129
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,910
um
let them down in any way um so

130
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920

 

131
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,670

extremely stressful i'd say

but we did
 

137
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,150
but we did
i was confident that at the time that we

138
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
i was confident that at the time that we
 

139
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,990
i was confident that at the time that we
launched that

140
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
launched that
 

141
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,790
launched that
no one could think of anything

142
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
no one could think of anything
 

143
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,350
no one could think of anything
at all to do that would improve the

144
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
at all to do that would improve the
 

145
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,430
at all to do that would improve the
probability of success

146
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
probability of success
 

147
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,390
probability of success
um and we we racked our brains to think

148
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
um and we we racked our brains to think

of any possible way to improve the
 

151
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,110
of any possible way to improve the
probability of success we could not

152
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
probability of success we could not
 

153
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,589
probability of success we could not
think of anything more and and nor could

154
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599

as as we we got more comfortable and
 

197
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,350
as as we we got more comfortable and
improved out the systems because you

198
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
improved out the systems because you
 

199
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,350
improved out the systems because you
know we really

200
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
know we really
 

201
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,470

enjoyable with the subsequent uh
astronaut uh missions

212
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
astronaut uh missions
 

213
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,630
astronaut uh missions
and i thought the

214
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
and i thought the
 

215
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,550

was kind of able to enjoy the the actual
mission and not just be super stressed

234
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
mission and not just be super stressed
 

235
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,630
mission and not just be super stressed
all the time so for people that somehow

236
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
all the time so for people that somehow
 

237
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,589
all the time so for people that somehow
don't know it's the all civilian first

238
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
don't know it's the all civilian first
 

239
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,390
don't know it's the all civilian first
time

240
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
time
 

241
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,189
time
all civilian out to space out to orbit

242
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
all civilian out to space out to orbit
 

243
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,990
all civilian out to space out to orbit
yeah it was the high i think the highest

244
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
yeah it was the high i think the highest
 

245
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,950
yeah it was the high i think the highest
orbit that uh in like under 30 or 40

246
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
orbit that uh in like under 30 or 40
 

247
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,710
orbit that uh in like under 30 or 40
years or something the only one that was

248
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
years or something the only one that was
 

249
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,670
years or something the only one that was
higher

250
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
higher
 

251
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,629
higher
was the one shuttle sorry a hubble uh

252
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
was the one shuttle sorry a hubble uh
 

253
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,070
was the one shuttle sorry a hubble uh
servicing mission

254
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
servicing mission
 

255
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,510
servicing mission
um and then before that it would have

256
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
um and then before that it would have
 

257
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,590
um and then before that it would have
been um apollo in 72.

258
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
been um apollo in 72.
 

259
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,030
been um apollo in 72.
it's pretty wild

260
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
it's pretty wild
 

261
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,270
it's pretty wild
so it's cool it's good you know i think

262
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
so it's cool it's good you know i think
 

263
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,590
so it's cool it's good you know i think
uh as you know

264
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
uh as you know
 

265
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,670
uh as you know
as a species like we want to be

266
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
as a species like we want to be
 

267
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,350
as a species like we want to be
you know continuing to

268
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
you know continuing to
 

269
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,590
you know continuing to
do better and and reach higher ground

270
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
do better and and reach higher ground
 

271
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,909
do better and and reach higher ground
and and like i think it would be tragic

272
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
and and like i think it would be tragic
 

273
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,629
and and like i think it would be tragic
extremely tragic if um apollo was the

274
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
extremely tragic if um apollo was the
 

275
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,870
extremely tragic if um apollo was the
high water mark for humanity you know

276
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
high water mark for humanity you know
 

277
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,230
high water mark for humanity you know
and that then that's as far as we ever

278
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
and that then that's as far as we ever
 

279
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,990
and that then that's as far as we ever
got

280
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
got
 

281
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,990
got
and it's um

282
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
and it's um
 

283
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,430
and it's um
it's concerning that here we are um

284
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
it's concerning that here we are um
 

285
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,670
it's concerning that here we are um
49 years after the last mission to the

286
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
49 years after the last mission to the
 

287
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,749
49 years after the last mission to the
moon

288
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
moon
 

289
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,749
moon
it's almost half a century

290
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
it's almost half a century
 

291
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,990
it's almost half a century
uh and we've not been back

292
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
uh and we've not been back
 

293
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,510
uh and we've not been back
um and that's

294
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
um and that's
 

295
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,430
um and that's
that's worrying it's like is that

296
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
that's worrying it's like is that
 

297
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,710
that's worrying it's like is that
does that mean

298
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
does that mean
 

299
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,870
does that mean
we've peaked as a civilization or what

300
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
we've peaked as a civilization or what
 

301
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,550
we've peaked as a civilization or what
so

302
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
so
 

303
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,990
so
like i think we got to get back to the

304
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
like i think we got to get back to the
 

305
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,310
like i think we got to get back to the
moon and build a base there you know a

306
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
moon and build a base there you know a
 

307
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,830
moon and build a base there you know a
science base i think we could learn a

308
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
science base i think we could learn a
 

309
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,749
science base i think we could learn a
lot about the nature of the universe if

310
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
lot about the nature of the universe if
 

311
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,189
lot about the nature of the universe if
we have a proper science base on the

312
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
we have a proper science base on the
 

313
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,990
we have a proper science base on the
moon

314
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
moon
 

315
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,469
moon
um you know like we have a science based

316
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
um you know like we have a science based
 

317
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,629
um you know like we have a science based
in antarctica and you know many other

318
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
in antarctica and you know many other
 

319
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,870
in antarctica and you know many other
parts of the world and

320
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
parts of the world and
 

321
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,950
parts of the world and
um so that that that's like i think the

322
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
um so that that that's like i think the
 

323
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,430
um so that that that's like i think the
next big thing we've got to have like a

324
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
next big thing we've got to have like a
 

325
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,150
next big thing we've got to have like a
serious like moon base um and then get

326
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
serious like moon base um and then get
 

327
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,469
serious like moon base um and then get
people to mars and

328
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
people to mars and
 

329
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,550
people to mars and
you know get get out there and

330
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
you know get get out there and
 

331
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,390
you know get get out there and
be a space bearing civilization

332
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
be a space bearing civilization
 

333
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,390
be a space bearing civilization
i'll ask you about some of those details

334
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
i'll ask you about some of those details
 

335
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,950
i'll ask you about some of those details
but since you're so busy with the hard

336
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
but since you're so busy with the hard
 

337
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,469
but since you're so busy with the hard
engineering challenges

338
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
engineering challenges
 

339
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,309
engineering challenges
of everything that's involved

340
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
of everything that's involved
 

341
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,670
of everything that's involved
are you still able to marvel at the

342
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
are you still able to marvel at the
 

343
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,309
are you still able to marvel at the
magic of it all of space travel

344
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
magic of it all of space travel
 

345
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,749
magic of it all of space travel
of every time the rocket goes up

346
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
of every time the rocket goes up
 

347
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,909
of every time the rocket goes up
especially when it's a crude mission

348
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
especially when it's a crude mission
 

349
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,550
especially when it's a crude mission
or you're just so overwhelmed with the

350
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
or you're just so overwhelmed with the
 

351
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,830
or you're just so overwhelmed with the
all the challenges that you have to

352
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
all the challenges that you have to
 

353
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,350
all the challenges that you have to
solve

354
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
solve
 

355
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,070
solve
and actually sort of to add to that

356
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
and actually sort of to add to that
 

357
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,749
and actually sort of to add to that
the reason i want to ask this question

358
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
the reason i want to ask this question
 

359
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,870
the reason i want to ask this question
of may 30th it's it's been some time so

360
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
of may 30th it's it's been some time so
 

361
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,390
of may 30th it's it's been some time so
you can look back and think about the

362
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
you can look back and think about the
 

363
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,870
you can look back and think about the
impact already it's already at the time

364
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
impact already it's already at the time
 

365
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,430
impact already it's already at the time
it was an engineering problem maybe now

366
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
it was an engineering problem maybe now
 

367
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,350
it was an engineering problem maybe now
it's becoming a historic moment like

368
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
it's becoming a historic moment like
 

369
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,790
it's becoming a historic moment like
it's a moment that

370
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
it's a moment that
 

371
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,070
it's a moment that
how many moments would be remembered

372
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
how many moments would be remembered
 

373
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,510
how many moments would be remembered
about the 21st century to me

374
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
about the 21st century to me
 

375
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,350
about the 21st century to me
that or something like that maybe

376
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
that or something like that maybe
 

377
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,189
that or something like that maybe
inspiration for one of those would be

378
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
inspiration for one of those would be
 

379
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,189
inspiration for one of those would be
remembered as the early steps of a new

380
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
remembered as the early steps of a new
 

381
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,070
remembered as the early steps of a new
age of uh space exploration

382
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
age of uh space exploration
 

383
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,469
age of uh space exploration
yeah i mean during the launches itself

384
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
yeah i mean during the launches itself
 

385
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,550
yeah i mean during the launches itself
so i mean i think i think maybe some

386
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
so i mean i think i think maybe some
 

387
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,909
so i mean i think i think maybe some
people know but a lot of people don't

388
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
people know but a lot of people don't
 

389
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,029
people know but a lot of people don't
know it's like i'm actually the chief

390
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
know it's like i'm actually the chief
 

391
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,790
know it's like i'm actually the chief
engineer of spacex so

392
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
engineer of spacex so
 

393
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,749
engineer of spacex so
um

394
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
um
 

395
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,629
um
the

396
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
the
 

397
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,550
the
you know i've signed off on pretty much

398
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
you know i've signed off on pretty much
 

399
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,309
you know i've signed off on pretty much
all the design decisions

400
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
all the design decisions
 

401
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,990
all the design decisions
um and

402
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
um and
 

403
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,550
um and
you know so if there's something that

404
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
you know so if there's something that
 

405
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,950
you know so if there's something that
goes wrong with that

406
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
goes wrong with that
 

407
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,710
goes wrong with that
vehicle it's it's fundamentally my fault

408
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
vehicle it's it's fundamentally my fault
 

409
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,909
vehicle it's it's fundamentally my fault
you know so

410
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
you know so
 

411
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,670
you know so
um

412
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
um
 

413
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,710
um
so i'm really just thinking

414
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
so i'm really just thinking
 

415
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,629
so i'm really just thinking
about all the things that like so so

416
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
about all the things that like so so
 

417
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,990
about all the things that like so so
when i see the rocket i see all the

418
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
when i see the rocket i see all the
 

419
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,350
when i see the rocket i see all the
things that could go wrong and the

420
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
things that could go wrong and the
 

421
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,430
things that could go wrong and the
things that could be better and the same

422
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
things that could be better and the same
 

423
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,629
things that could be better and the same
with the dragon spacecraft it's like

424
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
with the dragon spacecraft it's like
 

425
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,390
with the dragon spacecraft it's like
other people say oh this is a

426
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
other people say oh this is a
 

427
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,150
other people say oh this is a
spacecraft or a rocket and this looks

428
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
spacecraft or a rocket and this looks
 

429
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,830
spacecraft or a rocket and this looks
really cool i'm like

430
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
really cool i'm like
 

431
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,909
really cool i'm like
i've like a readout of like this is the

432
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
i've like a readout of like this is the
 

433
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,350
i've like a readout of like this is the
these are these are the risks these are

434
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
these are these are the risks these are
 

435
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,150
these are these are the risks these are
the pro the problems that's what i see

436
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160

 

437
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,749

so it's

438
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
so it's
 

439
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,189
so it's
not what other people see when they see

440
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
not what other people see when they see
 

441
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,430
not what other people see when they see
the product you know so let me uh ask

442
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
the product you know so let me uh ask
 

443
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,189
the product you know so let me uh ask
you then to analyze starship in that

444
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
you then to analyze starship in that
 

445
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,749
you then to analyze starship in that
same way i know you have you'll talk

446
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
same way i know you have you'll talk
 

447
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,990
same way i know you have you'll talk
about in more detail about starship in

448
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
about in more detail about starship in
 

449
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,230
about in more detail about starship in
the near future perhaps yeah talk about

450
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
the near future perhaps yeah talk about
 

451
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,629
the near future perhaps yeah talk about
it now if you want um but just in that

452
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
it now if you want um but just in that
 

453
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,950
it now if you want um but just in that
same way like you said you see when you

454
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
same way like you said you see when you
 

455
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,550
same way like you said you see when you
see up

456
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
see up
 

457
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,070
see up
when you see a rocket you see a sort of

458
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
when you see a rocket you see a sort of
 

459
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,150
when you see a rocket you see a sort of
a list of risks in that same way you

460
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
a list of risks in that same way you
 

461
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,830
a list of risks in that same way you
said that starship is a really hard

462
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
said that starship is a really hard
 

463
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,189
said that starship is a really hard
problem

464
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
problem
 

465
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,309
problem
so there's many ways i can ask this but

466
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
so there's many ways i can ask this but
 

467
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,550
so there's many ways i can ask this but
if you magically could solve one problem

468
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
if you magically could solve one problem
 

469
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,550
if you magically could solve one problem
perfectly one engineering problem

470
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
perfectly one engineering problem
 

471
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,990
perfectly one engineering problem
perfectly which one would it be on sasha

472
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
perfectly which one would it be on sasha
 

473
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,469
perfectly which one would it be on sasha
on sorry on starship so is it maybe

474
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
on sorry on starship so is it maybe
 

475
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,710
on sorry on starship so is it maybe
related to the efficiency the

476
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
related to the efficiency the
 

477
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,469
related to the efficiency the
uh the engine the weight of the

478
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
uh the engine the weight of the
 

479
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,909
uh the engine the weight of the
different components the complexity of

480
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
different components the complexity of
 

481
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,150
different components the complexity of
various things maybe the controls of the

482
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
various things maybe the controls of the
 

483
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,869
various things maybe the controls of the
the crazy thing has to do to land no

484
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
the crazy thing has to do to land no
 

485
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,749
the crazy thing has to do to land no
it's actually the by far the the biggest

486
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
it's actually the by far the the biggest
 

487
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,389
it's actually the by far the the biggest
thing absorbing my time is uh

488
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
thing absorbing my time is uh
 

489
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,029
thing absorbing my time is uh
uh engine production

490
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
uh engine production
 

491
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,990
uh engine production
not not the design of the engine but

492
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
not not the design of the engine but
 

493
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,870
not not the design of the engine but
i've often said prototypes are

494
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
i've often said prototypes are
 

495
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,269
i've often said prototypes are
are easy production is hard

496
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279

 

497
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:45,990

so

498
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
so
 

499
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,550
so
we have the most advanced rocket engine

500
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
we have the most advanced rocket engine
 

501
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,070
we have the most advanced rocket engine
that's ever been designed um

502
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
that's ever been designed um
 

503
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,990
that's ever been designed um
the because i say currently the the best

504
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
the because i say currently the the best
 

505
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,630
the because i say currently the the best
rocket engine ever is probably the rd

506
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
rocket engine ever is probably the rd
 

507
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,150
rocket engine ever is probably the rd
180 or rd-170 the um

508
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
180 or rd-170 the um
 

509
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,470
180 or rd-170 the um
that that's the russian engine basically

510
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
that that's the russian engine basically
 

511
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,590
that that's the russian engine basically
um

512
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
um
 

513
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,710
um
and um

514
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
and um
 

515
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,389
and um
and still i think an engine should only

516
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
and still i think an engine should only
 

517
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,070
and still i think an engine should only
count if it's gotten something to orbit

518
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
count if it's gotten something to orbit
 

519
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,870
count if it's gotten something to orbit
um

520
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
um
 

521
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,030
um
so our engine has not gotten anything to

522
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
so our engine has not gotten anything to
 

523
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,150
so our engine has not gotten anything to
orbit yet

524
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
orbit yet
 

525
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,470
orbit yet
um but it is it's the first engine

526
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
um but it is it's the first engine
 

527
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,550
um but it is it's the first engine
that's actually

528
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
that's actually
 

529
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,269
that's actually
better than than the the

530
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
better than than the the
 

531
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,949
better than than the the
russian rd engines which are

532
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
russian rd engines which are
 

533
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,470
russian rd engines which are
amazing design

534
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
amazing design
 

535
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,990
amazing design
so you're talking about raptor engine

536
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
so you're talking about raptor engine
 

537
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,070
so you're talking about raptor engine
what makes it amazing what what are the

538
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
what makes it amazing what what are the
 

539
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,310
what makes it amazing what what are the
different aspects of it that

540
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
different aspects of it that
 

541
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,470
different aspects of it that
make it like what are you the most

542
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
make it like what are you the most
 

543
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,630
make it like what are you the most
excited about uh if the whole thing

544
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
excited about uh if the whole thing
 

545
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,590
excited about uh if the whole thing
works

546
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
works
 

547
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,430
works
in terms of efficiency all those kinds

548
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
in terms of efficiency all those kinds
 

549
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,949
in terms of efficiency all those kinds
of things

550
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
of things
 

551
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,230
of things
well it's

552
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
well it's
 

553
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,070
well it's
the raptor is a

554
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
the raptor is a
 

555
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,509
the raptor is a
a full flow

556
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
a full flow
 

557
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,590
a full flow
uh staged combustion

558
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
uh staged combustion
 

559
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,750
uh staged combustion
um

560
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
um
 

561
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,670
um
engine and it's

562
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
engine and it's
 

563
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,509
engine and it's
operating at a very high chamber

564
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
operating at a very high chamber
 

565
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,710
operating at a very high chamber
pressure

566
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
pressure
 

567
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,350
pressure
so one of the key figures america

568
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
so one of the key figures america
 

569
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,990
so one of the key figures america
perhaps the key figure of merit is

570
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
perhaps the key figure of merit is
 

571
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,790
perhaps the key figure of merit is
um

572
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
um
 

573
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,870
um
what is the chamber pressure at which

574
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
what is the chamber pressure at which
 

575
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,030
what is the chamber pressure at which
the rocket engine can operate that's the

576
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
the rocket engine can operate that's the
 

577
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,870
the rocket engine can operate that's the
combustion chamber pressure

578
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
combustion chamber pressure
 

579
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,790
combustion chamber pressure
so a raptor is

580
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
so a raptor is
 

581
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,590
so a raptor is
designed to operate at 300 bar possibly

582
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
designed to operate at 300 bar possibly
 

583
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,910
designed to operate at 300 bar possibly
maybe higher that's 300 atmospheres so

584
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
maybe higher that's 300 atmospheres so
 

585
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,350
maybe higher that's 300 atmospheres so
um

586
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
um
 

587
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,350
um
the record right now for operational

588
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
the record right now for operational
 

589
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,190
the record right now for operational
engine is the rd engine that i mentioned

590
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
engine is the rd engine that i mentioned
 

591
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,870
engine is the rd engine that i mentioned
the russian rd which is i believe around

592
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
the russian rd which is i believe around
 

593
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,630
the russian rd which is i believe around

bar

596
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
bar
 

597
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,949
bar
and the the the difficulty of the

598
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
and the the the difficulty of the
 

599
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,710
and the the the difficulty of the
chamber pressure is increases on a

600
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
chamber pressure is increases on a
 

601
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,790
chamber pressure is increases on a
non-linear basis so

602
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
non-linear basis so
 

603
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,310
non-linear basis so
10 more

604
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
10 more
 

605
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,750
10 more
pressure is

606
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
pressure is
 

607
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,110
pressure is
more like uh

608
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
more like uh
 

609
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,150
more like uh
50

610
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
50
 

611
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,750
50
more difficult

612
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
more difficult
 

613
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,790
more difficult
um

614
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
um
 

615
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,870
um
but that that chain of pressure is that

616
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
but that that chain of pressure is that
 

617
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,790
but that that chain of pressure is that
that is what allows you to get a very

618
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
that is what allows you to get a very
 

619
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,230
that is what allows you to get a very
high uh power density

620
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
high uh power density
 

621
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,190
high uh power density
for the engine um so

622
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
for the engine um so
 

623
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,910
for the engine um so
uh enabling um

624
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
uh enabling um
 

625
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,190
uh enabling um
a very high thrust to weight ratio

626
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
a very high thrust to weight ratio
 

627
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,069
a very high thrust to weight ratio
and

628
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
and
 

629
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,870
and
a very high specific impulse

630
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
a very high specific impulse
 

631
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,949
a very high specific impulse
so specific impulse is like a measure of

632
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
so specific impulse is like a measure of
 

633
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,509
so specific impulse is like a measure of
the efficiency of a rocket engine or um

634
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
the efficiency of a rocket engine or um
 

635
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,509
the efficiency of a rocket engine or um
it's really the the

636
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
it's really the the
 

637
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,670
it's really the the
the uh

638
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
the uh
 

639
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,750
the uh
exhaust the effective exhaust velocity

640
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
exhaust the effective exhaust velocity
 

641
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,470
exhaust the effective exhaust velocity
of of the gas coming out of the engine

642
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
of of the gas coming out of the engine
 

643
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,710
of of the gas coming out of the engine
um

644
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
um
 

645
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,269
um
so uh

646
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
so uh
 

647
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,269
so uh
with a very high chamber pressure you

648
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
with a very high chamber pressure you
 

649
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,509
with a very high chamber pressure you
can have um

650
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
can have um
 

651
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,310
can have um
a

652
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
a
 

653
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,630
a
a compact engine that nonetheless has a

654
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
a compact engine that nonetheless has a
 

655
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,630
a compact engine that nonetheless has a
high expansion ratio which is the ratio

656
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
high expansion ratio which is the ratio
 

657
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,590
high expansion ratio which is the ratio
between the uh

658
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
between the uh
 

659
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,030
between the uh
exit nozzle

660
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
exit nozzle
 

661
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,790
exit nozzle
uh and the uh

662
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
uh and the uh
 

663
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,949
uh and the uh
throat so you know engine's got like you

664
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
throat so you know engine's got like you
 

665
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,230
throat so you know engine's got like you
see a rocket just got like sort of like

666
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
see a rocket just got like sort of like
 

667
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,389
see a rocket just got like sort of like
about like a hourglass shape it's like a

668
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
about like a hourglass shape it's like a
 

669
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,150
about like a hourglass shape it's like a
chamber and then it next down and

670
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
chamber and then it next down and
 

671
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,389
chamber and then it next down and
there's a nozzle and the ratio of the

672
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
there's a nozzle and the ratio of the
 

673
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,670
there's a nozzle and the ratio of the
the exit diameter to the

674
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
the exit diameter to the
 

675
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,790
the exit diameter to the
throat

676
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
throat
 

677
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,949
throat
expansion ratio so why is it such a hard

678
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
expansion ratio so why is it such a hard
 

679
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,790
expansion ratio so why is it such a hard
engine to manufacture

680
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
engine to manufacture
 

681
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,030
engine to manufacture
at scale

682
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
at scale
 

683
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,870
at scale
uh it's very complex

684
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
uh it's very complex
 

685
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,870
uh it's very complex
so a lot of what does complexity mean

686
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
so a lot of what does complexity mean
 

687
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,550
so a lot of what does complexity mean
here's a lot of components involved

688
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
here's a lot of components involved
 

689
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,629
here's a lot of components involved
there's a lot of a lot of components and

690
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
there's a lot of a lot of components and
 

691
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,990
there's a lot of a lot of components and
a lot of

692
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
a lot of
 

693
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,230
a lot of
uh unique materials

694
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
uh unique materials
 

695
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,350
uh unique materials
that so we had to invent a

696
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
that so we had to invent a
 

697
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,069
that so we had to invent a
several alloys that don't exist in order

698
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
several alloys that don't exist in order
 

699
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,629
several alloys that don't exist in order
to make this engine work

700
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
to make this engine work
 

701
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,430
to make this engine work
um

702
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
um
 

703
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,310
um
materials problem too

704
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
materials problem too
 

705
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,310
materials problem too
it's a materials problem and um it is in

706
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
it's a materials problem and um it is in
 

707
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,310
it's a materials problem and um it is in
a staged combustion a full flow stage

708
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
a staged combustion a full flow stage
 

709
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,310
a staged combustion a full flow stage
combustion there there are many uh

710
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
combustion there there are many uh
 

711
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,030
combustion there there are many uh
feedback loops in the system so

712
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
feedback loops in the system so
 

713
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,710
feedback loops in the system so
you uh

714
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
you uh
 

715
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,470
you uh
basically you've got

716
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
basically you've got
 

717
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,350
basically you've got
uh

718
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
uh
 

719
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,670
uh
propellant and and and uh hot gas

720
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
propellant and and and uh hot gas
 

721
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,190

um

724
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
um
 

725
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,470
um
simultaneously to so many different

726
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
simultaneously to so many different
 

727
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,030
simultaneously to so many different
places on the engine

728
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
places on the engine
 

729
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,110
places on the engine
and

730
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
and
 

731
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,949
and
they all have a recursive effect on each

732
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
they all have a recursive effect on each
 

733
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,790
they all have a recursive effect on each
other so you change one thing here it

734
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
other so you change one thing here it
 

735
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,230
other so you change one thing here it
has a recursive effect here it changes

736
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
has a recursive effect here it changes
 

737
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,949
has a recursive effect here it changes
something over there and and it's

738
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
something over there and and it's
 

739
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,310
something over there and and it's
it's it's quite

740
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
it's it's quite
 

741
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,629
it's it's quite
hard to control um

742
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
hard to control um
 

743
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,910
hard to control um
like there's a reason no one's made this

744
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
like there's a reason no one's made this
 

745
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,150
like there's a reason no one's made this
before um

746
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
before um
 

747
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,190
before um
but

748
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
but
 

749
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,629
but
um

750
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
um
 

751
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,590
um
and the reason we're doing um a

752
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
and the reason we're doing um a
 

753
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,509
and the reason we're doing um a
stage combustion uh

754
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
stage combustion uh
 

755
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,629
stage combustion uh
full flow

756
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
full flow
 

757
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,350
full flow
is because it it has the highest uh the

758
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
is because it it has the highest uh the
 

759
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,629
is because it it has the highest uh the
highest uh

760
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
highest uh
 

761
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,590
highest uh
theoretical possible uh efficiency

762
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
theoretical possible uh efficiency
 

763
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,629
theoretical possible uh efficiency
um

764
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
um
 

765
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,829
um
so

766
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
so
 

767
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,110
so
in in in order to make a fully reusable

768
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
in in in order to make a fully reusable
 

769
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,150
in in in order to make a fully reusable
rocket

770
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
rocket
 

771
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,190
rocket
um

772
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
um
 

773
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,829
um
which that's the really the holy grail

774
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
which that's the really the holy grail
 

775
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,269
which that's the really the holy grail
of orbital rocketry um

776
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
of orbital rocketry um
 

777
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,710
of orbital rocketry um
you have to have

778
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
you have to have
 

779
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,310
you have to have
everything's got to be the best uh it's

780
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
everything's got to be the best uh it's
 

781
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,310
everything's got to be the best uh it's
got to be the best engine the best

um
 

789
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,230
um
you know very clever control mechanisms

790
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
you know very clever control mechanisms
 

791
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,269
you know very clever control mechanisms
um you've got to shed mass in in any

792
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
um you've got to shed mass in in any
 

793
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,230
um you've got to shed mass in in any
possible way that you can um for example

794
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
possible way that you can um for example
 

795
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,750
possible way that you can um for example
instead of putting landing legs on the

796
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
instead of putting landing legs on the
 

797
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,269
instead of putting landing legs on the
booster and chip we are going to catch

798
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
booster and chip we are going to catch
 

799
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,430
booster and chip we are going to catch
them with a tower to save the weight of

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
them with a tower to save the weight of
 

801
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,710
them with a tower to save the weight of
the landing lens

802
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
the landing lens
 

803
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,949
the landing lens
legs so that's like

804
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
legs so that's like
 

805
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,150
legs so that's like
i mean

806
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
i mean
 

807
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,150
i mean
we're talking about catching

808
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
we're talking about catching
 

809
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,790
we're talking about catching
the largest flying object ever made

810
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
the largest flying object ever made
 

811
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,110
the largest flying object ever made
uh with

812
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
uh with
 

813
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,509
uh with
on a giant tower with with chopstick

814
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
on a giant tower with with chopstick
 

815

on a giant tower with with chopstick
arms

816
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
arms
 

817
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,710
arms
it's like karate kid with the fly but

818
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
it's like karate kid with the fly but
 

819
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,910
it's like karate kid with the fly but
much bigger

820
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920

 

821
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,069

i mean pulling this probably

822
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
i mean pulling this probably
 

823
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,110
i mean pulling this probably
won't work the first time

824
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
won't work the first time
 

825
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,949
won't work the first time
uh and anyway so this is bananas this is

826
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
uh and anyway so this is bananas this is
 

827
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,870
uh and anyway so this is bananas this is
banana stuff so you mentioned that you

828
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
banana stuff so you mentioned that you
 

829
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,310
banana stuff so you mentioned that you
doubt well not you doubt but there

830
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
doubt well not you doubt but there
 

831
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,310
doubt well not you doubt but there
there's days or moments when you doubt

832
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
there's days or moments when you doubt
 

833
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,230
there's days or moments when you doubt
that this is even possible

834
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
that this is even possible
 

835
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,710
that this is even possible
it's so difficult the possible part is

836
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
it's so difficult the possible part is
 

837
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,949
it's so difficult the possible part is
well at this point

838
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
well at this point
 

839
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,949
well at this point
we'll i think we will get starship to

840
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
we'll i think we will get starship to
 

841
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,910
we'll i think we will get starship to
work

842
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
work
 

843
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,389
work
um

844
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399

 

845
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,030

um there's a question of timing how long

846
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
um there's a question of timing how long
 

847
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,269
um there's a question of timing how long
will it take us to do this

848
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
will it take us to do this
 

849
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,629
will it take us to do this
how long will it take us to actually

850
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
how long will it take us to actually
 

851
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,310
how long will it take us to actually
achieve a full and rapid reusability

852
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
achieve a full and rapid reusability
 

853
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,150
achieve a full and rapid reusability
because it will take probably many

854
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
because it will take probably many
 

855
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,310
because it will take probably many
launches before we are able to have full

856
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
launches before we are able to have full
 

857
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,430
launches before we are able to have full
and rapid reusability

858
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
and rapid reusability
 

859
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,150
and rapid reusability
but i can't say that that the physics

860
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
but i can't say that that the physics
 

861
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,430
but i can't say that that the physics
pencils out like the like we're not uh

862
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
pencils out like the like we're not uh
 

863
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,110
pencils out like the like we're not uh
like at this point i'd say we're

864
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
like at this point i'd say we're
 

865
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,870
like at this point i'd say we're
confident that that

866
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
confident that that
 

867
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,990
confident that that
like let's say

868
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
like let's say
 

869
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,470
like let's say
i'm very confident success is in the set

870
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
i'm very confident success is in the set
 

871
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,389
i'm very confident success is in the set
of all possible outcomes

872
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399

 

873
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,230

for a while there i was not convinced

874
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
for a while there i was not convinced
 

875
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,990
for a while there i was not convinced
that success was in the set of possible

876
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
that success was in the set of possible
 

877
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,670
that success was in the set of possible
outcomes

878
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
outcomes
 

879
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,670
outcomes
which is very important actually

880
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:23,680
which is very important actually
 

881
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,230
which is very important actually
but so um

882
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240

 

883
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,829

saying there's a chance i'm saying

884
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
saying there's a chance i'm saying
 

885
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,790
saying there's a chance i'm saying
there's a chance exactly um

886
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
there's a chance exactly um
 

887
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,790
there's a chance exactly um
uh just not sure how

888
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
uh just not sure how
 

889
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,990
uh just not sure how
how how

890
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
how how
 

891
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,990
how how
long it will take uh

892
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
long it will take uh
 

893
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,590
long it will take uh
we're very very talented team they're

894
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
we're very very talented team they're
 

895
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,990
we're very very talented team they're
working night and day to make it happen

896
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
working night and day to make it happen
 

897
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,350
working night and day to make it happen
um

898
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
um
 

899
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,269
um
and uh

900
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
and uh
 

901
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,629
and uh
and like like i said the the the

902
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
and like like i said the the the
 

903
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,389
and like like i said the the the
critical thing to achieve for the

904
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
critical thing to achieve for the
 

905
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,670
critical thing to achieve for the
revolution in space flight and for

906
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
revolution in space flight and for
 

907
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,269
revolution in space flight and for
humanity to be a space frank

908
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
humanity to be a space frank
 

909
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,030
humanity to be a space frank
civilization is to have a fully and

910
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
civilization is to have a fully and
 

911
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,310
civilization is to have a fully and
rapidly reusable rocket oval rocket

912
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
rapidly reusable rocket oval rocket
 

913
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,629
rapidly reusable rocket oval rocket
there's not even been any orbital rocket

914
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
there's not even been any orbital rocket
 

915
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,230
there's not even been any orbital rocket
that's been fully reusable ever and this

916
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
that's been fully reusable ever and this
 

917
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,069
that's been fully reusable ever and this
has always been the

918
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
has always been the
 

919
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,990
has always been the
the the holy grail of rocketry

920
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
the the holy grail of rocketry
 

921
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,949
the the holy grail of rocketry
and

922
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
and
 

923
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,590
and
many smart people very smart people

924
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
many smart people very smart people
 

925
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,590
many smart people very smart people
have tried to do this before and have

926
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
have tried to do this before and have
 

927
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,749
have tried to do this before and have
not succeeded so

928
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
not succeeded so
 

929
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,870
not succeeded so
um because it's such a hard problem

930
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
um because it's such a hard problem
 

931
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,030
um because it's such a hard problem
what's your source of belief

932
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
what's your source of belief
 

933
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,030
what's your source of belief
in situations like this

934
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
in situations like this
 

935
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,710
in situations like this
when the engineering problem is so

936
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
when the engineering problem is so
 

937
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,509
when the engineering problem is so
difficult there's a lot of experts

938
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
difficult there's a lot of experts
 

939
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,990
difficult there's a lot of experts
many of whom you admire who have failed

940
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
many of whom you admire who have failed
 

941
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,990
many of whom you admire who have failed
in the past yes

942
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
in the past yes
 

943
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,430
in the past yes
and

944
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
and
 

945
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,710
and
um

946
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
um
 

947
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,870
um
a lot of people

948
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
a lot of people
 

949
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,069
a lot of people
you know

950
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
you know
 

951
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,990
you know
a lot of experts maybe journalists all

952
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
a lot of experts maybe journalists all
 

953
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,350
a lot of experts maybe journalists all
the kind of you know the public in

954
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
the kind of you know the public in
 

955
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,430
the kind of you know the public in
general have a lot of doubt about

956
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
general have a lot of doubt about
 

957
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,509
general have a lot of doubt about
whether it's possible

958
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
whether it's possible
 

959
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,990
whether it's possible
and you yourself know that even if it's

960
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
and you yourself know that even if it's
 

961
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,550
and you yourself know that even if it's
a non-null set not empty set

962
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
a non-null set not empty set
 

963
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,030
a non-null set not empty set
of success it's still unlikely or very

964
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
of success it's still unlikely or very
 

965
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,590
of success it's still unlikely or very
difficult like where do you go to both

966
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
difficult like where do you go to both
 

967
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,030
difficult like where do you go to both
personally

968
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
personally
 

969
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,430
personally
um intellectually as an engineer as a

970
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
um intellectually as an engineer as a
 

971
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,790
um intellectually as an engineer as a
team

972
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
team
 

973
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,949
team
like for source of strength needed to

974
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
like for source of strength needed to
 

975
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,430
like for source of strength needed to
sort of persevere through this

976
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
sort of persevere through this
 

977
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,189
sort of persevere through this
and to keep going with the project take

978
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
and to keep going with the project take
 

979
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:18,150
and to keep going with the project take
it to completion

980
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160

 

981
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,470

a source of strength hmm i i just really

982
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
a source of strength hmm i i just really
 

983
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,230
a source of strength hmm i i just really
not how i think about things

984
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
not how i think about things
 

985
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,429
not how i think about things
um

986
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
um
 

987
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,110
um
i mean for me it's simply this this is

988
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
i mean for me it's simply this this is
 

989
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,870
i mean for me it's simply this this is
something that is important to get done

990
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
something that is important to get done
 

991
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,990
something that is important to get done
um

992
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
um
 

993
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,029
um
and we we should just keep doing it um

994
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
and we we should just keep doing it um
 

995
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,470
and we we should just keep doing it um
or die trying

996
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
or die trying
 

997
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,430
or die trying
and i

998
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
and i
 

999
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,789
and i
i don't need

1000
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:34,799
i don't need
 

1001
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,190
i don't need
a source of strength so quitting is not

1002
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
a source of strength so quitting is not
 

1003
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,870
a source of strength so quitting is not
even like um

1004
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
even like um
 

1005
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,830
even like um
that's not it's not my nature okay and i

1006
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
that's not it's not my nature okay and i
 

1007
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,110
that's not it's not my nature okay and i
i don't

1008
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
i don't
 

1009
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,150
i don't
care about optimism or pessimism

1010
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
care about optimism or pessimism
 

1011
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,990
care about optimism or pessimism
[\h__\h] that we're gonna get it done gonna

1012
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
[\h__\h] that we're gonna get it done gonna
 

1013
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,669
[\h__\h] that we're gonna get it done gonna
get it done

1014
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679

 

1015
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,549

can you uh then zoom back in to specific

1016
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
can you uh then zoom back in to specific
 

1017
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,390
can you uh then zoom back in to specific
problems with starship or any

1018
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
problems with starship or any
 

1019
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,230
problems with starship or any
engineering problems you work on

1020
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
engineering problems you work on
 

1021
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,310
engineering problems you work on
can you try to introspect your

1022
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
can you try to introspect your
 

1023
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,150
can you try to introspect your
particular biological neural network

1024
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
particular biological neural network
 

1025
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,230
particular biological neural network
your thinking process and describe how

1026
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
your thinking process and describe how
 

1027
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,270
your thinking process and describe how
you think

1028
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
you think
 

1029
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,470
you think
through problems the different

1030
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
through problems the different
 

1031
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,230
through problems the different
engineering and design problems is there

1032
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
engineering and design problems is there
 

1033
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,470
engineering and design problems is there
like a systematic process you've spoken

1034
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
like a systematic process you've spoken
 

1035
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,070
like a systematic process you've spoken
about first principles thinking but is

1036
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
about first principles thinking but is
 

1037
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,110
about first principles thinking but is
there kind of a process to it well um

1038
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120

 

1039
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,630

you know like saying like like physics

1040
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
you know like saying like like physics
 

1041
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,830
you know like saying like like physics
is law and everything else is a

1042
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
is law and everything else is a
 

1043
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,270
is law and everything else is a
recommendation

1044
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
recommendation
 

1045
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,630
recommendation
um like i've met a lot of people who can

1046
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
um like i've met a lot of people who can
 

1047
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,549
um like i've met a lot of people who can
break the law but i haven't met anyone

1048
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
break the law but i haven't met anyone
 

1049
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,830
break the law but i haven't met anyone
who could break physics

1050
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840
who could break physics
 

1051
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,590
who could break physics
so uh so first for you know any kind of

1052
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
so uh so first for you know any kind of
 

1053
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,669
so uh so first for you know any kind of
technology problem you have to sort of

1054
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
technology problem you have to sort of
 

1055
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,590
technology problem you have to sort of
just make sure you're not

1056
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
just make sure you're not
 

1057
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,029
just make sure you're not
violating

1058
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
violating
 

1059
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,830
violating
physics um

1060
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840

 

1061
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,590

and you know uh

1062
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
and you know uh
 

1063
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,029
and you know uh
first principles analysis i think is

1064
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
first principles analysis i think is
 

1065
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,029
first principles analysis i think is
something that can be applied to

1066
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
something that can be applied to
 

1067
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,430
something that can be applied to
really any walk of life uh any anything

1068
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
really any walk of life uh any anything
 

1069
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,950
really any walk of life uh any anything
really it's just it's it's really just

1070
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
really it's just it's it's really just
 

1071
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,630
really it's just it's it's really just
saying um

1072
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
saying um
 

1073
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,549
saying um
you know let's let's well something down

1074
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
you know let's let's well something down
 

1075
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,630
you know let's let's well something down
to the most fundamental

1076
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
to the most fundamental
 

1077
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,590
to the most fundamental
uh

1078
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
uh
 

1079
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,590
uh
principles the things that we are most

1080
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
principles the things that we are most
 

1081
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,430
principles the things that we are most
confident are true at a foundational

1082
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
confident are true at a foundational
 

1083
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,310
confident are true at a foundational
level

1084
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
level
 

1085
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,830
level
and that sets you at your sets your

1086
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
and that sets you at your sets your
 

1087
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,909
and that sets you at your sets your
axiomatic base and then you reason up

1088
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
axiomatic base and then you reason up
 

1089
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,390
axiomatic base and then you reason up
from there and then you cross-check your

1090
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
from there and then you cross-check your
 

1091
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,710
from there and then you cross-check your
conclusion against the the axiomatic

1092
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
conclusion against the the axiomatic
 

1093
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,390
conclusion against the the axiomatic
truths

1094
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,400
truths
 

1095
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,590
truths
um

1096
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
um
 

1097
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,510
um
so

1098
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
so
 

1099
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,669
so
um you know some basics in physics would

1100
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
um you know some basics in physics would
 

1101
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,029
um you know some basics in physics would
be like are you violating conservation

1102
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
be like are you violating conservation
 

1103
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,710
be like are you violating conservation
of energy or momentum or something like

1104
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
of energy or momentum or something like
 

1105
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,789
of energy or momentum or something like
that you know then

1106
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
that you know then
 

1107
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,470
that you know then
it's not gonna work

1108
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
it's not gonna work
 

1109
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,669
it's not gonna work
um

1110
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
um
 

1111
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,510
um
so

1112
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
so
 

1113
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,029
so
uh that's

1114
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
uh that's
 

1115
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,870
uh that's
you know so that's just to establish is

1116
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
you know so that's just to establish is
 

1117
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,870
you know so that's just to establish is
it is it possible

1118
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
it is it possible
 

1119
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,789
it is it possible
and then another good physics tool is

1120
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
and then another good physics tool is
 

1121
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,549
and then another good physics tool is
thinking about things in the limit if

1122
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
thinking about things in the limit if
 

1123
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,390
thinking about things in the limit if
you if you take a particular thing and

1124
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
you if you take a particular thing and
 

1125
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,430
you if you take a particular thing and
you

1126
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
you
 

1127
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,230
you
uh

1128
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
uh
 

1129
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,830
uh
scale it to a very large number or to a

1130
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
scale it to a very large number or to a
 

1131
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,070
scale it to a very large number or to a
very small number how does how do things

1132
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
very small number how does how do things
 

1133
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,190
very small number how does how do things
change

1134
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
change
 

1135
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,590
change
um well it's like tempo like in number

1136
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
um well it's like tempo like in number
 

1137
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,190
um well it's like tempo like in number
of things you manufacture something like

1138
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
of things you manufacture something like
 

1139
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,510
of things you manufacture something like
that and then in time

1140
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
that and then in time
 

1141
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,430
that and then in time
yeah like let's say say the example of

1142
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
yeah like let's say say the example of
 

1143
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,950
yeah like let's say say the example of
like um

1144
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
like um
 

1145
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,710
like um
like manufacturing which i think is just

1146
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
like manufacturing which i think is just
 

1147
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,310
like manufacturing which i think is just
a very underrated

1148
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
a very underrated
 

1149
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,310
a very underrated
problem um

1150
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
problem um
 

1151
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,070
problem um
and and

1152
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
and and
 

1153
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,630
and and
uh likes it it's it's much harder to

1154
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
uh likes it it's it's much harder to
 

1155
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,669
uh likes it it's it's much harder to
take

1156
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
take
 

1157
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,669
take
an advanced technology product and bring

1158
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
an advanced technology product and bring
 

1159
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,190
an advanced technology product and bring
it into volume manufacturing than it is

1160
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,200
it into volume manufacturing than it is
 

1161
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,270
it into volume manufacturing than it is
to design it in the first place my

1162
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
to design it in the first place my
 

1163
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,669
to design it in the first place my
orders magnitude so

1164
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
orders magnitude so
 

1165
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,470
orders magnitude so
um

1166
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:16,480
um
 

1167
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,750
um
so let's say you're trying to figure out

1168
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
so let's say you're trying to figure out
 

1169
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,350
so let's say you're trying to figure out
is

1170
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
is
 

1171
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,789
is
like why is this

1172
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
like why is this
 

1173
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,830
like why is this
this uh

1174
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
this uh
 

1175
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,110
this uh
part or product

1176
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
part or product
 

1177
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,590
part or product
expensive is it um

1178
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
expensive is it um
 

1179
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,950
expensive is it um
because of something fundamentally

1180
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
because of something fundamentally
 

1181
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,470
because of something fundamentally
foolish that we're doing or is it

1182
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
foolish that we're doing or is it
 

1183
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,430
foolish that we're doing or is it
because our volume is too low and so

1184
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
because our volume is too low and so
 

1185
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,390
because our volume is too low and so
then you say okay well what if our

1186
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
then you say okay well what if our
 

1187
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,310
then you say okay well what if our
volume was a million units a year is it

1188
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
volume was a million units a year is it
 

1189
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,070
volume was a million units a year is it
still expensive that's what i'm

1190
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
still expensive that's what i'm
 

1191
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,190
still expensive that's what i'm
radically thinking about things to the

1192
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
radically thinking about things to the
 

1193
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,950
radically thinking about things to the
limit if it's still expensive at a

1194
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
limit if it's still expensive at a
 

1195
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,710
limit if it's still expensive at a
million units a year then volume is not

1196
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
million units a year then volume is not
 

1197
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,310
million units a year then volume is not
the reason why your thing is expensive

1198
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
the reason why your thing is expensive
 

1199
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,270
the reason why your thing is expensive
there's something fundamental about

1200
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
there's something fundamental about
 

1201
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,549
there's something fundamental about
design

1202
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
design
 

1203
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,310
design
and then you then can focus on the

1204
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
and then you then can focus on the
 

1205
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,750
and then you then can focus on the
reducing complexity or something like

1206
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
reducing complexity or something like
 

1207
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,909
reducing complexity or something like
that and change the design to change

1208
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
that and change the design to change
 

1209
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,029
that and change the design to change
changes apart to be something that is uh

1210
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
changes apart to be something that is uh
 

1211
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,149
changes apart to be something that is uh
uh

1212
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,159
uh
 

1213
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,230
uh
not fundamentally expensive

1214
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
not fundamentally expensive
 

1215
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,390
not fundamentally expensive
but like that's a common thing in

1216
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
but like that's a common thing in
 

1217
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,630
but like that's a common thing in
rocketry because the the unit volume is

1218
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
rocketry because the the unit volume is
 

1219
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,110
rocketry because the the unit volume is
relatively low and so a common excuse

1220
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
relatively low and so a common excuse
 

1221
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,950
relatively low and so a common excuse
would be well it's expensive because our

1222
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
would be well it's expensive because our
 

1223
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,190
would be well it's expensive because our
unit volume is low um and if we were in

1224
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
unit volume is low um and if we were in
 

1225
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,549
unit volume is low um and if we were in
like automotive or something like that

1226
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
like automotive or something like that
 

1227
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,310
like automotive or something like that
or consumer electronics then our costs

1228
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
or consumer electronics then our costs
 

1229
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,830
or consumer electronics then our costs
would be lower and like i'm like okay so

1230
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
would be lower and like i'm like okay so
 

1231
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,669
would be lower and like i'm like okay so
let's say we skip now you're making a

1232
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
let's say we skip now you're making a
 

1233
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,950
let's say we skip now you're making a
million units a year is it still

1234
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
million units a year is it still
 

1235
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,510
million units a year is it still
expensive if the answer is yes

1236
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
expensive if the answer is yes
 

1237
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,390
expensive if the answer is yes
then

1238
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
then
 

1239
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,669
then
uh

1240
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
uh
 

1241
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,909
uh
economies of scale are not the issue

1242
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
economies of scale are not the issue
 

1243
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,110
economies of scale are not the issue
do you throw

1244
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
do you throw
 

1245
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,549
do you throw
into manufacturing do you throw like

1246
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
into manufacturing do you throw like
 

1247
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,110
into manufacturing do you throw like
supply chain you talk about resources

1248
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
supply chain you talk about resources
 

1249
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,470
supply chain you talk about resources
and materials and stuff like that do you

1250
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
and materials and stuff like that do you
 

1251
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,909
and materials and stuff like that do you
throw that into the calculation of

1252
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
throw that into the calculation of
 

1253
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,590
throw that into the calculation of
trying to reason from first principles

1254
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
trying to reason from first principles
 

1255
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,870
trying to reason from first principles
like how we're going to make the supply

1256
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
like how we're going to make the supply
 

1257
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,470
like how we're going to make the supply
chain work here

1258
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
chain work here
 

1259
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,789
chain work here
yeah yeah and then the cost of materials

1260
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
yeah yeah and then the cost of materials
 

1261
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,789
yeah yeah and then the cost of materials
things like that or is that too much

1262
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
things like that or is that too much
 

1263
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,430
things like that or is that too much
exactly so um like another like a good

1264
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
exactly so um like another like a good
 

1265
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,110
exactly so um like another like a good
example of thinking about things uh in

1266
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
example of thinking about things uh in
 

1267
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,270
example of thinking about things uh in
the limit is

1268
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
the limit is
 

1269
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,870
the limit is
um if you take any uh

1270
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
um if you take any uh
 

1271
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,950
um if you take any uh
you know any any

1272
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
you know any any
 

1273
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,149
you know any any
product any machine or whatever um

1274
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
product any machine or whatever um
 

1275
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,909
product any machine or whatever um
like take a rocket or whatever

1276
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
like take a rocket or whatever
 

1277
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,830
like take a rocket or whatever
and

1278
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
and
 

1279
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,230
and
say uh if you've got if you look at the

1280
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
say uh if you've got if you look at the
 

1281
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,029
say uh if you've got if you look at the
room

1282
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
room
 

1283
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,710
room
raw materials in the rocket

1284
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
raw materials in the rocket
 

1285
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,750
raw materials in the rocket
um so you're gonna have like uh

1286
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
um so you're gonna have like uh
 

1287
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,029
um so you're gonna have like uh
aluminum steel titanium inconel

1288
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
aluminum steel titanium inconel
 

1289
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,470
aluminum steel titanium inconel
especially specialty alloys um

1290
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
especially specialty alloys um
 

1291
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,590
especially specialty alloys um
copper and and you say what are the

1292
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
copper and and you say what are the
 

1293
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,549
copper and and you say what are the
how

1294
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
how
 

1295
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,830
how
what what's the weight of the

1296
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
what what's the weight of the
 

1297
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,830
what what's the weight of the
constituent elements of each of these

1298
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:19,840
constituent elements of each of these
 

1299
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,350
constituent elements of each of these
elements and what is their raw material

1300
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
elements and what is their raw material
 

1301
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,470
elements and what is their raw material
value

1302
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480
value
 

1303
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,390
value
and that sets the

1304
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
and that sets the
 

1305
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,909
and that sets the
asymptotic limit for how

1306
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
asymptotic limit for how
 

1307
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,350
asymptotic limit for how
low the cost of the vehicle can be

1308
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
low the cost of the vehicle can be
 

1309
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,669
low the cost of the vehicle can be
unless you change the materials

1310
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:31,679
unless you change the materials
 

1311
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,630
unless you change the materials
so

1312
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
so
 

1313
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,390
so
and then when you do that i call it like

1314
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
and then when you do that i call it like
 

1315
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,990
and then when you do that i call it like
maybe the magic wand number or something

1316
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
maybe the magic wand number or something
 

1317
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,830
maybe the magic wand number or something
like that so that would be like if you

1318
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
like that so that would be like if you
 

1319
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,110
like that so that would be like if you
had the

1320
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
had the
 

1321
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,909
had the
you know a like just a pile of these raw

1322
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:41,919
you know a like just a pile of these raw
 

1323
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,190
you know a like just a pile of these raw
materials here and you could wave magic

1324
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
materials here and you could wave magic
 

1325
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,710
materials here and you could wave magic
wand and rearrange the atoms into the

1326
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
wand and rearrange the atoms into the
 

1327
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,990
wand and rearrange the atoms into the
final shape

1328
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,000
final shape
 

1329
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,950
final shape
um

1330
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
um
 

1331
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,230
um
that would be the

1332
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
that would be the
 

1333
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,310
that would be the
lowest possible cost that you could make

1334
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
lowest possible cost that you could make
 

1335
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,430
lowest possible cost that you could make
this thing for unless you change the

1336
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
this thing for unless you change the
 

1337
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,549
this thing for unless you change the
materials

1338
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
materials
 

1339
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,630
materials
so then and that is always a you're

1340
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
so then and that is always a you're
 

1341
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,710
so then and that is always a you're
almost always a very low number

1342
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
almost always a very low number
 

1343
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,590
almost always a very low number
um

1344
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
um
 

1345
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,230
um
so then the what's actually causing

1346
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
so then the what's actually causing
 

1347
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,909
so then the what's actually causing
these to be expensive is how you put the

1348
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
these to be expensive is how you put the
 

1349
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,830
these to be expensive is how you put the
atoms into the desired shape

1350
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840

 

1351
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,350

yeah actually if you don't mind me

1352
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
yeah actually if you don't mind me
 

1353
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,310
yeah actually if you don't mind me
taking a tiny tangent i had uh i often

1354
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
taking a tiny tangent i had uh i often
 

1355
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,470
taking a tiny tangent i had uh i often
talked to jim keller who was somebody

1356
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
talked to jim keller who was somebody
 

1357
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,669
talked to jim keller who was somebody
that worked with you oh yeah that's a

1358
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
that worked with you oh yeah that's a
 

1359
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,270
that worked with you oh yeah that's a
fantastic job jim was

1360
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
fantastic job jim was
 

1361
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,669
fantastic job jim was
yeah did great work at tesla

1362
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
yeah did great work at tesla
 

1363
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,470
yeah did great work at tesla
so

1364
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
so
 

1365
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,549
so
um i suppose he carries the flame of the

1366
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
um i suppose he carries the flame of the
 

1367
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,430
um i suppose he carries the flame of the
same kind of thinking that you're you're

1368
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
same kind of thinking that you're you're
 

1369
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,350
same kind of thinking that you're you're
talking about now

1370
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
talking about now
 

1371
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,070
talking about now
um and i guess i see that same thing at

1372
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
um and i guess i see that same thing at
 

1373
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,430
um and i guess i see that same thing at
tesla

1374
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,440
tesla
 

1375
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,830
tesla
and spacex folks who work there they

1376
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
and spacex folks who work there they
 

1377
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,750
and spacex folks who work there they
kind of learn this way of thinking and

1378
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
kind of learn this way of thinking and
 

1379
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,549
kind of learn this way of thinking and
it kind of becomes obvious almost

1380
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
it kind of becomes obvious almost
 

1381
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,950
it kind of becomes obvious almost
but anyway i had um argument not

1382
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
but anyway i had um argument not
 

1383
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,390
but anyway i had um argument not
argument

1384
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
argument
 

1385
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,630
argument
uh he educated me

1386
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
uh he educated me
 

1387
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,669
uh he educated me
about

1388
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
about
 

1389
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,510
about
how cheap it might be to manufacture

1390
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
how cheap it might be to manufacture
 

1391
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,070
how cheap it might be to manufacture
teslabot we just we had an argument what

1392
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
teslabot we just we had an argument what
 

1393
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,390
teslabot we just we had an argument what
is how can you reduce the cost of scale

1394
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
is how can you reduce the cost of scale
 

1395
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,029
is how can you reduce the cost of scale
of

1396
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
of
 

1397
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,350
of
producing a robot because i've gotten a

1398
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
producing a robot because i've gotten a
 

1399
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,830
producing a robot because i've gotten a
chance to interact quite a bit um

1400
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
chance to interact quite a bit um
 

1401
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,830
chance to interact quite a bit um
obviously in in the academic circles

1402
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
obviously in in the academic circles
 

1403
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,149
obviously in in the academic circles
with humanoid robots and then boston

1404
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159
with humanoid robots and then boston
 

1405
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,310
with humanoid robots and then boston
dynamics and stuff like that and they're

1406
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
dynamics and stuff like that and they're
 

1407
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,390
dynamics and stuff like that and they're
very expensive to to build

1408
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
very expensive to to build
 

1409
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,950
very expensive to to build
and then uh jim kind of schooled me on

1410
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
and then uh jim kind of schooled me on
 

1411
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,190
and then uh jim kind of schooled me on
saying like okay like this kind of first

1412
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
saying like okay like this kind of first
 

1413
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,710
saying like okay like this kind of first
principle is thinking of how can we get

1414
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
principle is thinking of how can we get
 

1415
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,029
principle is thinking of how can we get
the cost of manufacturing down

1416
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
the cost of manufacturing down
 

1417
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,990
the cost of manufacturing down
um i suppose you do that you have done

1418
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
um i suppose you do that you have done
 

1419
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,590
um i suppose you do that you have done
that kind of thinking for teslabot and

1420
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
that kind of thinking for teslabot and
 

1421
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,990
that kind of thinking for teslabot and
for all kinds of

1422
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
for all kinds of
 

1423
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,990
for all kinds of
all kinds of complex systems that are

1424
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
all kinds of complex systems that are
 

1425
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,750
all kinds of complex systems that are
traditionally seen as complex and you

1426
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
traditionally seen as complex and you
 

1427
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,269
traditionally seen as complex and you
say okay how can we simplify everything

1428
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
say okay how can we simplify everything
 

1429
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,110
say okay how can we simplify everything
down

1430
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120
down
 

1431
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,310
down
yeah

1432
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
yeah
 

1433
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,230
yeah
i mean i think if you are really good at

1434
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
i mean i think if you are really good at
 

1435
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,230
i mean i think if you are really good at
manufacturing

1436
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
manufacturing
 

1437
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,149
manufacturing
you can basically

1438
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
you can basically
 

1439
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,750
you can basically
make at high volume you can basically

1440
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
make at high volume you can basically
 

1441
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,390
make at high volume you can basically
make anything for a cost

1442
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
make anything for a cost
 

1443
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,110
make anything for a cost

anything right

1452
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
anything right
 

1453
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,870
anything right
but it's hard it's not like that's a

1454

so what will often happen in trying to

1472
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
so what will often happen in trying to
 

1473
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,269
so what will often happen in trying to
design a product is people will start

1474
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:09,279
design a product is people will start
 

1475
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,310
design a product is people will start
with the tools and and parts and methods

1476
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
with the tools and and parts and methods
 

1477
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,390
with the tools and and parts and methods
that they are familiar with

1478
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:14,400
that they are familiar with
 

1479
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,510
that they are familiar with
and then

1480
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
and then
 

1481
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,909
and then
and try to create a product using their

1482
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
and try to create a product using their
 

1483
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,029
and try to create a product using their
existing tools and methods

1484
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,039
existing tools and methods
 

1485
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,510
existing tools and methods
the other way to think about it is

1486
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
the other way to think about it is
 

1487
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,590
the other way to think about it is
actually imagine the try to imagine the

1488
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
actually imagine the try to imagine the
 

1489
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,870
actually imagine the try to imagine the
platonic ideal of the perfect product or

1490
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
platonic ideal of the perfect product or
 

1491
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,269
platonic ideal of the perfect product or
technology whatever it might be

1492
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
technology whatever it might be
 

1493
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,750
technology whatever it might be
and so what is this what is the perfect

1494
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
and so what is this what is the perfect
 

1495
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,510
and so what is this what is the perfect
arrangement of atoms

1496
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,520
arrangement of atoms
 

1497
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,029
arrangement of atoms
that would be the the best possible

1498
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
that would be the the best possible
 

1499
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,390
that would be the the best possible
product

1500
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
product
 

1501
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,909
product
and now let us try to figure out how to

1502
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
and now let us try to figure out how to
 

1503
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,750
and now let us try to figure out how to
get the atoms in that shape

1504
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760

 

1505
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,830

i mean it's it sounds um

1506
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840

 

1507
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,310

it's almost like a rick and morty absurd

1508
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
it's almost like a rick and morty absurd
 

1509
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,990
it's almost like a rick and morty absurd
until you start to really think about it

1510
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
until you start to really think about it
 

1511
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,789
until you start to really think about it
and

1512
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
and
 

1513
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,710
and
you really should

1514
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
you really should
 

1515
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,710
you really should
think about it in this way because

1516
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
think about it in this way because
 

1517
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,870
think about it in this way because
everything else is kind of uh

1518
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
everything else is kind of uh
 

1519
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,029
everything else is kind of uh
if you if you think uh

1520
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
if you if you think uh
 

1521
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,390
if you if you think uh
you you might fall victim to the

1522
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
you you might fall victim to the
 

1523
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,830
you you might fall victim to the
momentum of the way things are done in

1524
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
momentum of the way things are done in
 

1525
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,830
momentum of the way things are done in
the past unless you think in this way

1526
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
the past unless you think in this way
 

1527
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,590
the past unless you think in this way
well just as a function of inertia

1528
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600
well just as a function of inertia
 

1529
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,870
well just as a function of inertia
people will

1530
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
people will
 

1531
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,470
people will
want to use the same tools and methods

1532
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
want to use the same tools and methods
 

1533
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,990
want to use the same tools and methods
that they are familiar with

1534
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
that they are familiar with
 

1535
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,110
that they are familiar with
um

1536
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,120
um
 

1537
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,549
um
they just that's what they'll do by

1538
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
they just that's what they'll do by
 

1539
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,350
they just that's what they'll do by
default yeah and then that will lead to

1540
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
default yeah and then that will lead to
 

1541
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,110
default yeah and then that will lead to
an outcome of things that can be made

1542
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,120
an outcome of things that can be made
 

1543
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,950
an outcome of things that can be made
with those tools and methods but it is

1544
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960
with those tools and methods but it is
 

1545
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,950
with those tools and methods but it is
unlikely to be the

1546
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960
unlikely to be the
 

1547
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,110
unlikely to be the
platonic idea of the perfect product

1548
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,120
platonic idea of the perfect product
 

1549
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,909
platonic idea of the perfect product
um

1550
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
um
 

1551
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,870
um
so

1552
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
so
 

1553
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,950
so
then so that's why it's good to think of

1554
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
then so that's why it's good to think of
 

1555
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,149
then so that's why it's good to think of
things in both directions they're like

1556
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
things in both directions they're like
 

1557
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,350
things in both directions they're like
what can we build with the tools that we

1558
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
what can we build with the tools that we
 

1559
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,390
what can we build with the tools that we
have but then but but also what is the

1560
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
have but then but but also what is the
 

1561
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,149
have but then but but also what is the
what is the perfect the theoretical

1562
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
what is the perfect the theoretical
 

1563
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,310
what is the perfect the theoretical
perfect product look like and that that

1564
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,320
perfect product look like and that that
 

1565
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,750
perfect product look like and that that
theoretical perfect part is going to be

1566
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
theoretical perfect part is going to be
 

1567
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,750
theoretical perfect part is going to be
a moving target because as you learn

1568
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
a moving target because as you learn
 

1569
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,549
a moving target because as you learn
more

1570
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:42,559
more
 

1571
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,669
more
the definition of or or for that perfect

1572
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
the definition of or or for that perfect
 

1573
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,190
the definition of or or for that perfect
product will change because you don't

1574
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,200
product will change because you don't
 

1575
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,470
product will change because you don't
actually know what the perfect product

1576
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
actually know what the perfect product
 

1577
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,830
actually know what the perfect product
is but you can successfully approximate

1578
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:50,840
is but you can successfully approximate
 

1579
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,149
is but you can successfully approximate
a more perfect product

1580
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159
a more perfect product
 

1581
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,310
a more perfect product
so the thing about it like that and then

1582
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
so the thing about it like that and then
 

1583
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,710
so the thing about it like that and then
saying okay now what tools methods

1584
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
saying okay now what tools methods
 

1585
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,510
saying okay now what tools methods
materials whatever do we need to

1586
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
materials whatever do we need to
 

1587
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,830
materials whatever do we need to
create in order to get the atoms in that

1588
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840
create in order to get the atoms in that
 

1589
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,830
create in order to get the atoms in that
shape but for people

1590
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
shape but for people
 

1591
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,909
shape but for people
rarely think about it that way

1592
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
rarely think about it that way
 

1593
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,470
rarely think about it that way
but it's a powerful tool

1594
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
but it's a powerful tool
 

1595
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,870
but it's a powerful tool
i should mention that the brilliant

1596
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
i should mention that the brilliant
 

1597
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,029
i should mention that the brilliant

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,789
hanging out with us
in case you hear a voice of uh wisdom

1602
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
in case you hear a voice of uh wisdom

okay so let me ask you about mars you

1608
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
okay so let me ask you about mars you
 

1609
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,310
okay so let me ask you about mars you
mentioned it would be great for science

1610
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
mentioned it would be great for science
 

1611
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,750
mentioned it would be great for science
to put

1612
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:31,760
to put
 

1613
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,830
to put
um a base on the moon to do some

1614
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:33,840
um a base on the moon to do some
 

1615
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,870
um a base on the moon to do some
research

1616
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
research
 

1617
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,389
research
but

1618
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,399
but
 

1619
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,870
but
the truly big leap again in this

1620
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:38,880
the truly big leap again in this
 

1621
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,950
the truly big leap again in this
category of seemingly impossible is to

1622
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
category of seemingly impossible is to
 

1623
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,669
category of seemingly impossible is to
put a human being on mars

1624
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
put a human being on mars
 

1625
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,430
put a human being on mars
when do you think spacex will land a

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,230
when do you think spacex will land a

1629
00:27:50,240 --> 00:28:08,630

hmm

1630
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,640

 

1631
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,190

best case is about five years

1635
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,549

what are the determining factors would

1636
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
what are the determining factors would
 

1637
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,029
what are the determining factors would
you say from an engineering perspective

1638
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
you say from an engineering perspective
 

1639
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,830
you say from an engineering perspective
or is that that not the bottlenecks

1640
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
or is that that not the bottlenecks
 

1641
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,870
or is that that not the bottlenecks
uh you know it's fundamentally um

1642
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
uh you know it's fundamentally um
 

1643
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,230
uh you know it's fundamentally um
you know engineering the the vehicle um

1644
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240

 

1645
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,029

i mean starship is the most

1646
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:35,039
i mean starship is the most
 

1647
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,789
i mean starship is the most
complex and advanced rocket that's ever

i don't know order of magnitude or
something like that it's a lot

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,110
something like that it's a lot
it's really next level so

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
it's really next level so
 

1657
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,230
it's really next level so
um

1658
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
um
 

1659
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,630
um
and the fundamental optimization of

1660
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,640
and the fundamental optimization of
 

1661
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,710
and the fundamental optimization of
starship is minimizing cost per ton to

1662
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
starship is minimizing cost per ton to
 

1663
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,789
starship is minimizing cost per ton to
orbit and ultimately cost per ton to the

1664
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
orbit and ultimately cost per ton to the
 

1665
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,389
orbit and ultimately cost per ton to the
surface of mars

1666
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:54,399
surface of mars
 

1667
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,830
surface of mars
um this may seem like a mercantile

1668
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:55,840
um this may seem like a mercantile
 

1669
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,430
um this may seem like a mercantile
objective but it is actually the thing

1670
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,440
objective but it is actually the thing
 

1671
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,830
objective but it is actually the thing
that needs to be optimized

1672
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
that needs to be optimized
 

1673
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,990
that needs to be optimized
um like there is a certain

1674
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
um like there is a certain
 

1675
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,990
um like there is a certain
cost per tonne to the surface of mars

1676
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,000
cost per tonne to the surface of mars
 

1677
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,070
cost per tonne to the surface of mars
where we can afford to establish a

1678
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
where we can afford to establish a
 

1679
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,230
where we can afford to establish a
self-sustaining uh city

1680
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
self-sustaining uh city
 

1681
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,510
self-sustaining uh city
um and

1682
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
um and
 

1683
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,110
um and
and then above that we cannot afford to

1684
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
and then above that we cannot afford to
 

1685
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,470
and then above that we cannot afford to
do it um so right right now you couldn't

1686
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
do it um so right right now you couldn't
 

1687
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,070
do it um so right right now you couldn't
fly to mars for a trillion dollars

1688
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
fly to mars for a trillion dollars
 

1689
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,669
fly to mars for a trillion dollars
doesn't no amount of money could get

1690
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
doesn't no amount of money could get
 

1691
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,110
doesn't no amount of money could get
your ticket to mars

1692
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
your ticket to mars
 

1693
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,750
your ticket to mars
so we need to get that above

1694
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,760
so we need to get that above
 

1695
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,510
so we need to get that above
uh you know to get that like something

1696
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,520
uh you know to get that like something
 

1697
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,789
uh you know to get that like something
that is actually possible at all um

1698
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
that is actually possible at all um
 

1699
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,590
that is actually possible at all um
um

1700
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
um
 

1701
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,909
um
but but then but that's that's

1702
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:29,919
but but then but that's that's
 

1703
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,909
but but then but that's that's
we don't just want to have

1704
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
we don't just want to have
 

1705
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,750
we don't just want to have
you know with mars flags and footprints

1706
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
you know with mars flags and footprints
 

1707
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,190
you know with mars flags and footprints
and then not come back for a half

1708
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
and then not come back for a half
 

1709
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,350
and then not come back for a half
century like we did with the moon

1710
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
century like we did with the moon
 

1711
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,070
century like we did with the moon
uh

1712
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
uh
 

1713
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,350
uh
in order to pass

1714
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
in order to pass
 

1715
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,990
in order to pass
a very important great filter i think we

1716
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
a very important great filter i think we
 

1717
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,070
a very important great filter i think we
need to be a multi-planet species

1718
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,080
need to be a multi-planet species
 

1719
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,149
need to be a multi-planet species
um

1720
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
um
 

1721
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,630
um
this may sound somewhat esoteric to

1722
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
this may sound somewhat esoteric to
 

1723
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,149
this may sound somewhat esoteric to
to a lot of people but

1724
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,159
to a lot of people but
 

1725
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,430
to a lot of people but
uh

1726
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
uh
 

1727
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,149
uh
like eventually given enough time

1728
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
like eventually given enough time
 

1729
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,110
like eventually given enough time
uh

1730
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,120
uh
 

1731
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,470
uh
that's something

1732
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:58,480
that's something
 

1733
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,389
that's something
the earth is likely to experience

1734
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
the earth is likely to experience
 

1735
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,909
the earth is likely to experience
some calamity um that could be

1736
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
some calamity um that could be
 

1737
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:04,710
some calamity um that could be
uh

1738
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
uh
 

1739
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,630
uh
something that humans do to themselves

1740
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
something that humans do to themselves
 

1741
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,470
something that humans do to themselves
or an external event like happen to the

1742
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
or an external event like happen to the
 

1743
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,750
or an external event like happen to the
dinosaurs

1744
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:09,760
dinosaurs
 

1745
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,029
dinosaurs
um

1746
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:11,039
um
 

1747
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,990
um
and

1748
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
and
 

1749
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,110
and
um but a bit of you know eventually

1750
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120
um but a bit of you know eventually
 

1751
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,830
um but a bit of you know eventually
and if nothing if none of that happens

1752
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
and if nothing if none of that happens
 

1753
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,110
and if nothing if none of that happens
and somehow magically we keep going

1754
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
and somehow magically we keep going
 

1755
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,269
and somehow magically we keep going
then the sun will the sun is gradually

1756
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
then the sun will the sun is gradually
 

1757
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,470
then the sun will the sun is gradually
expanding

1758
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480
expanding
 

1759
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,430
expanding
um and will engulf the earth um and

1760
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,440
um and will engulf the earth um and
 

1761
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,230
um and will engulf the earth um and
probably earth gets too hot for

1762
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,240
probably earth gets too hot for
 

1763
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,149
probably earth gets too hot for
uh life in

1764
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:32,159
uh life in
 

1765
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,430
uh life in
uh

1766
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
uh
 

1767
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,269
uh
about 500 million years it's a long time

1768
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
about 500 million years it's a long time
 

1769
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,389
about 500 million years it's a long time
but that's only

1770
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
but that's only
 

1771
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,190
but that's only
10 longer than earth has been around

1772
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,200
10 longer than earth has been around
 

1773
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,070
10 longer than earth has been around
and so if you think about like the

1774
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
and so if you think about like the
 

1775
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,430
and so if you think about like the
because the current situation is really

1776
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
because the current situation is really
 

1777
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,190
because the current situation is really
remarkable um and kind of hard to

1778
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,200
remarkable um and kind of hard to
 

1779
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,430
remarkable um and kind of hard to
believe but

1780
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
believe but
 

1781
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,149
believe but
uh

1782
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
uh
 

1783
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,510
uh
it's been around four and a half billion

1784
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:49,520
it's been around four and a half billion
 

1785
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,510
it's been around four and a half billion
years and this is the first time if one

1786
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
years and this is the first time if one
 

1787
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,630
years and this is the first time if one
half billion years that has been

1788
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
half billion years that has been
 

1789
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,590
half billion years that has been
possible to extend life beyond earth

1790
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,600
possible to extend life beyond earth
 

1791
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,990
possible to extend life beyond earth
and that window opportunity may be open

1792
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
and that window opportunity may be open
 

1793
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,750
and that window opportunity may be open
for a long time and i hope it is but it

1794
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
for a long time and i hope it is but it
 

1795
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,830
for a long time and i hope it is but it
also may be open for a short time and we

1796
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
also may be open for a short time and we
 

1797
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,389
also may be open for a short time and we
should uh i think it was

1798
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
should uh i think it was
 

1799
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,389
should uh i think it was
wise for us to

1800
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:06,399
wise for us to
 

1801
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,389
wise for us to
uh

1802
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
uh
 

1803
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,870
uh
act quickly while the window is open

1804
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
act quickly while the window is open
 

1805
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,590
act quickly while the window is open
just in case it closes

1806
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
just in case it closes
 

1807
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,909
just in case it closes
yeah the existence of nuclear weapons

1808
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:15,919
yeah the existence of nuclear weapons
 

1809
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,669
yeah the existence of nuclear weapons
pandemics

1810
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:17,679
pandemics
 

1811
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,750
pandemics
all kinds of threats yeah

1812
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
all kinds of threats yeah
 

1813
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,470
all kinds of threats yeah
should uh should kind of um

1814
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
should uh should kind of um
 

1815
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,950
should uh should kind of um
give us some motivation

1816
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
give us some motivation
 

1817
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,190
give us some motivation
i mean civilization could get

1818
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
i mean civilization could get
 

1819
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,710
i mean civilization could get
um

1820
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:28,720
um
 

1821
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,870
um
could die with a bang or a whimper

1822
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
could die with a bang or a whimper
 

1823
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,789
could die with a bang or a whimper
you know if it's uh

1824
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
you know if it's uh
 

1825
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,029
you know if it's uh
if it dies a demographic collapse then

1826
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,039
if it dies a demographic collapse then
 

1827
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,549
if it dies a demographic collapse then
it's more of a whimper

1828
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
it's more of a whimper
 

1829
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,909
it's more of a whimper
obviously

1830
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
obviously
 

1831
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,430
obviously
but if it's world war three it's more of

1832
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,440
but if it's world war three it's more of
 

1833
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,549
but if it's world war three it's more of
a bang

1834
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
a bang
 

1835
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,470
a bang
but but these are all risks

1836
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
but but these are all risks
 

1837
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,070
but but these are all risks
um i mean it's important to think of

1838
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,080
um i mean it's important to think of
 

1839
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,269
um i mean it's important to think of
these things and just

1840
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
these things and just
 

1841
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,230
these things and just
you know think of things as like

1842
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
you know think of things as like
 

1843
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,549
you know think of things as like
probabilities not certainties um there's

1844
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:48,559
probabilities not certainties um there's
 

1845
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,789
probabilities not certainties um there's
a certain probability that

1846
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:50,799
a certain probability that
 

1847
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,110
a certain probability that
something bad will happen on earth like

1848
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
something bad will happen on earth like
 

1849
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,950
something bad will happen on earth like
i think most likely the future will be

1850
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
i think most likely the future will be
 

1851
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,310
i think most likely the future will be
good um

1852
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
good um
 

1853
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,509
good um
but there's like let's say for

1854
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:57,519
but there's like let's say for
 

1855
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,310
but there's like let's say for
argument's sake um a one percent chance

1856
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
argument's sake um a one percent chance
 

1857
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,990
argument's sake um a one percent chance
per century of

1858
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,000
per century of
 

1859
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,750
per century of
of a civilization ending event like that

1860
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
of a civilization ending event like that
 

1861
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,310
of a civilization ending event like that
was stephen hawking's estimate

1862
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
was stephen hawking's estimate
 

1863
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,509
was stephen hawking's estimate
um

1864
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:07,519
um
 

1865
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,110
um
i think he's he might be right about

1866
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,120
i think he's he might be right about
 

1867
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,990
i think he's he might be right about
that

1868
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
that
 

1869
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,870
that
uh so

1870
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:11,880
uh so
 

1871
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,190
uh so
then uh

1872
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
then uh
 

1873
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,350
then uh
you know we should basically

1874
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
you know we should basically
 

1875
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,870
you know we should basically
think of this like being a multi-planet

1876
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
think of this like being a multi-planet
 

1877
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,470
think of this like being a multi-planet
species just like taking out insurance

1878
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
species just like taking out insurance
 

1879
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,630
species just like taking out insurance
for life itself like life insurance for

1880
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
for life itself like life insurance for
 

1881
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,050
for life itself like life insurance for
life

1882
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,060
life
 

1883
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,710
life
[Laughter]

1884
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
[Laughter]
 

1885
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,789
[Laughter]
so it's turned into an infomercial real

1886
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:28,799
so it's turned into an infomercial real
 

1887
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,950
so it's turned into an infomercial real
quick life insurance for life yes

1888
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
quick life insurance for life yes
 

1889
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,990
quick life insurance for life yes
um and you know we we can bring the the

1890
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,000
um and you know we we can bring the the
 

1891
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,230
um and you know we we can bring the the
the creatures from uh you know plants

1892
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
the creatures from uh you know plants
 

1893
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,990
the creatures from uh you know plants
and animals from earth to mars and

1894
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,000
and animals from earth to mars and
 

1895
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,029
and animals from earth to mars and
breathe life into the planet um

1896
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:41,039
breathe life into the planet um
 

1897
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,029
breathe life into the planet um
and and have a second planet with with

1898
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
and and have a second planet with with
 

1899
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,389
and and have a second planet with with
life um

1900
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:44,399
life um
 

1901
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,389
life um
that would be great um they can't bring

1902
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:46,399
that would be great um they can't bring
 

1903
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,389
that would be great um they can't bring
themselves there you know so if we don't

1904
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:48,399
themselves there you know so if we don't
 

1905
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,750
themselves there you know so if we don't
bring them to mars

1906
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
bring them to mars
 

1907
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,190
bring them to mars
then they will just

1908
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,200
then they will just
 

1909
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,590
then they will just
for sure all die when the sun expands

1910
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
for sure all die when the sun expands
 

1911
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,230
for sure all die when the sun expands
anyway and then that'll be it what do

1912
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,240
anyway and then that'll be it what do
 

1913
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,389
anyway and then that'll be it what do
you think is the most difficult aspect

1914
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,399
you think is the most difficult aspect
 

1915
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,789
you think is the most difficult aspect
of building a civilization on mars

1916
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
of building a civilization on mars
 

1917
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,029
of building a civilization on mars
terraforming mars like from engineering

1918
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:03,039
terraforming mars like from engineering
 

1919
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,590
terraforming mars like from engineering
perspective from a financial perspective

1920
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:05,600
perspective from a financial perspective
 

1921
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,990
perspective from a financial perspective
human perspective to get

1922
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,000
human perspective to get
 

1923
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,870
human perspective to get
get a large number of folks there

1924
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:12,880
get a large number of folks there
 

1925
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,430
get a large number of folks there
who will never return back to earth

1926
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,440
who will never return back to earth
 

1927
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,110
who will never return back to earth
uh no they could certainly return some

1928
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
uh no they could certainly return some
 

1929
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,710
uh no they could certainly return some
will return back to earth they will

1930
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:18,720
will return back to earth they will
 

1931
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,310
will return back to earth they will
choose to stay there for the rest of

1932
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
choose to stay there for the rest of
 

1933
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,590
choose to stay there for the rest of
their lives yeah many will um

1934
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
their lives yeah many will um
 

1935
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,110
their lives yeah many will um
but uh we you know we

1936
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
but uh we you know we
 

1937
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,549
but uh we you know we
we need the spaceships back like the

1938
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
we need the spaceships back like the
 

1939
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,310
we need the spaceships back like the
ones that go to mars read them back so

1940
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320
ones that go to mars read them back so
 

1941
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,149
ones that go to mars read them back so
you can hop on if you want you know it's

1942
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159
you can hop on if you want you know it's
 

1943
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,830
you can hop on if you want you know it's
like but we can't just not have the

1944
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:33,840
like but we can't just not have the
 

1945
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,269
like but we can't just not have the
spaceships come back those things are

1946
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
spaceships come back those things are
 

1947
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,350
spaceships come back those things are
expensive we need them i'd like to come

1948
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
expensive we need them i'd like to come
 

1949
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,950
expensive we need them i'd like to come
back and do another trip i mean do you

1950
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
back and do another trip i mean do you
 

1951
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,789
back and do another trip i mean do you
think about the terraforming aspect like

1952
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
think about the terraforming aspect like
 

1953
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,310
think about the terraforming aspect like
actually building are you so focused

1954
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,320
actually building are you so focused
 

1955
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,630
actually building are you so focused
right now on the spaceships part that's

1956
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,640
right now on the spaceships part that's
 

1957
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,789
right now on the spaceships part that's
so critical yeah tomorrow

1958
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
so critical yeah tomorrow
 

1959
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,070
so critical yeah tomorrow
we absolutely if you can't get there

1960
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,080
we absolutely if you can't get there
 

1961
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,509
we absolutely if you can't get there
nothing else matters

1962
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:49,519
nothing else matters
 

1963
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,470
nothing else matters
so

1964
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
so
 

1965
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,509
so
and like i said

1966
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:51,519
and like i said
 

1967
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,950
and like i said
we can't get there with

1968
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:52,960
we can't get there with
 

1969
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,710
we can't get there with
at some extraordinarily high cost i mean

1970
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
at some extraordinarily high cost i mean
 

1971
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,070
at some extraordinarily high cost i mean
the current cost of

1972
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
the current cost of
 

1973
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,830
the current cost of
um let's say

1974
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
um let's say
 

1975
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,389
um let's say
one ton to the surface of mars is on the

1976
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:00,399
one ton to the surface of mars is on the
 

1977
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,630
one ton to the surface of mars is on the
order of a billion dollars

1978
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
order of a billion dollars
 

1979
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,590
order of a billion dollars
so

1980
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
so
 

1981
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,630
so
because you don't just need the rocket

1982
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:04,640
because you don't just need the rocket
 

1983
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,669
because you don't just need the rocket
and the launch and everything you need

1984
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:05,679
and the launch and everything you need
 

1985
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,629
and the launch and everything you need
like heat shield you need you know

1986
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
like heat shield you need you know
 

1987
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,869
like heat shield you need you know
guidance system you need deep space

1988
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:10,879
guidance system you need deep space
 

1989
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,190
guidance system you need deep space
communications you need some kind of

1990
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
communications you need some kind of
 

1991
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,950
communications you need some kind of
landing system

1992
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
landing system
 

1993
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,629
landing system
so like rough approximation would be

1994
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
so like rough approximation would be
 

1995
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,470
so like rough approximation would be
a billion dollars per ton to the surface

1996
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,480
a billion dollars per ton to the surface
 

1997
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,750
a billion dollars per ton to the surface
of mars right now

1998
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:21,760
of mars right now
 

1999
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,750
of mars right now
um this is obviously

2000
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
um this is obviously
 

2001
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,909
um this is obviously
um

2002
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:25,919
um
 

2003
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,510
um
way too expensive to create a

2004
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
way too expensive to create a
 

2005
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,510
way too expensive to create a
self-sustaining civilization

2006
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,520
self-sustaining civilization
 

2007
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,550
self-sustaining civilization
um

2008
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:30,560
um
 

2009
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,069
um
so we need to improve that by

2010
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
so we need to improve that by
 

2011
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,710
so we need to improve that by
at least a factor of a thousand

2012
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
at least a factor of a thousand
 

2013
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,310
at least a factor of a thousand
a million per ton

2014
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
a million per ton
 

2015
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,230
a million per ton
yes ideally less than much less than a

2016
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
yes ideally less than much less than a
 

2017
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,389
yes ideally less than much less than a
million ton but if it's not

2018
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
million ton but if it's not
 

2019
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,069
million ton but if it's not
like it's got to be

00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:44,079
like it's got to be
 

2021
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,790
like it's got to be
say if i say like what well how much can

city on mars the self-sustaining part is

2028
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
city on mars the self-sustaining part is
 

2029
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,430
city on mars the self-sustaining part is
important like it's just the key

from earth stop coming for any reason
 

2043
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,069
from earth stop coming for any reason
doesn't matter what the reason is but if

2044
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,079
doesn't matter what the reason is but if
 

2045
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,310
doesn't matter what the reason is but if
they stop coming for any reason will it

2046
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
they stop coming for any reason will it
 

2047
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,390
they stop coming for any reason will it
die out will it not and if there's even

2048
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
die out will it not and if there's even
 

2049
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,109
die out will it not and if there's even
one critical ingredient missing then

00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
one critical ingredient missing then
 

2051
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,109
one critical ingredient missing then
it still doesn't count it's like

2052
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:19,119
it still doesn't count it's like
 

2053
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,310
it still doesn't count it's like
you know if you're on a long sea voyage

2054
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,320
you know if you're on a long sea voyage
 

2055
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,670
you know if you're on a long sea voyage
and you've got everything except vitamin

2056
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680
and you've got everything except vitamin
 

2057
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,670
and you've got everything except vitamin
c

2058
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
c
 

2059
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,870
c
and it's only a matter of time you know

2060
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
and it's only a matter of time you know
 

2061
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,150
and it's only a matter of time you know
you're going to die

2062
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
you're going to die
 

2063
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,870
you're going to die
so so we're going to get mars city to

2064
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:28,880
so so we're going to get mars city to
 

2065
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,349
so so we're going to get mars city to
the point where it's self-sustaining

2066
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:31,359
the point where it's self-sustaining
 

2067
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,109
the point where it's self-sustaining
um i'm not sure this will really happen

2068
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:33,119
um i'm not sure this will really happen
 

2069
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,030
um i'm not sure this will really happen
in my lifetime but i i hope to see it at

2070
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,040
in my lifetime but i i hope to see it at
 

2071
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,190
in my lifetime but i i hope to see it at
least have a lot of momentum

2072
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,200
least have a lot of momentum
 

2073
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,630
least have a lot of momentum
and and then you could say okay what is

2074
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
and and then you could say okay what is
 

2075
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,430
and and then you could say okay what is
the minimum tonnage necessary to

2076
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,440
the minimum tonnage necessary to
 

2077
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,950
the minimum tonnage necessary to
have a self-sustaining city um

2078
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
have a self-sustaining city um
 

2079
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,069
have a self-sustaining city um
and there's a lot of uncertainty about

2080
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,079
and there's a lot of uncertainty about
 

2081
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,390
and there's a lot of uncertainty about
this you could say like i don't know

2082
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:48,400
this you could say like i don't know
 

2083
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,790
this you could say like i don't know
it's probably at least a million tons

2084
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,800
it's probably at least a million tons
 

2085
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,829
it's probably at least a million tons
um

2086
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
um
 

2087
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,950
um
because you have to set up a lot of

2088
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:52,960
because you have to set up a lot of
 

2089
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,190
because you have to set up a lot of
infrastructure on on mars

2090
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
infrastructure on on mars
 

2091
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,910
infrastructure on on mars
like i said you can't be missing any

2092
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:57,920
like i said you can't be missing any
 

2093
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,829
like i said you can't be missing any
anything that

2094
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
anything that
 

2095
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,109
anything that
in order to be self-sustaining you can't

2096
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:01,119
in order to be self-sustaining you can't
 

2097
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,470
in order to be self-sustaining you can't
be missed like you need you know

2098
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,480
be missed like you need you know
 

2099
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,910
be missed like you need you know
semiconductor

2100
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
semiconductor
 

2101
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,750
semiconductor
fabs you need

2102
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
fabs you need
 

2103
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,150
fabs you need
iron ore refineries like you need lots

2104
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,160
iron ore refineries like you need lots
 

2105
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,790
iron ore refineries like you need lots
of things you know so

2106
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
of things you know so
 

2107
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,510
of things you know so
um and mars is not super hospitable it's

2108
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:13,520
um and mars is not super hospitable it's
 

2109
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,750
um and mars is not super hospitable it's
it's the least inhospitable planet but

2110
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:15,760
it's the least inhospitable planet but
 

2111
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,190
it's the least inhospitable planet but
it's definitely a fixer-upper of a

2112
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
it's definitely a fixer-upper of a
 

2113
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,349
it's definitely a fixer-upper of a
planet outside of earth

2114
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
planet outside of earth
 

2115
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,030
planet outside of earth
yeah the earth is pretty earth is like

2116
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
yeah the earth is pretty earth is like
 

2117
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,990
yeah the earth is pretty earth is like
easy

2118
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,000
easy
 

2119
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,310
easy
yeah and also we should clarify in the

2120
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,320
yeah and also we should clarify in the
 

2121
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,550
yeah and also we should clarify in the
solar system yes in the solar system

2122
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,560
solar system yes in the solar system
 

2123
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,910
solar system yes in the solar system
there might be nice

2124
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
there might be nice
 

2125
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,150
there might be nice
like vacation spots there might be some

2126
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160
like vacation spots there might be some
 

2127
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,230
like vacation spots there might be some
great planets out there but

2128
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
great planets out there but
 

2129
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,710
great planets out there but
it's hard to get there yeah way way way

2130
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
it's hard to get there yeah way way way
 

2131
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,470
it's hard to get there yeah way way way
way too hard

2132
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:36,480
way too hard
 

2133
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,630
way too hard
to say at least let me push back on that

2134
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:38,640
to say at least let me push back on that
 

2135
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,310
to say at least let me push back on that
not really a pushback but a quick

2136
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
not really a pushback but a quick
 

2137
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,310
not really a pushback but a quick
curveball of a question so you did

2138
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,320
curveball of a question so you did
 

2139
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,069
curveball of a question so you did
mention physics as the the first

2140
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
mention physics as the the first
 

2141
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,750
mention physics as the the first
starting point so

2142
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
starting point so
 

2143
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,910
starting point so
um

2144
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
um
 

2145
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,030
um
general relativity allows for wormholes

2146
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
general relativity allows for wormholes
 

2147
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,190
general relativity allows for wormholes
uh they technically can exist do you

2148
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,200
uh they technically can exist do you
 

2149
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,750
uh they technically can exist do you
think um those can ever be leveraged by

2150
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:55,760
think um those can ever be leveraged by
 

2151
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,109
think um those can ever be leveraged by
humans to travel faster than the speed

2152
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
humans to travel faster than the speed
 

2153
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,349
humans to travel faster than the speed
of light

2154
00:36:59,349 --> 00:36:59,359
of light
 

2155
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,270
of light
well

2156
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:01,280
well
 

2157
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,710
well
are you saying the whole thing is

2158
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:02,720
are you saying the whole thing is
 

2159
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,990
are you saying the whole thing is
debatable uh the

2160
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,000

 

2161
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,589

that we currently do not know of any

2162
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
that we currently do not know of any
 

2163
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,270
that we currently do not know of any
means of going faster than the speed of

2164
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
means of going faster than the speed of
 

2165
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,150
means of going faster than the speed of
light

2166
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,160
light
 

2167
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,069
light
uh

2168
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:12,079
uh
 

2169
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,790
uh
there is like

2170
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800
there is like
 

2171
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,589
there is like
like

2172
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599

 

2173
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,069

there are some ideas about

2174
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:20,079
there are some ideas about
 

2175
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,030
there are some ideas about
having space like so so

2176
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,040

 

2177
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,390

you can only move at the speed of light

2178
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:26,400
you can only move at the speed of light
 

2179
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,550
you can only move at the speed of light
through through space but

2180
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:28,560
through through space but
 

2181
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,430
through through space but
if you can make space itself move

2182
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
if you can make space itself move
 

2183
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,430
if you can make space itself move
that that's like that that's

2184
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:33,440
that that's like that that's
 

2185
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,270
that that's like that that's
warping space

2186
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
warping space
 

2187
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,910
warping space
um space is is capable of moving faster

2188
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
um space is is capable of moving faster
 

2189
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,430
um space is is capable of moving faster
than the speed of light

2190
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,440
than the speed of light
 

2191
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,310
than the speed of light
right

2192
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,320
right
 

2193
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,990
right
uh like the universe in the big bang the

2194
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,000
uh like the universe in the big bang the
 

2195
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,069
uh like the universe in the big bang the
universe the universe expanded at much

2196
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:44,079
universe the universe expanded at much
 

2197
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,829
universe the universe expanded at much
much more than the speed of light

2198
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839
much more than the speed of light
 

2199
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,829
much more than the speed of light
by a lot yeah um

2200
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:48,839
by a lot yeah um
 

2201
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,670
by a lot yeah um
so um

2202
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
so um
 

2203
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,109
so um
but the

2204
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119

 

2205
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,950

if this is possible the the amount of

2206
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:56,960
if this is possible the the amount of
 

2207
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,390
if this is possible the the amount of
energy required towards space is so

2208
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:00,400
energy required towards space is so
 

2209
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,950
energy required towards space is so
gigantic it's boggles the mind

2210
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:02,960
gigantic it's boggles the mind
 

2211
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,310
gigantic it's boggles the mind
so all the work you've done with

2212
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
so all the work you've done with
 

2213
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,910
so all the work you've done with
propulsion how much innovation is

2214
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:05,920
propulsion how much innovation is
 

2215
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,470
propulsion how much innovation is
possible with rocket propulsion is this

2216
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,480
possible with rocket propulsion is this
 

2217
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,510
possible with rocket propulsion is this
um

2218
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:09,520
um
 

2219
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,430
um
i mean you've seen it all and you're

2220
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,440
i mean you've seen it all and you're
 

2221
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,310
i mean you've seen it all and you're
constantly innovating in every aspect

2222
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,320
constantly innovating in every aspect
 

2223
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,990
constantly innovating in every aspect
how much is possible like how much can

2224
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,000
how much is possible like how much can
 

2225
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,990
how much is possible like how much can
you get 10x somehow is there something

2226
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
you get 10x somehow is there something
 

2227
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,510
you get 10x somehow is there something
in there in physics

2228
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,520
in there in physics
 

2229
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,030
in there in physics
that you can get significant improvement

2230
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,040
that you can get significant improvement
 

2231
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,550
that you can get significant improvement
in terms of efficiency of engines and

2232
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
in terms of efficiency of engines and
 

2233
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,470
in terms of efficiency of engines and
all those kinds of things

2234
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480
all those kinds of things
 

2235
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,310
all those kinds of things
well as i'm saying like the

2236
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
well as i'm saying like the
 

2237
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,430
well as i'm saying like the
really the holy grail is a fully and

2238
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
really the holy grail is a fully and
 

2239
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,950
really the holy grail is a fully and
rapidly reusable orbital system um

2240
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:32,960
rapidly reusable orbital system um
 

2241
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,069
rapidly reusable orbital system um
so

2242
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
so
 

2243
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,310
so
uh right now uh

2244
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,320
uh right now uh
 

2245
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,270
uh right now uh
the

2246
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
the
 

2247
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,390
the
falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out

2248
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:40,400
falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out
 

2249
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,390
falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out
there that but it but

2250
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
there that but it but
 

2251
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,470
there that but it but
the the booster comes back and lands and

2252
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,480
the the booster comes back and lands and
 

2253
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,390
the the booster comes back and lands and
you've seen the videos and we get the

2254
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
you've seen the videos and we get the
 

2255
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,990
you've seen the videos and we get the
nose cone or faring back but we do not

2256
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,000
nose cone or faring back but we do not
 

2257
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,670
nose cone or faring back but we do not
get the upper stage back

2258
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
get the upper stage back
 

2259
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,430
get the upper stage back
so

2260
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
so
 

2261
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,470
so
uh

2262
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:52,480
uh
 

2263
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,150
uh
that means that we have a minimum cost

2264
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,160
that means that we have a minimum cost
 

2265
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,349
that means that we have a minimum cost
of

2266
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:55,359
of
 

2267
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,510
of
building up for stage um

2268
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:57,520
building up for stage um
 

2269
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,190
building up for stage um
you can think of like a two-stage rocket

2270
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,200
you can think of like a two-stage rocket
 

2271
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,950
you can think of like a two-stage rocket
of sort of like two airplanes like a big

2272
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:00,960
of sort of like two airplanes like a big
 

2273
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,030
of sort of like two airplanes like a big
airplane and a smaller airplane

2274
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,040
airplane and a smaller airplane
 

2275
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,710
airplane and a smaller airplane
um and we get big airplane back but not

2276
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:04,720
um and we get big airplane back but not
 

2277
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,710
um and we get big airplane back but not
the smaller airplane and so it still

2278
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
the smaller airplane and so it still
 

2279
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,270
the smaller airplane and so it still
costs a lot you know so that upper stage

2280
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:09,280
costs a lot you know so that upper stage
 

2281
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,150
costs a lot you know so that upper stage
is

2282
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,160
is
 

2283
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,230
is
you know at least 10 million dollars

2284
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
you know at least 10 million dollars
 

2285
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,190
you know at least 10 million dollars
um

2286
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,200
um
 

2287
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,630
um
and then the

2288
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:14,640
and then the
 

2289
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,630
and then the
degree of the the booster is not as

2290
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:16,640
degree of the the booster is not as
 

2291
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,150
degree of the the booster is not as
reused it's not as rapidly and

2292
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
reused it's not as rapidly and
 

2293
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,589
reused it's not as rapidly and
completely reusable as we'd like in

2294
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:19,599
completely reusable as we'd like in
 

2295
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,750
completely reusable as we'd like in
order of the fairings so

2296
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760
order of the fairings so
 

2297
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,349
order of the fairings so
you know our kind of

2298
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:23,359
you know our kind of
 

2299
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,510
you know our kind of
minimum marginal cost not counting

2300
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
minimum marginal cost not counting
 

2301
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,990
minimum marginal cost not counting
overhead for per flight is on the order

2302
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,000
overhead for per flight is on the order
 

2303
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,430
overhead for per flight is on the order
of

2304
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
of
 

2305
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,870
of
15

2306
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:30,880
15
 

2307
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,870
15
to 20 million dollars maybe

2308
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
to 20 million dollars maybe
 

2309
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,190
to 20 million dollars maybe
um so

2310
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,200
um so
 

2311
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,829
um so
uh that's that's extremely good for

2312
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
uh that's that's extremely good for
 

2313
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,349
uh that's that's extremely good for
it's by far better than any rocket ever

2314
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:39,359
it's by far better than any rocket ever
 

2315
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,510
it's by far better than any rocket ever
in history um

2316
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
in history um
 

2317
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,630
in history um
but

2318
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:42,640
but
 

2319
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,430
but
uh

2320
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:43,440
uh
 

2321
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,630
uh
with full and rapid reusability we can

2322
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:46,640
with full and rapid reusability we can
 

2323
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,990
with full and rapid reusability we can
reduce the cost per ton to orbit by

2324
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
reduce the cost per ton to orbit by
 

2325
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,870
reduce the cost per ton to orbit by
uh a factor of a hundred

2326
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:52,880
uh a factor of a hundred
 

2327
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,109
uh a factor of a hundred
but just think of it like um

2328
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:55,119
but just think of it like um
 

2329
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,630
but just think of it like um
like imagine if you had an aircraft or

2330
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
like imagine if you had an aircraft or
 

2331
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,190
like imagine if you had an aircraft or
something or a car

2332
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
something or a car
 

2333
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,750
something or a car
oh yeah and if you had to

2334
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:01,760
oh yeah and if you had to
 

2335
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,990
oh yeah and if you had to
buy a new car every time you went for a

2336
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
buy a new car every time you went for a
 

2337
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,550
buy a new car every time you went for a
drive it would be very expensive

2338
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,560
drive it would be very expensive
 

2339
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,150
drive it would be very expensive
it'll be silly frankly

2340
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
it'll be silly frankly
 

2341
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,829
it'll be silly frankly
but

2342
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:08,839
but
 

2343
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,349
but
um but you in fact you just refuel the

2344
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
um but you in fact you just refuel the
 

2345
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,349
um but you in fact you just refuel the
car or recharge the car

2346
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:13,359
car or recharge the car
 

2347
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,109
car or recharge the car
and that's uh makes your trip

2348
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:17,119
and that's uh makes your trip
 

2349
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,309
and that's uh makes your trip
like

2350
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:18,319
like
 

2351
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,230
like
i don't know a thousand times cheaper

2352
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
i don't know a thousand times cheaper
 

2353
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,750
i don't know a thousand times cheaper
so

2354
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
so
 

2355
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,550
so
it's the same for rockets uh if you

2356
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
it's the same for rockets uh if you
 

2357
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,510
it's the same for rockets uh if you
it's

2358
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
it's
 

2359
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,790
it's
very difficult to make this complex

2360
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:26,800
very difficult to make this complex
 

2361
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,550
very difficult to make this complex
machine that can go to orbit

2362
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:28,560
machine that can go to orbit
 

2363
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,870
machine that can go to orbit
and so if you cannot reuse it and if you

2364
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,880
and so if you cannot reuse it and if you
 

2365
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,870
and so if you cannot reuse it and if you
have to throw even any part of any

2366
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
have to throw even any part of any
 

2367
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,470
have to throw even any part of any
significant part of it away that

2368
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,480
significant part of it away that
 

2369
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,829
significant part of it away that
massively increases the cost

2370
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:36,839
massively increases the cost
 

2371
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,790
massively increases the cost
so

2372
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:38,800
so
 

2373
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,670
so
you know starship in theory could do

2374
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
you know starship in theory could do
 

2375
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,230
you know starship in theory could do
a cost per launch of like a million

2376
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
a cost per launch of like a million
 

2377
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,589
a cost per launch of like a million
maybe two million dollars or something

2378
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
maybe two million dollars or something
 

2379
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,710
maybe two million dollars or something
like that

2380
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:46,720
like that
 

2381
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,230
like that
um

2382
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,240
um
 

2383
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,670
um
and uh

2384
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
and uh
 

2385
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,390
and uh
and put over 100 tons in orbit

2386
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:52,400
and put over 100 tons in orbit
 

2387
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,390
and put over 100 tons in orbit
which is crazy yeah

2388
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,400
which is crazy yeah
 

2389
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,309
which is crazy yeah
so that's incredible so you're saying

2390
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
so that's incredible so you're saying
 

2391
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,230
so that's incredible so you're saying
like it's uh by far the biggest bang for

2392
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
like it's uh by far the biggest bang for
 

2393
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,550
like it's uh by far the biggest bang for
the buck is to make it fully reusable

2394
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,560
the buck is to make it fully reusable
 

2395
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,870
the buck is to make it fully reusable
versus like some kind of

2396
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
versus like some kind of
 

2397
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,710
versus like some kind of
brilliant breakthrough in theoretical

it just me you're gonna make the rocket

2406
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
it just me you're gonna make the rocket
 

2407
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,150
it just me you're gonna make the rocket
reusable this is an extremely difficult

2408
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,160
reusable this is an extremely difficult
 

2409
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,349
reusable this is an extremely difficult
insuring problem

2410

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,109
insuring problem
got it uh but no no new physics is

2412
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:15,119
got it uh but no no new physics is
 

2413
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,829
got it uh but no no new physics is
required

2414
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839

 

2415
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,910

just brilliant engineering let me ask a

2416
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
just brilliant engineering let me ask a
 

2417
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,069
just brilliant engineering let me ask a
slightly philosophical fun question

2418
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
slightly philosophical fun question
 

2419
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,829
slightly philosophical fun question
gotta ask i know you're focused on

2420
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:23,839
gotta ask i know you're focused on
 

2421
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,150
gotta ask i know you're focused on
getting to mars but once we're there on

2422
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160
getting to mars but once we're there on
 

2423
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,550
getting to mars but once we're there on
mars what do you what form of government

2424
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,560
mars what do you what form of government
 

2425
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,710
mars what do you what form of government
economic system

2426
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
economic system
 

2427
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,030
economic system
political system do you think would work

2428
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,040
political system do you think would work
 

2429
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,030
political system do you think would work
best for an early civilization of humans

2430
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,040
best for an early civilization of humans
 

2431
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,870
best for an early civilization of humans
is the i mean

2432
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
is the i mean
 

2433
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,870
is the i mean
the the interesting reason to talk about

2434
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880
the the interesting reason to talk about
 

2435
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,870
the the interesting reason to talk about
this stuff it also make helps people

2436
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:42,880
this stuff it also make helps people
 

2437
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,710
this stuff it also make helps people
dream about the future i know you're

2438
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:44,720
dream about the future i know you're
 

2439
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,309
dream about the future i know you're
really focused about

2440
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319
really focused about
 

2441
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,069
really focused about
the short-term engineering dream but

2442
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:48,079
the short-term engineering dream but
 

2443
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,670
the short-term engineering dream but
it's like i don't know there's something

2444
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:49,680
it's like i don't know there's something
 

2445
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,670
it's like i don't know there's something
about imagining an actual civilization

2446
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
about imagining an actual civilization
 

2447
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,670
about imagining an actual civilization
on mars that gives people

2448
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
on mars that gives people
 

2449
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,670
on mars that gives people
it really gives people hope well it

2450
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
it really gives people hope well it
 

2451
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,109
it really gives people hope well it
would be a new frontier and an

2452
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
would be a new frontier and an
 

2453
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,710
would be a new frontier and an
opportunity to rethink the whole nature

2454
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:58,720
opportunity to rethink the whole nature
 

2455
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,790
opportunity to rethink the whole nature
of government just as was done in the

2456
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:00,800
of government just as was done in the
 

2457
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,630
of government just as was done in the
creation of the united states

2458
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,640
creation of the united states
 

2459
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,270
creation of the united states
so

2460
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:07,280

 

2461
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,109

i mean i would suggest

2462
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119

 

2463
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,950

having a

2464
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960
having a
 

2465
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,190
having a
direct democracy like people vote

2466
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,200
direct democracy like people vote
 

2467
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,630
direct democracy like people vote
directly on things as opposed to

2468
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:16,640
directly on things as opposed to
 

2469
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,589
directly on things as opposed to
representative democracy so

2470
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:19,599
representative democracy so
 

2471
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,990
representative democracy so
uh representative democracy i think is

2472
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,000
uh representative democracy i think is
 

2473
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,790
uh representative democracy i think is

i think a fundamental problem that we're
because we've not really had a

that in a while and obviously we would
 

2589
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,750
that in a while and obviously we would
like to not have world wars um

2590

the there's not been a cleansing

2592
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
the there's not been a cleansing
 

2593
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,550
the there's not been a cleansing
function for rules and regulations um

2594
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
function for rules and regulations um
 

2595
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,270
function for rules and regulations um
so wars did have uh you know some sort

2596
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
so wars did have uh you know some sort
 

2597
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,829
so wars did have uh you know some sort
of lining in that there would be a a

2598
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:27,839
of lining in that there would be a a
 

2599
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,230
of lining in that there would be a a
reset on rules and regulations uh after

2600
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,240
reset on rules and regulations uh after
 

2601

regulations
 

2607
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,550
regulations
now as

2608
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:36,560
now as
 

2609
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,230
now as
for if the society society does not have

00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,240
for if the society society does not have
 

2611
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,270

a war

2612
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,280
a war
 

2613
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,870
a war
and there's no cleansing function or

2614
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:40,880
and there's no cleansing function or
 

2615
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,069
and there's no cleansing function or
garbage collection for rules and

2616
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
garbage collection for rules and
 

2617
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,670
garbage collection for rules and
regulations then rules and regulations

2618
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
regulations then rules and regulations
 

2619
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,109
regulations then rules and regulations
will accumulate every year because

2620
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:45,119
will accumulate every year because
 

2621
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,829
will accumulate every year because
they're immortal there's no actual

2622
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:47,839
they're immortal there's no actual
 

2623
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,510
they're immortal there's no actual
humans die but the laws don't so

2624
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,520
humans die but the laws don't so
 

2625
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,030
humans die but the laws don't so
we need a garbage collection function

2626
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,040
we need a garbage collection function
 

2627
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,710
we need a garbage collection function
for rules and regulations they should

2628
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:54,720
for rules and regulations they should
 

2629
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,750
for rules and regulations they should
not just

2630
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:55,760
not just
 

2631
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,309
not just
be immortal um because some of the rules

2632
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,319
be immortal um because some of the rules
 

2633
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,910
be immortal um because some of the rules
and regulations that are put in place

2634
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
and regulations that are put in place
 

2635
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,069
and regulations that are put in place
will be counterproductive uh done with

2636
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
will be counterproductive uh done with
 

2637
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,589
will be counterproductive uh done with
good intentions but counterproductive

2638
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:03,599
good intentions but counterproductive
 

2639
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,510
good intentions but counterproductive
sometimes not done with good intentions

2640
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
sometimes not done with good intentions
 

2641
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,950
sometimes not done with good intentions
so

2642
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
so
 

2643
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,710
so
um if you just if rules and regulations

2644
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:08,720
um if you just if rules and regulations
 

2645
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,630
um if you just if rules and regulations
just accumulate every year

2646
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
just accumulate every year
 

2647
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,470
just accumulate every year
and you get more and more of them then

2648
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:12,480
and you get more and more of them then
 

2649
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,990
and you get more and more of them then
eventually you won't be able to do

2650
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:14,000
eventually you won't be able to do
 

2651
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,309
eventually you won't be able to do
anything you're just like gulliver with

2652
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:16,319
anything you're just like gulliver with
 

2653
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,150
anything you're just like gulliver with
you know tied down by thousands of

2654
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,160
you know tied down by thousands of
 

2655
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,430
you know tied down by thousands of
little strings

2656
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:19,440
little strings
 

2657
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,589
little strings
and we had we see that in

2658
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
and we had we see that in
 

2659
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,230
and we had we see that in
um you know

2660
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:24,240
um you know
 

2661
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,750
um you know
us and

2662
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:25,760
us and
 

2663
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,550
us and
like basically all economies that uh

2664
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
like basically all economies that uh
 

2665
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,550
like basically all economies that uh
have been around for for a while

2666
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:30,560
have been around for for a while
 

2667
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,309
have been around for for a while
uh and and regulators and legislators

2668
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
uh and and regulators and legislators
 

2669
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,910
uh and and regulators and legislators
create new rules and regulations every

2670
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:35,920
create new rules and regulations every
 

2671
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,750
create new rules and regulations every
year but they don't put effort into

2672
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
year but they don't put effort into
 

2673
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,270
year but they don't put effort into
removing them and i think that's very

2674
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,280
removing them and i think that's very
 

2675
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,309
removing them and i think that's very
important that we put effort into

2676
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
important that we put effort into
 

2677
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,309
important that we put effort into
removing rules and regulations

2678
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,319
removing rules and regulations
 

2679
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,750
removing rules and regulations
um

2680
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:43,760
um
 

2681
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,790
um
but it gets tough because you get

2682
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:44,800
but it gets tough because you get
 

2683
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,470
but it gets tough because you get
special interests that then are

2684
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480
special interests that then are
 

2685
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,470
special interests that then are
dependent on like they they have a

2686
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
dependent on like they they have a
 

2687
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,750
dependent on like they they have a
you know a uh

2688
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:49,760
you know a uh
 

2689
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,109
you know a uh
vested interest in that whatever rule

2690
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:51,119
vested interest in that whatever rule
 

2691
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,870
vested interest in that whatever rule
and regulation and that they then they

2692
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:52,880
and regulation and that they then they
 

2693
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,829
and regulation and that they then they
fight

2694
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:53,839
fight
 

2695
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,150
fight
to not get it removed

2696
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
to not get it removed
 

2697
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,430
to not get it removed
um

2698
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,440
um
 

2699
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,190
um
yeah so it i mean i guess the problem

2700
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
yeah so it i mean i guess the problem
 

2701
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,589
yeah so it i mean i guess the problem
with the constitution is it's it's kind

2702
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
with the constitution is it's it's kind
 

2703
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,030
with the constitution is it's it's kind
of like c

2704
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
of like c
 

2705
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,190
of like c
versus java because it doesn't have any

2706
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
versus java because it doesn't have any
 

2707
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,790
versus java because it doesn't have any
garbage collection built in i think

2708
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:06,800
garbage collection built in i think
 

2709
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,550
garbage collection built in i think
there should be i when you first said

2710
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
there should be i when you first said
 

2711
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,230
there should be i when you first said
the the the metaphor of garbage

2712
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
the the the metaphor of garbage
 

2713
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,309
the the the metaphor of garbage
collection from a coding standpoint from

2714
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:12,319
collection from a coding standpoint from
 

2715
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,309
collection from a coding standpoint from
the colony standpoint yeah yeah i it

2716
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
the colony standpoint yeah yeah i it
 

2717
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,910
the colony standpoint yeah yeah i it
would be interesting interesting if the

2718
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:15,920
would be interesting interesting if the
 

2719
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,550
would be interesting interesting if the
laws themselves kind of had a built-in

2720
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,560
laws themselves kind of had a built-in
 

2721
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,230
laws themselves kind of had a built-in
thing where they kind of die after a

2722
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,240
thing where they kind of die after a
 

2723
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,990
thing where they kind of die after a
while unless somebody explicitly

2724
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,000
while unless somebody explicitly
 

2725
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,829
while unless somebody explicitly
publicly defends them yeah so that

2726
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:23,839
publicly defends them yeah so that
 

2727
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,430
publicly defends them yeah so that
that's sort of it's not like somebody

2728
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,440
that's sort of it's not like somebody
 

2729
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,829
that's sort of it's not like somebody
has to kill them they kind of die

2730
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:26,839
has to kill them they kind of die
 

2731
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,910
has to kill them they kind of die
themselves they disappear yeah

2732
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920
themselves they disappear yeah
 

2733
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,390
themselves they disappear yeah
um

2734
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400

 

2735
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,150

not to defend java or anything but you

2736
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
not to defend java or anything but you
 

2737
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,790
not to defend java or anything but you
know the c plus plus you know you could

2738
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
know the c plus plus you know you could
 

2739
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,470
know the c plus plus you know you could
also have a great garbage collection in

2740
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
also have a great garbage collection in
 

2741
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,829
also have a great garbage collection in
python and so on

2742
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:39,839
python and so on
 

2743
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,230
python and so on
yeah so yeah something's good something

2744
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:42,240
yeah so yeah something's good something
 

2745
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,589
yeah so yeah something's good something
needs to happen

2746
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
needs to happen
 

2747
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,829
needs to happen
or or just the the civilization's

2748
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
or or just the the civilization's
 

2749
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,470
or or just the the civilization's
arteries arteries just harden over time

2750
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:48,480
arteries arteries just harden over time
 

2751
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,470
arteries arteries just harden over time
and and you can just get less and less

2752
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
and and you can just get less and less
 

2753
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,390
and and you can just get less and less
done because there's just a rule against

2754
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:52,400
done because there's just a rule against
 

2755
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,829
done because there's just a rule against
everything

2756
00:46:54,829 --> 00:46:54,839

 

2757
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,190

so yeah i think like i don't know for

2758
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
so yeah i think like i don't know for
 

2759
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,190
so yeah i think like i don't know for
mars order i'd say or even for you

2760
00:46:59,190 --> 00:46:59,200
mars order i'd say or even for you
 

2761
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,550
mars order i'd say or even for you
obviously for earth as well like i think

2762
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:00,560
obviously for earth as well like i think
 

2763
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,630
obviously for earth as well like i think
there should be an active process for

2764
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
there should be an active process for
 

2765
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,910
there should be an active process for
removing

2766
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920
removing
 

2767
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,349
removing
rules and regulations and questioning

2768
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:05,359
rules and regulations and questioning
 

2769
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,950
rules and regulations and questioning
their existence

2770
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:06,960
their existence
 

2771
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,630
their existence
just um

2772
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:08,640
just um
 

2773
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,309
just um
like if we've got a function for

2774
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:10,319
like if we've got a function for
 

2775
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,510
like if we've got a function for
creating rules and regulations because

2776
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,520
creating rules and regulations because
 

2777
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,950
creating rules and regulations because
rules and regulations can also think of

2778
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
rules and regulations can also think of
 

2779
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,190
rules and regulations can also think of
as like they're like software or lines

2780
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
as like they're like software or lines
 

2781
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,030
as like they're like software or lines
of code for operating

2782
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:17,040
of code for operating
 

2783
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,270
of code for operating
uh civilization that's the rules and

2784
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
uh civilization that's the rules and
 

2785
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,030
uh civilization that's the rules and
regulations um

2786
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,040
regulations um
 

2787
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,390
regulations um
so it's like we shouldn't have rules and

2788
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
so it's like we shouldn't have rules and
 

2789
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,910
so it's like we shouldn't have rules and
regulations but you have code

2790
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:23,920
regulations but you have code
 

2791
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,950
regulations but you have code
accumulation but no code removal

2792
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:26,960
accumulation but no code removal
 

2793
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,710
accumulation but no code removal
um and so it just gets

2794
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:28,720
um and so it just gets
 

2795
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,349
um and so it just gets
to become basically archaic bloatware

2796
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:31,359
to become basically archaic bloatware
 

2797
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,870
to become basically archaic bloatware
after a while

2798
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:32,880
after a while
 

2799
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,510
after a while
um and and it's just it makes it hard

2800
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:35,520
um and and it's just it makes it hard
 

2801
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,390
um and and it's just it makes it hard
for

2802
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
for
 

2803
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,750
for
things to progress

2804
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:37,760
things to progress
 

2805
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,630
things to progress
so

2806
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:38,640
so
 

2807
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,150
so
i don't know maybe mars you'd have like

2808
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
i don't know maybe mars you'd have like
 

2809
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,589
i don't know maybe mars you'd have like
an uh

2810
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,599
an uh
 

2811
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,870
an uh
you know any given law must have a

2812
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880
you know any given law must have a
 

2813
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,990
you know any given law must have a
sunset you know and and and uh and

2814
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:46,000
sunset you know and and and uh and
 

2815
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,750
sunset you know and and and uh and
require active

2816
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
require active
 

2817
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,589
require active
voting to keep

2818
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
voting to keep
 

2819
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,510
voting to keep
restoring to keep it up there you know

2820
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
restoring to keep it up there you know
 

2821
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,910
restoring to keep it up there you know
um and i actually also say like

2822
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:53,920
um and i actually also say like
 

2823
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,030
um and i actually also say like
and these just i don't know

2824
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:55,040
and these just i don't know
 

2825
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,309
and these just i don't know
recommendations or thoughts and

2826
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:58,319
recommendations or thoughts and
 

2827
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,670
recommendations or thoughts and
ultimately we'll be up to the people on

2828
00:47:59,670 --> 00:47:59,680
ultimately we'll be up to the people on
 

2829
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,910
ultimately we'll be up to the people on
mars to decide but

2830
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
mars to decide but
 

2831
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,069
mars to decide but
i think um

2832
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:04,079
i think um
 

2833
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,710
i think um
it should be easier to remove a law than

2834
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
it should be easier to remove a law than
 

2835
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,790
it should be easier to remove a law than
to add one because of the just to

2836
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:08,800
to add one because of the just to
 

2837
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,630
to add one because of the just to
overcome the inertia of laws

2838
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
overcome the inertia of laws
 

2839
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,589
overcome the inertia of laws
so

2840
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
so
 

2841
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,230
so
maybe it's like uh

2842
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,240
maybe it's like uh
 

2843
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,390
maybe it's like uh
for argument's sake you need like say 60

2844
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
for argument's sake you need like say 60
 

2845
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,589
for argument's sake you need like say 60
percent vote to have a law take effect

2846
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:19,599
percent vote to have a law take effect
 

2847
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,190
percent vote to have a law take effect
but only a 40 vote to remove it

2848
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:23,200
but only a 40 vote to remove it
 

2849
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,750
but only a 40 vote to remove it
so let me be the guy you posted meme on

2850
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:25,760
so let me be the guy you posted meme on
 

2851
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,589
so let me be the guy you posted meme on
twitter recently where there's

2852
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
twitter recently where there's
 

2853
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,549
twitter recently where there's
there's like a row of urinals a guy just

2854
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
there's like a row of urinals a guy just
 

2855
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,950
there's like a row of urinals a guy just
walks all the way across

2856
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:32,960
walks all the way across
 

2857
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,750
walks all the way across
and he tells you about crypto

2858
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,760
and he tells you about crypto
 

2859
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,510
and he tells you about crypto
listen i mean that's happened to me

2860
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:37,520
listen i mean that's happened to me
 

2861
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,030
listen i mean that's happened to me
so many times i think maybe even

2862
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,040
so many times i think maybe even
 

2863
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,670
so many times i think maybe even
literally uh yeah

2864
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
literally uh yeah
 

2865
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,349
literally uh yeah
do you think technologically speaking

2866
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
do you think technologically speaking
 

2867
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,589
do you think technologically speaking
there's any room for ideas of smart

2868
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:45,599
there's any room for ideas of smart
 

2869
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,829
there's any room for ideas of smart
contracts or so on because you mentioned

2870
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:47,839
contracts or so on because you mentioned
 

2871
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:48,790
contracts or so on because you mentioned
laws

2872
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:48,800
laws
 

2873
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,790
laws
um that's an interesting implement use

2874
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:50,800
um that's an interesting implement use
 

2875
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,109
um that's an interesting implement use
of things like smart contracts to

2876
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
of things like smart contracts to
 

2877
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,270
of things like smart contracts to
implement the laws by which governments

2878
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,280
implement the laws by which governments
 

2879

00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:06,079
somehow i never i don't quite understand
 

2889
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,230

know
i mean

2894
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:12,160
i mean
 

2895
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,589
i mean
so it's two dumb times to have small

2896
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599
so it's two dumb times to have small
 

2897
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,790
so it's two dumb times to have small
contracts

2898
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:14,800
contracts
 

2899
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,829
contracts
it's a good line

2900
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:17,839
it's a good line
 

2901
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,829
it's a good line
i mean my general approach to any kind

language
 

2915
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,270
language
and just make sure everyone understands

2916
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:33,280
and just make sure everyone understands
 

2917
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,270
and just make sure everyone understands
this is the deal does everyone is it

and uh
 

2923
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,069
and uh
and and what are the consequences if

2924
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,079
and and what are the consequences if
 

2925
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,470

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,470
official currency of mars that's coming
in the future

2964
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:22,480
in the future
 

2965
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,190
in the future
well

2966
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,200
well
 

2967
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,829
well
i think mars itself will need to have a

2968
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:25,839
i think mars itself will need to have a
 

2969
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,990
i think mars itself will need to have a
different currency because you can't

2970
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,000
different currency because you can't
 

2971
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,030
different currency because you can't
synchronize due to speed of light

2972
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,040
synchronize due to speed of light
 

2973
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,109
synchronize due to speed of light
or not easily um so it must be

2974
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
or not easily um so it must be
 

2975
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,390
or not easily um so it must be
completely standalone from earth

2976
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
completely standalone from earth
 

2977
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,309
completely standalone from earth
well yeah because the

2978
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:38,319
well yeah because the
 

2979
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:39,190
well yeah because the
but

2980
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:39,200
but
 

2981
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,589
but
mars is at closest approach it's four

2982
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
mars is at closest approach it's four
 

2983
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,589
mars is at closest approach it's four
light minutes away roughly and then at

2984
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:43,599
light minutes away roughly and then at
 

2985
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,829
light minutes away roughly and then at
furthest approach uh it's roughly 20

2986
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:45,839
furthest approach uh it's roughly 20
 

2987
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,190
furthest approach uh it's roughly 20
light minutes away

2988
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,200
light minutes away
 

2989
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,910
light minutes away
uh maybe a little more um

2990
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
uh maybe a little more um
 

2991
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,430
uh maybe a little more um
so you can't really have something

2992
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:51,440
so you can't really have something
 

2993
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,670
so you can't really have something
synchronizing you know if you could if

2994
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
synchronizing you know if you could if
 

2995
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,109
synchronizing you know if you could if
if you've got a 20 minute speed light

2996
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
if you've got a 20 minute speed light
 

2997
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,710
if you've got a 20 minute speed light
issue if it's got a one minute

2998
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:56,720
issue if it's got a one minute
 

2999
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,470
issue if it's got a one minute
blockchain uh it's not going to

3000
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:58,480
blockchain uh it's not going to
 

3001
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,910
blockchain uh it's not going to
synchronize properly

3002
00:50:59,910 --> 00:50:59,920
synchronize properly
 

3003
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,030
synchronize properly
um

3004
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
um
 

3005
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,349
um
so mars really would i don't know if

3006
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:03,359
so mars really would i don't know if
 

3007
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,710
so mars really would i don't know if
mars would have a cryptocurrency as a

3008
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:04,720
mars would have a cryptocurrency as a
 

3009
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,430
mars would have a cryptocurrency as a
thing but probably seems likely

3010
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
thing but probably seems likely
 

3011
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,109
thing but probably seems likely
but it would be some kind of localized

3012
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
but it would be some kind of localized
 

3013
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,150
but it would be some kind of localized
thing on mars

3014
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,160

 

3015
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,710

and you let the people decide

3016
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
and you let the people decide
 

3017
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,670
and you let the people decide
yeah

3018
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:15,680
yeah
 

3019
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,910
yeah
absolutely

3020
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:17,920
absolutely
 

3021
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,109
absolutely
the future of mars should be up to the

3022
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:19,119
the future of mars should be up to the
 

3023
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,630
the future of mars should be up to the
martians

3024
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
martians
 

3025
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,910
martians
yeah so um

3026
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:23,920
yeah so um
 

3027
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,750
yeah so um
i mean i think the cryptocurrency thing

3028
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:25,760
i mean i think the cryptocurrency thing
 

3029
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,910
i mean i think the cryptocurrency thing
is an interesting

3030
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
is an interesting
 

3031
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,990
is an interesting
approach to

3032
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,000
approach to
 

3033
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,510
approach to
reducing the um

3034
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:33,520
reducing the um
 

3035
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,589
reducing the um
error in the

3036
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
error in the
 

3037
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,710
error in the
the database that is called money

3038
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
the database that is called money
 

3039
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,030
the database that is called money
um

3040
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040

 

3041
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,309

you know i think i have a pretty deep

3042
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:42,319
you know i think i have a pretty deep
 

3043
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,230
you know i think i have a pretty deep
understanding of the of what money

3044
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:44,240
understanding of the of what money
 

3045
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,150
understanding of the of what money
actually is on a practical day-to-day

3046
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
actually is on a practical day-to-day
 

3047
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,829
actually is on a practical day-to-day
basis because of paypal

3048
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:48,839
basis because of paypal
 

3049
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,750
basis because of paypal
um you know i really

3050
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:51,760
um you know i really
 

3051
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,030
um you know i really
got in deep there um

3052
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,040
got in deep there um
 

3053
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,990
got in deep there um
and

3054
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
and
 

3055
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,309
and
right now the money system actually for

3056
00:51:58,309 --> 00:51:58,319
right now the money system actually for
 

3057
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,829
right now the money system actually for
practical purposes is

3058
00:51:59,829 --> 00:51:59,839
practical purposes is
 

3059
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,270
practical purposes is
is really a bunch of uh heterogeneous uh

3060
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,280
is really a bunch of uh heterogeneous uh
 

3061
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,349
is really a bunch of uh heterogeneous uh
mainframes running uh old cobalt

3062
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:07,359
mainframes running uh old cobalt
 

3063
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,430
mainframes running uh old cobalt
okay you mean literally that's literally

3064
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
okay you mean literally that's literally
 

3065
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,870
okay you mean literally that's literally
that is literally what's happening in

3066
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:10,880
that is literally what's happening in
 

3067
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,630
that is literally what's happening in
batch mode

3068
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:12,640
batch mode
 

3069
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,349
batch mode
okay in patch mode yeah uh pretty the

3070
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:15,359
okay in patch mode yeah uh pretty the
 

3071
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,349
okay in patch mode yeah uh pretty the
poor fastest who have to

3072
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
poor fastest who have to
 

3073
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,150
poor fastest who have to
maintain that code okay that's a

3074
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,160
maintain that code okay that's a
 

3075
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,870
maintain that code okay that's a
that's a pain that's pain not even for

3076
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
that's a pain that's pain not even for
 

3077
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,910
that's a pain that's pain not even for
trans cobalt yep it's cobalt it's like

3078
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:25,920
trans cobalt yep it's cobalt it's like
 

3079
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,349
trans cobalt yep it's cobalt it's like
and they still

3080
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:27,359
and they still
 

3081
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,790
and they still
banks are still buying mainframes in

3082
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:28,800
banks are still buying mainframes in
 

3083
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,470
banks are still buying mainframes in
2021 and running ancient global code

3084
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,480
2021 and running ancient global code
 

3085
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,390
2021 and running ancient global code
uh and uh

3086
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:34,400
uh and uh
 

3087
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,470
uh and uh
you know the the federal reserve is like

3088
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:36,480
you know the the federal reserve is like
 

3089
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,309
you know the the federal reserve is like
probably even older than the what the

3090
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:38,319
probably even older than the what the
 

3091
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,069
probably even older than the what the
banks have and they have an old kobold

3092
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
banks have and they have an old kobold
 

3093
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,829
banks have and they have an old kobold
mainframe

3094
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:41,839
mainframe
 

3095
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:45,190
mainframe
and so now and and so the the government

3096
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:45,200
and so now and and so the the government
 

3097
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,109
and so now and and so the the government
effectively has editing privileges on

3098
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:47,119
effectively has editing privileges on
 

3099
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,349
effectively has editing privileges on
the on the money database

3100
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:49,359
the on the money database
 

3101
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,430
the on the money database
um and they use those editing privileges

3102
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,440
um and they use those editing privileges
 

3103
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,270
um and they use those editing privileges
to um

3104
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,280
to um
 

3105
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,710
to um
make more money

3106
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:54,720
make more money
 

3107
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,309
make more money
whenever they want

3108
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:56,319
whenever they want
 

3109
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,309
whenever they want
and this increases the error in the

3110
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
and this increases the error in the
 

3111
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,030
and this increases the error in the
database that is money so i think money

3112
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,040
database that is money so i think money
 

3113
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,390
database that is money so i think money
should really be viewed through the lens

3114
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,400
should really be viewed through the lens
 

3115
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,470
should really be viewed through the lens
of information theory

3116
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:04,480
of information theory
 

3117
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,030
of information theory
and uh and so it's uh

3118
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
and uh and so it's uh
 

3119
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,630
and uh and so it's uh
you're kind of like uh like an internet

3120
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
you're kind of like uh like an internet
 

3121
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,349
you're kind of like uh like an internet
connection like what's the bandwidth uh

3122
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:11,359
connection like what's the bandwidth uh
 

3123
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,470
connection like what's the bandwidth uh
you know

3124
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:12,480
you know
 

3125
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,790
you know
total bit rate uh what is the latency

3126
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
total bit rate uh what is the latency

you have a trillion dollars it's useless

so money is useless

3228
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:56,640
so money is useless

um
 

3249
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:20,230
um
so like just think of money as as a

3250
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,240
so like just think of money as as a
 

3251
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,470
so like just think of money as as a
database for resource allocation um

3252
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,480

00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:29,359
um and then what what what system
 

3259
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,990

uh it is what what

3260

uh it is what what
 

3261
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,470
uh it is what what
in what form should that that

3262
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,480
in what form should that that
 

3263

database or data system
 

3265
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,870

what what what would be most effective

3266
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
what what what would be most effective
 

3267
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,670
what what what would be most effective
now

3268
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,680
now
 

3269
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,270
now
there's a there is a fundamental issue

3270
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
there's a there is a fundamental issue
 

3271
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,589
there's a there is a fundamental issue
with um say bitcoin in its current form

3272
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:45,599
with um say bitcoin in its current form
 

3273
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,829
with um say bitcoin in its current form
uh in that it's the transaction volume

3274
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:47,839
uh in that it's the transaction volume
 

3275
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,349
uh in that it's the transaction volume
is very limited

3276
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
is very limited
 

3277
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:50,630
is very limited
um

3278
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:50,640
um
 

3279
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,789
um
and uh the

3280
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
and uh the
 

3281
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,309
and uh the
latency this is the latency for for a

3282
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319
latency this is the latency for for a
 

3283
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,990
latency this is the latency for for a
properly confirmed transaction is to is

3284
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,000
properly confirmed transaction is to is
 

3285
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,069
properly confirmed transaction is to is
too long much longer than you'd like

3286
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
too long much longer than you'd like
 

3287
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,710
too long much longer than you'd like
so it's not it's actually not great from

3288
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
so it's not it's actually not great from
 

3289

00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,990
um
uh so it is perhaps useful as

3298
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:12,000
uh so it is perhaps useful as
 

3299
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,549
uh so it is perhaps useful as
as to search to solve an aspect of the

3300
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:14,559
as to search to solve an aspect of the
 

3301
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,750
as to search to solve an aspect of the
money database problem uh

3302
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
money database problem uh
 

3303
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,990
money database problem uh
which is the sort of store of wealth or

3304
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
which is the sort of store of wealth or
 

3305
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,630
which is the sort of store of wealth or
an

3306
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
an
 

3307
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,150
an
accounting of

3308
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
accounting of
 

3309
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,430
accounting of
relative obligations i suppose

3310
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:25,440
relative obligations i suppose
 

3311
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,470
relative obligations i suppose
but it is not useful as a

3312
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
but it is not useful as a
 

3313
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,789
but it is not useful as a
currency as a day-to-day currency but

3314
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
currency as a day-to-day currency but
 

3315
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,069
currency as a day-to-day currency but
people have proposed different

3316
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,079
people have proposed different
 

3317
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,150
people have proposed different
technological solutions

3318
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,160
technological solutions
 

3319
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,990
technological solutions
yeah lightning network and the layer two

3320
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:36,000
yeah lightning network and the layer two
 

3321
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,150
yeah lightning network and the layer two
technologies on top of that i mean it's

3322
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:38,160
technologies on top of that i mean it's
 

3323
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,069
technologies on top of that i mean it's
it's all it seems to be all kind of a

3324
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:40,079
it's all it seems to be all kind of a
 

3325
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,309
it's all it seems to be all kind of a
trade-off but the point is it's kind of

3326
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:42,319
trade-off but the point is it's kind of
 

3327
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,829
trade-off but the point is it's kind of
brilliant to say that just think about

3328
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:43,839
brilliant to say that just think about
 

3329
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,589
brilliant to say that just think about
information think about what kind of

3330
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
information think about what kind of
 

3331
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,030
information think about what kind of
database what kind of infrastructure

3332
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,040
database what kind of infrastructure
 

3333
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,270
database what kind of infrastructure
enables yeah like you're operating an

3334
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
enables yeah like you're operating an
 

3335
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,309
enables yeah like you're operating an
economy

3336
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:50,319
economy
 

3337
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:51,270
economy
um

3338
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
um
 

3339
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,109
um
and you need to have some

3340
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,119
and you need to have some
 

3341
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,710
and you need to have some
thing that

3342
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:54,720
thing that
 

3343
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,030
thing that
allows for the efficient

3344
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,040
allows for the efficient
 

3345
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,470
allows for the efficient
to have efficient

3346
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
to have efficient
 

3347
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,390
to have efficient
uh value ratios between products and

3348
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,400
uh value ratios between products and
 

3349
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,470
uh value ratios between products and
services so you've got this massive

3350
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,480
services so you've got this massive
 

3351
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,990
services so you've got this massive
number of products and services and you

3352
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,000
number of products and services and you
 

3353
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,349
number of products and services and you
need to

3354
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
need to
 

3355
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,750
need to
you can't just bar barter it's like that

3356
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:07,760
you can't just bar barter it's like that
 

3357
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,510
you can't just bar barter it's like that
would be extremely unwieldy

3358
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:09,520
would be extremely unwieldy
 

3359
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,470
would be extremely unwieldy
so you need something that gives you the

3360
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
so you need something that gives you the
 

3361
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,510
so you need something that gives you the
the

3362
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:13,520
the
 

3363
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,390
the
an

3364
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:14,400
an
 

3365
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,589
an
a

3366
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:15,599
a
 

3367
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,309
a
a

3368
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:16,319
a
 

3369
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,390
a
ratio of exchange between goods and

3370
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,400
ratio of exchange between goods and
 

3371
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,589
ratio of exchange between goods and
services

3372
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:19,599
services
 

3373
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:20,470
services
um

3374
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:20,480
um
 

3375
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,549
um
and and then something that allows you

3376
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:22,559
and and then something that allows you
 

3377
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:23,270
and and then something that allows you
to

3378
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
to
 

3379
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,990
to
uh shift obligations across time like

3380
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,000
uh shift obligations across time like
 

3381
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,069
uh shift obligations across time like
debt debt and equity shift obligations

3382
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:28,079
debt debt and equity shift obligations
 

3383
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,309
debt debt and equity shift obligations
across time then what does what does the

3384
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:30,319
across time then what does what does the
 

3385
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,750
across time then what does what does the
best job of that

3386
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
best job of that
 

3387
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,109
best job of that
um

3388
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
um
 

3389
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,270
um
part reason why i think there's some

3390
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
part reason why i think there's some
 

3391
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,990
part reason why i think there's some
um merit to dogecoin even though it was

3392
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,000
um merit to dogecoin even though it was
 

3393
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,109
um merit to dogecoin even though it was
obviously created as a joke um

3394
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:41,119
obviously created as a joke um
 

3395
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,470
obviously created as a joke um
is that

3396
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,480
is that
 

3397
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,349
is that
it it actually does have a much higher

3398
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
it it actually does have a much higher
 

3399
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,510
it it actually does have a much higher
uh transaction volume capability than

3400
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
uh transaction volume capability than
 

3401
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,750
uh transaction volume capability than
bitcoin um

3402
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,760
bitcoin um
 

3403
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,829
bitcoin um
and the you know the cut like the costs

3404
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:51,839
and the you know the cut like the costs
 

3405
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,390
and the you know the cut like the costs
of doing a transaction the the dogecoin

3406
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
of doing a transaction the the dogecoin
 

3407
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,549
of doing a transaction the the dogecoin
fee is is very low like right now if you

3408
00:57:56,549 --> 00:57:56,559
fee is is very low like right now if you
 

3409
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,549
fee is is very low like right now if you
want to do a bitcoin transaction the

3410
00:57:58,549 --> 00:57:58,559
want to do a bitcoin transaction the
 

3411
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,069
want to do a bitcoin transaction the
price of doing that transaction is very

3412
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:00,079
price of doing that transaction is very
 

3413
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,549
price of doing that transaction is very
high so you could not use it effectively

3414
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:02,559
high so you could not use it effectively
 

3415
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,230
high so you could not use it effectively
for most things

3416
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,240
for most things
 

3417
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,230
for most things
um and nor could it even scale to a high

3418
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,240
um and nor could it even scale to a high
 

3419
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,190
um and nor could it even scale to a high
volume um

3420
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,200
volume um
 

3421
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,670
volume um
uh

3422
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:11,680

 

3423
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,910

and when bitcoin was you know started i

3424
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:13,920
and when bitcoin was you know started i
 

3425
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,670
and when bitcoin was you know started i
guess when around 2008 or something like

3426
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,680
guess when around 2008 or something like
 

3427
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,270
guess when around 2008 or something like
that um

3428
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:17,280
that um
 

3429
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,990
that um
the internet connections were much worse

3430
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,000
the internet connections were much worse
 

3431
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,190
the internet connections were much worse
than they are today like order of

3432
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:21,200
than they are today like order of
 

3433
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,030
than they are today like order of
magnitude cup

3434
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
magnitude cup
 

3435
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,589
magnitude cup
i mean there's the way way worse you

3436
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:25,599
i mean there's the way way worse you
 

3437
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,549
i mean there's the way way worse you
know in 2008 so so like having us you

3438
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
know in 2008 so so like having us you
 

3439
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:29,990
know in 2008 so so like having us you
know a small

3440
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,000
know a small
 

3441
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,630
know a small
uh block size or whatever is

3442
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,640
uh block size or whatever is
 

3443
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,470
uh block size or whatever is
you know and a long

3444
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,480
you know and a long
 

3445
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,549
you know and a long
synchronization time is

3446
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:36,559
synchronization time is
 

3447
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,589
synchronization time is
made sense in 2008 but did you know 2021

3448
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:39,599
made sense in 2008 but did you know 2021
 

3449
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,630
made sense in 2008 but did you know 2021
or fast forward 10 years it's like it's

3450
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:42,640
or fast forward 10 years it's like it's
 

3451
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,230
or fast forward 10 years it's like it's
it's like

3452
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:44,240
it's like
 

3453
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,870
it's like
comically low you know it's uh

3454
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:46,880
comically low you know it's uh
 

3455
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,829
comically low you know it's uh
so

3456
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:48,839
so
 

3457
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,390
so
um

3458
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
um
 

3459
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,750
um
and i think there's some

3460
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
and i think there's some
 

3461
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,950
and i think there's some
value to

3462
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
value to
 

3463
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,069
value to
having

3464
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:54,079
having
 

3465
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,470
having
a linear increase in the amount of

3466
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:56,480
a linear increase in the amount of
 

3467
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,150
a linear increase in the amount of
currency that uh is generated um

3468
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:00,160
currency that uh is generated um
 

3469
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,829
currency that uh is generated um
so because some amount of the currency

3470
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:01,839
so because some amount of the currency
 

3471
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,870
so because some amount of the currency
like like

3472
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:02,880
like like
 

3473
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,549
like like
if a currency is too deflationary or

3474
00:59:06,549 --> 00:59:06,559
if a currency is too deflationary or
 

3475
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,870
if a currency is too deflationary or
like uh or should say if if

3476
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:08,880
like uh or should say if if
 

3477
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,670
like uh or should say if if
if if a currency is expected to increase

3478
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
if if a currency is expected to increase
 

3479
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,670
if if a currency is expected to increase
in value over time there's reluctance to

3480
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:13,680
in value over time there's reluctance to
 

3481
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,950
in value over time there's reluctance to
spend it

3482
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:14,960
spend it
 

3483
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,710
spend it
because they're like oh i if i

3484
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:16,720
because they're like oh i if i
 

3485
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,470
because they're like oh i if i
i'll just hold it and not spend it

3486
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
i'll just hold it and not spend it
 

3487
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,150
i'll just hold it and not spend it
because it's scarcity is increasing with

3488
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,160
because it's scarcity is increasing with
 

3489
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,470
because it's scarcity is increasing with
time so if i spend it now then i will

3490
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:22,480
time so if i spend it now then i will
 

3491
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,710
time so if i spend it now then i will
regret spending it so i will just you

3492
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
regret spending it so i will just you
 

3493
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,829
regret spending it so i will just you
know total it

3494
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:27,839

 

3495
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,190

but if there's

3496
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,200
but if there's
 

3497
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,789
but if there's
some dilution of the currency occurring

3498
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:30,799
some dilution of the currency occurring
 

3499
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,309
some dilution of the currency occurring
over time that's that's more of an

3500
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,319
over time that's that's more of an
 

3501
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,789
over time that's that's more of an
incentive to use that as a currency so

3502
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:34,799
incentive to use that as a currency so
 

3503
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,829
incentive to use that as a currency so
um those coins somewhat randomly has

3504
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:37,839
um those coins somewhat randomly has
 

3505
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:38,630
um those coins somewhat randomly has
uh

3506
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
uh
 

3507
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,829
uh
a

3508
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:39,839
a
 

3509
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,109
a
um

3510
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:41,119
um
 

3511
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,349
um
just a fixed a number of

3512
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:43,359
just a fixed a number of
 

3513
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,150
just a fixed a number of
of

3514
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,160
of
 

3515
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,430
of
sort of coins or hash strings that

3516
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
sort of coins or hash strings that
 

3517
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,309
sort of coins or hash strings that
uh

3518
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:48,319
uh
 

3519
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,910
uh
are generated every year so there's

3520
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
are generated every year so there's
 

3521
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,750
are generated every year so there's
there's some inflation but it's not a

3522
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,760
there's some inflation but it's not a
 

3523
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,630
there's some inflation but it's not a
percentage base it's a it's so the

3524
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:54,640
percentage base it's a it's so the
 

3525
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,829
percentage base it's a it's so the
it's a fixed number so the percentage of

3526
00:59:57,829 --> 00:59:57,839
it's a fixed number so the percentage of
 

3527
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,510
it's a fixed number so the percentage of
inflation will necessarily decline over

3528
00:59:59,510 --> 00:59:59,520
inflation will necessarily decline over
 

3529
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,710
inflation will necessarily decline over
time

3530
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:00,720
time
 

3531
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,549
time
um

3532
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
um
 

3533
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,950
um
so it just i'm not saying that it's like

3534
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:04,960
so it just i'm not saying that it's like
 

3535
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,670
so it just i'm not saying that it's like
the ideal system for a currency but i

3536
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
the ideal system for a currency but i
 

3537
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,589
the ideal system for a currency but i
think it actually is uh just

3538
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:09,599
think it actually is uh just
 

3539
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,910
think it actually is uh just
fundamentally better than

3540
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
fundamentally better than
 

3541
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,109
fundamentally better than
anything else i've seen just by accident

3542
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
anything else i've seen just by accident
 

3543
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,670
anything else i've seen just by accident
um so i like how you said um around 2008

3544
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:19,680
um so i like how you said um around 2008
 

3545
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,750
um so i like how you said um around 2008
so you're not uh

3546
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
so you're not uh
 

3547
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,510
so you're not uh
you know some people suggested you might

3548
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,520
you know some people suggested you might
 

3549
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,430
you know some people suggested you might
be satoshi nakamoto you previously said

3550
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
be satoshi nakamoto you previously said
 

3551
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,630
be satoshi nakamoto you previously said
you're not i'm not

3552
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:28,640

 

3553
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,030

would you tell us if you were yes okay

3554
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,040

 

3555
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,710

uh do you think it's a feature of bug

3556
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
uh do you think it's a feature of bug
 

3557
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,710
uh do you think it's a feature of bug
that he's anonymous or she or they

3558
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:38,720
that he's anonymous or she or they
 

3559
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,789
that he's anonymous or she or they
it's an interesting kind of quirk of

3560
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:40,799
it's an interesting kind of quirk of
 

3561
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,549
it's an interesting kind of quirk of
human history that there is a particular

3562
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:42,559
human history that there is a particular
 

3563
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,870
human history that there is a particular
technology that is a completely

3564
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:44,880
technology that is a completely
 

3565
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,789
technology that is a completely
anonymous inventor

3566
01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:48,799

 

3567
01:00:48,799 --> 01:01:03,270

or creator

3568
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:03,280

 

3569
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,349

well i mean you can you can look at the

3570
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:05,359
well i mean you can you can look at the
 

3571
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:06,470
well i mean you can you can look at the
um

3572
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:06,480
um
 

3573
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,030
um
evolution of ideas

3574
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:09,040
evolution of ideas
 

3575
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,789
evolution of ideas
um before the launch of bitcoin

3576
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:12,799
um before the launch of bitcoin
 

3577
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,390
um before the launch of bitcoin
and

3578
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,400
and
 

3579
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,430
and
see who wrote

3580
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440

 

3581
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,990

you know about those ideas

3582
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:20,000
you know about those ideas
 

3583
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,670
you know about those ideas
um and then

3584
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
um and then
 

3585
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,950
um and then
i like i don't know exactly obviously i

3586
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:22,960
i like i don't know exactly obviously i
 

3587
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,190
i like i don't know exactly obviously i
don't know who created bitcoin for

3588
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,200
don't know who created bitcoin for
 

3589
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,789
don't know who created bitcoin for
practical purposes but

3590
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:26,799
practical purposes but
 

3591
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,950
practical purposes but
the evolution of ideas is is pretty

3592
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:28,960
the evolution of ideas is is pretty
 

3593
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,190
the evolution of ideas is is pretty
clear before that and like it seems as

3594
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
clear before that and like it seems as
 

3595
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,069
clear before that and like it seems as
though like nick zabo uh is probably

3596
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:34,079
though like nick zabo uh is probably
 

3597
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,230
though like nick zabo uh is probably
more than anyone else uh responsible for

3598
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
more than anyone else uh responsible for
 

3599
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,030
more than anyone else uh responsible for
the evolution of those ideas so

3600
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:39,040
the evolution of those ideas so
 

3601
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,190
the evolution of those ideas so
he claims not to be

3602
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:41,200
he claims not to be
 

3603
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,870
he claims not to be
nakamoto but

3604
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:42,880
nakamoto but
 

3605
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,230
nakamoto but
i'm not sure that's that's neither here

3606
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,240
i'm not sure that's that's neither here
 

3607
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,870
i'm not sure that's that's neither here
nor there uh but he he seems to be the

3608
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:46,880
nor there uh but he he seems to be the
 

3609
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,630
nor there uh but he he seems to be the
one more responsible for the ideas

3610
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:48,640
one more responsible for the ideas
 

3611
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,789
one more responsible for the ideas
behind bitcoin than anyone else

3612
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
behind bitcoin than anyone else
 

3613
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,870
behind bitcoin than anyone else
so it's not perhaps like singular

3614
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
so it's not perhaps like singular
 

3615
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,190
so it's not perhaps like singular
figures aren't even as important as the

3616
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
figures aren't even as important as the
 

3617
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,870
figures aren't even as important as the
the figures involved in the evolution of

3618
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880
the figures involved in the evolution of
 

3619
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,430
the figures involved in the evolution of
ideas that led to a thing so yeah yeah

3620
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
ideas that led to a thing so yeah yeah
 

3621
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,630
ideas that led to a thing so yeah yeah
it's you know and most perhaps it's sad

3622
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:02,640
it's you know and most perhaps it's sad
 

3623
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,950
it's you know and most perhaps it's sad

uh i think that's where we first like

01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:58,240
uh i think that's where we first like
 

3673
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,750
uh i think that's where we first like
connected really with the autopilot

3674
01:02:59,750 --> 01:02:59,760
connected really with the autopilot
 

3675
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,750
connected really with the autopilot
stuff autonomy and

3676
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
stuff autonomy and
 

3677
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,069
stuff autonomy and
the whole journey was incredible to me

3678
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
the whole journey was incredible to me
 

3679
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,109
the whole journey was incredible to me
to watch

01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
to watch
 

3681
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,510
to watch
i was um

3682
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:07,520
i was um
 

3683
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,589
i was um
because i knew well part of as i was at

3684
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
because i knew well part of as i was at
 

3685
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,910
because i knew well part of as i was at
mit and i i knew the difficulty of

3686
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
mit and i i knew the difficulty of
 

3687
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,750
mit and i i knew the difficulty of
computer vision yeah and i knew the

3688
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:13,760
computer vision yeah and i knew the
 

3689
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,270
computer vision yeah and i knew the
whole i had a lot of colleagues and

3690
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:15,280
whole i had a lot of colleagues and
 

3691
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,870
whole i had a lot of colleagues and
friends about the darpa challenge i knew

3692
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:16,880
friends about the darpa challenge i knew
 

3693
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,870
friends about the darpa challenge i knew
how difficult it is and so there was a

3694
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:18,880
how difficult it is and so there was a
 

3695
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,349
how difficult it is and so there was a
natural skepticism when i first drove a

3696
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
natural skepticism when i first drove a
 

3697
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,829
natural skepticism when i first drove a

01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
tesla with uh the initial system based
 

3699
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,750
tesla with uh the initial system based
on mobile eye yeah i thought there's no

3700
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:25,760
on mobile eye yeah i thought there's no
 

3701
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,349
on mobile eye yeah i thought there's no
way

3702
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:27,359
way
 

3703
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,430
way
the first one i got in i thought there's

3704
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:29,440
the first one i got in i thought there's
 

3705
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,390
the first one i got in i thought there's
no way this car could maintain

3706
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,400
no way this car could maintain
 

3707
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,390
no way this car could maintain
um like stay in the lane and create a

3708
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
um like stay in the lane and create a
 

3709
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,789
um like stay in the lane and create a
comfortable experience so my intuition

3710
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:36,799
comfortable experience so my intuition
 

3711
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,950
comfortable experience so my intuition
initially was that the lane keeping

3712
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:38,960
initially was that the lane keeping
 

3713
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,589
initially was that the lane keeping
problem is way too difficult to solve

3714
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
problem is way too difficult to solve
 

3715
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,829
problem is way too difficult to solve
oh thank you yeah that's relatively easy

3716
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:43,839
oh thank you yeah that's relatively easy
 

3717
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,950
oh thank you yeah that's relatively easy
well yeah but like uh but not this but

3718
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
well yeah but like uh but not this but
 

3719
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,710
well yeah but like uh but not this but
solve in the way that we just we talked

3720
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:48,720
solve in the way that we just we talked
 

3721
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,789
solve in the way that we just we talked
about previous is prototype

3722
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
about previous is prototype

a lot of code around the mobile eye

3730
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:01,359
a lot of code around the mobile eye
 

3731
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,230
a lot of code around the mobile eye
thing it doesn't just work by itself yes

3732
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,240
thing it doesn't just work by itself yes
 

3733
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,829
thing it doesn't just work by itself yes
i mean there's part that's part of the

3734
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
i mean there's part that's part of the
 

3735
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,430
i mean there's part that's part of the
story of how you approach things

3736
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:07,440
story of how you approach things
 

3737
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,789
story of how you approach things
sometimes sometimes you do things from

3738
01:04:08,789 --> 01:04:08,799
sometimes sometimes you do things from
 

3739
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:11,190
sometimes sometimes you do things from
scratch sometimes at first you kind of

3740
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:11,200
scratch sometimes at first you kind of
 

3741
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,109
scratch sometimes at first you kind of
see what's out there and then you decide

3742
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:13,119
see what's out there and then you decide
 

3743
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,109
see what's out there and then you decide
to from scratch that was

3744
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:15,119
to from scratch that was
 

3745
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,029
to from scratch that was
one of the boldest decisions i've seen

3746
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
one of the boldest decisions i've seen
 

3747
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,710
one of the boldest decisions i've seen
is both on the hardware and the software

3748
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
is both on the hardware and the software
 

3749
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,870
is both on the hardware and the software
to decide to eventually go from scratch

3750
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
to decide to eventually go from scratch
 

3751
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,870
to decide to eventually go from scratch
i thought again i was skeptical whether

3752
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:22,880
i thought again i was skeptical whether
 

3753
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,309
i thought again i was skeptical whether
that's going to be able to work out

3754
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:24,319
that's going to be able to work out
 

3755
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,829
that's going to be able to work out
because it's such a such a difficult

3756
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:25,839
because it's such a such a difficult
 

3757
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:26,789
because it's such a such a difficult
problem

3758
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:26,799
problem
 

3759
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,950
problem
and so it was an incredible journey what

3760
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:28,960
and so it was an incredible journey what
 

3761
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,950
and so it was an incredible journey what
i see now with um

3762
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:30,960
i see now with um
 

3763
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,470
i see now with um

01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:53,680
uh you know versus the image net model
 

3787
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,349
uh you know versus the image net model
of computer vision like what's in

3788
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:55,359
of computer vision like what's in
 

3789
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,789
of computer vision like what's in
academia is like real world artificial

3790
01:04:58,789 --> 01:04:58,799
academia is like real world artificial
 

3791
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,710
academia is like real world artificial
intelligence so

3792
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:00,720
intelligence so
 

3793
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,670
intelligence so
um

3794
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:01,680
um
 

3795
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,589
um
andrei's awesome and obviously plays an

3796
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:03,599
andrei's awesome and obviously plays an
 

3797
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,349
andrei's awesome and obviously plays an
important role but we have

3798
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:05,359
important role but we have
 

3799
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,190
important role but we have
a lot of really talented people driving

3800
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,200
a lot of really talented people driving
 

3801
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,710
a lot of really talented people driving
things so

3802
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:08,720
things so
 

3803
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,510
things so
um and uh ashok is actually the head of

3804
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,520
um and uh ashok is actually the head of
 

3805
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,670
um and uh ashok is actually the head of
autopilot engineering um

3806
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:13,680
autopilot engineering um
 

3807
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,630
autopilot engineering um
uh

3808
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:14,640
uh
 

3809
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,950
uh
andre is the director of ai ai stuff

3810
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:16,960
andre is the director of ai ai stuff
 

3811
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,270
andre is the director of ai ai stuff
yeah yeah so yeah there's i'm aware that

3812
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,280
yeah yeah so yeah there's i'm aware that
 

3813
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,510
yeah yeah so yeah there's i'm aware that
there's an incredible team of just a lot

3814
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:21,520
there's an incredible team of just a lot
 

3815
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,589
there's an incredible team of just a lot
going on yeah just uh you know as people

3816
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:23,599
going on yeah just uh you know as people
 

3817
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,430
going on yeah just uh you know as people
people will give off will give me too

3818
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:25,440
people will give off will give me too
 

3819
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,710
people will give off will give me too
much credit and they'll give andre too

3820
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:26,720
much credit and they'll give andre too
 

3821
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,549
much credit and they'll give andre too
much credit so

3822
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
much credit so
 

3823
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,950
much credit so
and people should realize how much is

3824
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
and people should realize how much is
 

3825
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,190
and people should realize how much is
going on under the yeah it's just a lot

3826
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,200
going on under the yeah it's just a lot
 

3827
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,390
going on under the yeah it's just a lot
of really talented people um

3828
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:36,400
of really talented people um
 

3829
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,349
of really talented people um
the tesla autopilot ai team is extremely

3830
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:39,359
the tesla autopilot ai team is extremely
 

3831
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:40,870
the tesla autopilot ai team is extremely
talented it's like

3832
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
talented it's like
 

3833
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,510
talented it's like
some of the smartest people in the world

3834
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
some of the smartest people in the world
 

3835
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,109
some of the smartest people in the world
so yeah we're getting it done

3836
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
so yeah we're getting it done
 

3837
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,510
so yeah we're getting it done
what are some insights you've gained

3838
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
what are some insights you've gained
 

3839
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,109
what are some insights you've gained
over those

3840
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
over those
 

3841
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,150
over those
five six years of autopilot about the

3842
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,160
five six years of autopilot about the
 

3843
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,950
five six years of autopilot about the
problem of autonomous driving so

3844
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:54,960
problem of autonomous driving so
 

3845
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,789
problem of autonomous driving so
you leaped in

3846
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
you leaped in
 

3847
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,109
you leaped in
having some sort of first principles

3848
01:05:59,109 --> 01:05:59,119
having some sort of first principles
 

3849
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,150
having some sort of first principles
kinds of intuitions but nobody knows

3850
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
kinds of intuitions but nobody knows
 

3851
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:02,829
kinds of intuitions but nobody knows
how

3852
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:02,839
how
 

3853
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,190
how
difficult the problem yeah like

3854
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,200
difficult the problem yeah like
 

3855
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,549
difficult the problem yeah like
i thought the self-driving problem would

3856
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:06,559
i thought the self-driving problem would
 

3857
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,309
i thought the self-driving problem would
be hard but it's it was harder than i

3858
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:08,319
be hard but it's it was harder than i
 

3859
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:09,589
be hard but it's it was harder than i
thought it's not like i thought it'd be

3860
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:09,599
thought it's not like i thought it'd be
 

3861
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:10,870
thought it's not like i thought it'd be
easy i thought it'd be very hard but it

3862
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:10,880
easy i thought it'd be very hard but it
 

3863
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,589
easy i thought it'd be very hard but it
was

3864
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:11,599
was
 

3865
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,069
was
actually way harder than than even that

3866
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:14,079
actually way harder than than even that
 

3867
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,430
actually way harder than than even that
so

3868
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:15,440
so
 

3869
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,630
so
i mean what it comes down to at the end

3870
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:16,640
i mean what it comes down to at the end
 

3871
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,029
i mean what it comes down to at the end
of the day is to solve self-driving

3872
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:19,039
of the day is to solve self-driving
 

3873
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,430
of the day is to solve self-driving
uh you have to solve

3874
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
uh you have to solve
 

3875
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,630
uh you have to solve
uh

3876
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:22,640
uh
 

3877
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,630
uh
you you basically

3878
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:24,640
you you basically
 

3879
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,549
you you basically
need to recreate

3880
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
need to recreate
 

3881
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,549
need to recreate
um what you what humans do to drive

3882
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:28,559
um what you what humans do to drive
 

3883
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,470
um what you what humans do to drive
which is humans drive with

3884
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,480
which is humans drive with
 

3885
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,950
which is humans drive with
optical sensors eyes and biological

3886
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
optical sensors eyes and biological
 

3887
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,230
optical sensors eyes and biological
neural nets

3888
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
neural nets
 

3889
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,710
neural nets
um and so in order to that that's how

3890
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
um and so in order to that that's how
 

3891
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,549
um and so in order to that that's how
the entire road system is designed to

3892
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:38,559
the entire road system is designed to
 

3893
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,789
the entire road system is designed to
work with with uh

3894
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:40,799
work with with uh
 

3895
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,710
work with with uh
basically passive optical

3896
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:42,720
basically passive optical
 

3897
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,230
basically passive optical
and neural nets

3898
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240
and neural nets
 

3899
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,029
and neural nets
um

3900
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:45,039
um
 

3901
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,789
um
it biologically um and now that we need

3902
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
it biologically um and now that we need
 

3903
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,109
it biologically um and now that we need
to it so for actually for full-size

3904
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:49,119
to it so for actually for full-size
 

3905
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,870
to it so for actually for full-size
driving to work we have to recreate that

3906
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:50,880
driving to work we have to recreate that
 

3907
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,470
driving to work we have to recreate that
in digital form

3908
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
in digital form
 

3909
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,910
in digital form
um so we have to

3910
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:53,920
um so we have to
 

3911
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,390
um so we have to
um that that means cameras with uh

3912
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
um that that means cameras with uh
 

3913
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,390
um that that means cameras with uh
advanced uh

3914
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
advanced uh
 

3915
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,950
advanced uh
neural nets in silicon form

3916
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:02,960
neural nets in silicon form
 

3917
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,990
neural nets in silicon form
uh

3918
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:04,000
uh
 

3919
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,309
uh
and and then you it will obviously solve

3920
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:06,319
and and then you it will obviously solve
 

3921
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,470
and and then you it will obviously solve
for full self-driving that's the only

3922
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:08,480
for full self-driving that's the only
 

3923
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,069
for full self-driving that's the only
way i don't think there's any other way

3924
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
way i don't think there's any other way
 

3925
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,990
way i don't think there's any other way
but the question is what aspects of

3926
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,000
but the question is what aspects of
 

3927
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,069
but the question is what aspects of
human nature do you have to encode into

3928
01:07:14,069 --> 01:07:14,079
human nature do you have to encode into
 

3929
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,990
human nature do you have to encode into
the machine right so you have to solve

3930
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,000
the machine right so you have to solve
 

3931
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,710
the machine right so you have to solve
the perception problem like detect

3932
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
the perception problem like detect
 

3933
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,910
the perception problem like detect
and then you first

3934
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
and then you first
 

3935
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,190
and then you first
well realize

3936
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:21,200
well realize
 

3937
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,630
well realize
what is the perception problem for

3938
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:22,640
what is the perception problem for
 

3939
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,150
what is the perception problem for
driving like all the kinds of things you

3940
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
driving like all the kinds of things you
 

3941
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,069
driving like all the kinds of things you
have to be able to see like what what do

3942
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
have to be able to see like what what do
 

3943
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,470
have to be able to see like what what do
we even look at when we drive there's uh

3944
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:28,480
we even look at when we drive there's uh
 

3945
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,150
we even look at when we drive there's uh
i just recently

3946
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:30,160
i just recently
 

3947
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,710
i just recently
heard andre talked about at mit about

3948
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:32,720
heard andre talked about at mit about
 

3949
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,390
heard andre talked about at mit about
like car doors i think it was the

3950
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:34,400
like car doors i think it was the
 

3951
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,230
like car doors i think it was the
world's greatest talk of all time about

3952
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,240
world's greatest talk of all time about
 

3953
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,349
world's greatest talk of all time about
car doors yeah um the the you know the

3954
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
car doors yeah um the the you know the
 

3955
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,829
car doors yeah um the the you know the
fine details of car doors like what what

3956
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:41,839
fine details of car doors like what what
 

3957
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:44,309
fine details of car doors like what what
is even an open car door man

3958
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:44,319
is even an open car door man
 

3959
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,950
is even an open car door man
so like the the ontology of that that's

3960
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:46,960
so like the the ontology of that that's
 

3961
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,630
so like the the ontology of that that's
the perception problem we humans solve

3962
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:48,640
the perception problem we humans solve
 

3963
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,549
the perception problem we humans solve
that perception problem and tesla has to

3964
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
that perception problem and tesla has to
 

3965
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,150
that perception problem and tesla has to
solve that problem and then there's the

3966
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:52,160
solve that problem and then there's the
 

3967
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,750
solve that problem and then there's the
control and the planning coupled with

3968
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:53,760
control and the planning coupled with
 

3969
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,510
control and the planning coupled with
the perception you have to figure out

3970
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:55,520
the perception you have to figure out
 

3971
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,630
the perception you have to figure out
like

3972
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,640
like
 

3973
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,630
like
what's involved in driving like

3974
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:58,640
what's involved in driving like
 

3975
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,069
what's involved in driving like
especially in all the different edge

3976
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
especially in all the different edge
 

3977
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,230
especially in all the different edge
cases

3978
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:02,240
cases
 

3979
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,230
cases
and and then i mean

3980
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:04,240
and and then i mean
 

3981
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,470
and and then i mean
maybe you can comment on this

3982
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:06,480
maybe you can comment on this
 

3983
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,029
maybe you can comment on this
how much game theoretic kind of stuff

3984
01:08:09,029 --> 01:08:09,039
how much game theoretic kind of stuff
 

3985
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,470
how much game theoretic kind of stuff
needs to be involved

3986
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,480
needs to be involved
 

3987
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,109
needs to be involved
you know at a four-way stop sign

3988
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
you know at a four-way stop sign

autonomous driving if you

3996
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:23,359
autonomous driving if you
 

3997
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,430
autonomous driving if you
you're usually just responding

3998
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,440
you're usually just responding
 

3999
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,550
you're usually just responding
um to the scene as opposed to like

4000
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
um to the scene as opposed to like
 

4001
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,030
um to the scene as opposed to like
really um asserting yourself in the

01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,040
really um asserting yourself in the
 

4003
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,950
really um asserting yourself in the
scene do you think

4004
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:32,960
scene do you think
 

4005
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,630
scene do you think
i think these actually i think i think

4006
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:34,640
i think these actually i think i think
 

4007
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,829
i think these actually i think i think
these could these sort of control

4008
01:08:35,829 --> 01:08:35,839
these could these sort of control
 

4009
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,390
these could these sort of control
control logic conundrums are not are not

the hard part

4012
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:39,600
the hard part
 

4013
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,630
the hard part
um

4014
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
um
 

4015
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,829
um
the

4016
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
the
 

4017
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:42,709
the
you know

4018
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:42,719
you know
 

4019
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,349
you know
let's see um

4020
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:45,359
let's see um
 

4021
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,950
let's see um
what do you think is the hard part in

4022
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:46,960
what do you think is the hard part in
 

4023
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,229
what do you think is the hard part in
this whole

4024
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
this whole
 

4025
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:50,950
this whole
um beautiful complex problem so it's a

4026
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
um beautiful complex problem so it's a
 

4027
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,870
um beautiful complex problem so it's a
lot of freaking software man

4028
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:52,880
lot of freaking software man
 

4029
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,189
lot of freaking software man
a lot of smart lines of code um

4030
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:57,199

 

4031
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,910

for sure in order to have

4032
01:08:59,910 --> 01:08:59,920
for sure in order to have
 

4033
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,349
for sure in order to have
um

4034
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:01,359
um
 

4035
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,910
um
create an accurate vector space

4036
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:03,920
create an accurate vector space
 

4037
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,189
create an accurate vector space
so

4038
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:05,199
so
 

4039
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:06,550
so
like you

4040
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:06,560
like you
 

4041
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,470
like you
you're coming from image space which is

4042
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,480
you're coming from image space which is
 

4043
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,950
you're coming from image space which is
like this this flow of

4044
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:10,960
like this this flow of
 

4045
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,749
like this this flow of
um photons you're going to camera

4046
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:13,759
um photons you're going to camera
 

4047
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,149
um photons you're going to camera
cameras and

4048
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,159
cameras and
 

4049
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,669
cameras and
and then uh

4050
01:09:17,669 --> 01:09:17,679
and then uh
 

4051
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,390
and then uh
so you have this massive bitstream

4052
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:20,400
so you have this massive bitstream
 

4053
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,269
so you have this massive bitstream
um

4054
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
um
 

4055
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,070
um
in

4056
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:22,080
in
 

4057
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,189
in
image space and then you have to

4058
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:25,199
image space and then you have to
 

4059
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:29,430
image space and then you have to
effectively compress uh the

4060
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:29,440

 

4061
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,789

a massive

4062
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:30,799
a massive
 

4063
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,829
a massive
bit stream

4064
01:09:32,829 --> 01:09:32,839
bit stream
 

4065
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,070
bit stream
uh corresponding to

4066
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:36,080
uh corresponding to
 

4067
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,669
uh corresponding to
photons that

4068
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:37,679
photons that
 

4069
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,749
photons that
knocked off an electron in a camera

4070
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:39,759
knocked off an electron in a camera
 

4071
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,030
knocked off an electron in a camera

4072
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,040
sensor
 

4073
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,829
sensor
uh and and turn that put stream into

4074
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
uh and and turn that put stream into
 

4075
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:47,110
uh and and turn that put stream into
into vector space um

4076
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,120
into vector space um
 

4077
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,749
into vector space um
i by by vector space i mean like

4078
01:09:49,749 --> 01:09:49,759
i by by vector space i mean like
 

4079
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,510
i by by vector space i mean like
uh

4080
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:51,520
uh
 

4081
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,030
uh
you know you've got

4082
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
you know you've got
 

4083
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,390
you know you've got
cars and and humans and uh

4084
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:56,400
cars and and humans and uh
 

4085
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,430

uh
 

4089
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,790
uh
traffic lights and that kind of thing

4090
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
traffic lights and that kind of thing
 

4091
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,990
traffic lights and that kind of thing
um

4092
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
um
 

4093
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,790
um
once you uh have an accurate vector

4094
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,800
once you uh have an accurate vector
 

4095
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,310
once you uh have an accurate vector
space um the control problem is similar

4096
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,320
space um the control problem is similar
 

4097
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,229
space um the control problem is similar
to that of a video game like a grand

4098
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:12,239
to that of a video game like a grand
 

4099
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,630
to that of a video game like a grand
theft auto cyberpunk um if you have

4100
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
theft auto cyberpunk um if you have
 

4101
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,390
theft auto cyberpunk um if you have
accurate best vector space it's the

4102
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:16,400
accurate best vector space it's the
 

4103
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,149
accurate best vector space it's the
control problem is

01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:18,159
control problem is
 

4105
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:19,590
control problem is
it's i wouldn't say it's it's trouble

4106
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:19,600
it's i wouldn't say it's it's trouble
 

4107
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,630
it's i wouldn't say it's it's trouble
it's not trivial but it's um

4108
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:22,640
it's not trivial but it's um
 

4109
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,270
it's not trivial but it's um
like it's it's it's it's a it's not like

01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:28,880
insurmountable thing it's a it's but
 

4115
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,870
insurmountable thing it's a it's but
having accurate vector space

4116
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:30,880
having accurate vector space
 

4117
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,110
having accurate vector space
is very difficult yeah i think we humans

4118
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
is very difficult yeah i think we humans
 

4119
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,310
is very difficult yeah i think we humans
uh

4120
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
uh
 

4121
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,669
uh
don't give enough respect to how

4122
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:35,679
don't give enough respect to how
 

4123
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,270
don't give enough respect to how
incredible the human perception system

4124
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:37,280
incredible the human perception system
 

4125
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,709
incredible the human perception system
is to mapping the raw

4126
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:40,719
is to mapping the raw
 

4127
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,310
is to mapping the raw
photons to the vector space

4128
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:42,320
photons to the vector space
 

4129
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,470
photons to the vector space
representation in our heads

4130
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:44,480
representation in our heads
 

4131
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,070

your brain is doing an incredible amount

4132
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,080
your brain is doing an incredible amount
 

4133
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,149
your brain is doing an incredible amount
of processing um

4134
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:48,159
of processing um
 

4135
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,149
of processing um
and and giving you an image that is a

4136
01:10:50,149 --> 01:10:50,159
and and giving you an image that is a
 

4137
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,830
and and giving you an image that is a
very cleaned up image like when we look

4138
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
very cleaned up image like when we look
 

4139
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,390
very cleaned up image like when we look
around here we see like you see color in

4140
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:54,400
around here we see like you see color in
 

4141
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,910
around here we see like you see color in
the corners of your eyes but actually

4142
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:55,920
the corners of your eyes but actually
 

4143
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,790
the corners of your eyes but actually
your eyes have very few uh

4144
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:58,800
your eyes have very few uh
 

4145
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,950
your eyes have very few uh
cones like the cone receptors in the

4146
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:00,960
cones like the cone receptors in the
 

4147
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,430
cones like the cone receptors in the
peripheral vision your your eyes are

4148
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
peripheral vision your your eyes are
 

4149
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,510
peripheral vision your your eyes are
painting color in the peripheral vision

4150
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:05,520
painting color in the peripheral vision
 

4151
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,350
painting color in the peripheral vision
you don't realize it but their eyes are

4152
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:07,360
you don't realize it but their eyes are
 

4153
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,149
you don't realize it but their eyes are
actually

4154
01:11:08,149 --> 01:11:08,159
actually
 

4155
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,990
actually
painting color and

4156
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:10,000
painting color and
 

4157
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,669
painting color and
your eyes also have like this blood

4158
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
your eyes also have like this blood
 

4159
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,350
your eyes also have like this blood
vessels and all sorts of gnarly things

4160
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:13,360
vessels and all sorts of gnarly things
 

4161
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,030
vessels and all sorts of gnarly things
and there's a blind spot but do you see

4162
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:15,040
and there's a blind spot but do you see
 

4163
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,590
and there's a blind spot but do you see
your blind spot no your

4164
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
your blind spot no your
 

4165
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,910
your blind spot no your
your brain is painting in the missing

4166
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:19,920
your brain is painting in the missing
 

4167
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,830
your brain is painting in the missing
the blind spot you're gonna do these

4168
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:21,840
the blind spot you're gonna do these
 

4169
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,709
the blind spot you're gonna do these
like

4170
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:22,719
like
 

4171
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,229
like
see these things online where you look

4172
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:24,239
see these things online where you look
 

4173
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,229
see these things online where you look
look here and look at this point and and

4174
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
look here and look at this point and and
 

4175
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,470
look here and look at this point and and
then look at this point and it's

4176
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:28,480
then look at this point and it's
 

4177
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,030
then look at this point and it's
if it's in your blind spot it your brain

4178
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:31,040
if it's in your blind spot it your brain
 

4179
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,470
if it's in your blind spot it your brain
will just fill in the

4180
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:32,480
will just fill in the
 

4181
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,510
will just fill in the
the missing version

4182
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:33,520
the missing version
 

4183
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,510
the missing version
the peripheral vision is so cool yes you

4184
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
the peripheral vision is so cool yes you
 

4185
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,510
the peripheral vision is so cool yes you
realize all the illusions for vision

4186
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
realize all the illusions for vision
 

4187
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,430
realize all the illusions for vision
sciences so makes you realize just how

4188
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:39,440
sciences so makes you realize just how
 

4189
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,790
sciences so makes you realize just how
incredible the brain is the brain is

4190
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
incredible the brain is the brain is
 

4191
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,709
incredible the brain is the brain is
doing crazy amount of post-processing on

4192
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
doing crazy amount of post-processing on
 

4193
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,110
doing crazy amount of post-processing on
the vision signals from your eyes

4194
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
the vision signals from your eyes
 

4195
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,510
the vision signals from your eyes
um it's insane

4196
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
um it's insane
 

4197
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,229
um it's insane
so

4198
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
so
 

4199
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,030
so
um

4200
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
um
 

4201
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,790
um
and then and then even once you get all

4202
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,800
and then and then even once you get all
 

4203
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,189
and then and then even once you get all
those vision signals uh your

4204
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:53,199
those vision signals uh your
 

4205
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:55,110
those vision signals uh your
your brain is constantly trying to fig

4206
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,120
your brain is constantly trying to fig
 

4207
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,990
your brain is constantly trying to fig
to forget as much as possible so human

4208
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,000
to forget as much as possible so human
 

4209
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,350
to forget as much as possible so human
memory is

4210
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
memory is
 

4211
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,470
memory is
perhaps the weakest thing about the

4212
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:00,480
perhaps the weakest thing about the
 

4213
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,830
perhaps the weakest thing about the
brain is memory

4214
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,840
brain is memory
 

4215
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,830
brain is memory
so because memory is

4216
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:03,840
so because memory is
 

4217
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,470
so because memory is
so expensive to a brain and so limited

4218
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,480
so expensive to a brain and so limited
 

4219
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,630
so expensive to a brain and so limited
your brain is trying to forget as much

4220
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:08,640
your brain is trying to forget as much
 

4221
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,950
your brain is trying to forget as much
as possible and distill

4222
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:10,960
as possible and distill
 

4223
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,110
as possible and distill
the things that you see into

4224
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,120
the things that you see into
 

4225
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,590
the things that you see into
uh the smallest smallest amounts of

4226
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:15,600
uh the smallest smallest amounts of
 

4227
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,189
uh the smallest smallest amounts of
information possible so your brain is

4228
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
information possible so your brain is
 

4229
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,270
information possible so your brain is
trying to not just get to a vector space

4230
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:19,280
trying to not just get to a vector space
 

4231
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,830
trying to not just get to a vector space
but get to a vector space that is the

4232
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:21,840
but get to a vector space that is the
 

4233
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,910
but get to a vector space that is the
smallest possible vector space of only

4234
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:23,920
smallest possible vector space of only
 

4235
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,669
smallest possible vector space of only
relevant objects

4236
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
relevant objects
 

4237
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:26,470
relevant objects
um

4238
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:26,480
um
 

4239
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,310
um
and i think like

4240
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
and i think like
 

4241
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,750
and i think like
you can sort of look inside your brain

4242
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
you can sort of look inside your brain
 

4243
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,709
you can sort of look inside your brain
or at least

4244
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:30,719
or at least
 

4245
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,030
or at least
i can like when you drive down the road

4246
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
i can like when you drive down the road
 

4247
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,870
i can like when you drive down the road
and and try to

4248
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:34,880
and and try to
 

4249
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,470
and and try to
think about what your brain is actually

4250
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,480
think about what your brain is actually
 

4251
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,350
think about what your brain is actually
doing

4252
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,360
doing
 

4253
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,790
doing
consciously

4254
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
consciously
 

4255
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,630
consciously
and it's conscious it's it's

4256
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640
and it's conscious it's it's
 

4257
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,669
and it's conscious it's it's
it's

4258
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:41,679
it's
 

4259
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:42,630
it's
it's like

4260
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:42,640
it's like
 

4261
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,470
it's like
you'll see a car that's you could

4262
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:44,480
you'll see a car that's you could
 

4263
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,550
you'll see a car that's you could
because you're you don't have cameras

4264
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:46,560
because you're you don't have cameras
 

4265
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,830
because you're you don't have cameras
you i don't have eyes in the back your

4266
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:47,840
you i don't have eyes in the back your
 

4267
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,189
you i don't have eyes in the back your
head on the side you know so you say

4268
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199
head on the side you know so you say
 

4269
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,990
head on the side you know so you say
like but you you basically your your

4270
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:52,000
like but you you basically your your
 

4271
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,350
like but you you basically your your
head is like a

4272
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:53,360
head is like a
 

4273
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,270
head is like a
you know you basically have like

4274
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:55,280
you know you basically have like
 

4275
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,189
you know you basically have like
two cameras on a slow gimbal

4276
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:57,199
two cameras on a slow gimbal
 

4277
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,229
two cameras on a slow gimbal
um

4278
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:58,239
um
 

4279
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,310
um
and and what's your

4280
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,320
and and what's your
 

4281
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,990
and and what's your
and i say it's not that great okay you

4282
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,000
and i say it's not that great okay you
 

4283
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,550
and i say it's not that great okay you
and i is uh you know like um and people

4284
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
and i is uh you know like um and people
 

4285
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,910
and i is uh you know like um and people
are constantly distracted and thinking

4286
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:05,920
are constantly distracted and thinking
 

4287
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,910
are constantly distracted and thinking
about things and texting and doing all

4288
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:07,920
about things and texting and doing all
 

4289
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,870
about things and texting and doing all
sorts of things they shouldn't do in a

4290
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:08,880
sorts of things they shouldn't do in a
 

4291
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,870
sorts of things they shouldn't do in a
car changing radio station

4292
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:10,880
car changing radio station
 

4293
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,709
car changing radio station
so

4294
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
so
 

4295
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,149
so
having arguments you know is like um

4296
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:16,159
having arguments you know is like um
 

4297
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:16,870
having arguments you know is like um
so

4298
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:16,880
so
 

4299
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,990
so
so then like say like like

4300
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,000
so then like say like like
 

4301
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,870
so then like say like like
uh

4302
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:20,880
uh
 

4303
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,310
uh
like when's the last time you look right

4304
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:22,320
like when's the last time you look right
 

4305
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,189
like when's the last time you look right
and left and you know or and rearward um

4306
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:25,199
and left and you know or and rearward um
 

4307
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,870
and left and you know or and rearward um
or even diagonally

4308
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
or even diagonally
 

4309
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,310
or even diagonally
you know forward

4310
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,320
you know forward
 

4311
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,030
you know forward
to actually refresh your vector space

4312
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:31,040
to actually refresh your vector space
 

4313
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,950
to actually refresh your vector space
so you're glancing around and what your

4314
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:32,960
so you're glancing around and what your
 

4315
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,750
so you're glancing around and what your
mind is doing is is is trying to distill

4316
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:35,760
mind is doing is is is trying to distill
 

4317
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,550
mind is doing is is is trying to distill
um

4318
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
um
 

4319
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,270
um
the relevant vectors basically objects

4320
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:39,280
the relevant vectors basically objects
 

4321
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,350
the relevant vectors basically objects
with a position and motion

4322
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:41,360
with a position and motion
 

4323
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,790
with a position and motion
uh

4324
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:42,800
uh
 

4325
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,910
uh
and

4326
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:43,920
and
 

4327
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,870
and
and and and then uh editing that down to

4328
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880
and and and then uh editing that down to
 

4329
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,790
and and and then uh editing that down to
the least amount that's necessary for

4330
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:48,800
the least amount that's necessary for
 

4331
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,830
the least amount that's necessary for
you to drive it does seem to be able to

4332
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:51,840
you to drive it does seem to be able to
 

4333
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,149
you to drive it does seem to be able to
uh edit it down or compress it even

4334
01:13:54,149 --> 01:13:54,159
uh edit it down or compress it even
 

4335
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,750
uh edit it down or compress it even
further into things like concepts so

4336
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:55,760
further into things like concepts so
 

4337
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,590
further into things like concepts so
it's not it's like it goes beyond the

4338
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:57,600
it's not it's like it goes beyond the
 

4339
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,830
it's not it's like it goes beyond the
human mind seems to go sometimes beyond

4340
01:13:59,830 --> 01:13:59,840
human mind seems to go sometimes beyond
 

4341
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,110
human mind seems to go sometimes beyond
vector space

4342
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:01,120
vector space
 

4343
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,830
vector space
to sort of space of concepts to where

4344
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:03,840
to sort of space of concepts to where
 

4345
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,669
to sort of space of concepts to where
you'll see a thing it's no longer

4346
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:05,679
you'll see a thing it's no longer
 

4347
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,430
you'll see a thing it's no longer
represented spatially somehow it's

4348
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:07,440
represented spatially somehow it's
 

4349
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,030
represented spatially somehow it's
almost like a concept that you should be

4350
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,040
almost like a concept that you should be
 

4351
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,149
almost like a concept that you should be
aware of like if this is a school zone

4352
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
aware of like if this is a school zone
 

4353
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,950
aware of like if this is a school zone
you'll remember that as a concept which

4354
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:14,960
you'll remember that as a concept which
 

4355
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,390
you'll remember that as a concept which
is a weird thing to represent but

4356
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
is a weird thing to represent but
 

4357
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,870
is a weird thing to represent but
perhaps for driving you don't

4358
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
perhaps for driving you don't
 

4359
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,390
perhaps for driving you don't
need to fully represent those things or

4360
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
need to fully represent those things or
 

4361
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,310
need to fully represent those things or
maybe you get those kind of

4362
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:22,320
maybe you get those kind of
 

4363
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,229
maybe you get those kind of
um

4364
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
um
 

4365
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,630
um
well you indirectly you need to like

4366
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:26,640
well you indirectly you need to like
 

4367
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,270
well you indirectly you need to like
establish vector space and then

4368
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:29,280
establish vector space and then
 

4369
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,390
establish vector space and then
actually have

4370
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:30,400
actually have
 

4371
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,390
actually have
predictions for

4372
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400
predictions for
 

4373
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,590
predictions for
uh that those vector spaces so like um

4374
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
uh that those vector spaces so like um
 

4375
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,310
uh that those vector spaces so like um
you know like if uh

4376
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,320
you know like if uh
 

4377
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,070
you know like if uh
you know like you drive past

4378
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:40,080
you know like you drive past
 

4379
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,189
you know like you drive past
say say

4380
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:41,199
say say
 

4381
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,709
say say
a a

4382
01:14:42,709 --> 01:14:42,719
a a
 

4383
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,910
a a
a a bus and and you see that there's

4384
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
a a bus and and you see that there's
 

4385
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,270
a a bus and and you see that there's
there's people

4386
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:47,280
there's people
 

4387
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,709
there's people
before you drove past the bus you saw

4388
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:48,719
before you drove past the bus you saw
 

4389
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,229
before you drove past the bus you saw
people crossing the interstate like or

4390
01:14:50,229 --> 01:14:50,239
people crossing the interstate like or
 

4391
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,390
people crossing the interstate like or
some just imagine there's like a large

4392
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,400
some just imagine there's like a large
 

4393
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,550
some just imagine there's like a large
truck or something blocking site

4394
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:54,560
truck or something blocking site
 

4395
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,350
truck or something blocking site
um

4396
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,360
um
 

4397
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,270
um
but you before you came out to the truck

4398
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:57,280
but you before you came out to the truck
 

4399
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,270
but you before you came out to the truck
you saw that there were some kids about

4400
01:14:59,270 --> 01:14:59,280
you saw that there were some kids about
 

4401
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,550
you saw that there were some kids about
to cross the road

4402
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:00,560
to cross the road
 

4403
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,830
to cross the road
in front of the truck now you can no

4404
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
in front of the truck now you can no
 

4405
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,229
in front of the truck now you can no
longer see the kids but you you need to

4406
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
longer see the kids but you you need to
 

4407
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,149
longer see the kids but you you need to
be able but you would now know okay

4408
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:06,159
be able but you would now know okay
 

4409
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,470
be able but you would now know okay
those kids are probably gonna pass by

4410
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:08,480
those kids are probably gonna pass by
 

4411
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,390
those kids are probably gonna pass by
the truck and cross the road

4412
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:10,400
the truck and cross the road
 

4413
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,229
the truck and cross the road
even though you cannot see them so you

4414
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
even though you cannot see them so you
 

4415
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:15,110
even though you cannot see them so you
have to have um

4416
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
have to have um
 

4417
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,270
have to have um
memory uh

4418
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,280
memory uh
 

4419
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,390
memory uh
you need to remember that there were

4420
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
you need to remember that there were
 

4421
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,790
you need to remember that there were
kids there and you need to have some

4422
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:20,800
kids there and you need to have some
 

4423
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,189
kids there and you need to have some
forward prediction of what their

4424
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:23,199
forward prediction of what their
 

4425
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,950
forward prediction of what their
position will be it's a really hard time

4426
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
position will be it's a really hard time
 

4427
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,430
position will be it's a really hard time
of relevance so with occlusions

4428
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:27,440
of relevance so with occlusions
 

4429
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,270
of relevance so with occlusions
and computer vision when you can't see

4430
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:29,280
and computer vision when you can't see
 

4431
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,430
and computer vision when you can't see
an object anymore even when it just

4432
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:31,440
an object anymore even when it just
 

4433
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,510
an object anymore even when it just
walks behind a tree and reappears that's

4434
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
walks behind a tree and reappears that's
 

4435
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,870
walks behind a tree and reappears that's
a really really

01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:34,880
a really really
 

4437
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,950
a really really
i mean at least in academic literature

4438
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:36,960
i mean at least in academic literature
 

4439
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,270
i mean at least in academic literature
it's tracking through occlusions it's

4440
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
it's tracking through occlusions it's
 

4441
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,550
it's tracking through occlusions it's
very difficult

4442
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,560
very difficult
 

4443
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,750
very difficult
yeah we're doing it

4444
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:41,760
yeah we're doing it
 

4445
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,350
yeah we're doing it
i understand this yeah

4446
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:43,360
i understand this yeah
 

4447
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,110
i understand this yeah
so some of it it's like object permanent

4448
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
so some of it it's like object permanent
 

4449
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,470
so some of it it's like object permanent
it's like same thing happens with the

4450
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,480
it's like same thing happens with the
 

4451
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,709
it's like same thing happens with the
humans with neural nets like when like a

4452
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
humans with neural nets like when like a
 

4453
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:51,030
humans with neural nets like when like a
toddler grows up like there's a there's

4454
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:51,040
toddler grows up like there's a there's
 

4455
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,630
toddler grows up like there's a there's
a point in time where

4456
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
a point in time where
 

4457
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,430
a point in time where
uh

4458
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:53,440
uh
 

4459
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,430
uh
they develop they have a sense of object

4460
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:55,440
they develop they have a sense of object
 

4461
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,430
they develop they have a sense of object
permanence so before a certain age if

4462
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,440
permanence so before a certain age if
 

4463
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,790
permanence so before a certain age if
you have a ball

4464
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:58,800
you have a ball
 

4465
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,149
you have a ball
uh or a toy or whatever and you put it

4466
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:00,159
uh or a toy or whatever and you put it
 

4467
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,630
uh or a toy or whatever and you put it
behind your back and you pop it out if

4468
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
behind your back and you pop it out if
 

4469
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,990
behind your back and you pop it out if
they don't before they have object

4470
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:04,000
they don't before they have object
 

4471
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,430
they don't before they have object
permanence it's like a new thing every

4472
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:05,440
permanence it's like a new thing every
 

4473
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,590
permanence it's like a new thing every
time it's like whoa this toy went poof

4474
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:07,600
time it's like whoa this toy went poof
 

4475
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,270
time it's like whoa this toy went poof
just faired and now it's back again and

4476
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:09,280
just faired and now it's back again and
 

4477
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,390
just faired and now it's back again and
they can't believe it and that they can

4478
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:10,400
they can't believe it and that they can
 

4479
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,310
they can't believe it and that they can
play peekaboo all day long because this

4480
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
play peekaboo all day long because this
 

4481
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,660
play peekaboo all day long because this
peekaboo is fresh every time

4482
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:13,670
peekaboo is fresh every time
 

4483
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:16,070
peekaboo is fresh every time
[Laughter]

4484
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
[Laughter]
 

4485
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,070
[Laughter]
but then we figure out object permanence

4486
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:18,080
but then we figure out object permanence
 

4487
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,750
but then we figure out object permanence
then they realize oh no the object is

4488
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:19,760
then they realize oh no the object is
 

4489
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,830
then they realize oh no the object is
not gone it's just behind your back

4490
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
not gone it's just behind your back
 

4491
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,229
not gone it's just behind your back
um sometimes i wish we never did figure

4492
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:24,239
um sometimes i wish we never did figure
 

4493
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,229
um sometimes i wish we never did figure
out objective permanence

4494
01:16:26,229 --> 01:16:26,239
out objective permanence
 

4495
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,189
out objective permanence
yeah so that's uh

4496
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
yeah so that's uh
 

4497
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,590
yeah so that's uh
that's an important problem to solve

4498
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:31,600
that's an important problem to solve
 

4499
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,950
that's an important problem to solve
yes so so

4500
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:32,960
yes so so
 

4501
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,149
yes so so
like an important evolution of the

4502
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
like an important evolution of the
 

4503
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,070
like an important evolution of the
neural nets in the car is

4504
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
neural nets in the car is
 

4505
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,550
neural nets in the car is
uh

4506
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:38,560

 

4507
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,830

um

4508
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:39,840
um
 

4509
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,110
um
memory card

4510
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:41,120
memory card
 

4511
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:45,189
memory card
memory across both time and space um so

4512
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:45,199
memory across both time and space um so
 

4513
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:46,790
memory across both time and space um so
now you can't remember like you have to

4514
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:46,800
now you can't remember like you have to
 

4515
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,990
now you can't remember like you have to
say like how long do you want to

4516
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
say like how long do you want to
 

4517
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,910
say like how long do you want to
remember things for and and it's it

4518
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
remember things for and and it's it
 

4519
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,750
remember things for and and it's it
there's there's a cost to remembering

4520
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:51,760
there's there's a cost to remembering
 

4521
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,750
there's there's a cost to remembering
things for a long time so you could you

4522
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
things for a long time so you could you
 

4523
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,189
things for a long time so you could you
know like run out of

4524
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:55,199
know like run out of
 

4525
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,030
know like run out of
memory to if you try to remember too

4526
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,040
memory to if you try to remember too
 

4527
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,390
memory to if you try to remember too
much for too long

4528
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,400
much for too long
 

4529
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,470
much for too long
um and and then you also have things

4530
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
um and and then you also have things
 

4531
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,470
um and and then you also have things
that are stale if if they're

4532
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,480
that are stale if if they're
 

4533
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,910
that are stale if if they're
remember them for too long and then you

4534
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
remember them for too long and then you
 

4535
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,590
remember them for too long and then you
also need things that are

4536
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:05,600
also need things that are
 

4537
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,550
also need things that are
remembered over time so even if you

4538
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
remembered over time so even if you
 

4539
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,470
remembered over time so even if you
like say have like

4540
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:10,480
like say have like
 

4541
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,030
like say have like
fragrance like five seconds of memory uh

4542
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,040
fragrance like five seconds of memory uh
 

4543
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,510
fragrance like five seconds of memory uh
on a time basis but like let's say you

4544
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:15,520
on a time basis but like let's say you
 

4545
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,750
on a time basis but like let's say you
you're parked at light and you and you

4546
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:17,760
you're parked at light and you and you
 

4547
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,270
you're parked at light and you and you
saw

4548
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,280
saw
 

4549
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,030
saw
you use a pedestrian example that people

4550
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:21,040
you use a pedestrian example that people
 

4551
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,750
you use a pedestrian example that people
were waiting to cross the

4552
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:23,760
were waiting to cross the
 

4553
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,910
were waiting to cross the
across the road and you can't you can't

4554
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:25,920
across the road and you can't you can't
 

4555
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,910
across the road and you can't you can't
quite see them because of an occlusion

4556
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:27,920
quite see them because of an occlusion
 

4557
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,709
quite see them because of an occlusion
uh

4558
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:28,719
uh
 

4559
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,709
uh
but they might wait for a minute before

4560
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
but they might wait for a minute before
 

4561
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,470
but they might wait for a minute before
the light changes for them to cross the

4562
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,480
the light changes for them to cross the
 

4563
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,870
the light changes for them to cross the
road you still need to remember that

4564
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:34,880
road you still need to remember that
 

4565
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,790
road you still need to remember that
that that's where they were

4566
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
that that's where they were
 

4567
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,390
that that's where they were
um and that they're probably going to

4568
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:38,400
um and that they're probably going to
 

4569
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,790
um and that they're probably going to
cross the road type of thing um so even

4570
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:40,800
cross the road type of thing um so even
 

4571
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,110
cross the road type of thing um so even
if that exceeds your

4572
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:43,120
if that exceeds your
 

4573
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,950
if that exceeds your
your your time-based memory should not

4574
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:44,960
your your time-based memory should not
 

4575
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,310
your your time-based memory should not
exceed your space

4576
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,320
exceed your space
 

4577
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,990
exceed your space
memory

4578
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000
memory
 

4579
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,070
memory
and i just think the data engine side of

4580
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,080
and i just think the data engine side of
 

4581
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,790
and i just think the data engine side of
that so getting the data to learn all

4582
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
that so getting the data to learn all
 

4583
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,950
that so getting the data to learn all
the concepts that you're saying now is

4584
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960
the concepts that you're saying now is
 

4585
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,470
the concepts that you're saying now is
an incredible process it's this

4586
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:56,480
an incredible process it's this
 

4587
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,950
an incredible process it's this
iterative process of just it's this this

4588
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:58,960
iterative process of just it's this this
 

4589
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,189
iterative process of just it's this this
hydrogen at many parts

4590
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:03,199

 

4591
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,790

we're changing the name to something

4592
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:04,800
we're changing the name to something
 

4593
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,510
we're changing the name to something
else okay i'm sure it would be equally

4594
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,520
else okay i'm sure it would be equally
 

4595
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,750
else okay i'm sure it would be equally
as yeah rick and morty like there's a

4596
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
as yeah rick and morty like there's a
 

4597
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,510
as yeah rick and morty like there's a
lot of

4598
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:11,520
lot of
 

4599
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,470
lot of
we've re-architected the neural net uh

4600
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
we've re-architected the neural net uh
 

4601
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,310
we've re-architected the neural net uh
the neural nets in the cars so many

4602
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:16,320
the neural nets in the cars so many
 

4603
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,750
the neural nets in the cars so many
times it's crazy

4604
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
times it's crazy
 

4605
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,510
times it's crazy
oh so every time there's a new major

4606
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:19,520
oh so every time there's a new major
 

4607
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,110
oh so every time there's a new major
version you'll rename it to something

4608
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
version you'll rename it to something
 

4609
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,630
version you'll rename it to something
more ridiculous or

4610
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,640
more ridiculous or
 

4611
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,110
more ridiculous or
uh or memorable and beautiful sorry not

4612
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:25,120
uh or memorable and beautiful sorry not
 

4613
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,990
uh or memorable and beautiful sorry not
ridiculous of course

4614
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000

 

4615
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,550

if you see the full the full like uh

4616
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,560
if you see the full the full like uh
 

4617
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,189
if you see the full the full like uh
array of neural nets that that that are

4618
01:18:33,189 --> 01:18:33,199
array of neural nets that that that are
 

4619
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:34,790
array of neural nets that that that are
operating in the car it kind of boggles

4620
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:34,800
operating in the car it kind of boggles
 

4621
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,110
operating in the car it kind of boggles
the mind there's so there's so many

4622
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,120
the mind there's so there's so many
 

4623
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,750
the mind there's so there's so many
layers it's crazy um

4624
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
layers it's crazy um
 

4625
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,270
layers it's crazy um
so

4626
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280
so
 

4627
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,149
so
yeah

4628
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:42,159
yeah
 

4629
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:43,830
yeah
um but

4630
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
um but
 

4631
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,709
um but
and we

4632
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
and we
 

4633
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,790
and we
we started off with

4634
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:46,800
we started off with
 

4635
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,910
we started off with
uh

4636
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:47,920
uh
 

4637
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,630
uh
simple neural nets that were uh

4638
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,640
simple neural nets that were uh
 

4639
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,390
simple neural nets that were uh
basically

4640
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,400
basically
 

4641
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,870
basically
image recognition on a single frame

4642
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:54,880
image recognition on a single frame
 

4643
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,470
image recognition on a single frame
from a single camera

4644
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,480
from a single camera
 

4645
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,390
from a single camera
uh and then

4646
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400
uh and then
 

4647
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,270
uh and then
uh trying to knit those together with

4648
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
uh trying to knit those together with
 

4649
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,030
uh trying to knit those together with
it you know it with the

4650
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:03,040
it you know it with the
 

4651
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,310
it you know it with the
c

4652
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
c
 

4653
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,510
c
i should say we

4654
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:05,520
i should say we
 

4655
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,510
i should say we
we're really primarily running c here

4656
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
we're really primarily running c here
 

4657
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,189
we're really primarily running c here
because c plus plus is

4658
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:09,199
because c plus plus is
 

4659
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,550
because c plus plus is
too much overhead and we have our own c

4660
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:10,560
too much overhead and we have our own c
 

4661
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,590
too much overhead and we have our own c
compiler

4662
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:11,600
compiler
 

4663
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,590
compiler
so to get maximum performance we

4664
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
so to get maximum performance we
 

4665
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,910
so to get maximum performance we
actually wrote rotor and c compiler and

4666
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
actually wrote rotor and c compiler and
 

4667
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,189
actually wrote rotor and c compiler and
are continuing to optimize our c

4668
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
are continuing to optimize our c
 

4669
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,950
are continuing to optimize our c
compiler uh for

4670
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:18,960
compiler uh for
 

4671
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,470
compiler uh for
maximum efficiency in fact we've just

4672
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:20,480
maximum efficiency in fact we've just
 

4673
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,510
maximum efficiency in fact we've just
recently

4674
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:21,520
recently
 

4675
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,310
recently
uh done a new rev on a c compiler that

4676
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,320
uh done a new rev on a c compiler that
 

4677
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,070
uh done a new rev on a c compiler that
will compile directly to our autopilot

4678
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:26,080
will compile directly to our autopilot
 

4679
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,590
will compile directly to our autopilot
hardware so you want to compile the

4680
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:27,600
hardware so you want to compile the
 

4681
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,430
hardware so you want to compile the
whole thing down and with your own

4682
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:29,440
whole thing down and with your own
 

4683
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,470
whole thing down and with your own
compiler yeah like so efficiency here

4684
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
compiler yeah like so efficiency here
 

4685
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,750
compiler yeah like so efficiency here
because there's all kinds of compute

4686
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:33,760
because there's all kinds of compute
 

4687
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,070
because there's all kinds of compute
there's cpu gpu there's like basic types

4688
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
there's cpu gpu there's like basic types
 

4689
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,270
there's cpu gpu there's like basic types
of things

4690
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:37,280
of things
 

4691
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,470
of things
and you have to somehow figure out the

4692
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:38,480
and you have to somehow figure out the
 

4693
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,070
and you have to somehow figure out the
scheduling across all those things and

4694
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,080
scheduling across all those things and
 

4695
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,070
scheduling across all those things and
so you're compiling the code down yeah

4696
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:42,080
so you're compiling the code down yeah
 

4697
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,590
so you're compiling the code down yeah
it does all okay

4698
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,600
it does all okay
 

4699
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,669
it does all okay
this is so that's why there's a lot of

4700
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:45,679
this is so that's why there's a lot of
 

4701
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,750
this is so that's why there's a lot of
people involved

4702
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:47,760
people involved
 

4703
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,590
people involved
there's a lot of hardcore

4704
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:49,600
there's a lot of hardcore
 

4705
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,030
there's a lot of hardcore
software engineering at a very sort of

4706
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
software engineering at a very sort of
 

4707
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,270
software engineering at a very sort of
bare metal level uh because

4708
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
bare metal level uh because
 

4709
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,110
bare metal level uh because
we're trying to do a lot of compute

4710
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,120
we're trying to do a lot of compute
 

4711
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,110
we're trying to do a lot of compute
that's constrained to

4712
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
that's constrained to
 

4713
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,709
that's constrained to
the

4714
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
the
 

4715
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,950
the
you know our full self-driving computer

4716
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
you know our full self-driving computer
 

4717
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,270
you know our full self-driving computer
so and we want to try to have the

4718
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:05,280
so and we want to try to have the
 

4719
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,030
so and we want to try to have the
highest frames per second

4720
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:07,040
highest frames per second
 

4721
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,790
highest frames per second
um possible

4722
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:08,800
um possible
 

4723
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,910
um possible
um

4724
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:09,920
um
 

4725
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,550
um
within a sort of very finite amount of

4726
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:12,560
within a sort of very finite amount of
 

4727
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,470
within a sort of very finite amount of
compute um

4728
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:14,480
compute um
 

4729
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,870
compute um
and power so

4730
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:16,880
and power so
 

4731
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,070
and power so
um we really put a lot of effort into

4732
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:20,080
um we really put a lot of effort into
 

4733
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,990
um we really put a lot of effort into
the efficiency of our compute

4734
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:22,000
the efficiency of our compute
 

4735
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,590
the efficiency of our compute
um

4736
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
um
 

4737
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,350
um
and and uh so there's actually a lot of

4738
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:25,360
and and uh so there's actually a lot of
 

4739
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,350
and and uh so there's actually a lot of
work done by

4740
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,360
work done by
 

4741
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,030
work done by
some very talented software engineers at

4742
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:29,040
some very talented software engineers at
 

4743
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,470
some very talented software engineers at
tesla that

4744
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
tesla that
 

4745
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,110
tesla that
uh at a very foundational level to

4746
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:33,120
uh at a very foundational level to
 

4747
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,270
uh at a very foundational level to
improve the efficiency of compute and

4748
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:35,280
improve the efficiency of compute and
 

4749
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,270
improve the efficiency of compute and
how we use the

4750
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:37,280
how we use the
 

4751
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,189
how we use the
the trip accelerators uh which are

4752
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:39,199
the trip accelerators uh which are
 

4753
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,510
the trip accelerators uh which are
basically um

4754
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,520
basically um
 

4755
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,310
basically um
dot you know uh doing matrix math dot

4756
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:44,320
dot you know uh doing matrix math dot
 

4757
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,189
dot you know uh doing matrix math dot
products

4758
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:45,199
products
 

4759
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,110
products
like a brazilian dot products

4760
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:47,120
like a brazilian dot products
 

4761
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,510
like a brazilian dot products
and it's like what what are neural nets

4762
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:49,520
and it's like what what are neural nets
 

4763
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,550
and it's like what what are neural nets
it's like

4764
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:50,560
it's like
 

4765
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,310
it's like
compute wise like 99

4766
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:52,320
compute wise like 99
 

4767
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,229
compute wise like 99
dot products

4768
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,239
dot products
 

4769
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:55,910
dot products
so

4770
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:55,920
so
 

4771
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,870
so
you know

4772
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:56,880
you know
 

4773
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,709
you know
and you want to achieve as many

4774
01:20:58,709 --> 01:20:58,719
and you want to achieve as many
 

4775
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,550
and you want to achieve as many
high frame rates like video game you

4776
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:00,560
high frame rates like video game you
 

4777
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,750
high frame rates like video game you
want yeah full resolution

4778
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:03,760
want yeah full resolution
 

4779
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,830
want yeah full resolution
high frame rate high frame rate low

4780
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:05,840
high frame rate high frame rate low
 

4781
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,270
high frame rate high frame rate low
latency

4782
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:07,280
latency
 

4783
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,110
latency
um

4784
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120
um
 

4785
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,390
um
low jitter uh so

4786
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,400
low jitter uh so
 

4787
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,030
low jitter uh so
um

4788
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:15,040
um
 

4789
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,950
um
i think one of the things we're um

4790
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:16,960
i think one of the things we're um
 

4791
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,470
i think one of the things we're um
moving towards now is no post processing

4792
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,480
moving towards now is no post processing
 

4793
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,910
moving towards now is no post processing
of the

4794
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:21,920
of the
 

4795
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,350
of the
image through the um

4796
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:25,360
image through the um
 

4797
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,870
image through the um
the image signal processor so um

4798
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
the image signal processor so um
 

4799
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,870
the image signal processor so um
like for what happens for

4800
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:30,880
like for what happens for
 

4801
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,350
like for what happens for
cameras is that almost all cameras is

4802
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
cameras is that almost all cameras is
 

4803
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,790
cameras is that almost all cameras is
they

4804
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:34,800
they
 

4805
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,750
they
um

4806
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:35,760
um
 

4807
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,669
um
there's a lot of post processing done in

4808
01:21:37,669 --> 01:21:37,679
there's a lot of post processing done in
 

4809
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:40,310
there's a lot of post processing done in
order to make pictures look pretty

4810
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:40,320
order to make pictures look pretty
 

4811
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,669
order to make pictures look pretty
and so we don't care about pictures

4812
01:21:41,669 --> 01:21:41,679
and so we don't care about pictures
 

4813
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,149
and so we don't care about pictures
looking pretty um we we just want the

4814
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159
looking pretty um we we just want the
 

4815
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,950
looking pretty um we we just want the
data we so we're removing just raw

4816
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:46,960
data we so we're removing just raw
 

4817
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,629
data we so we're removing just raw
photon counts

4818
01:21:48,629 --> 01:21:48,639
photon counts
 

4819
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,790
photon counts
so the system will

4820
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:50,800
so the system will
 

4821
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,229
so the system will
like the

4822
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:52,239
like the
 

4823
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:53,750
like the
image that

4824
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:53,760
image that
 

4825
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,669
image that
that the computer sees is actually much

4826
01:21:55,669 --> 01:21:55,679
that the computer sees is actually much
 

4827
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,270
that the computer sees is actually much
more than what

4828
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:57,280
more than what
 

4829
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,629
more than what
you see if you're represented on a

4830
01:21:58,629 --> 01:21:58,639
you see if you're represented on a
 

4831
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,790
you see if you're represented on a
camera it's got much more data

4832
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:00,800
camera it's got much more data
 

4833
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,470
camera it's got much more data
and even in very low light conditions

4834
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:02,480
and even in very low light conditions
 

4835
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,310
and even in very low light conditions
you can see that there's a small photon

4836
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
you can see that there's a small photon
 

4837
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,390
you can see that there's a small photon
count difference between

4838
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
count difference between
 

4839
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,189
count difference between
you know

4840
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:07,199
you know
 

4841
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,629
you know
this spot here and that's about there

4842
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:08,639
this spot here and that's about there
 

4843
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,550
this spot here and that's about there
which means that so it can see in the

4844
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
which means that so it can see in the
 

4845
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,550
which means that so it can see in the
dark incredibly well

4846
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:12,560
dark incredibly well
 

4847
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,470
dark incredibly well
um because it can detect these tiny

4848
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:14,480
um because it can detect these tiny
 

4849
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,950
um because it can detect these tiny
differences in photon counts

4850
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:16,960
differences in photon counts
 

4851
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,870
differences in photon counts
like much better than you'd

4852
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:18,880
like much better than you'd
 

4853
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,310
like much better than you'd
possibly imagine

4854
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:20,320
possibly imagine
 

4855
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,430
possibly imagine
um so

4856
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:21,440
um so
 

4857
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,510
um so
and and then we also save

4858
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:23,520
and and then we also save
 

4859
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,350
and and then we also save
uh 13 milliseconds on a latency uh

4860
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
uh 13 milliseconds on a latency uh
 

4861
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,470
uh 13 milliseconds on a latency uh
so

4862
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:28,480
so
 

4863
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,629
so
um from removing the post processing in

4864
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:30,639
um from removing the post processing in
 

4865
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,149
um from removing the post processing in
the image yes yeah it's like um

4866
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:34,159
the image yes yeah it's like um
 

4867
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:35,669
the image yes yeah it's like um
because we've got you know eight cameras

4868
01:22:35,669 --> 01:22:35,679
because we've got you know eight cameras
 

4869
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:38,870
because we've got you know eight cameras
and and then there's uh

4870
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
and and then there's uh
 

4871
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,990
and and then there's uh
roughly i don't know one and a half

4872
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,000
roughly i don't know one and a half
 

4873
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,830
roughly i don't know one and a half
milliseconds or so

4874
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:41,840
milliseconds or so
 

4875
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,189
milliseconds or so
maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency um

4876
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:45,199
maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency um
 

4877
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,750
maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency um
for each camera and so

4878
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:47,760
for each camera and so
 

4879
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,709
for each camera and so
like

4880
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:48,719
like
 

4881
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:49,430
like
uh

4882
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,440
uh
 

4883
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,550
uh
um

4884
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:50,560
um
 

4885
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,189
um
going to just uh

4886
01:22:53,189 --> 01:22:53,199
going to just uh
 

4887
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,830
going to just uh
basically bypassing the image processor

4888
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:55,840
basically bypassing the image processor
 

4889
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,750
basically bypassing the image processor
uh gets us back 13 milliseconds of

4890
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
uh gets us back 13 milliseconds of
 

4891
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,830
uh gets us back 13 milliseconds of
latency which is important

4892
01:22:59,830 --> 01:22:59,840
latency which is important
 

4893
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,270
latency which is important
um

4894
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
um
 

4895
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,030
um
and we track latency all the way from

4896
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:03,040
and we track latency all the way from
 

4897
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,709
and we track latency all the way from
you know photon hits the

4898
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:04,719
you know photon hits the
 

4899
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,390
you know photon hits the
the camera to

4900
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:06,400
the camera to
 

4901
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,669
the camera to
you know all the steps that it's got to

4902
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:07,679
you know all the steps that it's got to
 

4903
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,270
you know all the steps that it's got to
go through to get you know go through

4904
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:09,280
go through to get you know go through
 

4905
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,149
go through to get you know go through
the

4906
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
the
 

4907
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,189
the
um

4908
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:11,199
um
 

4909
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,870
um
the various neural nets and the the c

4910
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:12,880
the various neural nets and the the c
 

4911
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,550
the various neural nets and the the c
code and

4912
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:14,560
code and
 

4913
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,750
code and
there's a little bit of c plus plus

4914
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
there's a little bit of c plus plus
 

4915
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,790
there's a little bit of c plus plus
there as well

4916
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:16,800
there as well
 

4917
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,590
there as well
um

4918
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
um
 

4919
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,149
um
well i can maybe a lot but it the the

4920
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:20,159
well i can maybe a lot but it the the
 

4921
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,229
well i can maybe a lot but it the the
core stuff is the heavy duty computers

4922
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:22,239
core stuff is the heavy duty computers
 

4923
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:25,030
core stuff is the heavy duty computers
will see um

4924
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,040
will see um
 

4925
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,790
will see um
and uh

4926
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:26,800
and uh
 

4927
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,550
and uh
and so so we track that latency all the

4928
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:28,560
and so so we track that latency all the
 

4929
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,350
and so so we track that latency all the
way to an output command to the um

4930
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,360
way to an output command to the um
 

4931
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,350
way to an output command to the um
drive unit to accelerate

4932
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
drive unit to accelerate
 

4933
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,709
drive unit to accelerate
the brakes just to

4934
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:34,719
the brakes just to
 

4935
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,790
the brakes just to
slow down the steering you know turn

4936
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:36,800
slow down the steering you know turn
 

4937
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,790
slow down the steering you know turn
left or right um

4938
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:38,800
left or right um
 

4939
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,470
left or right um
so because you got to output a command

4940
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:40,480
so because you got to output a command
 

4941
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,830
so because you got to output a command
that's going to go to a controller and

4942
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:41,840
that's going to go to a controller and
 

4943
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,189
that's going to go to a controller and
like some of these controllers have an

4944
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:43,199
like some of these controllers have an
 

4945
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,590
like some of these controllers have an
update frequency that's maybe 10 hertz

4946
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:45,600
update frequency that's maybe 10 hertz
 

4947
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,110
update frequency that's maybe 10 hertz
or something like that which is slow

4948
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:47,120
or something like that which is slow
 

4949
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,149
or something like that which is slow
that's like now you lose 100

4950
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:48,159
that's like now you lose 100
 

4951
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,149
that's like now you lose 100
milliseconds potentially

4952
01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
milliseconds potentially
 

4953
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,350
milliseconds potentially
so

4954
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
so
 

4955
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,950
so
um so then we want to update the

4956
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:54,960
um so then we want to update the
 

4957
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,709
um so then we want to update the
the drivers on the

4958
01:23:56,709 --> 01:23:56,719
the drivers on the
 

4959
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,790
the drivers on the
like steering and braking control to

4960
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
like steering and braking control to
 

4961
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,709
like steering and braking control to
have um

4962
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
have um
 

4963
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,550
have um
more like uh 100 hertz instead of 10

4964
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:02,560
more like uh 100 hertz instead of 10
 

4965
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,910
more like uh 100 hertz instead of 10
hertz and you could have 10 milliseconds

4966
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:03,920
hertz and you could have 10 milliseconds
 

4967
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,270
hertz and you could have 10 milliseconds
latency instead of 100 milliseconds

4968
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
latency instead of 100 milliseconds
 

4969
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,350
latency instead of 100 milliseconds
worst case latency and actually jitter

4970
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
worst case latency and actually jitter
 

4971
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,350
worst case latency and actually jitter
is more of a challenge than than latency

4972
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,360
is more of a challenge than than latency
 

4973
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,790
is more of a challenge than than latency
because latency is like you can you can

4974
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
because latency is like you can you can
 

4975
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,229
because latency is like you can you can
you can anticipate and predict but if

4976
01:24:12,229 --> 01:24:12,239
you can anticipate and predict but if
 

4977
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,149
you can anticipate and predict but if
you're but if you've got a stack up of

4978
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:14,159
you're but if you've got a stack up of
 

4979
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,990
you're but if you've got a stack up of
things going from the camera to the to

4980
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
things going from the camera to the to
 

4981
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,110
things going from the camera to the to
the computer

4982
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:17,120
the computer
 

4983
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,270
the computer
through then a series of other computers

4984
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:19,280
through then a series of other computers
 

4985
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,149
through then a series of other computers
and finally to an actuator on the car if

4986
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159
and finally to an actuator on the car if
 

4987
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,070
and finally to an actuator on the car if
you have a stack up of

4988
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:24,080
you have a stack up of
 

4989
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,110
you have a stack up of
uh

4990
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,120
uh
 

4991
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,950
uh
of tolerances of timing tolerances then

4992
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960
of tolerances of timing tolerances then
 

4993
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,790
of tolerances of timing tolerances then
you can have quite a variable latency

4994
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
you can have quite a variable latency
 

4995
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,030
you can have quite a variable latency
which is called jetter and and that

4996
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:31,040
which is called jetter and and that
 

4997
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,229
which is called jetter and and that
makes it

4998
01:24:32,229 --> 01:24:32,239
makes it
 

4999
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,430
makes it
hard to to anticipate exactly what how

5000
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:35,440
hard to to anticipate exactly what how
 

5001
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,350
hard to to anticipate exactly what how
you should turn the car or accelerate

5002
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:37,360
you should turn the car or accelerate
 

5003
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,229
you should turn the car or accelerate
because

5004
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:38,239
because
 

5005
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,790
because
you know if you got maybe

5006
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:39,800
you know if you got maybe
 

5007
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,550
you know if you got maybe
150 200 milliseconds of jitter then you

5008
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:42,560
150 200 milliseconds of jitter then you
 

5009
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,470
150 200 milliseconds of jitter then you
could be off by you know after 0.2

5010
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
could be off by you know after 0.2
 

5011
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,229
could be off by you know after 0.2
seconds and this can make this could

5012
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:46,239
seconds and this can make this could
 

5013
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:47,830
seconds and this can make this could
make a big difference so you have to

5014
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:47,840
make a big difference so you have to
 

5015
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,070
make a big difference so you have to
interpolate somehow to to

5016
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
interpolate somehow to to
 

5017
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,790
interpolate somehow to to
to uh deal with the effects of jitter so

5018
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:52,800
to uh deal with the effects of jitter so
 

5019
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,790
to uh deal with the effects of jitter so
that you can make like

5020
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:54,800
that you can make like
 

5021
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,750
that you can make like
robust controlled decisions

5022
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:57,760
robust controlled decisions
 

5023
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,510
robust controlled decisions
the again you have to uh so the jitters

5024
01:24:59,510 --> 01:24:59,520
the again you have to uh so the jitters
 

5025
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,390
the again you have to uh so the jitters
and the sensor information or the jitter

5026
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:02,400
and the sensor information or the jitter
 

5027
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,950
and the sensor information or the jitter
can occur at any stage in the pipeline

5028
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:04,960
can occur at any stage in the pipeline
 

5029
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,870
can occur at any stage in the pipeline
you can if you have just if you have

5030
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:06,880
you can if you have just if you have
 

5031
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,229
you can if you have just if you have
fixed latency you can anticipate um

5032
01:25:10,229 --> 01:25:10,239
fixed latency you can anticipate um
 

5033
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:13,990
fixed latency you can anticipate um
and and uh like say okay we know that uh

5034
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,000
and and uh like say okay we know that uh
 

5035
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,470
and and uh like say okay we know that uh
our information is for argument's sake

5036
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:16,480
our information is for argument's sake
 

5037
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,870
our information is for argument's sake
150 milliseconds stale

5038
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:18,880
150 milliseconds stale
 

5039
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,310
150 milliseconds stale
like so for um

5040
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:21,320
like so for um
 

5041
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,510
like so for um
145 milliseconds from

5042
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:23,520
145 milliseconds from
 

5043
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,629
145 milliseconds from
photons taking camera to um

5044
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
photons taking camera to um
 

5045
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,430
photons taking camera to um
where you can measure a change in the

5046
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:29,440
where you can measure a change in the
 

5047
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,430
where you can measure a change in the
acceleration of the vehicle

5048
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:31,440
acceleration of the vehicle
 

5049
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,669
acceleration of the vehicle
um

5050
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:33,679
um
 

5051
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:34,470
um
so

5052
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
so
 

5053
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,550
so
then uh then you can say okay well we're

5054
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,560
then uh then you can say okay well we're
 

5055
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,510
then uh then you can say okay well we're
gonna

5056
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,520
gonna
 

5057
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,350
gonna
and we know it's 150 milliseconds so

5058
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:39,360
and we know it's 150 milliseconds so
 

5059
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,870
and we know it's 150 milliseconds so
we're going to take that into account

5060
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
we're going to take that into account
 

5061
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,629
we're going to take that into account
and uh

5062
01:25:42,629 --> 01:25:42,639
and uh
 

5063
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,470
and uh
and compensate for that latency however

5064
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:44,480
and compensate for that latency however
 

5065
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,790
and compensate for that latency however
if you've got then 150 milliseconds of

5066
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
if you've got then 150 milliseconds of
 

5067
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,030
if you've got then 150 milliseconds of
latency plus 100 milliseconds of jitter

5068
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:49,040
latency plus 100 milliseconds of jitter
 

5069
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,550
latency plus 100 milliseconds of jitter
that's which could be anywhere from zero

5070
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
that's which could be anywhere from zero
 

5071
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,550
that's which could be anywhere from zero
to zero to 100 milliseconds on top so

5072
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
to zero to 100 milliseconds on top so
 

5073
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,870
to zero to 100 milliseconds on top so
then your latency could be from 150 to

5074
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:54,880
then your latency could be from 150 to
 

5075
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,070
then your latency could be from 150 to
150 milliseconds now you got 100

5076
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:56,080
150 milliseconds now you got 100
 

5077
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,110
150 milliseconds now you got 100
milliseconds that you don't know what to

5078
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,120
milliseconds that you don't know what to
 

5079
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,910
milliseconds that you don't know what to
do with

5080
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:57,920
do with
 

5081
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,270
do with
and and that's basically random

5082
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:01,280
and and that's basically random
 

5083
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,870
and and that's basically random
so getting rid of jitter is extremely

5084
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:02,880
so getting rid of jitter is extremely
 

5085
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,070
so getting rid of jitter is extremely
important

5086
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,080
important
 

5087
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,669
important
and that affects your control decisions

5088
01:26:05,669 --> 01:26:05,679
and that affects your control decisions
 

5089
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:07,270
and that affects your control decisions
and all those kinds of things

5090
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:07,280
and all those kinds of things
 

5091
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,629
and all those kinds of things
okay

5092
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
okay
 

5093
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,070
okay
um yeah the car is just going to

5094
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:10,080
um yeah the car is just going to
 

5095
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,430
um yeah the car is just going to
fundamentally maneuver better with lower

5096
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:11,440
fundamentally maneuver better with lower
 

5097
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,470
fundamentally maneuver better with lower
jitter um

5098
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:14,480

 

5099
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,149

the cars will maneuver with superhuman

5100
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:16,159
the cars will maneuver with superhuman
 

5101
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,310
the cars will maneuver with superhuman
ability and reaction time much faster

5102
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
ability and reaction time much faster
 

5103
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,229
ability and reaction time much faster
than a human

5104
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:20,239
than a human
 

5105
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:23,590
than a human
i mean i think over time the

5106
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600
i mean i think over time the
 

5107
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,510
i mean i think over time the
autopilot full self driving will be

5108
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,520
autopilot full self driving will be
 

5109
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,070
autopilot full self driving will be
capable of maneuvers that um

5110
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:28,080
capable of maneuvers that um
 

5111
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,110
capable of maneuvers that um
you know

5112
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:29,120
you know
 

5113
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,229
you know
uh

5114
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:32,239

 

5115
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,910

you know are far more than what like

5116
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:33,920
you know are far more than what like
 

5117
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,350
you know are far more than what like
james bond could do in like the best

5118
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:35,360
james bond could do in like the best
 

5119
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,110
james bond could do in like the best
movie type of thing that's exactly what

5120
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,120
movie type of thing that's exactly what
 

5121
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,669
movie type of thing that's exactly what
i was imagining in my mind as you said

5122
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679
i was imagining in my mind as you said
 

5123
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,750
i was imagining in my mind as you said
um it's like an impossible maneuvers

5124
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:41,760
um it's like an impossible maneuvers
 

5125
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,870
um it's like an impossible maneuvers
that a human couldn't do you know so

5126
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:44,880
that a human couldn't do you know so
 

5127
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,510
that a human couldn't do you know so
well let me ask sort of uh looking back

5128
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:47,520
well let me ask sort of uh looking back
 

5129
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,350
well let me ask sort of uh looking back
the six years looking out into the

5130
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:49,360
the six years looking out into the
 

5131
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,950
the six years looking out into the
future based on your current

5132
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:50,960
future based on your current
 

5133
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,870
future based on your current
understanding how hard do you think this

5134
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:52,880
understanding how hard do you think this
 

5135
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,430
understanding how hard do you think this
is this full self-driving problem when

5136
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,440
is this full self-driving problem when
 

5137
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,910
is this full self-driving problem when
do you think tesla will solve level four

5138
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:57,920
do you think tesla will solve level four
 

5139
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,790
do you think tesla will solve level four
fsd

5140
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800

 

5141
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,390

i mean it's looking quite likely that it

5142
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:02,400
i mean it's looking quite likely that it
 

5143
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,350
i mean it's looking quite likely that it
will be next year

5144
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,360
will be next year
 

5145
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,030
will be next year
and what does the solution look like is

5146
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:07,040
and what does the solution look like is
 

5147
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,189
and what does the solution look like is
it the current pool of fsd beta

5148
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:09,199
it the current pool of fsd beta
 

5149
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,189
it the current pool of fsd beta
candidates

5150
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:11,199
candidates
 

5151
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:12,950
candidates
they start getting greater and greater

5152
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
they start getting greater and greater
 

5153
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,390
they start getting greater and greater
as they have been

5154
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
as they have been
 

5155
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,229
as they have been
degrees of autonomy and then there's a

5156
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:16,239
degrees of autonomy and then there's a
 

5157
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:17,189
degrees of autonomy and then there's a
certain

5158
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
certain
 

5159
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,189
certain
level beyond which

5160
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:19,199
level beyond which
 

5161
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:20,870
level beyond which
they can they can do their own they can

5162
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:20,880
they can they can do their own they can
 

5163
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,790
they can they can do their own they can
read a book

5164
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:22,800
read a book
 

5165
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,149
read a book
yeah so

5166
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:24,159
yeah so
 

5167
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,430
yeah so
uh

5168
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,440
uh
 

5169
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,110
uh
i mean you can see anybody who's been

5170
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,120
i mean you can see anybody who's been
 

5171
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,229
i mean you can see anybody who's been
following the

5172
01:27:28,229 --> 01:27:28,239
following the
 

5173
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,470
following the
fossil driving beta closely

5174
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:30,480
fossil driving beta closely
 

5175
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,030
fossil driving beta closely
will see that the um

5176
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:33,040
will see that the um
 

5177
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,070
will see that the um
the

5178
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,080
the
 

5179
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,149
the
rate of disengagements has been dropping

5180
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:36,159
rate of disengagements has been dropping
 

5181
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,270
rate of disengagements has been dropping
rapidly

5182
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
rapidly
 

5183
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,430
rapidly
so like a disengagement b where where

5184
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:39,440
so like a disengagement b where where
 

5185
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,270
so like a disengagement b where where
the driver intervenes to prevent the car

5186
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:41,280
the driver intervenes to prevent the car
 

5187
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,430
the driver intervenes to prevent the car
from doing something right uh

5188
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:43,440
from doing something right uh
 

5189
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,189
from doing something right uh
dangerous potentially so

5190
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:45,199
dangerous potentially so
 

5191
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:49,510
dangerous potentially so
um

5192
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520

 

5193
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,990

so the interventions

5194
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:52,000
so the interventions
 

5195
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,350
so the interventions
you know per million miles has been

5196
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:53,360
you know per million miles has been
 

5197
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,669
you know per million miles has been
dropping uh dramatically at some point

5198
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:55,679
dropping uh dramatically at some point
 

5199
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,590
dropping uh dramatically at some point
the

5200
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:57,600
the
 

5201
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,470
the
and that

5202
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:58,480
and that
 

5203
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,910
and that
trend looks like it happens next year is

5204
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
trend looks like it happens next year is
 

5205
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,430
trend looks like it happens next year is
the the the

5206
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:03,440
the the the
 

5207
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,390
the the the
probability of an accident on fsd uh is

5208
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:08,400
probability of an accident on fsd uh is
 

5209
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,229
probability of an accident on fsd uh is
uh less than that of the average human

5210
01:28:10,229 --> 01:28:10,239
uh less than that of the average human
 

5211
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,750
uh less than that of the average human
and then and then significantly less

5212
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
and then and then significantly less
 

5213
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,990
and then and then significantly less
than that of the average human um so

5214
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:16,000
than that of the average human um so
 

5215
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,030
than that of the average human um so
it certainly

5216
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,040
it certainly
 

5217
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,390
it certainly
appears like we will get there next year

5218
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:20,400
appears like we will get there next year
 

5219
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,669
appears like we will get there next year
um

5220
01:28:21,669 --> 01:28:21,679
um
 

5221
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:23,030
um
then of course

5222
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,040
then of course
 

5223
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,550
then of course
that then there's going to be a case of

5224
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
that then there's going to be a case of
 

5225
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,990
that then there's going to be a case of
okay we now have to prove this to

5226
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:26,000
okay we now have to prove this to
 

5227
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,910
okay we now have to prove this to
regulators and prove it to you know and

5228
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:27,920
regulators and prove it to you know and
 

5229
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,310
regulators and prove it to you know and
and we we want a standard that is not

5230
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:30,320
and we we want a standard that is not
 

5231
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,790
and we we want a standard that is not
just equivalent to a human but

5232
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:32,800
just equivalent to a human but
 

5233
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,229
just equivalent to a human but
uh much better than the average human i

5234
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:34,239
uh much better than the average human i
 

5235
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,669
uh much better than the average human i
think it's got to be at least two or

5236
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:35,679
think it's got to be at least two or
 

5237
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:37,910
think it's got to be at least two or
three times uh higher

5238
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:37,920
three times uh higher
 

5239
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,669
three times uh higher
safety than a human so two or three

5240
01:28:39,669 --> 01:28:39,679
safety than a human so two or three
 

5241
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,430
safety than a human so two or three
times lower probability of injury than a

5242
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:41,440
times lower probability of injury than a
 

5243
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,470
times lower probability of injury than a
human

5244
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,480
human
 

5245
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,709
human
before before we would actually say like

5246
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:44,719
before before we would actually say like
 

5247
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,229
before before we would actually say like
okay it's okay to go it's not going to

5248
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:46,239
okay it's okay to go it's not going to
 

5249
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,110
okay it's okay to go it's not going to
be equivalent it's going to be much

5250
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:47,120
be equivalent it's going to be much
 

5251
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,149
be equivalent it's going to be much
better

5252
01:28:48,149 --> 01:28:48,159
better
 

5253
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:51,189
better
so if you look uh 10 point fsd

5254
01:28:51,189 --> 01:28:51,199
so if you look uh 10 point fsd
 

5255
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:54,229
so if you look uh 10 point fsd
10.6 just came out recently 10.7 is on

5256
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:54,239
10.6 just came out recently 10.7 is on
 

5257
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,270
10.6 just came out recently 10.7 is on
the way

5258
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:55,280
the way
 

5259
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,590
the way
maybe 11 is on the way somewhere in the

5260
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
maybe 11 is on the way somewhere in the
 

5261
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,390
maybe 11 is on the way somewhere in the
future yeah um we were hoping to get 11

5262
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:00,400
future yeah um we were hoping to get 11
 

5263
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,430
future yeah um we were hoping to get 11
out this year but it's uh

5264
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:03,440
out this year but it's uh
 

5265
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,149
out this year but it's uh
11 actually has a whole bunch of uh

5266
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:06,159
11 actually has a whole bunch of uh
 

5267
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,149
11 actually has a whole bunch of uh
fundamental rewrites on the neural

5268
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:08,159
fundamental rewrites on the neural
 

5269
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:10,629
fundamental rewrites on the neural
neural net architecture

5270
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:10,639
neural net architecture
 

5271
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,310
neural net architecture
and some

5272
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,320
and some
 

5273
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:13,990
and some
fundamental improvements

5274
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,000
fundamental improvements
 

5275
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,270
fundamental improvements
in

5276
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,280
in
 

5277
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,030
in
creating vector space

5278
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,040
creating vector space
 

5279
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,510
creating vector space
uh so

5280
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
uh so
 

5281
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,070
uh so
there is a some fundamental like leap

5282
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:22,080
there is a some fundamental like leap
 

5283
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,990
there is a some fundamental like leap
that really deserves the 11. i mean

5284
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
that really deserves the 11. i mean
 

5285
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,790
that really deserves the 11. i mean
that's a pretty cool number yeah yeah

5286
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:26,800
that's a pretty cool number yeah yeah
 

5287
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,030
that's a pretty cool number yeah yeah
uh 11 would be uh

5288
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
uh 11 would be uh
 

5289
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,030
uh 11 would be uh
a single stack for all you know one

5290
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,040
a single stack for all you know one
 

5291
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,669
a single stack for all you know one
stack to rule them all um

5292
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:33,679
stack to rule them all um
 

5293
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:36,149
stack to rule them all um
and uh

5294
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:36,159
and uh
 

5295
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:37,669
and uh
but but there's just some really

5296
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:37,679
but but there's just some really
 

5297
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:38,870
but but there's just some really
fundamental

5298
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:38,880
fundamental
 

5299
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,390
fundamental
uh

5300
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:40,400
uh
 

5301
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,350
uh
neural net architecture changes that are

5302
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:43,360
neural net architecture changes that are
 

5303
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,310
neural net architecture changes that are
that that will allow for

5304
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:46,320
that that will allow for
 

5305
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,189
that that will allow for
uh much more capability but but

5306
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199
uh much more capability but but
 

5307
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,470
uh much more capability but but
you know at first they're gonna have

5308
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:50,480
you know at first they're gonna have
 

5309
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,950
you know at first they're gonna have
issues so like we have this working on

5310
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960
issues so like we have this working on
 

5311
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,950
issues so like we have this working on
like sort of alpha software and it's

5312
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,960
like sort of alpha software and it's
 

5313
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,229
like sort of alpha software and it's
it's good but it's uh

5314
01:29:58,229 --> 01:29:58,239
it's good but it's uh
 

5315
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:00,470
it's good but it's uh
it's it it's basically taking a whole

5316
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:00,480
it's it it's basically taking a whole
 

5317
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,590
it's it it's basically taking a whole
bunch of c c plus code and and deleting

5318
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:03,600
bunch of c c plus code and and deleting
 

5319
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,270
bunch of c c plus code and and deleting
a massive amount of c plus plus go and

5320
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:05,280
a massive amount of c plus plus go and
 

5321
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,790
a massive amount of c plus plus go and
replacing it with the neural net and you

5322
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:06,800
replacing it with the neural net and you
 

5323
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,950
replacing it with the neural net and you
know andre um makes this point a lot

5324
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:08,960
know andre um makes this point a lot
 

5325
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,229
know andre um makes this point a lot
which is like neural nets like kind of

5326
01:30:10,229 --> 01:30:10,239
which is like neural nets like kind of
 

5327
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,070
which is like neural nets like kind of
eating software

5328
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,080
eating software
 

5329
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,070
eating software
you know over time there's like

5330
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:14,080
you know over time there's like
 

5331
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,910
you know over time there's like
less and less conventional software more

5332
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:15,920
less and less conventional software more
 

5333
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,750
less and less conventional software more
and more neural net we're just still

5334
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:17,760
and more neural net we're just still
 

5335
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,590
and more neural net we're just still
software but it's you know

5336
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:19,600
software but it's you know
 

5337
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,030
software but it's you know
still comes out the lines of software

5338
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:21,040
still comes out the lines of software
 

5339
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:21,910
still comes out the lines of software
but

5340
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:21,920
but
 

5341
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,870
but
uh let's just more more neural net stuff

5342
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:24,880
uh let's just more more neural net stuff
 

5343
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,149
uh let's just more more neural net stuff
uh and less

5344
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:26,159
uh and less
 

5345
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,990
uh and less
uh

5346
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:28,000
uh
 

5347
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,270
uh
you know heuristics basically um

5348
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:31,280
you know heuristics basically um
 

5349
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,110
you know heuristics basically um
if you're

5350
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:33,120
if you're
 

5351
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,229
if you're
more more more uh matrix based

5352
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:36,239
more more more uh matrix based
 

5353
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,390
more more more uh matrix based
stuff and less uh

5354
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:38,400
stuff and less uh
 

5355
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,550
stuff and less uh
heuristics based stuff um

5356
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:42,560

 

5357
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,310

and um

5358
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:46,320

 

5359
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,790

you know like like like one of the big

5360
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:48,800
you know like like like one of the big
 

5361
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,750
you know like like like one of the big
changes will be um

5362
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:51,760
changes will be um
 

5363
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,149
changes will be um
like right now the neural nets

5364
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:54,159
like right now the neural nets
 

5365
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,390
like right now the neural nets
uh will

5366
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:56,400
uh will
 

5367
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,510
uh will
um

5368
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:57,520
um
 

5369
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,750
um
deliver a giant bag of points

5370
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:01,760
deliver a giant bag of points
 

5371
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,669
deliver a giant bag of points
to the c plus plus or c and c plus plus

5372
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:03,679
to the c plus plus or c and c plus plus
 

5373
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,669
to the c plus plus or c and c plus plus
code yeah um

5374
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:05,679
code yeah um
 

5375
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,070
code yeah um
we call the giant bag of points yeah uh

5376
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,080
we call the giant bag of points yeah uh
 

5377
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,390
we call the giant bag of points yeah uh
and it's like so you go to pixel and and

5378
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,400
and it's like so you go to pixel and and
 

5379
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,510
and it's like so you go to pixel and and
and

5380
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:11,520
and
 

5381
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,950
and
something associated with that pixel

5382
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
something associated with that pixel
 

5383
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,270
something associated with that pixel
like this pixel is probably car the

5384
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,280
like this pixel is probably car the
 

5385
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,750
like this pixel is probably car the
pixel is probably lane line

5386
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
pixel is probably lane line
 

5387
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,110
pixel is probably lane line
then you've got to assemble this giant

5388
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:19,120
then you've got to assemble this giant
 

5389
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,310
then you've got to assemble this giant
bag of points

5390
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:20,320
bag of points
 

5391
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,669
bag of points
in the c code and turn it into

5392
01:31:23,669 --> 01:31:23,679
in the c code and turn it into
 

5393
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,950
in the c code and turn it into
vectors

5394
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960

 

5395
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,870

and it does a pretty good job of it but

5396
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:28,880
and it does a pretty good job of it but
 

5397
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:29,830
and it does a pretty good job of it but
it's

5398
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:29,840
it's
 

5399
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,950
it's
it's a

5400
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:30,960
it's a
 

5401
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,990
it's a
it's

5402
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:32,000
it's
 

5403
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,149
it's
we want to just we need another layer of

5404
01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:34,159
we want to just we need another layer of
 

5405
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,790
we want to just we need another layer of
neural nets on top of that to take the

5406
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:36,800
neural nets on top of that to take the
 

5407
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,470
neural nets on top of that to take the
giant bag of points

5408
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:38,480
giant bag of points
 

5409
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,950
giant bag of points
and distill that down to

5410
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:40,960
and distill that down to
 

5411
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,149
and distill that down to
uh vector space in the neural net part

5412
01:31:44,149 --> 01:31:44,159
uh vector space in the neural net part
 

5413
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:45,830
uh vector space in the neural net part
of the software as opposed to the

5414
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:45,840
of the software as opposed to the
 

5415
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,950
of the software as opposed to the
heuristics

5416
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:46,960
heuristics
 

5417
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,550
heuristics
part of the software

5418
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:48,560
part of the software
 

5419
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,390
part of the software
this is a big improvement

5420
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:50,400
this is a big improvement
 

5421
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,390
this is a big improvement
um you know that's all the way down it's

5422
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:52,400
um you know that's all the way down it's
 

5423
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,229
um you know that's all the way down it's
what you want it's not even your only

5424
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:54,239
what you want it's not even your only
 

5425
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:57,030
what you want it's not even your only
realness but it's it's it's uh this will

5426
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:57,040
realness but it's it's it's uh this will
 

5427
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,590
realness but it's it's it's uh this will
be just a ga this is a game changer to

5428
01:31:59,590 --> 01:31:59,600
be just a ga this is a game changer to
 

5429
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,830
be just a ga this is a game changer to
not have the bag of points the giant bag

5430
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:01,840
not have the bag of points the giant bag
 

5431
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,390
not have the bag of points the giant bag
of points that has to be assembled with

5432
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:04,400
of points that has to be assembled with
 

5433
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,750
of points that has to be assembled with
um many lines of cfc plus plus uh and

5434
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:07,760
um many lines of cfc plus plus uh and
 

5435
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,189
um many lines of cfc plus plus uh and
and have the

5436
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:09,199
and have the
 

5437
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:10,950
and have the
and have a neural net just assemble

5438
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:10,960
and have a neural net just assemble
 

5439
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,350
and have a neural net just assemble
those into a vector so so that the

5440
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:13,360
those into a vector so so that the
 

5441
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,990
those into a vector so so that the
neural net is outputting

5442
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:16,000
neural net is outputting
 

5443
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,750
neural net is outputting
um

5444
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,760
um
 

5445
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,669
um
much much less data it's it's it's

5446
01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:19,679
much much less data it's it's it's
 

5447
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,990
much much less data it's it's it's
outputting this this is a lane line this

5448
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:22,000
outputting this this is a lane line this
 

5449
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,669
outputting this this is a lane line this
is a curve this is drivable space this

5450
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:23,679
is a curve this is drivable space this
 

5451
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:27,189
is a curve this is drivable space this
is a card this is a you know a

5452
01:32:27,189 --> 01:32:27,199
is a card this is a you know a
 

5453
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:28,709
is a card this is a you know a
pedestrian or a cyclist or something

5454
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:28,719
pedestrian or a cyclist or something
 

5455
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,550
pedestrian or a cyclist or something
like that it's outputting

5456
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:30,560
like that it's outputting
 

5457
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,990
like that it's outputting
um

5458
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
um
 

5459
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,070
um
it's really outputting

5460
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
it's really outputting
 

5461
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,310
it's really outputting
um profit vectors to

5462
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,320
um profit vectors to
 

5463
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,350
um profit vectors to
the

5464
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:37,360
the
 

5465
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,830
the
the cc plus less control control code as

5466
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:39,840
the cc plus less control control code as
 

5467
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,990
the cc plus less control control code as
opposed to

5468
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:42,000
opposed to
 

5469
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,229
opposed to
this sort of

5470
01:32:44,229 --> 01:32:44,239
this sort of
 

5471
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,790
this sort of
constructing the the vectors

5472
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
constructing the the vectors
 

5473
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,870
constructing the the vectors
uh in c

5474
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:48,880
uh in c
 

5475
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,229
uh in c
um

5476
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
um
 

5477
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,590
um
which we've done i think quite a good

5478
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:51,600
which we've done i think quite a good
 

5479
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,629
which we've done i think quite a good
job of but it's it's a it you're kind of

5480
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:54,639
job of but it's it's a it you're kind of
 

5481
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,790
job of but it's it's a it you're kind of
hitting a local maximum on the how well

5482
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:56,800
hitting a local maximum on the how well
 

5483
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,390
hitting a local maximum on the how well
the c can do this

5484
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:58,400
the c can do this
 

5485
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,510
the c can do this
um

5486
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
um
 

5487
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,590
um
so this is this is really this is really

5488
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:01,600
so this is this is really this is really
 

5489
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,790
so this is this is really this is really
a big deal

5490
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:02,800
a big deal
 

5491
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,310
a big deal
and and just all of the networks in the

5492
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:04,320
and and just all of the networks in the
 

5493
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,550
and and just all of the networks in the
car need need to move to surround video

5494
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:06,560
car need need to move to surround video
 

5495
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,310
car need need to move to surround video
there's still some legacy networks that

5496
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:08,320
there's still some legacy networks that
 

5497
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,910
there's still some legacy networks that
are not surround video

5498
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:11,920
are not surround video
 

5499
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,910
are not surround video
and all of the training needs to move to

5500
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:13,920
and all of the training needs to move to
 

5501
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,910
and all of the training needs to move to
surround video and the efficiency of the

5502
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:15,920
surround video and the efficiency of the
 

5503
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,750
surround video and the efficiency of the
training uh it needs to get better and

5504
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:17,760
training uh it needs to get better and
 

5505
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,790
training uh it needs to get better and
it is

5506
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:18,800
it is
 

5507
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,830
it is
and then we need to move everything to

5508
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:20,840
and then we need to move everything to
 

5509
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,870
and then we need to move everything to
uh raw

5510
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:22,880
uh raw
 

5511
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,950
uh raw
uh photon

5512
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:24,960
uh photon
 

5513
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,350
uh photon
counts as opposed to um

5514
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:27,360
counts as opposed to um
 

5515
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,750
counts as opposed to um
processed images okay so which is just

5516
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:29,760
processed images okay so which is just
 

5517
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,270
processed images okay so which is just
quite a big reset on the training

5518
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:31,280
quite a big reset on the training
 

5519
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,430
quite a big reset on the training
because the system's trained on post

5520
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:33,440
because the system's trained on post
 

5521
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,510
because the system's trained on post
processed image images so we need to

5522
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:35,520
processed image images so we need to
 

5523
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,270
processed image images so we need to
redo all the training

5524
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:37,280
redo all the training
 

5525
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,229
redo all the training
uh

5526
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:38,239
uh
 

5527
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,790
uh
to train against the the

5528
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:40,800
to train against the the
 

5529
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,390
to train against the the
raw photon accounts instead of the

5530
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
raw photon accounts instead of the
 

5531
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,950
raw photon accounts instead of the
post-processed image so ultimately it's

5532
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:44,960
post-processed image so ultimately it's
 

5533
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,470
post-processed image so ultimately it's
kind of reducing the complexity of the

5534
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:46,480
kind of reducing the complexity of the
 

5535
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:49,669
kind of reducing the complexity of the
whole thing so uh reducing reducing

5536
01:33:49,669 --> 01:33:49,679
whole thing so uh reducing reducing
 

5537
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,830
whole thing so uh reducing reducing
lines of code will actually go lower

5538
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:51,840
lines of code will actually go lower
 

5539
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,590
lines of code will actually go lower
yeah that's fascinating

5540
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:53,600
yeah that's fascinating
 

5541
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,510
yeah that's fascinating
um so you're doing fusion of all the

5542
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:55,520
um so you're doing fusion of all the
 

5543
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,110
um so you're doing fusion of all the
sensors so reducing the complexity of

5544
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,120
sensors so reducing the complexity of
 

5545
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,510
sensors so reducing the complexity of
having to deal with these cameras

5546
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,520
having to deal with these cameras
 

5547
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,830
having to deal with these cameras
cameras really right yes

5548
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:02,840

 

5549
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,270

um same with humans

5550
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,280
um same with humans
 

5551
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,510
um same with humans
yeah well i guess we got years too okay

5552
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:07,520
yeah well i guess we got years too okay
 

5553
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,629
yeah well i guess we got years too okay
yeah well we'll actually need to

5554
01:34:08,629 --> 01:34:08,639
yeah well we'll actually need to
 

5555
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:11,270
yeah well we'll actually need to
incorporate um sound as well um because

5556
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
incorporate um sound as well um because
 

5557
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,510
incorporate um sound as well um because
you know you need to like listen for

5558
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:13,520
you know you need to like listen for
 

5559
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,750
you know you need to like listen for
ambulance sirens or you know fire trucks

5560
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:15,760
ambulance sirens or you know fire trucks
 

5561
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,669
ambulance sirens or you know fire trucks
you know uh

5562
01:34:17,669 --> 01:34:17,679
you know uh
 

5563
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:19,350
you know uh
somebody like

5564
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,360
somebody like
 

5565
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,550
somebody like
you know yelling at you or something i

5566
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:20,560
you know yelling at you or something i
 

5567
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,910
you know yelling at you or something i
don't know just that there's there's a

5568
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:21,920
don't know just that there's there's a
 

5569
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,350
don't know just that there's there's a
little bit of audio that needs to be

5570
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:23,360
little bit of audio that needs to be
 

5571
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,950
little bit of audio that needs to be
incorporated as well do you need a

5572
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:24,960
incorporated as well do you need a
 

5573
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,629
incorporated as well do you need a
cookie bath break yeah we listen to the

5574
01:34:26,629 --> 01:34:26,639
cookie bath break yeah we listen to the
 

5575
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,709
cookie bath break yeah we listen to the
trolls take a break okay

5576
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:28,719
trolls take a break okay
 

5577
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:30,950
trolls take a break okay
honestly frankly

5578
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
honestly frankly
 

5579
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,430
honestly frankly
like the ideas are the easy thing and

5580
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:33,440
like the ideas are the easy thing and
 

5581
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,870
like the ideas are the easy thing and
the implementation is the hard thing

5582
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:34,880
the implementation is the hard thing
 

5583
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,790
the implementation is the hard thing
like the idea of going to the moon is is

5584
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:36,800
like the idea of going to the moon is is
 

5585
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,470
like the idea of going to the moon is is
the easy part but going to the moon is

5586
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:38,480
the easy part but going to the moon is
 

5587
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,550
the easy part but going to the moon is
the hard part it's the hard part um and

5588
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:40,560
the hard part it's the hard part um and
 

5589
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,149
the hard part it's the hard part um and
there's a lot of like hardcore

5590
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:42,159
there's a lot of like hardcore
 

5591
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:44,390
there's a lot of like hardcore
engineering that's got to get done

5592
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:44,400
engineering that's got to get done
 

5593
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,709
engineering that's got to get done
at the hardware and software level uh

5594
01:34:46,709 --> 01:34:46,719
at the hardware and software level uh
 

5595
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,310
at the hardware and software level uh
likes it optimizing the c compiler and

5596
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:50,320
likes it optimizing the c compiler and
 

5597
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,550
likes it optimizing the c compiler and
just you know uh

5598
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:52,560
just you know uh
 

5599
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,470
just you know uh
cutting out latency

5600
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:54,480
cutting out latency
 

5601
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,750
cutting out latency
everywhere

5602
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:55,760
everywhere
 

5603
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,030
everywhere
like this is

5604
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,040
like this is
 

5605
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,550
like this is
if we don't do this the system will not

5606
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:58,560
if we don't do this the system will not
 

5607
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,109
if we don't do this the system will not
work properly um so

5608
01:35:01,109 --> 01:35:01,119
work properly um so
 

5609
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:02,870
work properly um so
the work of the engineers doing this

5610
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:02,880
the work of the engineers doing this
 

5611
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,510
the work of the engineers doing this
they are like the unsung heroes you know

5612
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
they are like the unsung heroes you know
 

5613
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,590
they are like the unsung heroes you know
but they are critical to the success of

5614
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:07,600
but they are critical to the success of
 

5615
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,950
but they are critical to the success of
the situation

5616
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
the situation
 

5617
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,310
the situation
i think you made it clear i mean at

5618
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:10,320
i think you made it clear i mean at
 

5619
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,510
i think you made it clear i mean at
least to me it's super exciting

5620
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:11,520
least to me it's super exciting
 

5621
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,350
least to me it's super exciting
everything that's going on outside of

5622
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:13,360
everything that's going on outside of
 

5623
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,950
everything that's going on outside of
what andre is doing

5624
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:14,960
what andre is doing
 

5625
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,229
what andre is doing
yeah just the whole infrastructure of

5626
01:35:16,229 --> 01:35:16,239
yeah just the whole infrastructure of
 

5627
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:17,750
yeah just the whole infrastructure of
the software

5628
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
the software
 

5629
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,189
the software
i mean everything is going on with data

5630
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199
i mean everything is going on with data
 

5631
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,669
i mean everything is going on with data
engine uh whatever whatever it's called

5632
01:35:21,669 --> 01:35:21,679
engine uh whatever whatever it's called
 

5633
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:24,629
engine uh whatever whatever it's called
the whole process is just

5634
01:35:24,629 --> 01:35:24,639
the whole process is just
 

5635
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:26,790
the whole process is just
the scale of it is boggle's mind like

5636
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:26,800
the scale of it is boggle's mind like
 

5637
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,470
the scale of it is boggle's mind like
the training the amount of work done

5638
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:28,480
the training the amount of work done
 

5639
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,149
the training the amount of work done
with like we've written all this custom

5640
01:35:30,149 --> 01:35:30,159
with like we've written all this custom
 

5641
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,950
with like we've written all this custom
software for training and labeling

5642
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:32,960
software for training and labeling
 

5643
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,950
software for training and labeling
um and to do order labeling auto

5644
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:34,960
um and to do order labeling auto
 

5645
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,709
um and to do order labeling auto
leveling is essential

5646
01:35:36,709 --> 01:35:36,719
leveling is essential
 

5647
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,149
leveling is essential
um

5648
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:38,159
um
 

5649
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,350
um
because especially when you've got like

5650
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:39,360
because especially when you've got like
 

5651
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,950
because especially when you've got like
surround video

5652
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:40,960
surround video
 

5653
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,750
surround video
it's very difficult to like label

5654
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:43,760
it's very difficult to like label
 

5655
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,590
it's very difficult to like label
surround video from scratch is extremely

5656
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:45,600
surround video from scratch is extremely
 

5657
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,070
surround video from scratch is extremely
difficult um

5658
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:48,080
difficult um
 

5659
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,430
difficult um
like take a human

5660
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:49,440
like take a human
 

5661
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,270
like take a human
such a long time to even label one video

5662
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:51,280
such a long time to even label one video
 

5663
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,590
such a long time to even label one video
clip like several hours

5664
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:53,600
clip like several hours
 

5665
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,750
clip like several hours
or the order label it

5666
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:55,760
or the order label it
 

5667
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,830
or the order label it
basically would just apply like heavy

5668
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:57,840
basically would just apply like heavy
 

5669
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,030
basically would just apply like heavy
duty

5670
01:35:59,030 --> 01:35:59,040
duty
 

5671
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,390
duty
uh

5672
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:00,400
uh
 

5673
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,149
uh
like a lot of compute to the to the

5674
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:02,159
like a lot of compute to the to the
 

5675
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:03,830
like a lot of compute to the to the
video clips um

5676
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:03,840
video clips um
 

5677
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,910
video clips um
to pre-assign

5678
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:05,920
to pre-assign
 

5679
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,430
to pre-assign
and guess what all the things are that

5680
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:07,440
and guess what all the things are that
 

5681
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,870
and guess what all the things are that
are going on in the surround video and

5682
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:08,880
are going on in the surround video and
 

5683
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,030
are going on in the surround video and
then there's like correcting it yeah and

5684
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:11,040
then there's like correcting it yeah and
 

5685
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,470
then there's like correcting it yeah and
then all the human has to do is like

5686
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:12,480
then all the human has to do is like
 

5687
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,790
then all the human has to do is like
tweet like say this you know chan adjust

5688
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:14,800
tweet like say this you know chan adjust
 

5689
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,350
tweet like say this you know chan adjust
what is incorrect this this is like

5690
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
what is incorrect this this is like
 

5691
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,189
what is incorrect this this is like
increasing increases productivity by

5692
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199
increasing increases productivity by
 

5693
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,189
increasing increases productivity by
effect 100 or more

5694
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:21,199
effect 100 or more
 

5695
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,510
effect 100 or more
yeah uh so you've presented teslabot as

5696
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,520
yeah uh so you've presented teslabot as
 

5697
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,350
yeah uh so you've presented teslabot as
primarily useful in the factory first of

5698
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:25,360
primarily useful in the factory first of
 

5699
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,350
primarily useful in the factory first of
all i think humanoid robots are

5700
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
all i think humanoid robots are
 

5701
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:30,149
all i think humanoid robots are
incredible from a fan of robotics i

5702
01:36:30,149 --> 01:36:30,159
incredible from a fan of robotics i
 

5703
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:30,870
incredible from a fan of robotics i
think

5704
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:30,880
think
 

5705
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,750
think
uh the elegance of movement that cuba um

5706
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:33,760
uh the elegance of movement that cuba um
 

5707
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,550
uh the elegance of movement that cuba um
the humanoid robots the bipedal robots

5708
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,560
the humanoid robots the bipedal robots
 

5709
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,350
the humanoid robots the bipedal robots
show are just so cool so it's uh really

5710
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:39,360
show are just so cool so it's uh really
 

5711
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,550
show are just so cool so it's uh really
interesting that you're working on this

5712
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,560
interesting that you're working on this
 

5713
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,310
interesting that you're working on this
and also talking about applying the same

5714
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:42,320
and also talking about applying the same
 

5715
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,629
and also talking about applying the same
kind of all the ideas of some of which

5716
01:36:44,629 --> 01:36:44,639
kind of all the ideas of some of which
 

5717
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,310
kind of all the ideas of some of which
we've talked about with data engine all

5718
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:46,320
we've talked about with data engine all
 

5719
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,070
we've talked about with data engine all
the things that we're talking about with

5720
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:48,080
the things that we're talking about with
 

5721
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,790
the things that we're talking about with
tesla autopilot just uh transferring

5722
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:50,800
tesla autopilot just uh transferring
 

5723
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,709
tesla autopilot just uh transferring
that over to the just yet another

5724
01:36:52,709 --> 01:36:52,719
that over to the just yet another
 

5725
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:54,470
that over to the just yet another
robotics problem

5726
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:54,480
robotics problem
 

5727
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,629
robotics problem
i have to ask since i care about human

5728
01:36:56,629 --> 01:36:56,639
i have to ask since i care about human
 

5729
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:58,550
i have to ask since i care about human
robot interaction so the human side of

5730
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:58,560
robot interaction so the human side of
 

5731
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,550
robot interaction so the human side of
that so you've talked about mostly in

5732
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:00,560
that so you've talked about mostly in
 

5733
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,669
that so you've talked about mostly in
the factory do you see it uh also do you

5734
01:37:03,669 --> 01:37:03,679
the factory do you see it uh also do you
 

5735
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:05,350
the factory do you see it uh also do you
see part of this problem that tesla bot

5736
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:05,360
see part of this problem that tesla bot
 

5737
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,350
see part of this problem that tesla bot
has to solve is interacting with humans

5738
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:07,360
has to solve is interacting with humans
 

5739
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,030
has to solve is interacting with humans
and potentially having a place like in

5740
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:09,040
and potentially having a place like in
 

5741
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,390
and potentially having a place like in
the home

5742
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:10,400
the home
 

5743
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,229
the home
so interacting not just sure not

5744
01:37:12,229 --> 01:37:12,239
so interacting not just sure not
 

5745
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,629
so interacting not just sure not
replacing labor but also like

5746
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:14,639
replacing labor but also like
 

5747
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:15,669
replacing labor but also like
i don't know

5748
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:15,679
i don't know
 

5749
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,030
i don't know
being a friend

5750
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:17,040
being a friend
 

5751
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,350
being a friend
or an assistant yeah i think the

5752
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
or an assistant yeah i think the
 

5753
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,430
or an assistant yeah i think the
possibilities are

5754
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:21,440
possibilities are
 

5755
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:27,030
possibilities are
you know endless

5756
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:27,040

 

5757
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,590

yeah i mean it's it's obviously like a

5758
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:29,600
yeah i mean it's it's obviously like a
 

5759
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,990
yeah i mean it's it's obviously like a
it's not quite in tesla's primary

5760
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:32,000
it's not quite in tesla's primary
 

5761
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,430
it's not quite in tesla's primary
mission direction of accelerating

5762
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,440
mission direction of accelerating
 

5763
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,350
mission direction of accelerating
sustainable energy but

5764
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:35,360
sustainable energy but
 

5765
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,550
sustainable energy but
it is a

5766
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:36,560
it is a
 

5767
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,229
it is a
an extremely useful thing that we can do

5768
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:38,239
an extremely useful thing that we can do
 

5769
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:39,910
an extremely useful thing that we can do
for the world which is to make a useful

5770
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:39,920
for the world which is to make a useful
 

5771
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,990
for the world which is to make a useful
humanoid robot

5772
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,000
humanoid robot
 

5773
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,350
humanoid robot
that is capable of

5774
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
that is capable of
 

5775
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,189
that is capable of
interacting with the world and

5776
01:37:47,189 --> 01:37:47,199

 

5777
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:51,189

helping in in many different ways uh so

5778
01:37:51,189 --> 01:37:51,199
helping in in many different ways uh so
 

5779
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,350
helping in in many different ways uh so
certainly in fact reason and really just

5780
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:53,360
certainly in fact reason and really just
 

5781
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,350
certainly in fact reason and really just
just i mean i think if you say like

5782
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,360
just i mean i think if you say like
 

5783
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,550
just i mean i think if you say like
uh

5784
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:56,560
uh
 

5785
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,709
uh
extrapolate to you know many years in

5786
01:37:58,709 --> 01:37:58,719
extrapolate to you know many years in
 

5787
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:00,070
extrapolate to you know many years in
the future it's like

5788
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:00,080
the future it's like
 

5789
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,669
the future it's like
i i think

5790
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:01,679
i i think
 

5791
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,870
i i think
uh work will become optional

5792
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:04,880
uh work will become optional
 

5793
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,070
uh work will become optional
so

5794
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:06,080
so
 

5795
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,910
so
like there's a lot of jobs that

5796
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
like there's a lot of jobs that
 

5797
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,030
like there's a lot of jobs that
if you if

5798
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,040
if you if
 

5799
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,270
if you if
people weren't paid to do it they would

5800
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,280
people weren't paid to do it they would
 

5801
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,709
people weren't paid to do it they would
they wouldn't do it like it's not it's

5802
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:12,719
they wouldn't do it like it's not it's
 

5803
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,030
they wouldn't do it like it's not it's
not fun you know necessarily like

5804
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:15,040
not fun you know necessarily like
 

5805
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,550
not fun you know necessarily like
if you're washing dishes all day it's

5806
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:16,560
if you're washing dishes all day it's
 

5807
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,270
if you're washing dishes all day it's
like

5808
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
like
 

5809
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,229
like
you know

5810
01:38:18,229 --> 01:38:18,239
you know
 

5811
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:19,590
you know
even if you really like washing dishes

5812
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:19,600
even if you really like washing dishes
 

5813
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,870
even if you really like washing dishes
you really want to do it for eight hours

5814
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:20,880
you really want to do it for eight hours
 

5815
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,109
you really want to do it for eight hours
a day every day probably not so

5816
01:38:25,109 --> 01:38:25,119
a day every day probably not so
 

5817
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,189
a day every day probably not so
um and then there's like dangerous work

5818
01:38:27,189 --> 01:38:27,199
um and then there's like dangerous work
 

5819
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,430
um and then there's like dangerous work
and basically if it's dangerous boring

5820
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:29,440
and basically if it's dangerous boring
 

5821
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,030
and basically if it's dangerous boring
uh has like

5822
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:31,040
uh has like
 

5823
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,870
uh has like
potential for repetitive stress injury

5824
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:32,880
potential for repetitive stress injury
 

5825
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,629
potential for repetitive stress injury
that kind of thing um

5826
01:38:34,629 --> 01:38:34,639
that kind of thing um
 

5827
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,390
that kind of thing um
then that's really where

5828
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:36,400
then that's really where
 

5829
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,030
then that's really where
humanoid robots would add the most value

5830
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,040
humanoid robots would add the most value
 

5831
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,470
humanoid robots would add the most value
initially

5832
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:40,480
initially
 

5833
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,149
initially
um so that's

5834
01:38:42,149 --> 01:38:42,159
um so that's
 

5835
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:45,990
um so that's
what we're aiming for is is to um

5836
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,000
what we're aiming for is is to um
 

5837
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,830
what we're aiming for is is to um
for the human robots to do jobs that

5838
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:47,840
for the human robots to do jobs that
 

5839
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,669
for the human robots to do jobs that
people don't don't voluntarily want to

5840
01:38:49,669 --> 01:38:49,679
people don't don't voluntarily want to
 

5841
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:50,870
people don't don't voluntarily want to
do

5842
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:50,880
do
 

5843
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,669
do
um

5844
01:38:51,669 --> 01:38:51,679
um
 

5845
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:53,030
um
and then we'll have to pair that

5846
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:53,040
and then we'll have to pair that
 

5847
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,870
and then we'll have to pair that
obviously with some kind of universal

5848
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:54,880
obviously with some kind of universal
 

5849
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,030
obviously with some kind of universal
basic income in the future

5850
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,040
basic income in the future
 

5851
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,390
basic income in the future
so

5852
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,400
so
 

5853
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,870
so
i think um

5854
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:00,880
i think um
 

5855
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,390
i think um
so do you see a world when there's like

5856
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
so do you see a world when there's like
 

5857
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,149
so do you see a world when there's like
hundreds of millions of tesla bots

5858
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:06,159
hundreds of millions of tesla bots
 

5859
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:08,070
hundreds of millions of tesla bots
doing different performing different

5860
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:08,080
doing different performing different
 

5861
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:12,149
doing different performing different
tasks throughout the world

5862
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:12,159
tasks throughout the world
 

5863
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:13,270
tasks throughout the world
yeah i haven't really thought about it

5864
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,280
yeah i haven't really thought about it
 

5865
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,790
yeah i haven't really thought about it
that far into the future but i guess

5866
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:14,800
that far into the future but i guess
 

5867
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,590
that far into the future but i guess
that there may be something like that um

5868
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:17,600
that there may be something like that um
 

5869
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,229
that there may be something like that um
so

5870
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239

 

5871
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,470

ask a wild question so

5872
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:22,480
ask a wild question so
 

5873
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,790
ask a wild question so
the the number of tesla cars has been

5874
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:24,800
the the number of tesla cars has been
 

5875
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,790
the the number of tesla cars has been
accelerating there's been close to 2

5876
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:26,800
accelerating there's been close to 2
 

5877
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,950
accelerating there's been close to 2
million produced many of them have

5878
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:28,960
million produced many of them have
 

5879
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,030
million produced many of them have
autopilot i think we're over 2 million

5880
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:31,040
autopilot i think we're over 2 million
 

5881
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,310
autopilot i think we're over 2 million
now yeah

5882
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:32,320
now yeah
 

5883
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,590
now yeah
do you think there will ever be a time

5884
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:33,600
do you think there will ever be a time
 

5885
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,910
do you think there will ever be a time
when there will be more tesla bots

5886
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
when there will be more tesla bots
 

5887
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:40,629
when there will be more tesla bots
than tesla cars

5888
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:40,639

 

5889
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,390

yeah i i i i

5890
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:42,400
yeah i i i i
 

5891
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:43,750
yeah i i i i
you know actually it's funny you asked

5892
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:43,760
you know actually it's funny you asked
 

5893
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,109
you know actually it's funny you asked
this question because normally i do try

5894
01:39:45,109 --> 01:39:45,119
this question because normally i do try
 

5895
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:46,229
this question because normally i do try
to think

5896
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:46,239
to think
 

5897
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,270
to think
pretty far into the future but i haven't

5898
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:47,280
pretty far into the future but i haven't
 

5899
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,830
pretty far into the future but i haven't
really thought that far into the future

5900
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:49,840
really thought that far into the future
 

5901
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,430
really thought that far into the future
with the with the

5902
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:51,440
with the with the
 

5903
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:55,430
with the with the
tesla bot or it's code named optimus

5904
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:55,440
tesla bot or it's code named optimus
 

5905
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,109
tesla bot or it's code named optimus
i call it optimus subprime

5906
01:39:59,109 --> 01:39:59,119

 

5907
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:01,109

because that's not it's not like a giant

5908
01:40:01,109 --> 01:40:01,119
because that's not it's not like a giant
 

5909
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:04,310
because that's not it's not like a giant
you know transformer robot um

5910
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:04,320
you know transformer robot um
 

5911
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,350
you know transformer robot um
so

5912
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:05,360
so
 

5913
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,870
so
uh

5914
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:06,880
uh
 

5915
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,790
uh
but it's meant to be a general purpose

5916
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:08,800
but it's meant to be a general purpose
 

5917
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,390
but it's meant to be a general purpose
help help robot

5918
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,400
help help robot
 

5919
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:14,550
help help robot
um

5920
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:14,560

 

5921
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,070

and and basically like like the things

5922
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:16,080
and and basically like like the things
 

5923
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,030
and and basically like like the things
that were

5924
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,040
that were
 

5925
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,390
that were
basically

5926
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:18,400
basically
 

5927
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,990
basically
like tesla

5928
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:20,000
like tesla
 

5929
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,189
like tesla
i think um is the has the most advanced

5930
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:23,199
i think um is the has the most advanced
 

5931
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:24,870
i think um is the has the most advanced
real-world ai

5932
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:24,880
real-world ai
 

5933
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,229
real-world ai
uh for interacting with the real world

5934
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:26,239
uh for interacting with the real world
 

5935
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:27,910
uh for interacting with the real world
which we've developed as a function of

5936
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:27,920
which we've developed as a function of
 

5937
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,070
which we've developed as a function of
to to make self-driving work

5938
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:30,080
to to make self-driving work
 

5939
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,149
to to make self-driving work
um and so

5940
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:32,159
um and so
 

5941
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,310
um and so
along with custom hardware and

5942
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:34,320
along with custom hardware and
 

5943
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,669
along with custom hardware and
like a lot of

5944
01:40:35,669 --> 01:40:35,679
like a lot of
 

5945
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:37,910
like a lot of
you know uh hardcore low-level software

5946
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:37,920
you know uh hardcore low-level software
 

5947
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,750
you know uh hardcore low-level software
to have it run efficiently and be you

5948
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:39,760
to have it run efficiently and be you
 

5949
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,590
to have it run efficiently and be you
know power efficient because because you

5950
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:41,600
know power efficient because because you
 

5951
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,430
know power efficient because because you
know it's one thing to do neural nets if

5952
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
know it's one thing to do neural nets if
 

5953
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,790
know it's one thing to do neural nets if
you've got a gigantic server room with

5954
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:44,800
you've got a gigantic server room with
 

5955
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,950
you've got a gigantic server room with
10 000 computers but now let's say you

5956
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:46,960
10 000 computers but now let's say you
 

5957
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,550
10 000 computers but now let's say you
just you have to now distill that down

5958
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:48,560
just you have to now distill that down
 

5959
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:49,430
just you have to now distill that down
into

5960
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:49,440
into
 

5961
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,950
into
one computer that's running at low power

5962
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:50,960
one computer that's running at low power
 

5963
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,350
one computer that's running at low power
in a humanoid robot or a car

5964
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:53,360
in a humanoid robot or a car
 

5965
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,629
in a humanoid robot or a car
that's actually very difficult a lot of

5966
01:40:54,629 --> 01:40:54,639
that's actually very difficult a lot of
 

5967
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:56,070
that's actually very difficult a lot of
hardcore software work is required for

5968
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:56,080
hardcore software work is required for
 

5969
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,950
hardcore software work is required for
that

5970
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:56,960
that
 

5971
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,950
that
um

5972
01:40:58,950 --> 01:40:58,960
um
 

5973
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,669
um
so

5974
01:40:59,669 --> 01:40:59,679
so
 

5975
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,709
so
so since we're kind of like solving the

5976
01:41:02,709 --> 01:41:02,719
so since we're kind of like solving the
 

5977
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:05,030
so since we're kind of like solving the
navigate the real world

5978
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:05,040
navigate the real world
 

5979
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,510
navigate the real world
with neural nets problem for

5980
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:07,520
with neural nets problem for
 

5981
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:08,950
with neural nets problem for
cars which are kind of like robots with

5982
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:08,960
cars which are kind of like robots with
 

5983
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,990
cars which are kind of like robots with
four wheels

5984
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:10,000
four wheels
 

5985
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,590
four wheels
then it's like kind of a natural

5986
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:11,600
then it's like kind of a natural
 

5987
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,590
then it's like kind of a natural
extension of that is to

5988
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:13,600
extension of that is to
 

5989
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,910
extension of that is to
put it in a robot with arms and legs uh

5990
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:17,920
put it in a robot with arms and legs uh
 

5991
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,310
put it in a robot with arms and legs uh
and actually you know actuators um

5992
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,320
and actually you know actuators um
 

5993
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,109
and actually you know actuators um
so

5994
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:23,119

 

5995
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,030

um

5996
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,040
um
 

5997
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,750
um
like like the the two

5998
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:27,760
like like the the two
 

5999
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,350
like like the the two
like the hard things are like you

6000
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:29,360
like the hard things are like you
 

6001
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,430
like the hard things are like you
basically need to make the

6002
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,440
basically need to make the
 

6003
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,109
basically need to make the
have the rower be intelligent enough to

6004
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:33,119
have the rower be intelligent enough to
 

6005
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:34,550
have the rower be intelligent enough to
interact in a sensible way with the

6006
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:34,560
interact in a sensible way with the
 

6007
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,750
interact in a sensible way with the
environment

6008
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:35,760
environment
 

6009
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:36,870
environment
um

6010
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:36,880
um
 

6011
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,030
um
so you need real real world ai and you

6012
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:39,040
so you need real real world ai and you
 

6013
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:39,990
so you need real real world ai and you
need

6014
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:40,000
need
 

6015
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,350
need
to be very good at um manufacturing

6016
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:43,360
to be very good at um manufacturing
 

6017
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,030
to be very good at um manufacturing
which is a very hard problem tails is

6018
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:45,040
which is a very hard problem tails is
 

6019
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,550
which is a very hard problem tails is
very good at manufacturing

6020
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:46,560
very good at manufacturing
 

6021
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,070
very good at manufacturing
and also uh has the real world ai so

6022
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:50,080
and also uh has the real world ai so
 

6023
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,629
and also uh has the real world ai so
making the humanoid robot work is

6024
01:41:52,629 --> 01:41:52,639
making the humanoid robot work is
 

6025
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,510
making the humanoid robot work is
uh basically it means developing

6026
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:55,520
uh basically it means developing
 

6027
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,669
uh basically it means developing
custom

6028
01:41:57,669 --> 01:41:57,679
custom
 

6029
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,629
custom
motors and sensors

6030
01:42:00,629 --> 01:42:00,639
motors and sensors
 

6031
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:02,070
motors and sensors
that that are different from what a car

6032
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,080
that that are different from what a car
 

6033
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,030
that that are different from what a car
would use

6034
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:03,040
would use
 

6035
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:03,990
would use
um

6036
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:04,000
um
 

6037
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,149
um
but we also we have

6038
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:06,159
but we also we have
 

6039
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:07,910
but we also we have
um

6040
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:07,920
um
 

6041
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,270
um
i think with the the best expertise in

6042
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:11,280
i think with the the best expertise in
 

6043
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,830
i think with the the best expertise in
developing advanced electric motors and

6044
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:13,840
developing advanced electric motors and
 

6045
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,310
developing advanced electric motors and
power electronics so

6046
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:16,320
power electronics so
 

6047
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,310
power electronics so
it just has to be for

6048
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,320
it just has to be for
 

6049
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,070
it just has to be for
humanoid robot application on a car

6050
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:22,080

 

6051
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:25,590

still you do talk about love sometimes

6052
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:25,600
still you do talk about love sometimes
 

6053
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,669
still you do talk about love sometimes
so let me ask this isn't like for like

6054
01:42:27,669 --> 01:42:27,679
so let me ask this isn't like for like
 

6055
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:29,350
so let me ask this isn't like for like
sex robots or something i love is the

6056
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:29,360
sex robots or something i love is the
 

6057
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,709
sex robots or something i love is the
answer

6058
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:30,719
answer
 

6059
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:31,830
answer
yes

6060
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:31,840
yes
 

6061
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,270
yes
uh

6062
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280
uh
 

6063
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,030
uh
there is something compelling

6064
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
there is something compelling
 

6065
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,590
there is something compelling
to us not compelling but we connect with

6066
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:37,600
to us not compelling but we connect with
 

6067
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,550
to us not compelling but we connect with
the

6068
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:38,560
the
 

6069
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,629
the
humanoid robots or even lego robots like

6070
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:40,639

austin a lot of people have dogs
there seems to be a huge opportunity to

6086
01:42:58,550 --> 01:42:58,560
there seems to be a huge opportunity to
 

6087
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,830
there seems to be a huge opportunity to
also have robots that decrease

6088
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:01,840
also have robots that decrease
 

6089
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,590
also have robots that decrease
the uh

6090
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:03,600
the uh
 

6091
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,430
the uh
the the amount of loneliness in the

6092
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:05,440
the the amount of loneliness in the
 

6093
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,229
the the amount of loneliness in the
world or help us humans connect with

6094
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:08,239
world or help us humans connect with
 

6095
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:09,669
world or help us humans connect with
each with each other

6096
01:43:09,669 --> 01:43:09,679
each with each other
 

6097
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:11,990
each with each other
so in a way that dogs can

6098
01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:12,000
so in a way that dogs can
 

6099
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,229
so in a way that dogs can
um do you think about that we test about

6100
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:14,239
um do you think about that we test about
 

6101
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,390
um do you think about that we test about
it all or is it really focused on the

6102
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:16,400
it all or is it really focused on the
 

6103
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,590
it all or is it really focused on the
problem of

6104
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:17,600
problem of
 

6105
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,750
problem of
of performing specific tasks not

6106
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:19,760
of performing specific tasks not
 

6107
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,750
of performing specific tasks not
connecting with humans

6108
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:21,760
connecting with humans
 

6109
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,270
connecting with humans
um

6110
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:23,280
um
 

6111
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,350
um
i mean to be honest i have not actually

6112
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:25,360
i mean to be honest i have not actually
 

6113
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,189
i mean to be honest i have not actually
thought about it from the companionship

6114
01:43:27,189 --> 01:43:27,199
thought about it from the companionship
 

6115
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,189
thought about it from the companionship
standpoint but i think it actually would

6116
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:29,199
standpoint but i think it actually would
 

6117
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:31,189
standpoint but i think it actually would
end up being it could be actually a very

6118
01:43:31,189 --> 01:43:31,199
end up being it could be actually a very
 

6119
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:32,790
end up being it could be actually a very
good companion

6120
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:32,800
good companion
 

6121
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,229
good companion
um

6122
01:43:34,229 --> 01:43:34,239
um
 

6123
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:35,030
um
and

6124
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,040
and
 

6125
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,950
and
it could

6126
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:36,960
it could
 

6127
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,910
it could
develop like a personality

6128
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:39,920
develop like a personality
 

6129
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,189
develop like a personality
uh

6130
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
uh
 

6131
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,350
uh
over time that is that is like

6132
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:43,360
over time that is that is like
 

6133
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,350
over time that is that is like
unique like uh you know it's not like

6134
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
unique like uh you know it's not like
 

6135
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,270
unique like uh you know it's not like
they're just all the robots are the same

6136
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:47,280
they're just all the robots are the same
 

6137
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:49,669
they're just all the robots are the same
and that personality could evolve

6138
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:49,679
and that personality could evolve
 

6139
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:53,350
and that personality could evolve
to be you know uh

6140
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:53,360
to be you know uh
 

6141
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,149
to be you know uh
match match the the the owner or the you

think that's a huge opportunity i think
 

6155
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,189
think that's a huge opportunity i think
yeah no that's interesting

6156
01:44:11,189 --> 01:44:11,199
yeah no that's interesting
 

6157
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:13,669
yeah no that's interesting
like um

6158
01:44:13,669 --> 01:44:13,679
like um
 

6159
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:14,390
like um

the
 

6161
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,550
the
because you know like there's a

6162
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:16,560
because you know like there's a
 

6163
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,790
because you know like there's a
japanese phrase i like the uh

6164
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:18,800
japanese phrase i like the uh
 

6165
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,709
japanese phrase i like the uh
wabi-sabi you know uh the subtle

6166
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:20,719
wabi-sabi you know uh the subtle
 

6167
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:21,990
wabi-sabi you know uh the subtle
imperfections

6168
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:22,000
imperfections
 

6169
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,990
imperfections
are what makes something special

6170
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,000
are what makes something special
 

6171
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,149
are what makes something special
and the subtle imperfections of the

6172
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:26,159
and the subtle imperfections of the
 

6173
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,910
and the subtle imperfections of the
personality of the robot

6174
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:27,920
personality of the robot
 

6175
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,830
personality of the robot
mapped to the subtle imperfections of

6176
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:29,840
mapped to the subtle imperfections of
 

6177
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,830
mapped to the subtle imperfections of
the robot's

6178
01:44:32,830 --> 01:44:32,840

 

6179
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,590

human friend i don't know owner sounds

6180

human friend i don't know owner sounds
 

6181
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,189
human friend i don't know owner sounds
like maybe the wrong word but

6182
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:37,199
like maybe the wrong word but
 

6183
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:39,270
like maybe the wrong word but
um

6184
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:39,280
um
 

6185
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,350
um
could actually make an incredible buddy

6186
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:41,360
could actually make an incredible buddy
 

6187
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,310
could actually make an incredible buddy
basically and in that way the r2d2 or

6188
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:44,320
basically and in that way the r2d2 or
 

6189
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,470
basically and in that way the r2d2 or
like a c-3po sort of thing you know so

6190
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:46,480
like a c-3po sort of thing you know so
 

6191
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,830
like a c-3po sort of thing you know so
from a machine learning perspective

6192
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:49,840
from a machine learning perspective
 

6193
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,510
from a machine learning perspective
i think the flaws

6194
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:51,520
i think the flaws
 

6195
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,149
i think the flaws
being a feature is really nice you could

6196
01:44:54,149 --> 01:44:54,159
being a feature is really nice you could
 

6197
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:56,229
being a feature is really nice you could
be quite terrible at being a robot for

6198
01:44:56,229 --> 01:44:56,239
be quite terrible at being a robot for
 

6199
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:57,350
be quite terrible at being a robot for
quite a while

6200
01:44:57,350 --> 01:44:57,360
quite a while
 

6201
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,109
quite a while
in the general home environment or all

6202
01:44:59,109 --> 01:44:59,119
in the general home environment or all
 

6203
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:01,910
in the general home environment or all
the in general world and that's kind of

6204
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
the in general world and that's kind of
 

6205
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,070
the in general world and that's kind of
adorable and that's like those are your

6206
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,080
adorable and that's like those are your
 

6207
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,910
adorable and that's like those are your
flaws and you fall in love with those

6208
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:05,920
flaws and you fall in love with those
 

6209
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,910
flaws and you fall in love with those
flaws so it's it's

6210
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:07,920
flaws so it's it's
 

6211
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,669
flaws so it's it's
very different than autonomous driving

6212
01:45:09,669 --> 01:45:09,679
very different than autonomous driving
 

6213
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,030
very different than autonomous driving
where it's a very high stakes

6214
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:11,040
where it's a very high stakes
 

6215
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,030
where it's a very high stakes
environment you cannot mess up

6216
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:13,040
environment you cannot mess up
 

6217
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,070
environment you cannot mess up
and so

6218
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:14,080
and so
 

6219
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,470
and so
yeah it's more fun to be a robot in the

6220
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:16,480
yeah it's more fun to be a robot in the
 

6221
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,510
yeah it's more fun to be a robot in the
home

6222
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:17,520
home
 

6223
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,590
home
yeah in fact if you think of like c-3po

6224
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:19,600
yeah in fact if you think of like c-3po
 

6225
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,390
yeah in fact if you think of like c-3po
and

6226
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:20,400
and
 

6227
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,470
and
r2d2 yeah like they actually had a lot

6228
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:22,480
r2d2 yeah like they actually had a lot
 

6229
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,390
r2d2 yeah like they actually had a lot
of like flaws and imperfections and

6230
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:24,400
of like flaws and imperfections and
 

6231
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,310
of like flaws and imperfections and
silly things and they would argue with

6232
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:26,320
silly things and they would argue with
 

6233
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,470
silly things and they would argue with
each other

6234
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:28,480
each other
 

6235
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,470
each other
and um were they actually good at doing

6236
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:30,480
and um were they actually good at doing
 

6237
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,910
and um were they actually good at doing
anything

6238
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:31,920
anything
 

6239
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,910
anything
i'm not exactly sure

6240
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:33,920
i'm not exactly sure
 

6241
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,750
i'm not exactly sure
they definitely added a lot to the story

6242
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:35,760
they definitely added a lot to the story
 

6243
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,229
they definitely added a lot to the story
um

6244
01:45:38,229 --> 01:45:38,239

 

6245
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:39,990

but but there's they're sort of quirky

6246
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:40,000
but but there's they're sort of quirky
 

6247
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,910
but but there's they're sort of quirky
elements and

6248
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:41,920
elements and
 

6249
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:42,950
elements and
you know

6250
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:42,960
you know
 

6251
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,709
you know
that they would like make mistakes and

6252
01:45:44,709 --> 01:45:44,719
that they would like make mistakes and
 

6253
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,870
that they would like make mistakes and
do things like it was like uh it made

6254
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:46,880
do things like it was like uh it made
 

6255
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,470
do things like it was like uh it made
them

6256
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:48,480
them
 

6257
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,709
them
relatable i don't know um

6258
01:45:50,709 --> 01:45:50,719
relatable i don't know um
 

6259
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,229
relatable i don't know um
endearing

6260
01:45:52,229 --> 01:45:52,239
endearing
 

6261
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:53,350
endearing
so

6262
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:53,360
so
 

6263
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,709
so
so yeah i think that that could be

6264
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
so yeah i think that that could be
 

6265
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:57,189
so yeah i think that that could be
something that uh probably would happen

6266
01:45:57,189 --> 01:45:57,199
something that uh probably would happen
 

6267
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:58,790
something that uh probably would happen
um

6268
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:58,800
um
 

6269
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,030
um
but our initial focus is just to make it

6270
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:01,040
but our initial focus is just to make it
 

6271
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,229
but our initial focus is just to make it
useful uh so that so

6272
01:46:04,229 --> 01:46:04,239
useful uh so that so
 

6273
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:05,590
useful uh so that so
um

6274
01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:05,600
um
 

6275
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:06,870
um
i'm confident we'll get it done i'm not

6276
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:06,880
i'm confident we'll get it done i'm not
 

6277
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,189
i'm confident we'll get it done i'm not
sure what the exact time frame is but uh

6278
01:46:09,189 --> 01:46:09,199
sure what the exact time frame is but uh
 

6279
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:11,030
sure what the exact time frame is but uh
like we'll probably have i don't know

6280
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:11,040
like we'll probably have i don't know
 

6281
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,790
like we'll probably have i don't know
a decent prototype

6282
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:12,800
a decent prototype
 

6283
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,669
a decent prototype
towards the end of next year or

6284
01:46:13,669 --> 01:46:13,679
towards the end of next year or
 

6285
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:15,350
towards the end of next year or
something like that

6286
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:15,360
something like that
 

6287
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,109
something like that
and it's cool that it's connected to

6288
01:46:17,109 --> 01:46:17,119
and it's cool that it's connected to
 

6289
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:19,270
and it's cool that it's connected to
tesla the car

6290
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,280
tesla the car
 

6291
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,950
tesla the car
the so so yeah

6292
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:20,960
the so so yeah
 

6293
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,030
the so so yeah
it's using a lot of you know it would

6294
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:23,040
it's using a lot of you know it would
 

6295
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,830
it's using a lot of you know it would
use the autopilot inference computer and

6296
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:25,840
use the autopilot inference computer and
 

6297
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,750
use the autopilot inference computer and
um a lot of the training that we've done

6298
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:27,760
um a lot of the training that we've done
 

6299
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,669
um a lot of the training that we've done
for the four cars in terms of

6300
01:46:29,669 --> 01:46:29,679
for the four cars in terms of
 

6301
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:31,189
for the four cars in terms of
recognizing

6302
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:31,199
recognizing
 

6303
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,790
recognizing
real world things could be applied

6304
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:32,800
real world things could be applied
 

6305
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,950
real world things could be applied
directly to the

6306
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:34,960
directly to the
 

6307
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:37,270
directly to the
to the robot um

6308
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:37,280
to the robot um
 

6309
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,270
to the robot um
so it but but there's there's a lot of

6310
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:39,280
so it but but there's there's a lot of
 

6311
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,870
so it but but there's there's a lot of
custom actuators and sensors that need

6312
01:46:40,870 --> 01:46:40,880
custom actuators and sensors that need
 

6313
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,390
custom actuators and sensors that need
to be developed

6314
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:42,400
to be developed
 

6315
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,470
to be developed
and an extra module on top of the vector

6316
01:46:44,470 --> 01:46:44,480
and an extra module on top of the vector
 

6317
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,350
and an extra module on top of the vector
space

6318
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:45,360
space
 

6319
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,950
space
uh for love

6320
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:46,960
uh for love
 

6321
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,470
uh for love
oh yeah that's missing

6322
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:50,480

 

6323
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:53,109

okay okay add that to the car too

6324
01:46:53,109 --> 01:46:53,119
okay okay add that to the car too
 

6325
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:54,470
okay okay add that to the car too
that's true

6326
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
that's true
 

6327
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,350
that's true
um

6328
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:55,360
um
 

6329
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,270
um
that could be useful in all environments

6330
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:57,280
that could be useful in all environments
 

6331
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,709
that could be useful in all environments
like you said a lot of people argue in

6332
01:46:58,709 --> 01:46:58,719
like you said a lot of people argue in
 

6333
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,390
like you said a lot of people argue in
the car so maybe people can help them

6334
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:00,400
the car so maybe people can help them
 

6335
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,669
the car so maybe people can help them
out

6336
01:47:01,669 --> 01:47:01,679
out
 

6337
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,830
out
uh you're a student of history fan of

6338
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:03,840
uh you're a student of history fan of
 

6339
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,910
uh you're a student of history fan of
dan carlin's hardcore history podcast

6340
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:05,920
dan carlin's hardcore history podcast
 

6341
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,390
dan carlin's hardcore history podcast
yeah that's great greatest podcast ever

6342
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:08,400
yeah that's great greatest podcast ever
 

6343
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,550
yeah that's great greatest podcast ever
yeah i think it is actually

6344
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:10,560
yeah i think it is actually
 

6345
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,790
yeah i think it is actually
i i it does it almost doesn't really

6346
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:12,800
i i it does it almost doesn't really
 

6347
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,629
i i it does it almost doesn't really
count as a podcast yeah it's it's it's

6348
01:47:14,629 --> 01:47:14,639
count as a podcast yeah it's it's it's
 

6349
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:17,350
count as a podcast yeah it's it's it's
more like a audiobook yeah so you were

6350
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:17,360
more like a audiobook yeah so you were
 

6351
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,950
more like a audiobook yeah so you were
on the podcast with dan i just had to

6352
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:18,960
on the podcast with dan i just had to
 

6353
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,950
on the podcast with dan i just had to
chat with him about it

6354
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:20,960
chat with him about it
 

6355
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,550
chat with him about it
he said you guys want military and all

6356
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
he said you guys want military and all
 

6357
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,750
he said you guys want military and all
that kind of stuff uh yeah it's

6358
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:23,760
that kind of stuff uh yeah it's
 

6359
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,910
that kind of stuff uh yeah it's
literally uh it was basically um

6360
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
literally uh it was basically um
 

6361
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,030
literally uh it was basically um
uh

6362
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:29,040
uh
 

6363
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,870
uh
i think it should be titled engineer

6364
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:30,880
i think it should be titled engineer
 

6365
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,510
i think it should be titled engineer
wars uh essentially like like when

6366
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:33,520
wars uh essentially like like when
 

6367
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,430
wars uh essentially like like when
there's a rapid change in the rate of

6368
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:35,440
there's a rapid change in the rate of
 

6369
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,470
there's a rapid change in the rate of
technology

6370
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,480
technology
 

6371
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,070
technology
then uh

6372
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,080
then uh
 

6373
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,310
then uh
engineering plays a pivotal role in in

6374
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,320
engineering plays a pivotal role in in
 

6375
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,990
engineering plays a pivotal role in in
victory in battle

6376
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:42,000
victory in battle
 

6377
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,750
victory in battle
um

6378
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:43,760
um
 

6379
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,350
um
how far in back in history did you go

6380
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:45,360
how far in back in history did you go
 

6381
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,870
how far in back in history did you go
did you go world war ii

6382
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:46,880
did you go world war ii
 

6383
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,310
did you go world war ii
uh it was mostly

6384
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:48,320
uh it was mostly
 

6385
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,709
uh it was mostly
well it was supposed to be a deep dive

6386
01:47:50,709 --> 01:47:50,719
well it was supposed to be a deep dive
 

6387
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:52,950
well it was supposed to be a deep dive
on fighters and bomber

6388
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
on fighters and bomber
 

6389
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,350
on fighters and bomber
uh technology in world war ii um but

6390
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,360
uh technology in world war ii um but
 

6391
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,790
uh technology in world war ii um but
that ended up being more wide-ranging

6392
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:56,800
that ended up being more wide-ranging
 

6393
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,390
that ended up being more wide-ranging
than that um

6394
01:47:58,390 --> 01:47:58,400
than that um
 

6395
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,070
than that um
because i just went down the total rat

6396
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:00,080
because i just went down the total rat
 

6397
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,669
because i just went down the total rat
hole of like

6398
01:48:01,669 --> 01:48:01,679
hole of like
 

6399
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:03,590
hole of like
studying all of the fighters and bombers

6400
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:03,600
studying all of the fighters and bombers
 

6401
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,310
studying all of the fighters and bombers
world war ii and like the constant rock

6402
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:06,320
world war ii and like the constant rock
 

6403
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:09,270
world war ii and like the constant rock
paper scissors game that like you know

6404
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:09,280
paper scissors game that like you know
 

6405
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,790
paper scissors game that like you know
uh one country would make this plane

6406
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:10,800
uh one country would make this plane
 

6407
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,149
uh one country would make this plane
that would make a plane to beat that and

6408
01:48:12,149 --> 01:48:12,159
that would make a plane to beat that and
 

6409
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:13,750
that would make a plane to beat that and
that try to make plane to beat that and

6410
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:13,760
that try to make plane to beat that and
 

6411
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,350
that try to make plane to beat that and
then

6412
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:15,360
then
 

6413
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,950
then
and really what matters like the pace of

6414
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:16,960
and really what matters like the pace of
 

6415
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,390
and really what matters like the pace of
innovation um and also access to high

6416
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:20,400
innovation um and also access to high
 

6417
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:21,830
innovation um and also access to high
quality uh

6418
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:21,840
quality uh
 

6419
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,709
quality uh
fuel and uh raw materials

6420
01:48:24,709 --> 01:48:24,719
fuel and uh raw materials
 

6421
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:27,030
fuel and uh raw materials
so like germany had like some amazing

6422
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:27,040
so like germany had like some amazing
 

6423
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,950
so like germany had like some amazing
designs but they couldn't make them uh

6424
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:28,960
designs but they couldn't make them uh
 

6425
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,310
designs but they couldn't make them uh
because they couldn't get their raw

6426
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:30,320
because they couldn't get their raw
 

6427
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,430
because they couldn't get their raw
materials

6428
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:31,440
materials
 

6429
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,629
materials
and uh

6430
01:48:32,629 --> 01:48:32,639
and uh
 

6431
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:33,990
and uh
they they had a real problem with the

6432
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:34,000
they they had a real problem with the
 

6433
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,350
they they had a real problem with the
oil and and and uh fuel basically the

6434
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:37,360
oil and and and uh fuel basically the
 

6435
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,830
oil and and and uh fuel basically the
fuel quality was extremely uh variable

6436
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:39,840
fuel quality was extremely uh variable
 

6437
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,430
fuel quality was extremely uh variable
so the design wasn't the bottom that

6438
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:41,440
so the design wasn't the bottom that
 

6439
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,910
so the design wasn't the bottom that
goes uh yeah like the us had kick-ass

6440
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:43,920
goes uh yeah like the us had kick-ass
 

6441
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,870
goes uh yeah like the us had kick-ass
fuel uh that was like very consistent

6442
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:46,880
fuel uh that was like very consistent
 

6443
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,149
fuel uh that was like very consistent
like the problems if you make a very

6444
01:48:48,149 --> 01:48:48,159
like the problems if you make a very
 

6445
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:50,390
like the problems if you make a very
high performance aircraft engine um in

6446
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:50,400
high performance aircraft engine um in
 

6447
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,669
high performance aircraft engine um in
order to make high performance you have

6448
01:48:51,669 --> 01:48:51,679
order to make high performance you have
 

6449
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:53,189
order to make high performance you have
to um

6450
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199
to um
 

6451
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:56,550
to um
the the

6452
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560

 

6453
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,189

the fuel the aviation gas uh

6454
01:48:59,189 --> 01:48:59,199
the fuel the aviation gas uh
 

6455
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:03,189
the fuel the aviation gas uh
has to be a consistent mixture and uh

6456
01:49:03,189 --> 01:49:03,199
has to be a consistent mixture and uh
 

6457
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:05,669
has to be a consistent mixture and uh
uh it has to have a high high octane

6458
01:49:05,669 --> 01:49:05,679
uh it has to have a high high octane
 

6459
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,189
uh it has to have a high high octane
um

6460
01:49:07,189 --> 01:49:07,199
um
 

6461
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,470
um
like high octane is the most important

6462
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:08,480
like high octane is the most important
 

6463
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,830
like high octane is the most important
thing but also can't have like

6464
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
thing but also can't have like
 

6465
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,310
thing but also can't have like
impurities and stuff uh because you'll

6466
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:12,320
impurities and stuff uh because you'll
 

6467
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,790
impurities and stuff uh because you'll
fill up the engine and and and german

6468
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:14,800
fill up the engine and and and german
 

6469
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,390
fill up the engine and and and german
just never had good access oil like they

6470
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:16,400
just never had good access oil like they
 

6471
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,629
just never had good access oil like they
tried to get it by invading the caucasus

6472
01:49:18,629 --> 01:49:18,639
tried to get it by invading the caucasus
 

6473
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:20,260
tried to get it by invading the caucasus
um but that didn't work too well

6474
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:20,270
um but that didn't work too well
 

6475
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:21,669
um but that didn't work too well
[Laughter]

6476
01:49:21,669 --> 01:49:21,679
[Laughter]
 

6477
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:26,149
[Laughter]
that never works well for him

6478
01:49:26,149 --> 01:49:26,159

 

6479
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,229

that's nice for you so they always was

6480
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:28,239
that's nice for you so they always was
 

6481
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:29,589
that's nice for you so they always was
germany was always struggling with [\h__\h]

6482
01:49:29,589 --> 01:49:29,599
germany was always struggling with [\h__\h]
 

6483
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:31,589
germany was always struggling with [\h__\h]
with basically shitty oil um and then

6484
01:49:31,589 --> 01:49:31,599
with basically shitty oil um and then
 

6485
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:33,589
with basically shitty oil um and then
they could not uh

6486
01:49:33,589 --> 01:49:33,599
they could not uh
 

6487
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,669
they could not uh
they couldn't count on a on high quality

6488
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:35,679
they couldn't count on a on high quality
 

6489
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:37,430
they couldn't count on a on high quality
fuel for their aircraft so then they had

6490
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:37,440
fuel for their aircraft so then they had
 

6491
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,030
fuel for their aircraft so then they had
to add all they have all these additives

6492
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:39,040
to add all they have all these additives
 

6493
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,470
to add all they have all these additives
and and stuff

6494
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:40,480
and and stuff
 

6495
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,109
and and stuff
uh so um

6496
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:43,119
uh so um
 

6497
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:45,589
uh so um
uh whereas the u.s had awesome fuel um

6498
01:49:45,589 --> 01:49:45,599
uh whereas the u.s had awesome fuel um
 

6499
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:46,870
uh whereas the u.s had awesome fuel um
and that provided that to britain as

6500
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:46,880
and that provided that to britain as
 

6501
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,109
and that provided that to britain as
well um so

6502
01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:49,119
well um so
 

6503
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:50,629
well um so
that allowed the british and the

6504
01:49:50,629 --> 01:49:50,639
that allowed the british and the
 

6505
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:52,950
that allowed the british and the
americans to design aircraft engines

6506
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:52,960
americans to design aircraft engines
 

6507
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,870
americans to design aircraft engines
that were uh super high performance

6508
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:54,880
that were uh super high performance
 

6509
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,830
that were uh super high performance
better than anything else in the world

6510
01:49:57,830 --> 01:49:57,840
better than anything else in the world
 

6511
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,430
better than anything else in the world
and germany germany could could design

6512
01:49:59,430 --> 01:49:59,440
and germany germany could could design
 

6513
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,390
and germany germany could could design
the engines they just didn't have the

6514
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:00,400
the engines they just didn't have the
 

6515
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:03,589
the engines they just didn't have the
fuel and then also the likes of the the

6516
01:50:03,589 --> 01:50:03,599
fuel and then also the likes of the the
 

6517
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:05,589
fuel and then also the likes of the the
uh the quality of the aluminum allies

6518
01:50:05,589 --> 01:50:05,599
uh the quality of the aluminum allies
 

6519
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,790
uh the quality of the aluminum allies
that they were getting was also not that

6520
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:06,800
that they were getting was also not that
 

6521
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,750
that they were getting was also not that
great and so yeah did you is this like

6522
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:09,760
great and so yeah did you is this like
 

6523
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,430
great and so yeah did you is this like
uh you talked about all this with dan

6524
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:11,440
uh you talked about all this with dan
 

6525
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,510
uh you talked about all this with dan
yep awesome

moments does it help you gain insight
 

6539
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,790
moments does it help you gain insight
about human nature about human behavior

um
 

6833
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,589
um
once you know what the sort like

6834
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:41,599
once you know what the sort like
 

6835
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:43,990
once you know what the sort like
characters stand for actually

then reading russian becomes a lot

6838
01:55:46,550 --> 01:55:46,560
then reading russian becomes a lot
 

6839
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,830
then reading russian becomes a lot
easier because there are a lot of words

6840
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:47,840
easier because there are a lot of words
 

6841
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,830
easier because there are a lot of words
that are actually the same like bank is

6842
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:49,840
that are actually the same like bank is
 

6843
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:50,310
that are actually the same like bank is
bank

6844
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:50,320
bank
 

6845
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,310

and uh

6850
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:55,440
and uh
 

6851
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,350
and uh
so find the words that are exactly the

6852
01:55:57,350 --> 01:55:57,360
so find the words that are exactly the
 

6853
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,629
so find the words that are exactly the
same and now you start to understand

6854
01:55:58,629 --> 01:55:58,639
same and now you start to understand
 

6855
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:00,790
same and now you start to understand
cyrillic yeah if you can if you can

6856

cyrillic yeah if you can if you can
sound it out then yeah

6858
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:03,280
sound it out then yeah
 

6859

sound it out then yeah
it's much

6860
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:04,480
it's much
 

6861
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,830
it's much
there's at least some commonality of

6862
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:05,840
there's at least some commonality of

words what about the culture
 

6865
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:11,350
words what about the culture
you uh you love great engineering

6866
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:11,360
you uh you love great engineering
 

6867
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:13,350

physics there's a tradition of the

6868
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:13,360
physics there's a tradition of the
 

6869
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,350
physics there's a tradition of the
sciences there sure you look at the 20th

6870
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:15,360
sciences there sure you look at the 20th
 

6871
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,830
sciences there sure you look at the 20th
century from rocketry so

6872
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:17,840
century from rocketry so
 

6873
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,350
century from rocketry so
you know some of the greatest rockets of

6874
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:19,360
you know some of the greatest rockets of
 

6875
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:21,669
you know some of the greatest rockets of
the space exploration has been done in

6876
01:56:21,669 --> 01:56:21,679
the space exploration has been done in
 

6877
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:23,510
the space exploration has been done in
the soviet in the former soviet union

01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,400
yeah so do you draw inspiration from
 

6881
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,350
yeah so do you draw inspiration from
that history just how this culture that

6882
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:29,360
that history just how this culture that
 

6883

that history just how this culture that
in many ways i mean one of the sad

6884
01:56:31,189 --> 01:56:31,199
in many ways i mean one of the sad
 

6885
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,030
in many ways i mean one of the sad
things is because of the language

6886
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,040
things is because of the language
 

6887

things is because of the language
a lot of it is lost to history because

6888
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:35,520
a lot of it is lost to history because
 

6889
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:37,510
a lot of it is lost to history because
it's not translated all those kinds of

6890
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:37,520
it's not translated all those kinds of
 

6891
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,430
it's not translated all those kinds of
because it it is in some ways an

6892
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
because it it is in some ways an
 

6893
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,750
because it it is in some ways an
isolated culture it flourishes within

6894
01:56:41,750 --> 01:56:41,760
isolated culture it flourishes within
 

6895
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,750
isolated culture it flourishes within
its within its borders

6896
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:43,760
its within its borders
 

6897
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:46,790

those folks from from the history of
 

6901
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:51,270
those folks from from the history of
science engineering there

6902
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:51,280
science engineering there
 

6903
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:54,950
science engineering there
i mean the soviet union russia and

just crossed the finishing line at the
 

6991
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,470
just crossed the finishing line at the
same time yeah nobody would watch yeah

6992
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:18,480
same time yeah nobody would watch yeah
 

6993
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:21,109
same time yeah nobody would watch yeah
uh and and people wouldn't try hard to

01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:15,679
um
 

7053
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:17,270
um
but but hydrogen has a lot of challenges

7054
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:17,280
but but hydrogen has a lot of challenges
 

7055
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,189
but but hydrogen has a lot of challenges
it's very low density it's a it's a deep

7056
01:59:19,189 --> 01:59:19,199
it's very low density it's a it's a deep
 

7057
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:21,189
it's very low density it's a it's a deep
cryogen so it's only liquid at a very

7058
01:59:21,189 --> 01:59:21,199
cryogen so it's only liquid at a very
 

7059
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:23,189
cryogen so it's only liquid at a very
you know very close to absolute zero

7060
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:23,199
you know very close to absolute zero
 

7061
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:26,550
you know very close to absolute zero
requires a lot of insulation it's um

7062
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:26,560
requires a lot of insulation it's um
 

7063
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:30,470
requires a lot of insulation it's um
so it is a lot of challenges there

7064
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:30,480
so it is a lot of challenges there
 

7065
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,669
so it is a lot of challenges there
and um

7066
01:59:31,669 --> 01:59:31,679
and um
 

7067
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:33,350
and um
and i was actually reading a bit about

7068
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:33,360
and i was actually reading a bit about
 

7069
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:36,470
and i was actually reading a bit about
uh russian rocket engine development and

7070
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:36,480
uh russian rocket engine development and
 

7071
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,430
uh russian rocket engine development and
um

7072
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:37,440
um
 

7073
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,950
um
at least the impression i had was that

7074
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:38,960
at least the impression i had was that
 

7075
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,550
at least the impression i had was that
that uh

7076
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:40,560
that uh
 

7077
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,030
that uh
soviet union russia and ukraine uh

7078
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:43,040
soviet union russia and ukraine uh
 

7079
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,950
soviet union russia and ukraine uh
primarily were

7080
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:44,960
primarily were
 

7081
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,350
primarily were
uh actually in the process of

7082
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:47,360
uh actually in the process of
 

7083
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:50,310
uh actually in the process of
uh switching to meth methylox

7084
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:50,320
uh switching to meth methylox
 

7085
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:53,109
uh switching to meth methylox
um and there were some interesting tests

7086
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:53,119
um and there were some interesting tests
 

7087
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:54,390
um and there were some interesting tests
and data for

7088
01:59:54,390 --> 01:59:54,400
and data for
 

7089
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:57,109
and data for
isp like they were able to get like

7090
01:59:57,109 --> 01:59:57,119
isp like they were able to get like
 

7091
01:59:57,119 --> 02:00:00,310
isp like they were able to get like
up to like a 380 second isp with the

7092
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:00,320
up to like a 380 second isp with the
 

7093
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,070
up to like a 380 second isp with the
meth lux engine and i was like whoa okay

7094
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,080
meth lux engine and i was like whoa okay
 

7095
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,589
meth lux engine and i was like whoa okay
that's

7096
02:00:03,589 --> 02:00:03,599
that's
 

7097
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:06,950
that's
that's actually really impressive so

7098
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:06,960
that's actually really impressive so
 

7099
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,709
that's actually really impressive so
um

7100
02:00:08,709 --> 02:00:08,719
um
 

7101
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:10,070
um
so i think we could you could actually

7102
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:10,080
so i think we could you could actually
 

7103
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,550
so i think we could you could actually
get

7104
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560
get
 

7105
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,030
get
a much lower cost like in optimizing

7106
02:00:15,030 --> 02:00:15,040
a much lower cost like in optimizing
 

7107
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,470
a much lower cost like in optimizing
cost per ton to orbit cost per time to

7108
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:16,480
cost per ton to orbit cost per time to
 

7109
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,870

7110
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:18,880

 

7111
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:19,910

it's uh

7112
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:19,920
it's uh
 

7113
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:22,629
it's uh
i think

7114
02:00:22,629 --> 02:00:22,639

 

7115
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:25,030

7151
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,870

so

7152

so
 

7153
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,629
so
you get it because uh yes are you

7154
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
you get it because uh yes are you

02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:45,109
extreme natural disasters i think it's a
nuclear power is a great way to generate

7178
02:01:45,109 --> 02:01:45,119
nuclear power is a great way to generate
 

7179
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:47,430
nuclear power is a great way to generate
uh electricity

7180
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:47,440
uh electricity
 

7181
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:49,270
uh electricity
um i i don't think we should be shutting

7182
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,280
um i i don't think we should be shutting
 

7183
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,750
um i i don't think we should be shutting
down nuclear power stations

7184

down nuclear power stations
 

7185
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,070
down nuclear power stations
yeah but what about chernobyl

7186
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:54,080
yeah but what about chernobyl
 

7187
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,430
yeah but what about chernobyl
exactly

7188
02:01:55,430 --> 02:01:55,440

uh i think people there's like a lot of

7196
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:00,400
uh i think people there's like a lot of
 

7197
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:04,149
uh i think people there's like a lot of
fear of radiation and stuff um

7198
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:04,159
fear of radiation and stuff um
 

7199
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:05,189
fear of radiation and stuff um
and it's

7200
02:02:05,189 --> 02:02:05,199
and it's
 

7201
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:06,790
and it's
i guess what the problem is like a lot

7202
02:02:06,790 --> 02:02:06,800
i guess what the problem is like a lot
 

7203
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,310
i guess what the problem is like a lot
of people just don't

7204
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:08,320
of people just don't
 

7205
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:09,350
of people just don't
unders

7206
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:09,360
unders
 

7207
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,109
unders
they didn't study

7208
02:02:11,109 --> 02:02:11,119
they didn't study
 

7209
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:12,790
they didn't study
engineering or physics so they don't

7210
02:02:12,790 --> 02:02:12,800
engineering or physics so they don't
 

7211
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,870
engineering or physics so they don't
it's just the word radiation just sounds

7212
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:14,880
it's just the word radiation just sounds
 

7213
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,950
it's just the word radiation just sounds
scary you know so they don't they ha

7214
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:16,960
scary you know so they don't they ha
 

7215
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:18,550
scary you know so they don't they ha
they can't calibrate what radiation

7216
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:18,560
they can't calibrate what radiation
 

7217
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,870
they can't calibrate what radiation
means

7218
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:20,880

 

7219
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:23,350

but radiation is much less dangerous

7220
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:23,360
but radiation is much less dangerous
 

7221
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,790
but radiation is much less dangerous
than than you'd think

7222
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:26,800

 

7223
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:30,149

so

7224
02:02:30,149 --> 02:02:30,159

 

7225
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:34,310

like for example fukushima you know um

7226
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:34,320
like for example fukushima you know um
 

7227
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,229
like for example fukushima you know um
when the fukushima uh problem happened

7228
02:02:36,229 --> 02:02:36,239
when the fukushima uh problem happened
 

7229
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:38,470
when the fukushima uh problem happened
uh

7230
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:38,480
uh
 

7231
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:41,189
uh
do the tsunami the

7232
02:02:41,189 --> 02:02:41,199
do the tsunami the
 

7233
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:43,589
do the tsunami the
i got people in california asking me if

7234
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:43,599
i got people in california asking me if
 

7235
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:45,589
i got people in california asking me if
they should worry about radiation

7236
02:02:45,589 --> 02:02:45,599
they should worry about radiation
 

7237
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:47,669
they should worry about radiation
from fukushima i'm like

7238
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:47,679
from fukushima i'm like
 

7239
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:50,390
from fukushima i'm like
definitely not not even slightly not at

7240
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,400
definitely not not even slightly not at
 

7241
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:51,350
definitely not not even slightly not at
all

7242
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,360
all
 

7243
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:54,070
all
that is crazy

7244
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:54,080
that is crazy
 

7245
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,270
that is crazy
and

7246
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:55,280
and
 

7247
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:57,750
and
just to

7248
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:57,760

 

7249
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:59,109

show like look

7250
02:02:59,109 --> 02:02:59,119
show like look
 

7251
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:01,830
show like look
this is how

7252
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:01,840
this is how
 

7253
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,990
this is how
like the dangers is so much overplayed

7254
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:04,000
like the dangers is so much overplayed
 

7255
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,910
like the dangers is so much overplayed
compared to what what it really

7256
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:05,920
compared to what what it really
 

7257
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:09,030
compared to what what it really
is that i actually flew to fukushima

7258
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:09,040
is that i actually flew to fukushima
 

7259
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,589
is that i actually flew to fukushima
and actually i donated a

7260
02:03:11,589 --> 02:03:11,599
and actually i donated a
 

7261
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:14,470
and actually i donated a
a solar power system for water treatment

7262
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:14,480
a solar power system for water treatment
 

7263
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:17,350
a solar power system for water treatment
plant and

7264
02:03:17,350 --> 02:03:17,360
plant and
 

7265
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:19,189
plant and
and i made a point of

7266
02:03:19,189 --> 02:03:19,199
and i made a point of
 

7267
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:23,589
and i made a point of
eating locally grown vegetables

7268
02:03:23,589 --> 02:03:23,599

 

7269
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:24,950

on tv

7270
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:24,960
on tv
 

7271
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,629
on tv
in fukushima

7272
02:03:28,629 --> 02:03:28,639

 

7273
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:29,510

like

7274
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:29,520
like
 

7275
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:31,350
like
i'm still alive okay

7276
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:31,360
i'm still alive okay
 

7277
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:33,109
i'm still alive okay
so it's not even that the risk of these

7278
02:03:33,109 --> 02:03:33,119
so it's not even that the risk of these
 

7279
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:35,589
so it's not even that the risk of these
events is low but the impact of them is

7280
02:03:35,589 --> 02:03:35,599
events is low but the impact of them is
 

7281
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:38,390
events is low but the impact of them is
the impact is greatly exaggerated it's

7282
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:38,400
the impact is greatly exaggerated it's
 

7283
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,910
the impact is greatly exaggerated it's
just human nature

7284
02:03:39,910 --> 02:03:39,920
just human nature
 

7285
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,189
just human nature
it's people who don't know what

7286
02:03:41,189 --> 02:03:41,199
it's people who don't know what
 

7287
02:03:41,199 --> 02:03:42,629
it's people who don't know what
radiation is like i've had people ask me

7288
02:03:42,629 --> 02:03:42,639
radiation is like i've had people ask me
 

7289
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:44,149
radiation is like i've had people ask me
like what about radiation from cell

7290
02:03:44,149 --> 02:03:44,159
like what about radiation from cell
 

7291
02:03:44,159 --> 02:03:46,149
like what about radiation from cell
phones according to causing brain cancer

7292
02:03:46,149 --> 02:03:46,159
phones according to causing brain cancer
 

7293
02:03:46,159 --> 02:03:47,669
phones according to causing brain cancer
i'm like when you say radiation do you

7294
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
i'm like when you say radiation do you
 

7295
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,910
i'm like when you say radiation do you
mean photons or particles then like that

7296
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:49,920
mean photons or particles then like that
 

7297
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,350
mean photons or particles then like that
i don't know what what do you mean

7298
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:51,360
i don't know what what do you mean
 

7299
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,669
i don't know what what do you mean
protons particles so do you mean

7300
02:03:53,669 --> 02:03:53,679
protons particles so do you mean
 

7301
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:54,470
protons particles so do you mean
uh

7302
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:54,480
uh
 

7303
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:55,270
uh
if

7304
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:55,280
if
 

7305
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,350
if
let's say photons what

7306
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:57,360
let's say photons what
 

7307
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,510
let's say photons what
what frequency or wavelength and they're

7308
02:03:59,510 --> 02:03:59,520
what frequency or wavelength and they're
 

7309
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,990
what frequency or wavelength and they're
like no i have no idea um like do you

7310
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:02,000
like no i have no idea um like do you
 

7311
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,430
like no i have no idea um like do you
know that everything's radiating all the

7312
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:03,440
know that everything's radiating all the
 

7313
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:04,709
know that everything's radiating all the
time

7314
02:04:04,709 --> 02:04:04,719
time
 

7315
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:06,149
time
like what do you mean like yeah

7316
02:04:06,149 --> 02:04:06,159
like what do you mean like yeah
 

7317
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:08,550
like what do you mean like yeah
everything's radiating all the time

7318
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:08,560
everything's radiating all the time
 

7319
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:11,430
everything's radiating all the time
photons are being emitted by all objects

7320
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:11,440
photons are being emitted by all objects
 

7321
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,430
photons are being emitted by all objects
all the time basically so

7322
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:13,440
all the time basically so
 

7323
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,390
all the time basically so
um

7324
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:14,400
um
 

7325
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,629
um
and if you want to know what it's it's

7326
02:04:16,629 --> 02:04:16,639
and if you want to know what it's it's
 

7327
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:18,470
and if you want to know what it's it's
what it means to stand in front of

7328
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:18,480
what it means to stand in front of
 

7329
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:20,069
what it means to stand in front of
nuclear fire

7330
02:04:20,069 --> 02:04:20,079
nuclear fire
 

7331
02:04:20,079 --> 02:04:21,669
nuclear fire
go outside

7332
02:04:21,669 --> 02:04:21,679
go outside
 

7333
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,229
go outside
the sun is a gigantic

7334
02:04:24,229 --> 02:04:24,239
the sun is a gigantic
 

7335
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:25,990
the sun is a gigantic
you know thermonuclear

7336
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:26,000
you know thermonuclear
 

7337
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,709
you know thermonuclear
reactor that you're staring right at it

7338
02:04:28,709 --> 02:04:28,719
reactor that you're staring right at it
 

7339
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:32,390
reactor that you're staring right at it
are you still alive yes okay amazing

7340
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:32,400
are you still alive yes okay amazing
 

7341
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,069
are you still alive yes okay amazing
yeah i guess radiation is one of the

7342
02:04:34,069 --> 02:04:34,079
yeah i guess radiation is one of the
 

7343
02:04:34,079 --> 02:04:37,589
yeah i guess radiation is one of the
words that can be used as a tool to to

7344
02:04:37,589 --> 02:04:37,599
words that can be used as a tool to to
 

7345
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:40,149
words that can be used as a tool to to
fear monger by certain people that's it

7346
02:04:40,149 --> 02:04:40,159
fear monger by certain people that's it
 

7347
02:04:40,159 --> 02:04:41,910
fear monger by certain people that's it
and i think people just don't understand

7348
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:41,920
and i think people just don't understand
 

7349
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,430
and i think people just don't understand
so i mean that's the way to fight that

7350
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:43,440
so i mean that's the way to fight that
 

7351
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,430
so i mean that's the way to fight that
uh that fear i suppose is to understand

7352
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:45,440
uh that fear i suppose is to understand
 

7353
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,550
uh that fear i suppose is to understand
is to learn

7354
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:46,560
is to learn
 

7355
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,149
is to learn
yeah just say like okay how many people

7356
02:04:48,149 --> 02:04:48,159
yeah just say like okay how many people
 

7357
02:04:48,159 --> 02:04:49,750
yeah just say like okay how many people
have actually died from nuclear

7358
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:49,760
have actually died from nuclear
 

7359
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:51,510
have actually died from nuclear
accidents it's like practically nothing

7360
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:51,520
accidents it's like practically nothing
 

7361
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:54,069
accidents it's like practically nothing
and uh say how many people have have

7362
02:04:54,069 --> 02:04:54,079
and uh say how many people have have
 

7363
02:04:54,079 --> 02:04:55,510
and uh say how many people have have
died from

7364
02:04:55,510 --> 02:04:55,520
died from
 

7365
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:56,870
died from
you know coal

7366
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880
you know coal
 

7367
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,270
you know coal
plants and it's a very big number

7368
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
plants and it's a very big number
 

7369
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,870
plants and it's a very big number
so

7370
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:00,880
so
 

7371
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,030
so
like obviously we should not be

7372
02:05:03,030 --> 02:05:03,040
like obviously we should not be
 

7373
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:04,310
like obviously we should not be
starting up coal plants and shutting

7374
02:05:04,310 --> 02:05:04,320
starting up coal plants and shutting
 

7375
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,669
starting up coal plants and shutting
down nuclear plants just doesn't make

7376
02:05:05,669 --> 02:05:05,679
down nuclear plants just doesn't make
 

7377
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:06,790
down nuclear plants just doesn't make
any sense

7378
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:06,800
any sense
 

7379
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:08,149
any sense
at all

7380
02:05:08,149 --> 02:05:08,159
at all
 

7381
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:09,669
at all
coal plants like i don't know a hundred

7382
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:09,679
coal plants like i don't know a hundred

what everyone else was doing um
they were not the worst

7690
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:31,280
they were not the worst
 

7691
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:32,310

like i said you gotta look at these

7692
02:10:32,310 --> 02:10:32,320
like i said you gotta look at these

02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:34,000
things in the context of the history at
 

7695
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,229
things in the context of the history at
the time um and say what what were the

the time um and say what what were the
 

7697
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:37,669
the time um and say what what were the
alternatives and what are you comparing

and when it completely falls flat it's
just it's beautiful to see people

8030
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:13,360
just it's beautiful to see people
 

8031
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:15,589
just it's beautiful to see people
deal with like that uh you might have

8032
02:16:15,589 --> 02:16:15,599
deal with like that uh you might have
 

8033
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:17,750
deal with like that uh you might have
enough material to do standard

8034
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:17,760
enough material to do standard
 

8035
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:19,830
enough material to do standard
no no i've never thought about but i

i so like what's your favorite one i
know the the butter robot certainly is

8080
02:17:01,830 --> 02:17:01,840
know the the butter robot certainly is
 

8081
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:02,790
know the the butter robot certainly is
uh

8082
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:02,800
uh
 

8083
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,230
uh
you know it's like it it's certainly

8084
02:17:04,230 --> 02:17:04,240
you know it's like it it's certainly
 

8085
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:06,150
you know it's like it it's certainly
possible to have too much sentience in a

8086
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:06,160
possible to have too much sentience in a
 

8087
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:07,110
possible to have too much sentience in a
device

8088
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:07,120
device
 

8089
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,469
device
um like you don't want to have your

8090
02:17:08,469 --> 02:17:08,479
um like you don't want to have your
 

8091
02:17:08,479 --> 02:17:10,070
um like you don't want to have your
toast to be like

8092
02:17:10,070 --> 02:17:10,080
toast to be like
 

8093
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:12,790
toast to be like
a super genius toaster it's gonna hate

8094
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:12,800
a super genius toaster it's gonna hate
 

8095
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,309
a super genius toaster it's gonna hate
hate life because well it could just

8096
02:17:14,309 --> 02:17:14,319
hate life because well it could just
 

8097
02:17:14,319 --> 02:17:16,309
hate life because well it could just
make us toast but if you know it's like

8098
02:17:16,309 --> 02:17:16,319
make us toast but if you know it's like
 

8099
02:17:16,319 --> 02:17:17,190
make us toast but if you know it's like
you don't want to have like super

8100
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:17,200
you don't want to have like super
 

8101
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,950
you don't want to have like super
intelligent stuck in a

8102
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:18,960
intelligent stuck in a
 

8103
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:21,349
intelligent stuck in a
a very limited device um do you think

8104
02:17:21,349 --> 02:17:21,359
a very limited device um do you think
 

8105
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:23,509
a very limited device um do you think
it's too easy from uh if we talk about

8106
02:17:23,509 --> 02:17:23,519
it's too easy from uh if we talk about
 

8107
02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:25,030
it's too easy from uh if we talk about
from the engineering perspective of

8108
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:25,040
from the engineering perspective of
 

8109
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:27,110
from the engineering perspective of
super intelligence like with marvin the

8110
02:17:27,110 --> 02:17:27,120
super intelligence like with marvin the
 

8111
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,469
super intelligence like with marvin the
robot like is it j it seems like it

8112
02:17:30,469 --> 02:17:30,479
robot like is it j it seems like it
 

8113
02:17:30,479 --> 02:17:32,389
robot like is it j it seems like it
might be very easy to engineer just a

8114
02:17:32,389 --> 02:17:32,399
might be very easy to engineer just a
 

8115
02:17:32,399 --> 02:17:33,910
might be very easy to engineer just a
depressed robot

8116
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:33,920
depressed robot
 

8117
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,830
depressed robot
like it sure it's not obvious to

8118
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:35,840
like it sure it's not obvious to
 

8119
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:38,389
like it sure it's not obvious to
engineer a robot that's going to

8120
02:17:38,389 --> 02:17:38,399
engineer a robot that's going to
 

8121
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:40,469
engineer a robot that's going to
find a fulfilling existence

8122
02:17:40,469 --> 02:17:40,479
find a fulfilling existence
 

8123
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:42,629
find a fulfilling existence
same as humans i suppose

8124
02:17:42,629 --> 02:17:42,639
same as humans i suppose
 

8125
02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:44,230
same as humans i suppose
but um

8126
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:44,240
but um
 

8127
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:46,549
but um
i wonder if that's like the default

8128
02:17:46,549 --> 02:17:46,559
i wonder if that's like the default
 

8129
02:17:46,559 --> 02:17:48,950
i wonder if that's like the default
if you don't do a good job on building a

8130
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:48,960
if you don't do a good job on building a
 

8131
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:52,469
if you don't do a good job on building a
robot it's going to be sad a lot

8132
02:17:52,469 --> 02:17:52,479
robot it's going to be sad a lot
 

8133
02:17:52,479 --> 02:17:55,110
robot it's going to be sad a lot
well we can reprogram robots easier than

8134
02:17:55,110 --> 02:17:55,120
well we can reprogram robots easier than
 

8135
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:57,910
well we can reprogram robots easier than
we can reprogram humans

8136
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:57,920
we can reprogram humans
 

8137
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:59,750
we can reprogram humans
so

8138
02:17:59,750 --> 02:17:59,760
so
 

8139
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:01,750
so
i guess if you let it evolve

8140
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:01,760
i guess if you let it evolve
 

8141
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:02,870
i guess if you let it evolve
without

8142
02:18:02,870 --> 02:18:02,880
without
 

8143
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:05,110
without
tinkering then it might get sad

8144
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:05,120
tinkering then it might get sad
 

8145
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:07,030
tinkering then it might get sad
but you can change the optimization

8146
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:07,040
but you can change the optimization
 

8147
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:07,990
but you can change the optimization
function

8148
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:08,000
function
 

8149
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:08,790
function
and

8150
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:08,800
and
 

8151
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:12,790
and
have it be a cheery robot

8152
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:12,800

 

8153
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:15,509

you uh like i mentioned with with spacex

8154
02:18:15,509 --> 02:18:15,519
you uh like i mentioned with with spacex
 

8155
02:18:15,519 --> 02:18:17,349
you uh like i mentioned with with spacex
you give a lot of people hope and a lot

8156
02:18:17,349 --> 02:18:17,359
you give a lot of people hope and a lot
 

8157
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:18,629
you give a lot of people hope and a lot
of people look up to you millions of

8158
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:18,639
of people look up to you millions of
 

8159
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:20,709
of people look up to you millions of
people look up to you uh if we think

8160
02:18:20,709 --> 02:18:20,719
people look up to you uh if we think
 

8161
02:18:20,719 --> 02:18:22,629
people look up to you uh if we think
about young people

8162
02:18:22,629 --> 02:18:22,639
about young people
 

8163
02:18:22,639 --> 02:18:25,270
about young people
in high school maybe in college

8164
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:25,280
in high school maybe in college
 

8165
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,750
in high school maybe in college
um what advice would you give to them

8166
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:27,760
um what advice would you give to them
 

8167
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:29,190
um what advice would you give to them
about

8168
02:18:29,190 --> 02:18:29,200
about
 

8169
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,950
about
if they want to try to do something big

8170
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:30,960
if they want to try to do something big
 

8171
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:32,389
if they want to try to do something big
in this world they want to really have a

8172
02:18:32,389 --> 02:18:32,399
in this world they want to really have a
 

8173
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:33,990
in this world they want to really have a
big positive impact what advice would

8174
02:18:33,990 --> 02:18:34,000
big positive impact what advice would
 

8175
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,309
big positive impact what advice would
you give them about their career maybe

8176
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:36,319
you give them about their career maybe
 

8177
02:18:36,319 --> 02:18:39,190
you give them about their career maybe
about life in general

8178
02:18:39,190 --> 02:18:39,200
about life in general
 

8179
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:40,870
about life in general
try to be useful

8180
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:40,880
try to be useful
 

8181
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:41,830
try to be useful
um

8182
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:41,840
um
 

8183
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,589
um
you do things that are useful to your

8184
02:18:43,589 --> 02:18:43,599
you do things that are useful to your
 

8185
02:18:43,599 --> 02:18:46,230
you do things that are useful to your
fellow human beings to the world

8186
02:18:46,230 --> 02:18:46,240
fellow human beings to the world
 

8187
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:48,389
fellow human beings to the world
it's very hard to be useful

8188
02:18:48,389 --> 02:18:48,399
it's very hard to be useful

where there's an overlap of your talents
and

8362

um
 

8375
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:00,950
um
so you want to try to find a thing where

you ha you're
 

8379
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:05,110
you ha you're
that's a good a good uh combination of

8380
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,120
that's a good a good uh combination of
 

8381
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:06,870
that's a good a good uh combination of
of your of the things that you're

8382
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:06,880
of your of the things that you're
 

8383
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:09,190
of your of the things that you're
inherently good at but you also like

doing
um

8388
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:12,160
um
 

8389
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:14,469
um
and um and reading is a super fast

8390
02:22:14,469 --> 02:22:14,479
and um and reading is a super fast
 

8391
02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:17,510
and um and reading is a super fast
shortcut to to figure out which where

8392
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:17,520
shortcut to to figure out which where
 

8393
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:19,670
shortcut to to figure out which where
are you you're both good at it you like

8394
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:19,680
are you you're both good at it you like
 

8395
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,750
are you you're both good at it you like
doing it and it will actually have

8396
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:21,760
doing it and it will actually have
 

8397
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,750
doing it and it will actually have
positive impact well you've got to learn

8398
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:23,760
positive impact well you've got to learn
 

8399
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:27,349
positive impact well you've got to learn
about things somehow so re reading

8400
02:22:27,349 --> 02:22:27,359
about things somehow so re reading
 

8401
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:30,230
about things somehow so re reading
a broad range just really

8402
02:22:30,230 --> 02:22:30,240
a broad range just really
 

8403
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,110
a broad range just really
read it

8404
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:31,120
read it
 

8405
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,469
read it
you know the more important one is that

8406
02:22:32,469 --> 02:22:32,479
you know the more important one is that
 

8407
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:33,830
you know the more important one is that
kid i i

8408
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:33,840
kid i i
 

8409
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:37,190
kid i i
read through the encyclopedia uh so

8410
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:37,200
read through the encyclopedia uh so
 

8411
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,469
read through the encyclopedia uh so
that's pretty helpful

8412
02:22:38,469 --> 02:22:38,479
that's pretty helpful
 

8413
02:22:38,479 --> 02:22:39,910
that's pretty helpful
um

8414
02:22:39,910 --> 02:22:39,920
um
 

8415
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:41,270
um
and uh

8416
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:41,280
and uh
 

8417
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,389
and uh
there's also things i didn't even know

8418
02:22:42,389 --> 02:22:42,399
there's also things i didn't even know
 

8419
02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:44,550
there's also things i didn't even know
existed or a lot so obviously it's like

8420
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:44,560
existed or a lot so obviously it's like
 

8421
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:46,790
existed or a lot so obviously it's like
as broad as it gets encyclopedias were

8422
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:46,800
as broad as it gets encyclopedias were
 

8423
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:48,469
as broad as it gets encyclopedias were
digestible i think

8424
02:22:48,469 --> 02:22:48,479
digestible i think
 

8425
02:22:48,479 --> 02:22:51,190
digestible i think
uh you know whatever 40 years ago

8426
02:22:51,190 --> 02:22:51,200
uh you know whatever 40 years ago
 

8427
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:52,469
uh you know whatever 40 years ago
um

8428
02:22:52,469 --> 02:22:52,479
um
 

8429
02:22:52,479 --> 02:22:53,750
um
so

8430
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:53,760
so
 

8431
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:54,870
so
um

8432
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:54,880
um
 

8433
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:56,469
um
you know we read through the the

8434
02:22:56,469 --> 02:22:56,479
you know we read through the the
 

8435
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:58,230
you know we read through the the
condensed version of the encyclopedia

8436
02:22:58,230 --> 02:22:58,240
condensed version of the encyclopedia
 

8437
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:00,469
condensed version of the encyclopedia
britannica i'd recommend that

8438
02:23:00,469 --> 02:23:00,479
britannica i'd recommend that
 

8439
02:23:00,479 --> 02:23:02,790
britannica i'd recommend that
um you can always like skip subjects or

8440
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:02,800
um you can always like skip subjects or
 

8441
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,950
um you can always like skip subjects or
you read a few paragraphs and you know

8442
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:04,960
you read a few paragraphs and you know
 

8443
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:06,070
you read a few paragraphs and you know
you're not interested just jump to the

8444
02:23:06,070 --> 02:23:06,080
you're not interested just jump to the
 

8445

gonna
 

8451
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:11,990
gonna
skim through it

8452
02:23:11,990 --> 02:23:12,000
skim through it
 

8453
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,870
skim through it
um

8454
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:14,880

someone who puts in an honest day's work
 

8463

grow the pie mindset like the
 

8477
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:39,590
grow the pie mindset like the
if you if you sort of say like

8478
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:39,600
if you if you sort of say like
 

8479
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:42,469
if you if you sort of say like
when when we see people like perhaps um

8480
02:23:42,469 --> 02:23:42,479
when when we see people like perhaps um
 

8481
02:23:42,479 --> 02:23:45,110
when when we see people like perhaps um
including some very smart people

8482
02:23:45,110 --> 02:23:45,120
including some very smart people
 

8483
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:47,910
including some very smart people
kind of uh taking an attitude of uh like

8484
02:23:47,910 --> 02:23:47,920
kind of uh taking an attitude of uh like
 

8485
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:49,510
kind of uh taking an attitude of uh like
like doing things that seem like morally

8486
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:49,520
like doing things that seem like morally
 

8487
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:50,790
like doing things that seem like morally
questionable

8488
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:50,800
questionable
 

8489
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:53,349
questionable
it's often because they have at a base

8490
02:23:53,349 --> 02:23:53,359
it's often because they have at a base
 

8491
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:55,750
it's often because they have at a base
sort of axiomatic level a zero-sum

8492
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:55,760
sort of axiomatic level a zero-sum
 

8493
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,270
sort of axiomatic level a zero-sum
mindset

8494
02:23:57,270 --> 02:23:57,280
mindset
 

8495
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,910
mindset
um and and they without realizing it

8496
02:23:59,910 --> 02:23:59,920
um and and they without realizing it
 

8497
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:01,670
um and and they without realizing it
they don't realize they have a

8498
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:01,680
they don't realize they have a
 

8499
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:03,590
they don't realize they have a
zero-sum mindset or at least that they

8500
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:03,600
zero-sum mindset or at least that they
 

8501
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:05,349
zero-sum mindset or at least that they
don't realize it consciously

8502
02:24:05,349 --> 02:24:05,359
don't realize it consciously
 

8503
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:07,429
don't realize it consciously
um and so if you have a zero-sum mindset

8504
02:24:07,429 --> 02:24:07,439
um and so if you have a zero-sum mindset
 

8505
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:08,950
um and so if you have a zero-sum mindset
then the only way to get ahead is by

8506
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:08,960
then the only way to get ahead is by
 

8507
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:11,349
then the only way to get ahead is by
taking things from others

8508
02:24:11,349 --> 02:24:11,359
taking things from others
 

8509
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:13,510
taking things from others
if if it's like if if

8510
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:13,520
if if it's like if if
 

8511
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,990
if if it's like if if
if the pie is fixed then the only way to

8512
02:24:15,990 --> 02:24:16,000
if the pie is fixed then the only way to
 

8513
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,990
if the pie is fixed then the only way to
have more pie is to take someone else's

8514
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:18,000
have more pie is to take someone else's
 

8515
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,110
have more pie is to take someone else's
pie

8516
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:19,120
pie
 

8517
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:21,030
pie
but but this is false like obviously the

8518
02:24:21,030 --> 02:24:21,040
but but this is false like obviously the
 

8519
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:22,630
but but this is false like obviously the
pie has grown dramatically over time the

8520
02:24:22,630 --> 02:24:22,640
pie has grown dramatically over time the
 

8521
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:24,469
pie has grown dramatically over time the
economic pie

8522
02:24:24,469 --> 02:24:24,479
economic pie
 

8523
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:25,830
economic pie
so

8524
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:25,840
so
 

8525
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:29,429
so
in reality you can have that

8526
02:24:29,429 --> 02:24:29,439

 

8527
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:31,750

so overuse this analogy if you have a

8528
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:31,760
so overuse this analogy if you have a
 

8529
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,750
so overuse this analogy if you have a
lot of you can have there's a lot of pi

8530
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:35,760

 

8531
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:38,790

yeah it's not fixed um

8532
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:38,800
yeah it's not fixed um
 

8533
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:40,550
yeah it's not fixed um
so you really want to make sure you

8534
02:24:40,550 --> 02:24:40,560
so you really want to make sure you
 

8535
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:42,790
so you really want to make sure you
don't you're not operating um

8536
02:24:42,790 --> 02:24:42,800
don't you're not operating um
 

8537
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:44,469
don't you're not operating um
without realizing it from a zero-sum

8538
02:24:44,469 --> 02:24:44,479
without realizing it from a zero-sum
 

8539
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:46,230
without realizing it from a zero-sum
mindset

8540
02:24:46,230 --> 02:24:46,240
mindset
 

8541
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:47,429
mindset
where the only way to get ahead is to

8542
02:24:47,429 --> 02:24:47,439
where the only way to get ahead is to
 

8543
02:24:47,439 --> 02:24:48,469
where the only way to get ahead is to
take things from others then that's

8544
02:24:48,469 --> 02:24:48,479
take things from others then that's
 

8545
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:49,830
take things from others then that's
going to result in you trying to take

8546
02:24:49,830 --> 02:24:49,840
going to result in you trying to take
 

8547
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:51,830
going to result in you trying to take
things from others which is not not good

8548
02:24:51,830 --> 02:24:51,840
things from others which is not not good
 

8549
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:53,670
things from others which is not not good
it's much better to work on

8550
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:53,680
it's much better to work on
 

8551
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:53,950
it's much better to work on
uh

8552
02:24:53,950 --> 02:24:53,960

adding to the economic pie maybe you

8556
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:56,720
adding to the economic pie maybe you
 

8557
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:59,429
adding to the economic pie maybe you
know so

8558
02:24:59,429 --> 02:24:59,439

 

8559
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:01,990

uh you know creating

8560
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,000
uh you know creating
 

8561
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,349
uh you know creating
like i said creating more than you

8562
02:25:03,349 --> 02:25:03,359
like i said creating more than you
 

8563
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:05,830
like i said creating more than you
consume uh doing more than you

8564
02:25:05,830 --> 02:25:05,840
consume uh doing more than you
 

8565
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:07,590
consume uh doing more than you
yeah um

8566
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:07,600
yeah um
 

8567
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,429
yeah um
so that that's a big deal um i think

8568
02:25:09,429 --> 02:25:09,439
so that that's a big deal um i think
 

8569
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:11,030
so that that's a big deal um i think
there's like you know a fair number of

8570
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:11,040
there's like you know a fair number of
 

8571
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:12,710
there's like you know a fair number of
people in

8572
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:12,720
people in
 

8573
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:14,389
people in
in finance that

8574
02:25:14,389 --> 02:25:14,399
in finance that
 

8575
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:17,110
in finance that
uh do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset

8576
02:25:17,110 --> 02:25:17,120
uh do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset
 

8577
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:19,429
uh do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset
i mean it's all walks of life i've seen

8578
02:25:19,429 --> 02:25:19,439
i mean it's all walks of life i've seen
 

8579
02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:22,550
i mean it's all walks of life i've seen
that one of the one of the reasons

02:25:22,550 --> 02:25:22,560
that one of the one of the reasons

uh rogan inspires me he celebrates oh
 

8583
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:28,150
uh rogan inspires me he celebrates oh
there's a lot there's not not creating a

8584
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:28,160
there's a lot there's not not creating a
 

8585
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:29,750
there's a lot there's not not creating a
constant competition like there's a

8586
02:25:29,750 --> 02:25:29,760
constant competition like there's a
 

8587
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:31,750
constant competition like there's a
scarcity of resources what happens when

8588
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:31,760
scarcity of resources what happens when
 

8589
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:33,670
scarcity of resources what happens when
you celebrate others and you promote

8590
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:33,680
you celebrate others and you promote
 

8591
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:34,790
you celebrate others and you promote

it uh it actually grows that pie i mean

8596
02:25:39,110 --> 02:25:39,120
it uh it actually grows that pie i mean
 

8597
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:42,309
it uh it actually grows that pie i mean
it the every like the uh the resource

8598
02:25:42,309 --> 02:25:42,319
it the every like the uh the resource
 

8599
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:44,469
it the every like the uh the resource
the resources become less scarce

8600
02:25:44,469 --> 02:25:44,479
the resources become less scarce
 

8601
02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:46,150
the resources become less scarce
and that that applies in a lot of kinds

8602
02:25:46,150 --> 02:25:46,160
and that that applies in a lot of kinds
 

8603
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:47,830
and that that applies in a lot of kinds
of domains it applies in academia where

8604
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:47,840
of domains it applies in academia where
 

8605
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:49,429
of domains it applies in academia where
a lot of people are very

8606
02:25:49,429 --> 02:25:49,439
a lot of people are very

02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:51,510
a lot of people are very
uh see some funding for academic

8608
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:51,520
uh see some funding for academic
 

8609
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:54,070
uh see some funding for academic
research is zero sum and it is not if

8610
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:54,080
research is zero sum and it is not if
 

8611
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:56,070
research is zero sum and it is not if
you celebrate each other if you make if

8612
02:25:56,070 --> 02:25:56,080
you celebrate each other if you make if
 

8613
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:57,910
you celebrate each other if you make if
you get everybody to be excited about ai

8614
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:57,920
you get everybody to be excited about ai
 

8615
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:00,550
you get everybody to be excited about ai
about physics above mathematics i think

8616
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:00,560
about physics above mathematics i think
 

8617
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:02,309
about physics above mathematics i think
it there'd be more and more funding and

8618
02:26:02,309 --> 02:26:02,319
it there'd be more and more funding and
 

8619
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:04,550
it there'd be more and more funding and
i think everybody wins yeah that applies

8620
02:26:04,550 --> 02:26:04,560
i think everybody wins yeah that applies
 

8621
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:06,550
i think everybody wins yeah that applies
i think broadly

8622
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:06,560
i think broadly
 

8623
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:09,429
i think broadly
yeah yeah exactly so last

8624
02:26:09,429 --> 02:26:09,439
yeah yeah exactly so last
 

8625
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:13,030
yeah yeah exactly so last

last question about love and meaning
 

8627
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:15,670
last question about love and meaning
uh what is the role of love in the human

8628
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:15,680
uh what is the role of love in the human
 

8629
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,910
uh what is the role of love in the human
condition broadly and more specific to

8630
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:17,920
condition broadly and more specific to

8637
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:29,030

better engineer

8638
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:29,040
better engineer
 

8639
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:30,469
better engineer
now you're asking really perplexing

8640
02:26:30,469 --> 02:26:30,479
now you're asking really perplexing
 

8641
02:26:30,479 --> 02:26:32,070
now you're asking really perplexing
questions

8642
02:26:32,070 --> 02:26:32,080
questions
 

8643
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:34,389
questions
um

8644
02:26:34,389 --> 02:26:34,399
um
 

8645
02:26:34,399 --> 02:26:36,790
um
it's hard to give up

8646
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:36,800
it's hard to give up
 

8647
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:38,469
it's hard to give up
i mean there are many

8648

i mean there are many
 

8649
02:26:38,479 --> 02:26:41,349
i mean there are many

i mean there's um
 

8673
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:06,550
i mean there's um
it's because we've talked about so many

8674
02:27:06,550 --> 02:27:06,560
it's because we've talked about so many
 

8675
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:07,990
it's because we've talked about so many
inspiring things like be useful in the

8676
02:27:07,990 --> 02:27:08,000
inspiring things like be useful in the
 

8677
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,389
inspiring things like be useful in the
world sort of like solve problems

8678
02:27:10,389 --> 02:27:10,399
world sort of like solve problems
 

8679
02:27:10,399 --> 02:27:12,550
world sort of like solve problems

multiplication multi-planetary species
 

8701
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:37,830

02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:44,720
and conscious and intelligent it doesn't
 

8709
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:46,790
and conscious and intelligent it doesn't
mean nearly as much as if we're with

8710
02:27:46,790 --> 02:27:46,800
mean nearly as much as if we're with
 

8711

mean nearly as much as if we're with
others

right and there's some magic created
 

8715
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:51,910
right and there's some magic created
when we're together

on the whole we're pretty interesting
uh bunch

8764
02:28:45,190 --> 02:28:45,200
uh bunch
 

8765
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:46,469

both things considered
 

8769
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:49,990
both things considered
and i've read a lot of history including

8770
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:50,000
and i've read a lot of history including
 

8771
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,630
and i've read a lot of history including
the darkest worst parts of it

8772
02:28:52,630 --> 02:28:52,640
the darkest worst parts of it
 

8773
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:55,349
the darkest worst parts of it
and uh and despite all that i think on

8774
02:28:55,349 --> 02:28:55,359
and uh and despite all that i think on
 

8775
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:56,870
and uh and despite all that i think on
balance

8776
02:28:56,870 --> 02:28:56,880

what do you think is the meaning of this
whole thing

8784
02:29:05,349 --> 02:29:05,359
whole thing
 

8785
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:08,870
whole thing
is like is there a non-numerical oh

8786
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:08,880
is like is there a non-numerical oh
 

8787
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:10,950
is like is there a non-numerical oh
yeah well really i think what douglas

8788
02:29:10,950 --> 02:29:10,960
yeah well really i think what douglas
 

8789
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:12,309
yeah well really i think what douglas
adams was saying in hitchhiker's guide

8790
02:29:12,309 --> 02:29:12,319
adams was saying in hitchhiker's guide
 

8791
02:29:12,319 --> 02:29:14,070
adams was saying in hitchhiker's guide
to the galaxy is that

8792
02:29:14,070 --> 02:29:14,080
to the galaxy is that
 

8793
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:15,670
to the galaxy is that
um

8794
02:29:15,670 --> 02:29:15,680
um
 

8795
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:17,830
um
the universe is the answer

8796
02:29:17,830 --> 02:29:17,840
the universe is the answer
 

8797
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:18,710
the universe is the answer
and

8798
02:29:18,710 --> 02:29:18,720
and
 

8799
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:19,910
and
uh

8800
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:19,920
uh
 

8801
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:20,710
uh
what

8802
02:29:20,710 --> 02:29:20,720
what
 

8803
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:22,389
what
we really need to figure out are what

8804
02:29:22,389 --> 02:29:22,399
we really need to figure out are what
 

8805
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:24,550
we really need to figure out are what
questions to ask about the answer that

8806
02:29:24,550 --> 02:29:24,560
questions to ask about the answer that
 

8807
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:26,550
questions to ask about the answer that
is the universe yeah

8808
02:29:26,550 --> 02:29:26,560
is the universe yeah
 

8809
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:27,990
is the universe yeah
and that the question is the really the

8810
02:29:27,990 --> 02:29:28,000
and that the question is the really the
 

8811
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,429
and that the question is the really the
hard part and if you can properly frame

8812
02:29:29,429 --> 02:29:29,439
hard part and if you can properly frame
 

8813
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:31,429
hard part and if you can properly frame
the question then the answer relatively

8814
02:29:31,429 --> 02:29:31,439
the question then the answer relatively
 

8815
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:33,910
the question then the answer relatively
speaking is easy

8816
02:29:33,910 --> 02:29:33,920
speaking is easy
 

8817
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:35,110
speaking is easy
so

8818
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:35,120
so
 

8819
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:38,710
so
so therefore if you want to understand

8820
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:38,720
so therefore if you want to understand
 

8821
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:39,510
so therefore if you want to understand
what

8822
02:29:39,510 --> 02:29:39,520
what
 

8823
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:40,790
what
questions to ask about the universe you

8824
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:40,800
questions to ask about the universe you
 

8825
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:42,150
questions to ask about the universe you
want to understand the meaning of life

8826
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:42,160
want to understand the meaning of life
 

8827
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,349
want to understand the meaning of life
we need to

8828
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:43,359
we need to
 

8829
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:44,550
we need to
expand the scope and scale of

8830
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:44,560
expand the scope and scale of
 

8831
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,670
expand the scope and scale of
consciousness

8832
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:45,680
consciousness
 

8833
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:48,230
consciousness
so that we're better able to

8834
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:48,240
so that we're better able to
 

8835
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:49,590
so that we're better able to
understand the nature of the universe

8836
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:49,600
understand the nature of the universe
 

8837
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:50,469
understand the nature of the universe
and

8838
02:29:50,469 --> 02:29:50,479
and
 

8839
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:52,309
and
and understand the meaning of life

8840
02:29:52,309 --> 02:29:52,319
and understand the meaning of life
 

8841
02:29:52,319 --> 02:29:53,510
and understand the meaning of life
and ultimately

8842
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:53,520
and ultimately
 

8843
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:55,590
and ultimately
the most important part would be to ask

8844
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:55,600
the most important part would be to ask
 

8845
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:57,590
the most important part would be to ask
the right question

8846
02:29:57,590 --> 02:29:57,600
the right question
 

8847
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:59,110
the right question
