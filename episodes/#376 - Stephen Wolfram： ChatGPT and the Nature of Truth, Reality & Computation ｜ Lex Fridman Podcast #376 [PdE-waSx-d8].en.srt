00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270

you know I can tell chat gbt create a

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:02,280
you know I can tell chat gbt create a
 

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,430
you know I can tell chat gbt create a
piece of code and then just run it on my

4
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:04,440
piece of code and then just run it on my
 

5
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,010
piece of code and then just run it on my
computer and I'm like you know that that

6
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,020
computer and I'm like you know that that
 

7
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,350
computer and I'm like you know that that
sort of personalizes for me the what

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
sort of personalizes for me the what
 

9
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,390
sort of personalizes for me the what
could what could possibly go wrong so to

10
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:11,400
could what could possibly go wrong so to
 

11
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,310
could what could possibly go wrong so to
speak was that exciting or scary that

12
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:13,320
speak was that exciting or scary that
 

13
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,530
speak was that exciting or scary that
possibility it was a little bit scary

14
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:15,540
possibility it was a little bit scary
 

15
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,390
possibility it was a little bit scary
actually because it's kind of like if

16
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,400
actually because it's kind of like if
 

17
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,790
actually because it's kind of like if
you do that right what is the sandboxing

18
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:19,800
you do that right what is the sandboxing
 

19
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,290
you do that right what is the sandboxing
that you should have and that's sort of

20
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,300
that you should have and that's sort of
 

21
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,689
that you should have and that's sort of
a that's a a version of of that question

22
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:23,699
a that's a a version of of that question
 

23
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,849
a that's a a version of of that question
for the world that is as soon as you put

00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:25,859
for the world that is as soon as you put

27
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,410
the AIS in charge of things you know how
much how many constraints should there

28
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:30,420
much how many constraints should there
 

29
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,749

89
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,630
from the high philosophical level
maybe the technical level between the

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,390
let's Ripple through the neural net one

139
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,570

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,280
kind of form of foundation you can build
 

319
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,189
kind of form of foundation you can build
such a formal structure on

320
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:22,199
such a formal structure on
 

321
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,170
such a formal structure on
about the kinds of things you would

322
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,180
about the kinds of things you would
 

323
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,809
about the kinds of things you would
start on in order to build this kind of

324
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:26,819
start on in order to build this kind of
 

325
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,350
start on in order to build this kind of
uh deep computable knowledge trees so

326
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
uh deep computable knowledge trees so
 

327
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,090
uh deep computable knowledge trees so
the question is sort of how do you how

328
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,100
the question is sort of how do you how
 

329
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,430
the question is sort of how do you how
do you think about computation and

330
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,440
do you think about computation and
 

331
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,170
do you think about computation and
there's there's a couple of points here

332
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,180
there's there's a couple of points here
 

333
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,350
there's there's a couple of points here
one is what computation intrinsically is

334
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
one is what computation intrinsically is
 

335
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,010
one is what computation intrinsically is
like and the other is what aspects of

336
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,020
like and the other is what aspects of
 

337
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,529
like and the other is what aspects of
computation we humans with our minds and

338
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:45,539
computation we humans with our minds and
 

339
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,029
computation we humans with our minds and
with the kinds of things we've learned

340
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
with the kinds of things we've learned
 

341
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,610
with the kinds of things we've learned
can sort of relate to in that

342
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,620
can sort of relate to in that
 

343
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,249
can sort of relate to in that
computational universe so if we start on

344
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:52,259
computational universe so if we start on
 

345
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,469
computational universe so if we start on
the kind of what can computation be like

346
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
the kind of what can computation be like
 

347
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,170
the kind of what can computation be like
it's something I've spent some big chunk

348
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,180
it's something I've spent some big chunk
 

349
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,689
it's something I've spent some big chunk
of my life studying is imagine that

350
00:06:59,689 --> 00:06:59,699
of my life studying is imagine that
 

351
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,909
of my life studying is imagine that
you're you know we usually we write

352
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
you're you know we usually we write
 

353
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,409
you're you know we usually we write
programs where we kind of know what we

354
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:03,419
programs where we kind of know what we
 

355
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,749
programs where we kind of know what we
want the program to do and we carefully

356
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
want the program to do and we carefully
 

357
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,670
want the program to do and we carefully
write you know many lines of code and we

358
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
write you know many lines of code and we
 

359
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,230
write you know many lines of code and we
hope that the program does what we what

360
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,240
hope that the program does what we what
 

361
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,330
hope that the program does what we what
we intended it to do but the thing I've

362
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,340
we intended it to do but the thing I've
 

363
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,730
we intended it to do but the thing I've
been interested in is if you just look

364
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:13,740
been interested in is if you just look
 

365
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,230
been interested in is if you just look
at the kind of natural science of

366
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
at the kind of natural science of
 

367
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,150
at the kind of natural science of
programs so you just say I'm going to

368
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,160
programs so you just say I'm going to
 

369
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,650
programs so you just say I'm going to
make this program it's a really tiny

370
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:18,660
make this program it's a really tiny
 

371
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,689
make this program it's a really tiny
program maybe I even pick the pieces of

372
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:20,699
program maybe I even pick the pieces of
 

373
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:21,890
program maybe I even pick the pieces of
the program at random but it's really

374
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:21,900
the program at random but it's really
 

375
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,469
the program at random but it's really
tiny by really tiny I mean you know less

376
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
tiny by really tiny I mean you know less
 

377
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,809
tiny by really tiny I mean you know less
than a line of code type thing you say

378
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:26,819
than a line of code type thing you say
 

379
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,150
than a line of code type thing you say
what does this program do and you run it

380
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,160
what does this program do and you run it
 

381
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,309
what does this program do and you run it
and big discovery that I made in the

382
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:31,319
and big discovery that I made in the
 

383
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,370
and big discovery that I made in the
early 80s is that even extremely simple

384
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,380
early 80s is that even extremely simple
 

385
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,950
early 80s is that even extremely simple
programs when you run them can do really

386
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
programs when you run them can do really
 

387
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,930
programs when you run them can do really
complicated things really surprised me

388
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:38,940
complicated things really surprised me
 

389
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,370
complicated things really surprised me
it took me several years to kind of

390
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,380
it took me several years to kind of
 

391
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,830
it took me several years to kind of
realize that that was a thing so to

392
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840
realize that that was a thing so to
 

393
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,770
realize that that was a thing so to
speak but that that realization that

394
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:45,780
speak but that that realization that
 

395
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,210
speak but that that realization that
even very simple programs can do

396
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,220
even very simple programs can do
 

397
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,830
even very simple programs can do
incredibly complicated things that we

398
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:48,840
incredibly complicated things that we
 

399
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,570
incredibly complicated things that we
very much don't expect

400
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:50,580
very much don't expect
 

401
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,909
very much don't expect
that Discovery I mean I realized that

402
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:52,919
that Discovery I mean I realized that
 

403
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,650
that Discovery I mean I realized that
that's very much I think how nature

404
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:54,660
that's very much I think how nature
 

405
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,170
that's very much I think how nature
works that is nature has simple rules

406
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,180
works that is nature has simple rules
 

407
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,029
works that is nature has simple rules
but yet does all sorts of complicated

408
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
but yet does all sorts of complicated
 

409
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,610
but yet does all sorts of complicated
things that we might not expect you know

410
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:01,620
things that we might not expect you know
 

411
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,770
things that we might not expect you know
as a big thing of the last few years has

412
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:03,780
as a big thing of the last few years has
 

413
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,210
as a big thing of the last few years has
been understanding that that's how the

414
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,220
been understanding that that's how the
 

415
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,610
been understanding that that's how the
whole universe and physics works but

416
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:07,620
whole universe and physics works but
 

417
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,830
whole universe and physics works but
that's a a quite separate topic but so

418
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
that's a a quite separate topic but so
 

419
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,589
that's a a quite separate topic but so
there's this whole world of programs and

420
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:12,599
there's this whole world of programs and
 

421
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,409
there's this whole world of programs and
what they do and very rich sophisticated

422
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:15,419
what they do and very rich sophisticated
 

423
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,510
what they do and very rich sophisticated
things that these programs can do but

424
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
things that these programs can do but
 

425
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,129
things that these programs can do but
when we look at many of these programs

426
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:19,139
when we look at many of these programs
 

427
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,629
when we look at many of these programs
we look at them and say well that's kind

428
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
we look at them and say well that's kind
 

429
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,950
we look at them and say well that's kind
of I don't really know what that's doing

430
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:21,960
of I don't really know what that's doing
 

431
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,589
of I don't really know what that's doing
it's not a very human kind of thing

432
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:24,599
it's not a very human kind of thing
 

433
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,390
it's not a very human kind of thing
so on the one hand we have sort of

434
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
so on the one hand we have sort of
 

435
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,650
so on the one hand we have sort of
what's possible in the computational

436
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:27,660
what's possible in the computational
 

437
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,809
what's possible in the computational
universe on the other hand we have the

438
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:29,819
universe on the other hand we have the
 

439
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,189
universe on the other hand we have the
kinds of things that we humans think

440
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
kinds of things that we humans think
 

441
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,930
kinds of things that we humans think
about the kinds of things that are

442
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:32,940
about the kinds of things that are
 

443
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,430
about the kinds of things that are
developed in kind of our intellectual

444
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,440
developed in kind of our intellectual
 

445
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,449
developed in kind of our intellectual
history and that's uh and the Really the

446
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:38,459
history and that's uh and the Really the
 

447
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,310
history and that's uh and the Really the
challenge to sort of making things

448
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
challenge to sort of making things
 

449
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,769
challenge to sort of making things
computational is to connect what's

450
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:42,779
computational is to connect what's
 

451
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,690
computational is to connect what's
computationally possible out in the

452
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,700
computationally possible out in the
 

453
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,610
computationally possible out in the
computational universe with the things

454
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:46,620
computational universe with the things
 

455
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,130
computational universe with the things
that we humans sort of typically think

456
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,140
that we humans sort of typically think
 

457
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,590
that we humans sort of typically think
about with our minds now that's a

458
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
about with our minds now that's a
 

459
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,329
about with our minds now that's a
complicated kind of moving Target

460
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:53,339
complicated kind of moving Target
 

461
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,910
complicated kind of moving Target
because the things that we think about

462
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
because the things that we think about
 

463
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,070
because the things that we think about
change over time we've learned more

464
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
change over time we've learned more
 

465
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,050
change over time we've learned more
stuff we've invented mathematics we've

466
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,060
stuff we've invented mathematics we've
 

467
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,870
stuff we've invented mathematics we've
invented various kinds of ideas and

468
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
invented various kinds of ideas and
 

469
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,850
invented various kinds of ideas and
structures and so on so it's gradually

470
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:04,860
structures and so on so it's gradually
 

471
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,610
structures and so on so it's gradually
expanding we're kind of gradually

472
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:06,620
expanding we're kind of gradually
 

473
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,810
expanding we're kind of gradually
colonizing more and more of this kind of

474
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:08,820
colonizing more and more of this kind of
 

475
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,210
colonizing more and more of this kind of
intellectual space of possibilities but

476
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,220
intellectual space of possibilities but
 

477
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,250
intellectual space of possibilities but
the the real thing the real challenge is

478
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,260
the the real thing the real challenge is
 

479
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,949
the the real thing the real challenge is
how do you take what is computationally

480
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:15,959
how do you take what is computationally
 

481
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,170
how do you take what is computationally
possible how do you take how do you

482
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,180
possible how do you take how do you
 

483
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,210
possible how do you take how do you
encapsulate the kinds of things that we

484
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,220
encapsulate the kinds of things that we
 

485
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,430
encapsulate the kinds of things that we
think about in a way that kind of plugs

486
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:22,440
think about in a way that kind of plugs
 

487
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,070
think about in a way that kind of plugs
into what's computationally possible and

488
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,080
into what's computationally possible and
 

489
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,650
into what's computationally possible and
and actually the the uh the big sort of

490
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:27,660
and actually the the uh the big sort of
 

491
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,230
and actually the the uh the big sort of
idea there is this idea of kind of

492
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
idea there is this idea of kind of
 

493
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,150
idea there is this idea of kind of
symbolic programming symbolic

494
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
symbolic programming symbolic
 

495
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,670
symbolic programming symbolic
representations of things and so the the

496
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680
representations of things and so the the
 

497
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,769
representations of things and so the the
question is when you look at sort of

498
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:36,779
question is when you look at sort of
 

499
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,210
question is when you look at sort of
everything in the world and you kind of

500
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,220
everything in the world and you kind of
 

501
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,769
everything in the world and you kind of
you know you take some visual scene or

502
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:39,779
you know you take some visual scene or
 

503
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,630
you know you take some visual scene or
something you're looking at and you say

504
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:41,640
something you're looking at and you say
 

505
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,730
something you're looking at and you say
well how do I turn that into something

506
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:43,740
well how do I turn that into something
 

507
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,350
well how do I turn that into something
that I can kind of stuff into my mind

508
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
that I can kind of stuff into my mind
 

509
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,810
that I can kind of stuff into my mind
you know there are lots of pixels in my

510
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:47,820
you know there are lots of pixels in my
 

511
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,790
you know there are lots of pixels in my
visual scene but the things that I

512
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:49,800
visual scene but the things that I
 

513
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,889
visual scene but the things that I
remembered from that visual scene are

514
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:51,899
remembered from that visual scene are
 

515
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,750
remembered from that visual scene are
you know there's a there's a chair in

516
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
you know there's a there's a chair in
 

517
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,930
you know there's a there's a chair in
this place it's a kind of a symbolic

518
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:55,940
this place it's a kind of a symbolic
 

519
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,490
this place it's a kind of a symbolic
representation of the visual scene there

520
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:58,500
representation of the visual scene there
 

521
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,870
representation of the visual scene there
are two chairs on a table or something

522
00:09:59,870 --> 00:09:59,880
are two chairs on a table or something
 

523
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,670
are two chairs on a table or something
rather than there are all these pixels

524
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
rather than there are all these pixels
 

525
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,829
rather than there are all these pixels
arranged in all these detailed ways and

526
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
arranged in all these detailed ways and
 

527
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,630
arranged in all these detailed ways and
so the question then is how do you take

528
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,640
so the question then is how do you take
 

529
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,030
so the question then is how do you take
sort of all all the things in the world

530
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,040
sort of all all the things in the world
 

531
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,889
sort of all all the things in the world
and make some kind of representation

532
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:09,899
and make some kind of representation
 

533
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,009
and make some kind of representation
that corresponds to the types of ways

534
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:13,019
that corresponds to the types of ways
 

535
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,630
that corresponds to the types of ways
that we think about things and human

536
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
that we think about things and human
 

537
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,870
that we think about things and human
language is is sort of one form of

538
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:17,880
language is is sort of one form of
 

539
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,310
language is is sort of one form of
representation that we have we talk

540
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,320
representation that we have we talk
 

541
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,870
representation that we have we talk
about chairs that's a word in human

542
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
about chairs that's a word in human
 

543
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,090
about chairs that's a word in human
language and so on how do we how do we

544
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,100
language and so on how do we how do we
 

545
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,030
language and so on how do we how do we
take but human language is is not in and

546
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040
take but human language is is not in and
 

547
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,370
take but human language is is not in and
of itself something from that plugs in

548
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,380
of itself something from that plugs in
 

549
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,610
of itself something from that plugs in
very well to sort of computation it's

550
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:31,620
very well to sort of computation it's
 

551
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,810
very well to sort of computation it's
not something from which you can

552
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:32,820
not something from which you can
 

553
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,389
not something from which you can
immediately compute consequences and so

554
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:35,399
immediately compute consequences and so
 

555
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,370
immediately compute consequences and so
on and so you have to kind of find a way

556
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:37,380
on and so you have to kind of find a way
 

557
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,269
on and so you have to kind of find a way
to take sort of the the stuff we

558
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
to take sort of the the stuff we
 

559
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,490
to take sort of the the stuff we
understand from human language and make

560
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:43,500
understand from human language and make
 

561
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,130
understand from human language and make
it more precise and that's really this

562
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:46,140
it more precise and that's really this
 

563
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,949
it more precise and that's really this
story of of symbolic programming and you

564
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
story of of symbolic programming and you
 

565
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,990
story of of symbolic programming and you
know what what that turns into is

566
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,000
know what what that turns into is
 

567
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,850
know what what that turns into is
something which I didn't know at the

568
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:52,860
something which I didn't know at the
 

569
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,410
something which I didn't know at the
time it was going to work as well as it

570
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:54,420
time it was going to work as well as it
 

571
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,410
time it was going to work as well as it
has but back in the 1979 or so I was

572
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,420
has but back in the 1979 or so I was
 

573
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,970
has but back in the 1979 or so I was
trying to build my first big computer

574
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:58,980
trying to build my first big computer
 

575
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,829
trying to build my first big computer
system and trying to figure out you know

576
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:00,839
system and trying to figure out you know
 

577
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,050
system and trying to figure out you know
how should I represent computations at a

578
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,060
how should I represent computations at a
 

579
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,810
how should I represent computations at a
high level and I kind of invented this

580
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:05,820
high level and I kind of invented this
 

581
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,810
high level and I kind of invented this
idea of using kind of symbolic

582
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:08,820
idea of using kind of symbolic
 

583
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,269
idea of using kind of symbolic
Expressions you know structured as it's

584
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
Expressions you know structured as it's
 

585
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,430
Expressions you know structured as it's
kind of like a a function and a bunch of

586
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
kind of like a a function and a bunch of
 

587
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,949
kind of like a a function and a bunch of
arguments but that function doesn't

588
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:15,959
arguments but that function doesn't
 

589
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,410
arguments but that function doesn't
necessarily evaluate to anything it's

590
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:18,420
necessarily evaluate to anything it's
 

591
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,509
necessarily evaluate to anything it's
just a a thing that sits there

592
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:20,519
just a a thing that sits there
 

593
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,389
just a a thing that sits there
representing a structure and so building

594
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:23,399
representing a structure and so building
 

595
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,550
representing a structure and so building
up that structure and it's turned out

596
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:25,560
up that structure and it's turned out
 

597
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,790
up that structure and it's turned out
that structure has been extremely it's

598
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
that structure has been extremely it's
 

599
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,069
that structure has been extremely it's
it's a good match for the way that we

600
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:31,079
it's a good match for the way that we
 

601
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,110
it's a good match for the way that we
humans it seems to be a good match for

602
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
humans it seems to be a good match for
 

603
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,790
humans it seems to be a good match for
the way that we humans kind of

604
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
the way that we humans kind of
 

605
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,190
the way that we humans kind of
conceptualize higher level things and

606
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
conceptualize higher level things and
 

607
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,350
conceptualize higher level things and
it's been the last I don't know 45 years

608
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
it's been the last I don't know 45 years
 

609
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,990
it's been the last I don't know 45 years
or something it's served me remarkably

610
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
or something it's served me remarkably
 

611
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,690
or something it's served me remarkably
well so building up that structure using

612
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:44,700
well so building up that structure using
 

613
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,690
well so building up that structure using
this kind of symbolic representation but

614
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:47,700
this kind of symbolic representation but
 

615
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,970
this kind of symbolic representation but
what can you say about abstractions here

616
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:49,980
what can you say about abstractions here
 

617
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,829
what can you say about abstractions here
because you could just start with your

618
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
because you could just start with your
 

619
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,569
because you could just start with your
physics project you could start at a

620
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:53,579
physics project you could start at a
 

621
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,790
physics project you could start at a
hypograph at a very very low level and

622
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:55,800
hypograph at a very very low level and
 

623
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,410
hypograph at a very very low level and
build up everything from there but you

624
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:57,420
build up everything from there but you
 

625
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,470
build up everything from there but you
don't you type shortcuts right uh you

626
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
don't you type shortcuts right uh you
 

627
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,990
don't you type shortcuts right uh you
take the highest level of abstraction

628
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,000
take the highest level of abstraction
 

629
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,850
take the highest level of abstraction
convert that

630
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:04,860
convert that
 

631
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,530
convert that
uh the kind of abstraction that's

632
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:06,540
uh the kind of abstraction that's
 

633
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,150
uh the kind of abstraction that's
convertible to something computable

634
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
convertible to something computable
 

635
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,970
convertible to something computable
using symbolic representation

636
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:10,980
using symbolic representation
 

637
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,910
using symbolic representation
and then that's your new foundation for

638
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
and then that's your new foundation for
 

639
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,170
and then that's your new foundation for
that little piece of knowledge yeah

640
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:15,180
that little piece of knowledge yeah
 

641
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,569
that little piece of knowledge yeah
somehow all of that is integrated right

642
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:17,579
somehow all of that is integrated right
 

643
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,030
somehow all of that is integrated right
so the the sort of a very important

644
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,040
so the the sort of a very important
 

645
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,889
so the the sort of a very important
phenomenon that that is kind of a thing

646
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:21,899
phenomenon that that is kind of a thing
 

647
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,009
phenomenon that that is kind of a thing
that I've sort of realized is just it's

648
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:25,019
that I've sort of realized is just it's
 

649
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,569
that I've sort of realized is just it's
one of these things that sort of in the

650
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:26,579
one of these things that sort of in the
 

651
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,509
one of these things that sort of in the
in the future of kind of everything is

652
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
in the future of kind of everything is
 

653
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,829
in the future of kind of everything is
going to become more and more important

654
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:30,839
going to become more and more important
 

655
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,090
going to become more and more important
is this phenomenon of computational

656
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:32,100
is this phenomenon of computational
 

657
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,569
is this phenomenon of computational
irreducibility and the the question is

658
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:35,579
irreducibility and the the question is
 

659
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,430
irreducibility and the the question is
if you know the rules for something you

660
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
if you know the rules for something you
 

661
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,050
if you know the rules for something you
have a program you're going to run it

662
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,060
have a program you're going to run it
 

663
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,150
have a program you're going to run it
you might say I know the rules great I

664
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,160
you might say I know the rules great I
 

665
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,230
you might say I know the rules great I
know everything about what's going to

666
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
know everything about what's going to
 

667
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,829
know everything about what's going to
happen

668
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:42,839
happen
 

669
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,350
happen
well in principle you do because you can

670
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
well in principle you do because you can
 

671
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,050
well in principle you do because you can
just run those rules out and just see

672
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,060
just run those rules out and just see
 

673
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,370
just run those rules out and just see
what they do you might run them a

674
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,380
what they do you might run them a
 

675
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,470
what they do you might run them a
million steps you see what happens Etc

676
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,480
million steps you see what happens Etc
 

677
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,949
million steps you see what happens Etc
the question is can you like immediately

678
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
the question is can you like immediately
 

679
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,569
the question is can you like immediately
jump ahead and say I know it's going to

680
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:56,579
jump ahead and say I know it's going to
 

681
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,490
jump ahead and say I know it's going to
happen after a million steps and the

682
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:58,500
happen after a million steps and the
 

683
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,370
happen after a million steps and the
answer is 13 or something yes and the

684
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:01,380
answer is 13 or something yes and the
 

685
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,470
answer is 13 or something yes and the
the one of the very critical things to

686
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,480
the one of the very critical things to
 

687
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,350
the one of the very critical things to
realize is if you could reduce that

688
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:06,360
realize is if you could reduce that
 

689
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,569
realize is if you could reduce that
computation there isn't a sense no point

690
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:08,579
computation there isn't a sense no point
 

691
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,030
computation there isn't a sense no point
in doing the computation the place where

692
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
in doing the computation the place where
 

693
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,350
in doing the computation the place where
you really get value out of doing

694
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:12,360
you really get value out of doing
 

695
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,050
you really get value out of doing
computation is when you had to do the

696
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,060
computation is when you had to do the
 

697
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,210
computation is when you had to do the
computation to find out the answer but

698
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,220
computation to find out the answer but
 

699
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,769
computation to find out the answer but
this phenomenon that you have to do the

700
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:18,779
this phenomenon that you have to do the
 

701
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,269
this phenomenon that you have to do the
computation to find out the answer this

702
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:20,279
computation to find out the answer this
 

703
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,170
computation to find out the answer this
phenomenon of computational

704
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:21,180
phenomenon of computational
 

705
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,629
phenomenon of computational
irreducibility seems to be tremendously

706
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:23,639
irreducibility seems to be tremendously
 

707
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,129
irreducibility seems to be tremendously
important for thinking about lots of

708
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:25,139
important for thinking about lots of
 

709
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,870
important for thinking about lots of
kinds of things so one of the things

710
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
kinds of things so one of the things
 

711
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,329
kinds of things so one of the things
that happens is okay you've got a model

712
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:29,339
that happens is okay you've got a model
 

713
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,190
that happens is okay you've got a model
of the universe at the low level in

714
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
of the universe at the low level in
 

715
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,050
of the universe at the low level in
terms of atoms of space and hypographs

716
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,060
terms of atoms of space and hypographs
 

717
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,329
terms of atoms of space and hypographs
and rewriting typographs and so on and

718
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:35,339
and rewriting typographs and so on and
 

719
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,710
and rewriting typographs and so on and
it's happening you know 10 to the 100

720
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
it's happening you know 10 to the 100
 

721
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,769
it's happening you know 10 to the 100
times every second let's say well you

722
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:39,779
times every second let's say well you
 

723
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,569
times every second let's say well you
say great then we've we've nailed it

724
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:41,579
say great then we've we've nailed it
 

725
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,610
say great then we've we've nailed it
we've we know how the universe works

726
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:43,620
we've we know how the universe works
 

727
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,009
we've we know how the universe works
well the problem is the universe can

728
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:46,019
well the problem is the universe can
 

729
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,870
well the problem is the universe can
figure out what it's going to do it does

730
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:47,880
figure out what it's going to do it does
 

731
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,750
figure out what it's going to do it does
those 10 to the 100 you know steps but

732
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:50,760
those 10 to the 100 you know steps but
 

733
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,370
those 10 to the 100 you know steps but
for us to work out what it's going to do

734
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:52,380
for us to work out what it's going to do
 

735
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,410
for us to work out what it's going to do
we have no way to reduce that

736
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,420
we have no way to reduce that
 

737
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,389
we have no way to reduce that
computation the only way to do the

738
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
computation the only way to do the
 

739
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,949
computation the only way to do the
computation to see the result of the

740
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:57,959
computation to see the result of the
 

741
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,350
computation to see the result of the
computation is to do it and if we're

742
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:00,360
computation is to do it and if we're
 

743
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,449
computation is to do it and if we're
operating within the universe we're kind

744
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:02,459
operating within the universe we're kind
 

745
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,250
operating within the universe we're kind
of there's no there's no opportunity to

746
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:04,260
of there's no there's no opportunity to
 

747
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,990
of there's no there's no opportunity to
do that because the universe is doing it

748
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
do that because the universe is doing it
 

749
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,389
do that because the universe is doing it
as fast as the universe can do it and

750
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
as fast as the universe can do it and
 

751
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,769
as fast as the universe can do it and
that's you know that's what's happening

752
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:09,779
that's you know that's what's happening
 

753
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,110
that's you know that's what's happening
so what we're trying to do and a lot of

754
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,120
so what we're trying to do and a lot of
 

755
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,850
so what we're trying to do and a lot of
the story of science a lot of other

756
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:13,860
the story of science a lot of other
 

757
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,370
the story of science a lot of other
kinds of things is finding pockets of

758
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,380
kinds of things is finding pockets of
 

759
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,310
kinds of things is finding pockets of
reducibility that is you could have a

760
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,320
reducibility that is you could have a
 

761
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,750
reducibility that is you could have a
situation where everything in the world

762
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:20,760
situation where everything in the world
 

763
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,430
situation where everything in the world
is full of computational irreducibility

764
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:22,440
is full of computational irreducibility
 

765
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,050
is full of computational irreducibility
we never know what's going to happen

766
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,060
we never know what's going to happen
 

767
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,030
we never know what's going to happen
next the only way we can figure out

768
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,040
next the only way we can figure out
 

769
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,530
next the only way we can figure out
what's going to happen next is just let

770
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:27,540
what's going to happen next is just let
 

771
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,990
what's going to happen next is just let
the system run and see what happens so

772
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
the system run and see what happens so
 

773
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,569
the system run and see what happens so
in a sense the story of of most kinds of

774
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:32,579
in a sense the story of of most kinds of
 

775
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,030
in a sense the story of of most kinds of
science inventions a lot of kinds of

776
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
science inventions a lot of kinds of
 

777
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,370
science inventions a lot of kinds of
things is the story of finding these

778
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:37,380
things is the story of finding these
 

779
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,650
things is the story of finding these
places where we can locally jump ahead

780
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:39,660
places where we can locally jump ahead
 

781
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,210
places where we can locally jump ahead
and one of the features of computational

782
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,220
and one of the features of computational
 

783
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,550
and one of the features of computational
reducibility is that there are always

784
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:43,560
reducibility is that there are always
 

785
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,889
reducibility is that there are always
pockets of reducibility there are always

786
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:45,899
pockets of reducibility there are always
 

787
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,509
pockets of reducibility there are always
places there always an infinite number

788
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
places there always an infinite number
 

789
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,889
places there always an infinite number
of places where you can jump ahead

790
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:48,899
of places where you can jump ahead
 

791
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,990
of places where you can jump ahead
there's no way where you can jump

792
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,000
there's no way where you can jump
 

793
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,970
there's no way where you can jump
completely ahead but there are little

794
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:52,980
completely ahead but there are little
 

795
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,009
completely ahead but there are little
little patches little places where you

796
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:55,019
little patches little places where you
 

797
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,290
little patches little places where you
can jump ahead a bit and I think you

798
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,300
can jump ahead a bit and I think you
 

799
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,790
can jump ahead a bit and I think you
know we can talk about physics project

800
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
know we can talk about physics project
 

801
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,470
know we can talk about physics project
and so on but I think the thing we

802
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
and so on but I think the thing we
 

803
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,889
and so on but I think the thing we
realize is we kind of exist in a slice

804
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:03,899
realize is we kind of exist in a slice
 

805
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,329
realize is we kind of exist in a slice
of all the possible computational

806
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:05,339
of all the possible computational
 

807
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,610
of all the possible computational
irreducibility in the universe we exist

808
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:07,620
irreducibility in the universe we exist
 

809
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,410
irreducibility in the universe we exist
in a slice where there's a reasonable

810
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:09,420
in a slice where there's a reasonable
 

811
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,170
in a slice where there's a reasonable
amount of predictability and in a sense

812
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,180
amount of predictability and in a sense
 

813
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,210
amount of predictability and in a sense
as we try and construct these kind of

814
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,220
as we try and construct these kind of
 

815
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,990
as we try and construct these kind of
higher levels of of abstraction symbolic

816
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
higher levels of of abstraction symbolic
 

817
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,430
higher levels of of abstraction symbolic
representations and so on what we're

818
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
representations and so on what we're
 

819
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,530
representations and so on what we're
doing is we're finding these lumps of

820
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:21,540
doing is we're finding these lumps of
 

821
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,870
doing is we're finding these lumps of
reducibility that we can kind of attach

822
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:23,880
reducibility that we can kind of attach
 

823
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,629
reducibility that we can kind of attach
ourselves to and about which we can kind

824
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
ourselves to and about which we can kind
 

825
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,730
ourselves to and about which we can kind
of have fairly simple narrative things

826
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:28,740
of have fairly simple narrative things
 

827
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,889
of have fairly simple narrative things

00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:30,899

00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,930

831
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,670
say what's going to happen in the next
few seconds you know oh there are these

832
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:34,680
few seconds you know oh there are these
 

833
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,230
few seconds you know oh there are these
molecules moving around in the air in

834
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
molecules moving around in the air in
 

835
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,389
molecules moving around in the air in
this room and oh gosh it's an incredibly

836
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
this room and oh gosh it's an incredibly
 

837
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,310
this room and oh gosh it's an incredibly
complicated story

838
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
complicated story
 

839
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,689
complicated story
um and that's a whole computational

840
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:41,699
um and that's a whole computational
 

841
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,030
um and that's a whole computational
irresistible thing most of which I don't

842
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,040
irresistible thing most of which I don't
 

843
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,569
irresistible thing most of which I don't
care about and most of it is well you

844
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:47,579
care about and most of it is well you
 

845
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,710
care about and most of it is well you
know the air is still going to be here

846
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
know the air is still going to be here
 

847
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,090
know the air is still going to be here
and nothing much is going to be

848
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,100
and nothing much is going to be
 

849
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,430
and nothing much is going to be
different about it and that's a kind of

850
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:52,440
different about it and that's a kind of
 

851
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,889
different about it and that's a kind of
reducible fact about what is ultimately

852
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:54,899
reducible fact about what is ultimately
 

853
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,930
reducible fact about what is ultimately
a an underlying level of computational

00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:56,940
a an underlying level of computational

irreducible process
 

857
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,449
irreducible process
and uh life would not be possible if we

858
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:02,459
and uh life would not be possible if we
 

859
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,910
and uh life would not be possible if we
didn't have a large number of such

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:04,920
didn't have a large number of such

didn't have a large number of such
reducible Pockets uh yes Pockets

862
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
reducible Pockets uh yes Pockets
 

863
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,189
reducible Pockets uh yes Pockets
amenable to uh reduction into something

864
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:10,199
amenable to uh reduction into something
 

865
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,069
amenable to uh reduction into something
symbolic yes I think so I mean life in

866
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:13,079
symbolic yes I think so I mean life in
 

867
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,210
symbolic yes I think so I mean life in
in the way that we experience it that I

868
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:17,220
in the way that we experience it that I
 

869
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,150
in the way that we experience it that I
mean you know one might you know

870
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
mean you know one might you know
 

871
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,129
mean you know one might you know
depending on what we mean by life so to

872
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:22,139
depending on what we mean by life so to
 

873
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,829
depending on what we mean by life so to
speak the the the experience that we

874
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:24,839
speak the the the experience that we
 

875
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,810
speak the the the experience that we
have of sort of consistent things

876
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:26,820
have of sort of consistent things
 

877
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,449
have of sort of consistent things
happening in the world the idea of space

878
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:29,459
happening in the world the idea of space
 

879
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,550
happening in the world the idea of space
for example where there's you know we

880
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:31,560
for example where there's you know we
 

881
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,889
for example where there's you know we
can just say you're here you move there

882
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:33,899
can just say you're here you move there
 

883
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,530
can just say you're here you move there
it's kind of the same thing it's still

884
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:36,540
it's kind of the same thing it's still
 

885
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,509
it's kind of the same thing it's still
you in that different place even though

886
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:38,519
you in that different place even though
 

887
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,069
you in that different place even though
you're made of different atoms of space

888
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
you're made of different atoms of space
 

889
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,970
you're made of different atoms of space
and so on this is this idea that it's uh

890
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:43,980
and so on this is this idea that it's uh
 

891
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,769
and so on this is this idea that it's uh
that there's sort of this level of

892
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:45,779
that there's sort of this level of
 

893
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,930
that there's sort of this level of
predictability of what's going on that's

894
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:47,940
predictability of what's going on that's
 

895
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,050
predictability of what's going on that's
us finding a slice of reducibility in

896
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,060
us finding a slice of reducibility in
 

897
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,970
us finding a slice of reducibility in
what is underneath this computationally

898
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:52,980
what is underneath this computationally
 

899
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,790
what is underneath this computationally
reducible kind of system and I think

900
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:55,800
reducible kind of system and I think
 

901
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,889
reducible kind of system and I think
that's that's sort of the thing which is

902
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:57,899
that's that's sort of the thing which is
 

903
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,710
that's that's sort of the thing which is
actually my favorite discovery of the

904
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
actually my favorite discovery of the
 

905
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,829
actually my favorite discovery of the
last few years is the realization that

906
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
last few years is the realization that
 

907
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,750
last few years is the realization that
it is sort of the interaction between

908
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
it is sort of the interaction between
 

909
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,309
it is sort of the interaction between
this sort of underlying computational

910
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:07,319
this sort of underlying computational
 

911
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,689
this sort of underlying computational
irreducibility and our nature as kind of

912
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:11,699
irreducibility and our nature as kind of
 

913
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,270
irreducibility and our nature as kind of
observers who sort of have to key into

914
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,280
observers who sort of have to key into
 

915
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,470
observers who sort of have to key into
computational reducibility that fact

916
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:17,480
computational reducibility that fact
 

917
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,390
computational reducibility that fact
leads to the main laws of physics that

918
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
leads to the main laws of physics that
 

919
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,250
leads to the main laws of physics that
we discovered in throughout his century

920
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,260
we discovered in throughout his century
 

921
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,530
we discovered in throughout his century
so this is we talked about this in in

922
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:24,540
so this is we talked about this in in
 

923
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,949
so this is we talked about this in in
more detail but this is a uh to me it's

924
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:27,959
more detail but this is a uh to me it's
 

925
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,610
more detail but this is a uh to me it's
kind of our nature as observers the fact

926
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:31,620
kind of our nature as observers the fact
 

927
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,470
kind of our nature as observers the fact
that we are computationally bounded

928
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:33,480
that we are computationally bounded
 

929
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,750
that we are computationally bounded
observers we don't get to follow all

930
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
observers we don't get to follow all
 

931
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,890

those little pieces of computational

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:36,900
those little pieces of computational

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,789
what's the detail of what's going on in
the world that together with one other

948
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:55,799
the world that together with one other
 

949
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,310
the world that together with one other
condition that at first seems sort of

950
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
condition that at first seems sort of
 

951
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,710
condition that at first seems sort of
trivial but isn't which is that we

952
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
trivial but isn't which is that we
 

953
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,750
trivial but isn't which is that we
believe we are persistent in time

954
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:02,760
believe we are persistent in time
 

955
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,529
believe we are persistent in time
that is yes you know uh so some sense of

956
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:06,539
that is yes you know uh so some sense of
 

957
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,870
that is yes you know uh so some sense of
causality here's the thing at every

958
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
causality here's the thing at every
 

959
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,570
causality here's the thing at every
moment according to our Theory we're

960
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:11,580
moment according to our Theory we're
 

961
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,549
moment according to our Theory we're
made of different atoms of space

962
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:13,559
made of different atoms of space
 

963
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,310
made of different atoms of space
at every moment sort of the microscopic

964
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
at every moment sort of the microscopic
 

965
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,350
at every moment sort of the microscopic
detail of what what the universe is made

966
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,360
detail of what what the universe is made
 

967
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,230
detail of what what the universe is made
of is being Rewritten and that's and in

968
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,240
of is being Rewritten and that's and in
 

969
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,370
of is being Rewritten and that's and in
fact the very fact that there's

970
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:22,380
fact the very fact that there's
 

971
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,990
fact the very fact that there's
coherence between different parts of

972
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
coherence between different parts of
 

973
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,850
coherence between different parts of
space is a consequence of the fact that

974
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:25,860
space is a consequence of the fact that
 

975
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,810
space is a consequence of the fact that
there are all these little processes

976
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:26,820
there are all these little processes
 

977
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,549
there are all these little processes
going on that kind of knit together the

978
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
going on that kind of knit together the
 

979
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,169
going on that kind of knit together the
structure of space it's kind of like if

980
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:30,179
structure of space it's kind of like if
 

981
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,549
structure of space it's kind of like if
you wanted to have a fluid with a bunch

982
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:31,559
you wanted to have a fluid with a bunch
 

983
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,409
you wanted to have a fluid with a bunch
of molecules in it if those molecules

984
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:33,419
of molecules in it if those molecules
 

985
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,210
of molecules in it if those molecules
weren't interacting you wouldn't have

986
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,220
weren't interacting you wouldn't have
 

987
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,950
weren't interacting you wouldn't have
this fluid that would pour and do all

988
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
this fluid that would pour and do all
 

989
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,390
this fluid that would pour and do all
these kinds of things it would just be

990
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
these kinds of things it would just be
 

991
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,830
these kinds of things it would just be
sort of a free-floating collection of

992
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
sort of a free-floating collection of
 

993
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,110
sort of a free-floating collection of
molecules so similarities with space

994
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,120
molecules so similarities with space
 

995
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,909
molecules so similarities with space
that the fact that space is kind of

996
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
that the fact that space is kind of
 

997
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,770
that the fact that space is kind of
knitted together as a consequence of all

998
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:45,780
knitted together as a consequence of all
 

999
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,770
knitted together as a consequence of all
this activity in space and the fact that

1000
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:48,780
this activity in space and the fact that
 

1001
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,710
this activity in space and the fact that
kind of what we consist of sort of this

1002
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:51,720
kind of what we consist of sort of this
 

1003
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,409
kind of what we consist of sort of this
this series of of uh you know we're

1004
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:54,419
this series of of uh you know we're
 

1005
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,510
this series of of uh you know we're
continually being Rewritten and the

1006
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:56,520
continually being Rewritten and the
 

1007
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,490
continually being Rewritten and the
question is why is it the case that we

1008
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:58,500
question is why is it the case that we
 

1009
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,310
question is why is it the case that we
think of ourselves as being the same us

1010
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:01,320
think of ourselves as being the same us
 

1011
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,130
think of ourselves as being the same us
through time that's kind of a key

1012
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,140
through time that's kind of a key
 

1013
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,110
through time that's kind of a key
assumption I think it's a key aspect of

1014
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,120
assumption I think it's a key aspect of
 

1015
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,150
assumption I think it's a key aspect of
what we see as sort of our Consciousness

1016
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
what we see as sort of our Consciousness
 

1017
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,430
what we see as sort of our Consciousness
so to speak is that we have this kind of

1018
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,440
so to speak is that we have this kind of
 

1019
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,590
so to speak is that we have this kind of
consistent thread of experience well

1020
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:12,600
consistent thread of experience well
 

1021
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,870
consistent thread of experience well
isn't that just another

1022
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
isn't that just another
 

1023
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,789
isn't that just another
limitation

1024
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
limitation
 

1025
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,150
limitation
of our mind that we want to reduce

1026
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
of our mind that we want to reduce
 

1027
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,529
of our mind that we want to reduce
reality into some that kind of temporal

1028
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:24,539
reality into some that kind of temporal
 

1029
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,630
reality into some that kind of temporal
yeah consistency is just a nice

1030
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
yeah consistency is just a nice
 

1031
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,330
yeah consistency is just a nice
narrative right tell ourselves well the

1032
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,340
narrative right tell ourselves well the
 

1033
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,370
narrative right tell ourselves well the
fact is I think it's critical to the way

1034
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:31,380
fact is I think it's critical to the way
 

1035
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,590
fact is I think it's critical to the way
we humans typically operate is that we

1036
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
we humans typically operate is that we
 

1037
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,930
we humans typically operate is that we
have a single thread of experience you

1038
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:35,940
have a single thread of experience you
 

1039
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,510
have a single thread of experience you
know if you if you imagine sort of a

1040
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,520
know if you if you imagine sort of a
 

1041
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,310
know if you if you imagine sort of a
mind where you have you know maybe

1042
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
mind where you have you know maybe
 

1043
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,230
mind where you have you know maybe
that's what's happening in various kinds

1044
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
that's what's happening in various kinds
 

1045
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,029
that's what's happening in various kinds
of Minds that aren't working the same

1046
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:44,039
of Minds that aren't working the same
 

1047
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,830
of Minds that aren't working the same
way other minds work is that you're

1048
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
way other minds work is that you're
 

1049
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,210
way other minds work is that you're
splitting into multiple threads of

1050
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,220
splitting into multiple threads of
 

1051
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,909
splitting into multiple threads of
experience it's also it's also something

1052
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
experience it's also it's also something
 

1053
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,650
experience it's also it's also something
where you know when you look at I don't

1054
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:51,660
where you know when you look at I don't
 

1055
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,990
where you know when you look at I don't
know Quantum Mechanics for example in

1056
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
know Quantum Mechanics for example in
 

1057
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,210
know Quantum Mechanics for example in
the insides of quantum mechanics it's

1058
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,220
the insides of quantum mechanics it's
 

1059
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,470
the insides of quantum mechanics it's
splitting into many threads of

1060
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:57,480
splitting into many threads of
 

1061
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,230
splitting into many threads of
experience but in order for us humans to

1062
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
experience but in order for us humans to
 

1063
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,970
experience but in order for us humans to
interact with it you kind of have to

1064
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:01,980
interact with it you kind of have to
 

1065
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,190
interact with it you kind of have to
have to knit all those different threads

1066
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,200
have to knit all those different threads
 

1067
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,169
have to knit all those different threads
together so that we say oh yeah a

1068
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:06,179
together so that we say oh yeah a
 

1069
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,730
together so that we say oh yeah a
definite thing happened and now the next

1070
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:07,740
definite thing happened and now the next
 

1071
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,130
definite thing happened and now the next
definite thing happens and so on and I

1072
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,140
definite thing happens and so on and I
 

1073
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,150
definite thing happens and so on and I
think you know sort of inside uh it's

1074
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,160
think you know sort of inside uh it's
 

1075
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,770
think you know sort of inside uh it's
it's sort of interesting to try and

1076
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:15,780
it's sort of interesting to try and
 

1077
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,070
it's sort of interesting to try and
imagine what's it like to have kind of

1078
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,080
imagine what's it like to have kind of
 

1079
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,470
imagine what's it like to have kind of
these uh fundamentally multiple threads

1080
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:21,480
these uh fundamentally multiple threads
 

1081
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,090
these uh fundamentally multiple threads
of experience going on I mean right now

1082
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:23,100
of experience going on I mean right now
 

1083
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,669
of experience going on I mean right now
different human Minds have different

1084
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
different human Minds have different
 

1085
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,470
different human Minds have different
threads of experience we just have a

1086
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:27,480
threads of experience we just have a
 

1087
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,789
threads of experience we just have a
bunch of Minds that are interacting with

1088
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
bunch of Minds that are interacting with
 

1089
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,130
bunch of Minds that are interacting with
each other but we don't have a you know

1090
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,140
each other but we don't have a you know
 

1091
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,590
each other but we don't have a you know
within each mind there's a single thread

1092
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
within each mind there's a single thread
 

1093
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,750
within each mind there's a single thread
and that's a that is indeed a

1094
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
and that's a that is indeed a
 

1095
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,610
and that's a that is indeed a
simplification I think it's a it's a

1096
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:37,620
simplification I think it's a it's a
 

1097
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,169
simplification I think it's a it's a
thing you know the general computational

1098
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:39,179
thing you know the general computational
 

1099
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,029
thing you know the general computational
system does not have that simplification

1100
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
system does not have that simplification
 

1101
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,909
system does not have that simplification
and um it's one of the things you know I

1102
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
and um it's one of the things you know I
 

1103
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,010
and um it's one of the things you know I
I people often seem to think that you

1104
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,020
I people often seem to think that you
 

1105
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,690
I people often seem to think that you
know Consciousness is the highest level

1106
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:47,700
know Consciousness is the highest level
 

1107
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,909
know Consciousness is the highest level
of kind of things that can happen in the

1108
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
of kind of things that can happen in the
 

1109
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,470
of kind of things that can happen in the
universe so to speak but I think that's

1110
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:51,480
universe so to speak but I think that's
 

1111
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,049
universe so to speak but I think that's
not true I think it's actually a a

1112
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:54,059
not true I think it's actually a a
 

1113
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,750
not true I think it's actually a a
specialization in which among other

1114
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:56,760
specialization in which among other
 

1115
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,490
specialization in which among other
things you have this idea of a single

1116
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:58,500
things you have this idea of a single
 

1117
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,470
things you have this idea of a single
threat of experience which is not a

1118
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
threat of experience which is not a
 

1119
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,390
threat of experience which is not a
general feature of anything that could

1120
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
general feature of anything that could
 

1121
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,830
general feature of anything that could
kind of computationally happen in the

1122
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
kind of computationally happen in the
 

1123
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,630
kind of computationally happen in the
universe so it's a feature of a

1124
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:05,640
universe so it's a feature of a
 

1125
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,430
universe so it's a feature of a
computationally limited system that's

1126
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
computationally limited system that's
 

1127
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,490
computationally limited system that's
only able to

1128
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:09,500
only able to
 

1129
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,350
only able to
observe

1130
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360
observe
 

1131
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,650
observe
reducible Pockets so yeah so I mean this

1132
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:15,660
reducible Pockets so yeah so I mean this
 

1133
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,230
reducible Pockets so yeah so I mean this
word Observer it means something in

1134
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
word Observer it means something in
 

1135
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,110
word Observer it means something in
quantum mechanics it means something

1136
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
quantum mechanics it means something
 

1137
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,450
quantum mechanics it means something
in a lot of places it means something to

1138
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:23,460
in a lot of places it means something to
 

1139
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,090
in a lot of places it means something to
us humans right as conscious beings so

1140
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,100
us humans right as conscious beings so
 

1141
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,029
us humans right as conscious beings so
what what's the importance of the

1142
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
what what's the importance of the
 

1143
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,890
what what's the importance of the
Observer what is the Observer and what's

1144
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:30,900
Observer what is the Observer and what's
 

1145
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,330
Observer what is the Observer and what's
the importance of the observer in the

1146
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:32,340
the importance of the observer in the
 

1147
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,430
the importance of the observer in the
computational universe so this question

1148
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:34,440
computational universe so this question
 

1149
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,590
computational universe so this question
of what is an observer what's the

1150
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:36,600
of what is an observer what's the
 

1151
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,149
of what is an observer what's the
general idea of an observer it's

1152
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
general idea of an observer it's
 

1153
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,590
general idea of an observer it's
actually one of my next projects which

1154
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
actually one of my next projects which
 

1155
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,510
actually one of my next projects which
got somewhat derailed by the the current

1156
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
got somewhat derailed by the the current
 

1157
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,610
got somewhat derailed by the the current
sort of AI Mania but um is there a

1158
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:43,620
sort of AI Mania but um is there a
 

1159
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,770
sort of AI Mania but um is there a
connection there or is that uh do you do

1160
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:45,780
connection there or is that uh do you do
 

1161
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,210
connection there or is that uh do you do
you think the Observer is primarily a

1162
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:47,220
you think the Observer is primarily a
 

1163
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,250
you think the Observer is primarily a
physics phenomena is it related to the

1164
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,260
physics phenomena is it related to the
 

1165
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,950
physics phenomena is it related to the
whole AI thing yes yes it is related so

1166
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:51,960
whole AI thing yes yes it is related so
 

1167
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,270
whole AI thing yes yes it is related so
one question is what is a general

1168
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
one question is what is a general
 

1169
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,149
one question is what is a general
Observer so you know we know we have an

1170
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
Observer so you know we know we have an
 

1171
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,830
Observer so you know we know we have an
idea what is a general computational

1172
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
idea what is a general computational
 

1173
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,870
idea what is a general computational
system we think about Turing machines we

1174
00:21:59,870 --> 00:21:59,880
system we think about Turing machines we
 

1175
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,430
system we think about Turing machines we
think about other models of computation

1176
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
think about other models of computation
 

1177
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,230
think about other models of computation
there's a question what is a general

1178
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,240
there's a question what is a general
 

1179
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,990
there's a question what is a general
model of an observer and the there's

1180
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
model of an observer and the there's
 

1181
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,990
model of an observer and the there's
kind of observers like us which is kind

1182
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,000
kind of observers like us which is kind
 

1183
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,730
kind of observers like us which is kind
of The Observers we're interested in you

1184
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:10,740
of The Observers we're interested in you
 

1185
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,470
of The Observers we're interested in you
know we could imagine an alien Observer

1186
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
know we could imagine an alien Observer
 

1187
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,549
know we could imagine an alien Observer
that deals with computational

1188
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:13,559
that deals with computational
 

1189
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,409
that deals with computational
irreducibility and it has a mind that's

1190
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:15,419
irreducibility and it has a mind that's
 

1191
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,270
irreducibility and it has a mind that's
utterly different from ours and and

1192
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
utterly different from ours and and
 

1193
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,830
utterly different from ours and and
completely incoherent with what what

1194
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:18,840
completely incoherent with what what
 

1195
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,070
completely incoherent with what what
we're like but the fact is that that you

1196
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
we're like but the fact is that that you
 

1197
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,870
we're like but the fact is that that you
know if we are talking about observers

1198
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:23,880
know if we are talking about observers
 

1199
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,630
know if we are talking about observers
like us that one of the key things is

1200
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
like us that one of the key things is
 

1201
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,390
like us that one of the key things is
this idea of kind of taking all the

1202
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:29,400
this idea of kind of taking all the
 

1203
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,130
this idea of kind of taking all the
detail of the world and being able to

1204
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:31,140
detail of the world and being able to
 

1205
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,409
detail of the world and being able to
stuff it into a mind being able to take

1206
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:33,419
stuff it into a mind being able to take
 

1207
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,690
stuff it into a mind being able to take
all the detail and kind of you know

1208
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:35,700
all the detail and kind of you know
 

1209
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,049
all the detail and kind of you know
extract out of it a smaller set of of

1210
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:39,059
extract out of it a smaller set of of
 

1211
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,029
extract out of it a smaller set of of
kind of degrees of freedom a smaller

1212
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
kind of degrees of freedom a smaller
 

1213
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,789
kind of degrees of freedom a smaller
number of elements that will sort of fit

1214
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:43,799
number of elements that will sort of fit
 

1215
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,310
number of elements that will sort of fit
in our minds and I think this this

1216
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
in our minds and I think this this
 

1217
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,230
in our minds and I think this this
question so I've been interested in

1218
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
question so I've been interested in
 

1219
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,090
question so I've been interested in
trying to characterize what is the

1220
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,100
trying to characterize what is the
 

1221
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,710
trying to characterize what is the
general Observer and the general

1222
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:51,720
general Observer and the general
 

1223
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,490
general Observer and the general
Observer is I think in part there are

1224
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:55,500
Observer is I think in part there are
 

1225
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,230
Observer is I think in part there are
many let me give an example of a you

1226
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:57,240
many let me give an example of a you
 

1227
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,549
many let me give an example of a you
know you have a gas it's got a bunch of

1228
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559
know you have a gas it's got a bunch of
 

1229
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,190
know you have a gas it's got a bunch of
molecules bouncing around and the thing

1230
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
molecules bouncing around and the thing
 

1231
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,169
molecules bouncing around and the thing
you're measuring about the gas is its

1232
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:03,179
you're measuring about the gas is its
 

1233
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,450
you're measuring about the gas is its
pressure and the only anything you as an

1234
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:05,460
pressure and the only anything you as an
 

1235
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,430
pressure and the only anything you as an
observer care about is pressure and that

1236
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
observer care about is pressure and that
 

1237
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,169
observer care about is pressure and that
means you have a piston on the side of

1238
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:09,179
means you have a piston on the side of
 

1239
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,270
means you have a piston on the side of
this box and the Piston is being pushed

1240
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
this box and the Piston is being pushed
 

1241
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,370
this box and the Piston is being pushed
by the gas and there are many many

1242
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:13,380
by the gas and there are many many
 

1243
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,870
by the gas and there are many many
different ways that molecules can hit

1244
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
different ways that molecules can hit
 

1245
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,049
different ways that molecules can hit
that piston but all that matters is the

1246
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:18,059
that piston but all that matters is the
 

1247
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,149
that piston but all that matters is the
kind of aggregate of all those molecular

1248
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
kind of aggregate of all those molecular
 

1249
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,190
kind of aggregate of all those molecular
impacts because that's what determines

1250
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,200
impacts because that's what determines
 

1251
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,930
impacts because that's what determines
pressure so there's a huge number of

1252
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:23,940
pressure so there's a huge number of
 

1253
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,310
pressure so there's a huge number of
different configurations of the gas

1254
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,320
different configurations of the gas
 

1255
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,830
different configurations of the gas
which are all equivalent so I think one

1256
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
which are all equivalent so I think one
 

1257
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,510
which are all equivalent so I think one
key aspect of observers is this

1258
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
key aspect of observers is this
 

1259
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,250
key aspect of observers is this
equivalency of many different

1260
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,260
equivalency of many different
 

1261
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,710
equivalency of many different
configurations of a system saying all I

1262
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:33,720
configurations of a system saying all I
 

1263
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,690
configurations of a system saying all I
care about is this aggregate feature all

1264
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:35,700
care about is this aggregate feature all
 

1265
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,970
care about is this aggregate feature all
I care about is this this overall thing

1266
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:37,980
I care about is this this overall thing
 

1267
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,610
I care about is this this overall thing
and that's that sort of one one aspect

1268
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:40,620
and that's that sort of one one aspect
 

1269
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,289
and that's that sort of one one aspect
and when we see that in lots of

1270
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:42,299
and when we see that in lots of
 

1271
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,210
and when we see that in lots of
different again it's the same story over

1272
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,220
different again it's the same story over
 

1273
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,950
different again it's the same story over
and over again that there's there's a

1274
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:45,960
and over again that there's there's a
 

1275
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,049
and over again that there's there's a
lot of detail in the world but what we

1276
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:48,059
lot of detail in the world but what we
 

1277
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,210
lot of detail in the world but what we
are extracting from it is something a

1278
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,220
are extracting from it is something a
 

1279
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,029
are extracting from it is something a
sort of a thin a thin summary of that of

1280
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
sort of a thin a thin summary of that of
 

1281
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,149
sort of a thin a thin summary of that of
that detail is that thin summary

1282
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:55,159
that detail is that thin summary
 

1283
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,990
that detail is that thin summary
nevertheless true is can it be a crappy

1284
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
nevertheless true is can it be a crappy
 

1285
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,230
nevertheless true is can it be a crappy
approximation sure that on average is is

1286
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,240
approximation sure that on average is is
 

1287
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,490
approximation sure that on average is is
correct I mean if we look at the

1288
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:04,500
correct I mean if we look at the
 

1289
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,350

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,360
Observer that's the human mind it seems
 

1291
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,570
Observer that's the human mind it seems
like there's a lot of very

1292
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:08,580
like there's a lot of very
 

1293
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,010
like there's a lot of very
um as represented by natural language

1294
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,020
um as represented by natural language
 

1295
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,390
um as represented by natural language
for example there's a lot of really

1296
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:11,400
for example there's a lot of really
 

1297
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,970
for example there's a lot of really
crappy approximation sure and that could

1298
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:13,980
crappy approximation sure and that could
 

1299
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,310
crappy approximation sure and that could
be maybe a feature of it well with this

1300
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
be maybe a feature of it well with this
 

1301
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,549
be maybe a feature of it well with this
ambiguity right right you don't know you

1302
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:19,559
ambiguity right right you don't know you
 

1303
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,169
ambiguity right right you don't know you
know it could be the case you're just

1304
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:21,179
know it could be the case you're just
 

1305
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:22,909
know it could be the case you're just
measuring the aggregate impacts of these

1306
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:22,919
measuring the aggregate impacts of these
 

1307
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,250
measuring the aggregate impacts of these
molecules but there is some tiny tiny

1308
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,260
molecules but there is some tiny tiny
 

1309
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,289
molecules but there is some tiny tiny
probability that molecules will arrange

1310
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:27,299
probability that molecules will arrange
 

1311
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,750
probability that molecules will arrange
themselves in some really funky way and

1312
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
themselves in some really funky way and
 

1313
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,270
themselves in some really funky way and
that just measuring that average isn't

1314
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,280
that just measuring that average isn't
 

1315
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,070
that just measuring that average isn't
going to be the main point yeah by the

1316
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
going to be the main point yeah by the
 

1317
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,350
going to be the main point yeah by the
way an awful lot of science is very

1318
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:36,360
way an awful lot of science is very
 

1319
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,090
way an awful lot of science is very
confused about this because you know you

1320
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,100
confused about this because you know you
 

1321
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,070
confused about this because you know you
look at you look at papers and people

1322
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
look at you look at papers and people
 

1323
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,049
look at you look at papers and people
are really Keen they draw this curve and

1324
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:42,059
are really Keen they draw this curve and
 

1325
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,090
are really Keen they draw this curve and
they have these you know these bars on

1326
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,100
they have these you know these bars on
 

1327
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,649
they have these you know these bars on
the curve and things it's just this

1328
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:45,659
the curve and things it's just this
 

1329
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,049
the curve and things it's just this
curve and it's this one thing and it's

1330
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:48,059
curve and it's this one thing and it's
 

1331
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,510
curve and it's this one thing and it's
supposed to represent some system that

1332
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:50,520
supposed to represent some system that
 

1333
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,850
supposed to represent some system that
has all kinds of details in it and this

1334
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:52,860
has all kinds of details in it and this
 

1335
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,590
has all kinds of details in it and this
is a way that lots of science has gotten

1336
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:54,600
is a way that lots of science has gotten
 

1337
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,149
is a way that lots of science has gotten
wrong because people say I remember

1338
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
wrong because people say I remember
 

1339
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,070
wrong because people say I remember
years ago I was studying snowflake

1340
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,080
years ago I was studying snowflake
 

1341
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,409
years ago I was studying snowflake
growth you know you have the Snowflake

1342
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:00,419
growth you know you have the Snowflake
 

1343
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,909
growth you know you have the Snowflake
and it's growing it has all these arms

1344
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
and it's growing it has all these arms
 

1345
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,010
and it's growing it has all these arms
it's doing complicated things but there

1346
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,020
it's doing complicated things but there
 

1347
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,230
it's doing complicated things but there
was a literature on this stuff and it

1348
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240
was a literature on this stuff and it
 

1349
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,669
was a literature on this stuff and it
talked about you know what's the rate of

1350
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
talked about you know what's the rate of
 

1351
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,710
talked about you know what's the rate of
snowflake growth and you know it got

1352
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:09,720
snowflake growth and you know it got
 

1353
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,330
snowflake growth and you know it got
pretty good answers for the rate of the

1354
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:11,340
pretty good answers for the rate of the
 

1355
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,250
pretty good answers for the rate of the
growth of the Snowflake and they looked

1356
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:13,260
growth of the Snowflake and they looked
 

1357
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,870
growth of the Snowflake and they looked
at it more carefully and they had these

1358
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
at it more carefully and they had these
 

1359
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,490
at it more carefully and they had these
nice curves of you know snowflake growth

1360
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:16,500
nice curves of you know snowflake growth
 

1361
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,990
nice curves of you know snowflake growth
rates and so on I looked at it more

1362
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
rates and so on I looked at it more
 

1363
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,730
rates and so on I looked at it more
carefully and I realized according to

1364
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:19,740
carefully and I realized according to
 

1365
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,230
carefully and I realized according to
their models the snowflake will be

1366
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,240
their models the snowflake will be
 

1367
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,029
their models the snowflake will be
spherical

1368
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
spherical
 

1369
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,970
spherical
and so they got the growth rate right

1370
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:24,980
and so they got the growth rate right
 

1371
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,830
and so they got the growth rate right
but the detail was just utterly wrong

1372
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,840
but the detail was just utterly wrong
 

1373
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,110
but the detail was just utterly wrong
and you know that not only the detail

1374
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,120
and you know that not only the detail
 

1375
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,690
and you know that not only the detail
that the whole thing was was not

1376
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:32,700
that the whole thing was was not
 

1377
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,850
that the whole thing was was not
capturing you know it was capturing this

1378
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:34,860
capturing you know it was capturing this
 

1379
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,250
capturing you know it was capturing this
aspect of the system that was in a sense

1380
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,260
aspect of the system that was in a sense
 

1381
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,870
aspect of the system that was in a sense
missing the main point of what was going

1382
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
missing the main point of what was going
 

1383
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,649
missing the main point of what was going
on and what is the geometric uh shape of

1384
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:42,659
on and what is the geometric uh shape of
 

1385
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,830
on and what is the geometric uh shape of
a snowflake snowflakes start in in the

1386
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
a snowflake snowflakes start in in the
 

1387
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,110
a snowflake snowflakes start in in the
phase of water that's relevant to the

1388
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,120
phase of water that's relevant to the
 

1389
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,149
phase of water that's relevant to the
formation of snowflakes it's a phase of

1390
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
formation of snowflakes it's a phase of
 

1391
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,250
formation of snowflakes it's a phase of
ice which starts with a hexagonal

1392
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,260
ice which starts with a hexagonal
 

1393
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,649
ice which starts with a hexagonal
arrangement of of water molecules and so

1394
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:54,659
arrangement of of water molecules and so
 

1395
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,330
arrangement of of water molecules and so
it starts off growing as a hexagonal

1396
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:56,340
it starts off growing as a hexagonal
 

1397
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,029
it starts off growing as a hexagonal
plate and then what happens is is the

1398
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
plate and then what happens is is the
 

1399
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,310
plate and then what happens is is the
plate oh oh versus sphere sphere well no

1400
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:01,320
plate oh oh versus sphere sphere well no
 

1401
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,570
plate oh oh versus sphere sphere well no
no but it's it's much more than that I

1402
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:02,580
no but it's it's much more than that I
 

1403
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,310
no but it's it's much more than that I
mean snowflakes are fluffy you know

1404
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,320
mean snowflakes are fluffy you know
 

1405
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,990
mean snowflakes are fluffy you know
typical snowflakes have little little

1406
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
typical snowflakes have little little
 

1407
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,450
typical snowflakes have little little
dendritic Arts yeah and what actually

1408
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,460
dendritic Arts yeah and what actually
 

1409
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,130
dendritic Arts yeah and what actually
happens is it's kind of kind of cool

1410
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,140
happens is it's kind of kind of cool
 

1411
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,230
happens is it's kind of kind of cool
because you can make these very simple

1412
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
because you can make these very simple
 

1413
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,269
because you can make these very simple
discrete models with cellular automata

1414
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:14,279
discrete models with cellular automata
 

1415
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,850
discrete models with cellular automata
and things that that figure this out you

1416
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:16,860
and things that that figure this out you
 

1417
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,710
and things that that figure this out you
start off with this you know hexagonal

1418
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
start off with this you know hexagonal
 

1419
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,830
start off with this you know hexagonal
thing and then the places it starts to

1420
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
thing and then the places it starts to
 

1421
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,230
thing and then the places it starts to
grow little arms and every time a little

1422
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
grow little arms and every time a little
 

1423
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,750
grow little arms and every time a little
piece of ice it adds itself to the

1424
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:26,760
piece of ice it adds itself to the
 

1425
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,970
piece of ice it adds itself to the
snowflake the fact that that ice

1426
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:28,980
snowflake the fact that that ice
 

1427
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,850
snowflake the fact that that ice
condensed from the water vapor heats the

1428
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:31,860
condensed from the water vapor heats the
 

1429
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,130
condensed from the water vapor heats the
snowflake up locally and so it makes it

1430
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,140
snowflake up locally and so it makes it
 

1431
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,490
snowflake up locally and so it makes it
less likely for uh for another piece of

1432
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:37,500
less likely for uh for another piece of
 

1433
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,669
less likely for uh for another piece of
ice to accumulate right nearby so this

1434
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:40,679
ice to accumulate right nearby so this
 

1435
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,169
ice to accumulate right nearby so this
leads to a kind of growth inhibition so

1436
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:42,179
leads to a kind of growth inhibition so
 

1437
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,289
leads to a kind of growth inhibition so
you grow an arm and it is a separated

1438
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:45,299
you grow an arm and it is a separated
 

1439
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,470
you grow an arm and it is a separated
arm because right around the arm it got

1440
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
arm because right around the arm it got
 

1441
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,750
arm because right around the arm it got
a little bit hot and it didn't add more

1442
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:50,760
a little bit hot and it didn't add more
 

1443
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,730
a little bit hot and it didn't add more
ice there so what happens is it grows

1444
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:52,740
ice there so what happens is it grows
 

1445
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,190
ice there so what happens is it grows
you have a hexagon it grows out arms the

1446
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,200
you have a hexagon it grows out arms the
 

1447
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,890
you have a hexagon it grows out arms the
arms go arms and then the arms go arms

1448
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:57,900
arms go arms and then the arms go arms
 

1449
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,570
arms go arms and then the arms go arms
go arms and eventually actually it's

1450
00:26:59,570 --> 00:26:59,580
go arms and eventually actually it's
 

1451
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,010
go arms and eventually actually it's
kind of cool because it actually fills

1452
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,020
kind of cool because it actually fills
 

1453
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,470
kind of cool because it actually fills
in another hexagon a bigger hexagon and

1454
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:03,480
in another hexagon a bigger hexagon and
 

1455
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,970
in another hexagon a bigger hexagon and
when I first looked at this we had a

1456
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:04,980
when I first looked at this we had a
 

1457
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,769
when I first looked at this we had a
very simple model for this I realized

1458
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:06,779
very simple model for this I realized
 

1459
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,210
very simple model for this I realized
you know when it fills in that hexagon

1460
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:08,220
you know when it fills in that hexagon
 

1461
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,310
you know when it fills in that hexagon
it actually leaves some holes behind so

1462
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
it actually leaves some holes behind so
 

1463
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,870
it actually leaves some holes behind so
I thought well you know that is that

1464
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:11,880
I thought well you know that is that
 

1465
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,070
I thought well you know that is that
really right so look at these pictures

1466
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,080
really right so look at these pictures
 

1467
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,750
really right so look at these pictures
of snowflakes and sure enough they have

1468
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:14,760
of snowflakes and sure enough they have
 

1469
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,549
of snowflakes and sure enough they have
these little holes in them that are kind

1470
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
these little holes in them that are kind
 

1471
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,950
these little holes in them that are kind
of scars of the way that these arms grow

1472
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960
of scars of the way that these arms grow
 

1473
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,149
of scars of the way that these arms grow
out

1474
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
out
 

1475
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,130
out
um so you can't fill in backfill holes

1476
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:24,140
um so you can't fill in backfill holes
 

1477
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,810
um so you can't fill in backfill holes
yeah they don't backfill and presumably

1478
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:26,820
yeah they don't backfill and presumably
 

1479
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,669
yeah they don't backfill and presumably
there's a limitation of how big like you

1480
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:28,679
there's a limitation of how big like you
 

1481
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,010
there's a limitation of how big like you
can't arbitrarily grow

1482
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,020
can't arbitrarily grow
 

1483
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,810
can't arbitrarily grow
I'm not sure I mean the thing falls

1484
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:32,820
I'm not sure I mean the thing falls
 

1485
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,490
I'm not sure I mean the thing falls
through the the I mean I think it this

1486
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,500
through the the I mean I think it this
 

1487
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,470
through the the I mean I think it this
you know it hits the ground at some

1488
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
you know it hits the ground at some
 

1489
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,990
you know it hits the ground at some
point I think you can grow I think you

1490
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,000
point I think you can grow I think you
 

1491
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,430
point I think you can grow I think you
can grow in the lab I think you can grow

1492
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:40,440
can grow in the lab I think you can grow
 

1493
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,049
can grow in the lab I think you can grow
pretty big ones I think you can grow

1494
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:42,059
pretty big ones I think you can grow
 

1495
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,330
pretty big ones I think you can grow
many many iterations of this kind of

1496
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:44,340
many many iterations of this kind of
 

1497
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,669
many many iterations of this kind of
goes from hexagon it grows out arms it

1498
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:46,679
goes from hexagon it grows out arms it
 

1499
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,470
goes from hexagon it grows out arms it
turns back it fills back into a hexagon

1500
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
turns back it fills back into a hexagon
 

1501
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,810
turns back it fills back into a hexagon
it grows more arms again in 3D no it's

1502
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:50,820
it grows more arms again in 3D no it's
 

1503
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,870
it grows more arms again in 3D no it's
flat usually why is it flat why doesn't

1504
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:53,880
flat usually why is it flat why doesn't
 

1505
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,930
flat usually why is it flat why doesn't
it uh span out okay wait a minute you

1506
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:56,940
it uh span out okay wait a minute you
 

1507
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,490
it uh span out okay wait a minute you
said it's fluffy and fluffy is a

1508
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:58,500
said it's fluffy and fluffy is a
 

1509
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,649
said it's fluffy and fluffy is a
three-dimensional property no or no it's

1510
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:00,659
three-dimensional property no or no it's
 

1511
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,769
three-dimensional property no or no it's
it's fluffy snow is okay so you know

1512
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:03,779
it's fluffy snow is okay so you know
 

1513
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,230
it's fluffy snow is okay so you know
what makes we're really uh we're really

1514
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,240
what makes we're really uh we're really
 

1515
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,690
what makes we're really uh we're really
in it

1516
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:07,700
in it
 

1517
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,669
in it
it's multiple snowflakes become fluffy a

1518
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:10,679
it's multiple snowflakes become fluffy a
 

1519
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,590
it's multiple snowflakes become fluffy a
single snowflake is not fluffy no no

1520
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:12,600
single snowflake is not fluffy no no
 

1521
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,049
single snowflake is not fluffy no no
single snowflake is Fluffy and what

1522
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:15,059
single snowflake is Fluffy and what
 

1523
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,750
single snowflake is Fluffy and what
happens is you know if if you have snow

1524
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
happens is you know if if you have snow
 

1525
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,750
happens is you know if if you have snow
that it's just pure hexagons they they

1526
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:20,760
that it's just pure hexagons they they
 

1527
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,250
that it's just pure hexagons they they
can you know they they fit together

1528
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,260
can you know they they fit together
 

1529
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,169
can you know they they fit together
pretty well it's not it doesn't it

1530
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:24,179
pretty well it's not it doesn't it
 

1531
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:25,370
pretty well it's not it doesn't it
doesn't make it doesn't have a lot of

1532
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:25,380
doesn't make it doesn't have a lot of
 

1533
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,289
doesn't make it doesn't have a lot of
air in it and they can also slide

1534
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:27,299
air in it and they can also slide
 

1535
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,970
air in it and they can also slide
against each other pretty easily and so

1536
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:28,980
against each other pretty easily and so
 

1537
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,769
against each other pretty easily and so
the snow can be pretty you know can I

1538
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:30,779
the snow can be pretty you know can I
 

1539
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,110
the snow can be pretty you know can I
think avalanches happen sometimes when

1540
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
think avalanches happen sometimes when
 

1541
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,510
think avalanches happen sometimes when
when the things tend to be these you

1542
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
when the things tend to be these you
 

1543
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,130
when the things tend to be these you
know hexagonal plates and it kind of

1544
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,140
know hexagonal plates and it kind of
 

1545
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,529
know hexagonal plates and it kind of
slides but then when the thing has all

1546
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:39,539
slides but then when the thing has all
 

1547
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,690
slides but then when the thing has all
these arms that have grown out it's not

1548
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:41,700
these arms that have grown out it's not
 

1549
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,370
these arms that have grown out it's not
they don't fit together very well and

1550
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:43,380
they don't fit together very well and
 

1551
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,350
they don't fit together very well and
that's why the snow has lots of air in

1552
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
that's why the snow has lots of air in
 

1553
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,730
that's why the snow has lots of air in
it and if you look at one of these

1554
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:46,740
it and if you look at one of these
 

1555
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,470
it and if you look at one of these
snowflakes and if you catch one you'll

1556
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
snowflakes and if you catch one you'll
 

1557
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,289
snowflakes and if you catch one you'll
see it has these little arms and people

1558
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:51,299
see it has these little arms and people
 

1559
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,970
see it has these little arms and people
actually people often say you know no

1560
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:52,980
actually people often say you know no
 

1561
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,010
actually people often say you know no
two snowflakes are alike

1562
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:55,020
two snowflakes are alike
 

1563
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,950
two snowflakes are alike
um that's mostly because as a snowflake

1564
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:57,960
um that's mostly because as a snowflake
 

1565
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,690
um that's mostly because as a snowflake
grows they do grow pretty consistently

1566
00:28:59,690 --> 00:28:59,700
grows they do grow pretty consistently
 

1567
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,610
grows they do grow pretty consistently
with these different arms and so on but

1568
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:01,620
with these different arms and so on but
 

1569
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,830
with these different arms and so on but
you capture them at different times as

1570
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
you capture them at different times as
 

1571
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,510
you capture them at different times as
they you know they fell through through

1572
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520
they you know they fell through through
 

1573
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,850
they you know they fell through through
the air in a different way you'll catch

1574
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:07,860
the air in a different way you'll catch
 

1575
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,190
the air in a different way you'll catch
this one at this stage and as it goes

1576
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,200
this one at this stage and as it goes
 

1577
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,269
this one at this stage and as it goes
through different stages they look

1578
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
through different stages they look
 

1579
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,370
through different stages they look
really different and so that's why you

1580
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:13,380
really different and so that's why you
 

1581
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,690
really different and so that's why you
know kind of looks like no two slime

1582
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:14,700
know kind of looks like no two slime
 

1583
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,610
know kind of looks like no two slime
flakes are alike because you caught them

1584
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:16,620
flakes are alike because you caught them
 

1585
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,409
flakes are alike because you caught them
at different at different times so the

1586
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:18,419
at different at different times so the
 

1587
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,389
at different at different times so the
rules under which they grow are the same

1588
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
rules under which they grow are the same
 

1589
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,029
rules under which they grow are the same
it's just the timing is yes okay so the

1590
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:23,039
it's just the timing is yes okay so the
 

1591
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,289
it's just the timing is yes okay so the
point is science is not able to uh

1592
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:26,299
point is science is not able to uh
 

1593
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,430
point is science is not able to uh
describe the full complexity of

1594
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:28,440
describe the full complexity of
 

1595
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,310
describe the full complexity of
snowflake growth well science if you if

1596
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,320
snowflake growth well science if you if
 

1597
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,070
snowflake growth well science if you if
you do what people might often do just

1598
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,080
you do what people might often do just
 

1599
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,529
you do what people might often do just
say okay let's make it scientific let's

1600
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:36,539
say okay let's make it scientific let's
 

1601
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,409
say okay let's make it scientific let's
turn into one number and that one number

1602
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:39,419
turn into one number and that one number
 

1603
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:40,789
turn into one number and that one number
is kind of the growth rate of the arms

1604
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:40,799
is kind of the growth rate of the arms
 

1605
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,010
is kind of the growth rate of the arms
or some such other thing that fails to

1606
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,020
or some such other thing that fails to
 

1607
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,870
or some such other thing that fails to
capture sort of the detail of what's

1608
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
capture sort of the detail of what's
 

1609
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,850
capture sort of the detail of what's
going on inside the system and that's in

1610
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:46,860
going on inside the system and that's in
 

1611
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,070
going on inside the system and that's in
a sense a big challenge for science is

1612
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,080
a sense a big challenge for science is
 

1613
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,010
a sense a big challenge for science is
how do you extract from the natural

1614
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,020
how do you extract from the natural
 

1615
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,649
how do you extract from the natural
world for example those aspects of it

1616
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:54,659
world for example those aspects of it
 

1617
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,230
world for example those aspects of it
that you are interested in talking about

1618
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:57,240
that you are interested in talking about
 

1619
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,730
that you are interested in talking about
now you might just say I don't really

1620
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:58,740
now you might just say I don't really
 

1621
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,110
now you might just say I don't really
care about the fluffiness of the

00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,120
care about the fluffiness of the
 

1623
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,970
care about the fluffiness of the
snowflakes all I care about is the

1624
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:01,980
snowflakes all I care about is the
 

1625
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,830
snowflakes all I care about is the
growth rate of the arms in which case

1626
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
growth rate of the arms in which case
 

1627
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,750
growth rate of the arms in which case
you know you have you can have a good

1628
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
you know you have you can have a good
 

1629
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,370
you know you have you can have a good
model without knowing anything about the

1630
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:07,380
model without knowing anything about the
 

1631

model without knowing anything about the
fluffiness

1632
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
fluffiness
 

1633
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,210
fluffiness
um but the fact is as a practical you

1634
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,220
um but the fact is as a practical you
 

1635
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,889
um but the fact is as a practical you
know when if you if you say what's the

1636
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:12,899
know when if you if you say what's the
 

1637
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,630
know when if you if you say what's the
what is the most obvious feature of a

1638
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
what is the most obvious feature of a
 

1639
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,070
what is the most obvious feature of a
snowflake oh that it has this

1640
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
snowflake oh that it has this
 

1641
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,710
snowflake oh that it has this
complicated shape well then you've got a

1642
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
complicated shape well then you've got a
 

1643
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,450
complicated shape well then you've got a
different story about what you model I

1644
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:20,460
different story about what you model I
 

1645
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,310
different story about what you model I
mean this is one of the features of sort

1646
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,320
mean this is one of the features of sort
 

1647
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,350
mean this is one of the features of sort
of modeling and science that you know

1648
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,360
of modeling and science that you know
 

1649
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,690
of modeling and science that you know
what is a Model A model is some way of

1650
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:26,700
what is a Model A model is some way of
 

1651
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,210
what is a Model A model is some way of
reducing the actuality of the world to

1652
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,220
reducing the actuality of the world to
 

1653
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,190
reducing the actuality of the world to
something where you can readily sort of

1654
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
something where you can readily sort of
 

1655
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,690
something where you can readily sort of
give a narrative for what's happening

1656
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:32,700
give a narrative for what's happening
 

1657
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,210
give a narrative for what's happening
where you can basically make some kind

1658
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:35,220
where you can basically make some kind
 

1659
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,370
where you can basically make some kind
of abstraction of what's happening and

1660
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:37,380
of abstraction of what's happening and
 

1661
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,169
of abstraction of what's happening and
answer questions that you care about

1662
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:39,179
answer questions that you care about
 

1663
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,970
answer questions that you care about
answering if you want to answer all

1664
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:40,980
answering if you want to answer all
 

1665
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,529
answering if you want to answer all
possible questions about the system

1666
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:42,539
possible questions about the system
 

1667
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,090
possible questions about the system
you'd have to have the whole system

1668
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,100
you'd have to have the whole system
 

1669
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,649
you'd have to have the whole system
because you might care about this

1670
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:45,659
because you might care about this
 

1671
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,630
because you might care about this
particular molecule where did it go and

1672
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:47,640
particular molecule where did it go and
 

1673
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,250
particular molecule where did it go and
you know your model which is some big

1674
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,260
you know your model which is some big
 

1675
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,169
you know your model which is some big
abstraction of that has nothing to say

1676
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:51,179
abstraction of that has nothing to say
 

1677
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,750
abstraction of that has nothing to say
about that so you know one of the things

1678
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
about that so you know one of the things
 

1679
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,549
about that so you know one of the things
that's that's often confusing in science

1680
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:55,559
that's that's often confusing in science
 

1681
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,870
that's that's often confusing in science
is people will have I've got a model

1682
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
is people will have I've got a model
 

1683
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,909
is people will have I've got a model
somebody says somebody else will say I

1684
00:30:58,909 --> 00:30:58,919
somebody says somebody else will say I
 

1685
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,110
somebody says somebody else will say I
don't believe in your model because it

1686
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,120
don't believe in your model because it
 

1687
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,430
don't believe in your model because it
doesn't capture the feature of the

1688
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
doesn't capture the feature of the
 

1689
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,230
doesn't capture the feature of the
system that I care about you know

1690
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,240
system that I care about you know
 

1691
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,669
system that I care about you know
there's always this controversy about

1692
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:04,679
there's always this controversy about
 

1693
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,010
there's always this controversy about
you know is the is it a correct model

1694
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,020
you know is the is it a correct model
 

1695
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,470
you know is the is it a correct model
well no model is a except for the actual

1696
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:09,480
well no model is a except for the actual
 

1697
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,230
well no model is a except for the actual
system itself is a correct model in the

1698
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,240
system itself is a correct model in the
 

1699
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,190
system itself is a correct model in the
sense that it captures everything

1700
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
sense that it captures everything
 

1701
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,230
sense that it captures everything
questions does It capture what you care

1702
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:15,240
questions does It capture what you care
 

1703
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,269
questions does It capture what you care
about capturing sometimes that's

1704
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
about capturing sometimes that's
 

1705
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,070
about capturing sometimes that's
ultimately defined by what you're going

1706
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,080
ultimately defined by what you're going
 

1707
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,810
ultimately defined by what you're going
to build technology out of things like

1708
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:20,820
to build technology out of things like
 

1709
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,510
to build technology out of things like
this the one counter example to this is

1710
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:23,520
this the one counter example to this is
 

1711
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,190
this the one counter example to this is
if you think you're modeling the whole

1712
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,200
if you think you're modeling the whole
 

1713
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,250
if you think you're modeling the whole
universe all the way down then there is

1714
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:28,260
universe all the way down then there is
 

1715
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,710
universe all the way down then there is
a notion of a correct model but even

1716
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
a notion of a correct model but even
 

1717
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,330
a notion of a correct model but even
that is more complicated because it

1718
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,340
that is more complicated because it
 

1719
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,970
that is more complicated because it
depends on kind of how observers sample

1720
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:34,980
depends on kind of how observers sample
 

1721
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,529
depends on kind of how observers sample
things and so on that's a that's a

1722
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:36,539
things and so on that's a that's a
 

1723
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,029
things and so on that's a that's a
separate story but at least at the first

1724
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:38,039
separate story but at least at the first
 

1725
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,310
separate story but at least at the first
level to say you know this thing about

1726
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,320
level to say you know this thing about
 

1727
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,870
level to say you know this thing about
oh it's an approximation you're

1728
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,880
oh it's an approximation you're
 

1729
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,070
oh it's an approximation you're
capturing one aspect you're not

1730
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,080
capturing one aspect you're not
 

1731
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,350
capturing one aspect you're not
capturing other aspects when you really

1732
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,360
capturing other aspects when you really
 

1733
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,210
capturing other aspects when you really
think you have a complete model for the

1734
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,220
think you have a complete model for the
 

1735
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,130
think you have a complete model for the
whole universe you better be capturing

1736
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,140
whole universe you better be capturing
 

1737
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,310
whole universe you better be capturing
ultimately everything even though oh to

1738
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
ultimately everything even though oh to
 

1739
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,169
ultimately everything even though oh to
actually run that model is impossible

1740
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:54,179
actually run that model is impossible
 

1741
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,090
actually run that model is impossible
because of computational reducibility

1742
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,100
because of computational reducibility
 

1743
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,950
because of computational reducibility
the only the only thing that

1744
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:57,960
the only the only thing that
 

1745
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,870
the only the only thing that
successfully runs that model is the

1746
00:31:59,870 --> 00:31:59,880
successfully runs that model is the
 

1747
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,610
successfully runs that model is the
actual running of the universe is the

1748
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:01,620
actual running of the universe is the
 

1749
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,409
actual running of the universe is the
universe itself but okay so what you

1750
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:03,419
universe itself but okay so what you
 

1751
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:04,850
universe itself but okay so what you
care about

1752
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:04,860
care about
 

1753
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,310
care about
is an interesting concept so that's a

1754
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,320
is an interesting concept so that's a
 

1755
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,409
is an interesting concept so that's a
that's a human concept so that's what

1756
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:09,419
that's a human concept so that's what
 

1757
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,630
that's a human concept so that's what
you're doing with uh wolf from Alpha and

1758
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:11,640
you're doing with uh wolf from Alpha and
 

1759
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,810
you're doing with uh wolf from Alpha and
Wolfram language is you trying to come

1760
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:14,820
Wolfram language is you trying to come
 

1761
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,289
Wolfram language is you trying to come
up with symbolic representations yes as

1762
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:18,299
up with symbolic representations yes as
 

1763
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,690
up with symbolic representations yes as
simple as possible

1764
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:20,700
simple as possible
 

1765
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,990
simple as possible
uh so a model that's as simple as

1766
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
uh so a model that's as simple as
 

1767
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,029
uh so a model that's as simple as
possible that fully captures stuff we

1768
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:26,039
possible that fully captures stuff we
 

1769
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,210
possible that fully captures stuff we
care about yes so I mean for example you

1770
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:29,220
care about yes so I mean for example you
 

1771
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,730
care about yes so I mean for example you
know we could we'll have a thing about

1772
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:31,740
know we could we'll have a thing about
 

1773
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,370
know we could we'll have a thing about
you know data about movies let's say we

1774
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:34,380
you know data about movies let's say we
 

1775
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,870
you know data about movies let's say we
could be describing every individual

1776
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:35,880
could be describing every individual
 

1777
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,909
could be describing every individual
pixel in every movie and so on but

1778
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
pixel in every movie and so on but
 

1779
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,590
pixel in every movie and so on but
that's not the level that people care

1780
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
that's not the level that people care
 

1781
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,769
that's not the level that people care
about and it's yes this is a I mean and

1782
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:42,779
about and it's yes this is a I mean and
 

1783
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:46,010
about and it's yes this is a I mean and
and that level that people care about is

1784
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:46,020
and that level that people care about is
 

1785
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,230
and that level that people care about is
somewhat related to what's described in

1786
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,240
somewhat related to what's described in
 

1787
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,810
somewhat related to what's described in
natural language but what what we're

1788
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:50,820
natural language but what what we're
 

1789
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,210
natural language but what what we're
trying to do is to find a way to sort of

1790
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:53,220
trying to do is to find a way to sort of
 

1791
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,370
trying to do is to find a way to sort of
represent precisely so you can compute

1792
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,380
represent precisely so you can compute
 

1793
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,049
represent precisely so you can compute
things see see one thing when you say

1794
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:57,059
things see see one thing when you say
 

1795
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,549
things see see one thing when you say
you give a piece of natural language

1796
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
you give a piece of natural language
 

1797
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,830
you give a piece of natural language
question is you feed it to a computer

1798
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:00,840
question is you feed it to a computer
 

1799
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,330
question is you feed it to a computer
you say does the computer understand

1800
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:02,340
you say does the computer understand
 

1801
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,310
you say does the computer understand
this natural language

1802
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
this natural language
 

1803
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,590
this natural language
well you know the computer process it in

1804
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:06,600
well you know the computer process it in
 

1805
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,210
well you know the computer process it in
some way it does this maybe it can make

1806
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:08,220
some way it does this maybe it can make
 

1807
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,649
some way it does this maybe it can make
a continuation of the natural language

1808
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:09,659
a continuation of the natural language
 

1809
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,389
a continuation of the natural language
you know maybe it can go on from The

1810
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:11,399
you know maybe it can go on from The
 

1811
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:12,769
you know maybe it can go on from The
Prompt and say what it's going to say

1812
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:12,779
Prompt and say what it's going to say
 

1813
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,529
Prompt and say what it's going to say
you say does it really understand it

1814
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:15,539
you say does it really understand it
 

1815
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:19,370
you say does it really understand it
hard to know but for in this kind of

1816
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,380
hard to know but for in this kind of
 

1817
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,950
hard to know but for in this kind of
computational world there is a very

1818
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:21,960
computational world there is a very
 

1819
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,690
computational world there is a very
definite definition of does it

1820
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:23,700
definite definition of does it
 

1821
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,210
definite definition of does it
understand which is could it be turned

1822
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:26,220
understand which is could it be turned
 

1823
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,490
understand which is could it be turned
into this symbolic computational thing

1824
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:28,500
into this symbolic computational thing
 

1825
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,470
into this symbolic computational thing
from which you can compute all kinds of

1826
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
from which you can compute all kinds of
 

1827
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,110
from which you can compute all kinds of
consequences and that's the that's the

1828
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,120
consequences and that's the that's the
 

1829
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,730
consequences and that's the that's the
sense in which one has sort of a target

1830
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:34,740
sense in which one has sort of a target
 

1831
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,230
sense in which one has sort of a target
for the understanding of natural

1832
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
for the understanding of natural
 

1833
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,930
for the understanding of natural
language and that's kind of our goal is

1834
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:38,940
language and that's kind of our goal is
 

1835
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,630
language and that's kind of our goal is
to have as much as possible about the

1836
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:41,640
to have as much as possible about the
 

1837
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,570
to have as much as possible about the
world that can be computed in a in a

1838
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:44,580
world that can be computed in a in a
 

1839
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,269
world that can be computed in a in a
reasonable way so to speak be able to be

1840
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:47,279
reasonable way so to speak be able to be
 

1841
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,430
reasonable way so to speak be able to be
sort of captured by this kind of

1842
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
sort of captured by this kind of
 

1843
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,750
sort of captured by this kind of
computational language that's that's

1844
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:50,760
computational language that's that's
 

1845
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,029
computational language that's that's
kind of the goal and and I think for us

1846
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
kind of the goal and and I think for us
 

1847
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,649
kind of the goal and and I think for us
humans the the main thing that's

1848
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:54,659
humans the the main thing that's
 

1849
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,649
humans the the main thing that's
important is as we formalize what we're

1850
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:57,659
important is as we formalize what we're
 

1851
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:00,649
important is as we formalize what we're
talking about it gives us a way of kind

1852
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:00,659
talking about it gives us a way of kind
 

1853
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,210
talking about it gives us a way of kind
of building a structure where we can

1854
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:02,220
of building a structure where we can
 

1855
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,190
of building a structure where we can
sort of build this Tower of consequences

1856
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,200
sort of build this Tower of consequences
 

1857
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,470
sort of build this Tower of consequences
of things so if we're just saying well

1858
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480
of things so if we're just saying well
 

1859
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,909
of things so if we're just saying well
let's talk about it in natural language

1860
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
let's talk about it in natural language
 

1861
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,010
let's talk about it in natural language
it doesn't really give us some hard

1862
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,020
it doesn't really give us some hard
 

1863
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,990
it doesn't really give us some hard
Foundation that lets us you know build

1864
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
Foundation that lets us you know build
 

1865
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,210
Foundation that lets us you know build
step by step to work something out I

1866
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,220
step by step to work something out I
 

1867
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,530
step by step to work something out I
mean it's kind of like what happens in

1868
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:15,540
mean it's kind of like what happens in
 

1869
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,930
mean it's kind of like what happens in
math if we were just sort of vaguely

1870
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:17,940
math if we were just sort of vaguely
 

1871
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,210
math if we were just sort of vaguely
talking about math but didn't have the

1872
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,220
talking about math but didn't have the
 

1873
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,129
talking about math but didn't have the
kind of full structure of math and all

1874
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:22,139
kind of full structure of math and all
 

1875
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,629
kind of full structure of math and all
that kind of thing we wouldn't be able

1876
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:23,639
that kind of thing we wouldn't be able
 

1877
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,129
that kind of thing we wouldn't be able
to build this kind of big tower of

1878
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:25,139
to build this kind of big tower of
 

1879
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,530
to build this kind of big tower of
consequences and so you know in a sense

1880
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:27,540
consequences and so you know in a sense
 

1881
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,909
consequences and so you know in a sense
what we're trying to do with the whole

1882
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:28,919
what we're trying to do with the whole
 

1883
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:32,149
what we're trying to do with the whole
computational language effort is to make

1884
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
computational language effort is to make
 

1885
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,010
computational language effort is to make
a formalism for describing the world

1886
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,020
a formalism for describing the world
 

1887
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,290
a formalism for describing the world
that makes it possible to kind of build

1888
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,300
that makes it possible to kind of build
 

1889
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,349
that makes it possible to kind of build
this this Tower of consequences well can

1890
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:39,359
this this Tower of consequences well can
 

1891
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,909
this this Tower of consequences well can
you talk about this dance between

1892
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:40,919
you talk about this dance between
 

1893
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:44,389
you talk about this dance between
natural language and Wolfram language

1894
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:44,399
natural language and Wolfram language
 

1895
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,609
natural language and Wolfram language
so there's this gigantic thing called

1896
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:46,619
so there's this gigantic thing called
 

1897
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,589
so there's this gigantic thing called
the internet where people post memes and

1898
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:51,599
the internet where people post memes and
 

1899
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,770
the internet where people post memes and
diary type thoughts and very important

1900
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:54,780
diary type thoughts and very important
 

1901
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,510
diary type thoughts and very important
sounding articles and all of that that

1902
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:56,520
sounding articles and all of that that
 

1903
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,690
sounding articles and all of that that
makes up the training data set for GPT

1904
00:34:59,690 --> 00:34:59,700
makes up the training data set for GPT
 

1905
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,329
makes up the training data set for GPT
and then there's a wolf from language

1906
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:02,339
and then there's a wolf from language
 

1907
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,190
and then there's a wolf from language
how can you map from the natural

1908
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,200
how can you map from the natural
 

1909
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,250
how can you map from the natural
language of the internet to the Wolfram

1910
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:07,260
language of the internet to the Wolfram
 

1911
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,030
language of the internet to the Wolfram
language is there an

1912
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,040
language is there an
 

1913
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,710
language is there an
manual is there an automated way of

1914
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
manual is there an automated way of
 

1915
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,650
manual is there an automated way of
doing that as we look into the future

1916
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:15,660
doing that as we look into the future
 

1917
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,829
doing that as we look into the future
well so wolf from alpha what it does

1918
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:18,839
well so wolf from alpha what it does
 

1919
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,829
well so wolf from alpha what it does
it's kind of front end is turning

1920
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
it's kind of front end is turning
 

1921
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,270
it's kind of front end is turning
natural language into computational

1922
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,280
natural language into computational
 

1923
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,670
natural language into computational
language right what you mean by that is

1924
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
language right what you mean by that is
 

1925
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,250
language right what you mean by that is
there's a prompt you ask a question what

1926
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:28,260
there's a prompt you ask a question what
 

1927
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,190
there's a prompt you ask a question what
is the capital of some yeah and it turns

1928
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,200
is the capital of some yeah and it turns
 

1929
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,390
is the capital of some yeah and it turns
into you know what's the distance

1930
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,400
into you know what's the distance
 

1931
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,910
into you know what's the distance
between you know Chicago and London or

1932
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:34,920
between you know Chicago and London or
 

1933
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,650
between you know Chicago and London or
something and that will turn into you

1934
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:36,660
something and that will turn into you
 

1935
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,370
something and that will turn into you
know geo-distance of entity City you

1936
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:40,380
know geo-distance of entity City you

you know we know the geolocation of that

1948
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:53,400
you know we know the geolocation of that
 

1949
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,069
you know we know the geolocation of that
we know it's population we know all

1950
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:55,079
we know it's population we know all
 

1951
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,990
we know it's population we know all
kinds of things about it which we have

1952
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,000
kinds of things about it which we have
 

1953
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,990
kinds of things about it which we have
you know curated that data to be able to

1954
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
you know curated that data to be able to
 

1955
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,910
you know curated that data to be able to
to know that with some degree of

1956
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
to know that with some degree of
 

1957
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,849
to know that with some degree of
certainty so to speak and then

1958
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:04,859
certainty so to speak and then
 

1959
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,250
certainty so to speak and then
then we can compute things from this and

1960
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:07,260
then we can compute things from this and
 

1961
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,930
then we can compute things from this and
that's that's kind of the

1962
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:08,940
that's that's kind of the
 

1963
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,150
that's that's kind of the
um yeah that's that's that's the idea

1964
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,160
um yeah that's that's that's the idea
 

1965
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,790
um yeah that's that's that's the idea
but then something like GPT large

1966
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:13,800
but then something like GPT large
 

1967
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,450
but then something like GPT large
language models do they allow you to uh

1968
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:17,460
language models do they allow you to uh
 

1969
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,550
language models do they allow you to uh
make that conversion much more powerful

1970
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:19,560
make that conversion much more powerful
 

1971
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,050
make that conversion much more powerful
okay so that's an interesting thing

1972
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,060
okay so that's an interesting thing
 

1973
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,490
okay so that's an interesting thing
which we still don't know everything

1974
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:22,500
which we still don't know everything
 

1975
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,550
which we still don't know everything
about okay the um I mean this question

1976
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:25,560
about okay the um I mean this question
 

1977
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,890
about okay the um I mean this question
of going from natural language to

1978
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:27,900
of going from natural language to
 

1979
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,990
of going from natural language to
computational language yes in will from

computational language now I from the
 

2015
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,829
computational language now I from the
very beginning of Orphan Alpha I thought

2016
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
very beginning of Orphan Alpha I thought
 

2017
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,650
very beginning of Orphan Alpha I thought
about for example uh writing code with

2018
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:12,660
about for example uh writing code with
 

2019
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,589
about for example uh writing code with
natural language in fact I had a I was

2020
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:15,599
natural language in fact I had a I was
 

2021
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,910
natural language in fact I had a I was
just looking at this recently I had a

2022
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:16,920
just looking at this recently I had a
 

2023
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,609
just looking at this recently I had a
post that I wrote in 2010 2011 called

2024
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:19,619
post that I wrote in 2010 2011 called
 

2025
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,170
post that I wrote in 2010 2011 called
something like programming with natural

2026
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:21,180
something like programming with natural
 

2027
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,750
something like programming with natural
language is actually going to work okay

2028
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:23,760
language is actually going to work okay
 

2029
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,849
language is actually going to work okay
and so you know we had done a bunch of

2030
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:25,859
and so you know we had done a bunch of
 

2031
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:29,270
and so you know we had done a bunch of
experiments using methods that were a

2032
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
experiments using methods that were a
 

2033
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,190
experiments using methods that were a
little bit some of them a little bit

2034
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
little bit some of them a little bit
 

2035
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,349
little bit some of them a little bit
machine learning like but certainly not

2036
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:33,359
machine learning like but certainly not
 

2037
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,810
machine learning like but certainly not
the same you know the same kind of idea

2038
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:35,820
the same you know the same kind of idea
 

2039
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,930
the same you know the same kind of idea
of vast training data and so on that is

2040
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:38,940
of vast training data and so on that is
 

2041
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,190
of vast training data and so on that is
the story of large language models

2042
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,200
the story of large language models
 

2043
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,349
the story of large language models
actually I know that that post a piece

2044
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:42,359
actually I know that that post a piece
 

2045
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,349
actually I know that that post a piece
of utter trivia but that that post um uh

2046
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
of utter trivia but that that post um uh
 

2047
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,150
of utter trivia but that that post um uh
Steve Jobs forwarded that post around to

2048
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,160
Steve Jobs forwarded that post around to
 

2049
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,550
Steve Jobs forwarded that post around to
all kinds of people at Apple you know

2050
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:49,560
all kinds of people at Apple you know
 

2051
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,050
all kinds of people at Apple you know
that was because he never really liked

2052
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,060
that was because he never really liked
 

2053
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,849
that was because he never really liked
programming languages so he was very

2054
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:52,859
programming languages so he was very
 

2055
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,190
programming languages so he was very
happy to see the idea that that that

2056
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,200
happy to see the idea that that that
 

2057
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,230
happy to see the idea that that that
that you could get rid of this kind of

2058
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,240
that you could get rid of this kind of
 

2059
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,329
that you could get rid of this kind of
layer of kind of engineering like

2060
00:37:59,329 --> 00:37:59,339
layer of kind of engineering like
 

2061
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,790
layer of kind of engineering like
structure he would have liked you know I

2062
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:01,800
structure he would have liked you know I
 

2063
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,710
structure he would have liked you know I
think what's happening now because it

2064
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:03,720
think what's happening now because it
 

2065
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,390
think what's happening now because it
really is the case that you can you know

2066
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:05,400
really is the case that you can you know
 

2067
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,490
really is the case that you can you know
this idea that you have to kind of learn

2068
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:07,500
this idea that you have to kind of learn
 

2069
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,710
this idea that you have to kind of learn
how the computer works to use a

2070
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:09,720
how the computer works to use a
 

2071
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,810
how the computer works to use a
programming language is something that

2072
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:11,820
programming language is something that
 

2073
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,450
programming language is something that
is I think a a thing that you know just

2074
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:14,460
is I think a a thing that you know just
 

2075
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,950
is I think a a thing that you know just
like you had to learn the details of the

2076
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:15,960
like you had to learn the details of the
 

2077
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,270
like you had to learn the details of the
op codes to know how Assembly Language

2078
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
op codes to know how Assembly Language
 

2079
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,130
op codes to know how Assembly Language
worked and so on it's kind of a thing

2080
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:19,140
worked and so on it's kind of a thing
 

2081
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,589
worked and so on it's kind of a thing
that's that's that's a limited time

2082
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:21,599
that's that's that's a limited time
 

2083
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,410
that's that's that's a limited time
Horizon but but kind of the the you know

2084
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:24,420
Horizon but but kind of the the you know
 

2085
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,630
Horizon but but kind of the the you know
so this idea

2086
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:26,640
so this idea
 

2087
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,230
so this idea
of how elaborate can you make kind of

2088
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,240
of how elaborate can you make kind of
 

2089
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,730
of how elaborate can you make kind of
the prompt how elaborate can you make

2090
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:31,740
the prompt how elaborate can you make
 

2091
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,130
the prompt how elaborate can you make
the natural language and Abstract from

2092
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,140
the natural language and Abstract from
 

2093
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,470
the natural language and Abstract from
it computational language it's a very

2094
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
it computational language it's a very
 

2095
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,470
it computational language it's a very
interesting question and you know what

2096
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:39,480
interesting question and you know what
 

2097
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,430
interesting question and you know what
chat gbt you know gbt4 and so on can do

2098
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:43,440
chat gbt you know gbt4 and so on can do
 

2099
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,890
chat gbt you know gbt4 and so on can do
is pretty good

2100
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:45,900
is pretty good
 

2101
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,990
is pretty good
um it isn't it's very interesting

2102
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,000
um it isn't it's very interesting
 

2103
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,310
um it isn't it's very interesting
process I'm still trying to understand

2104
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:49,320
process I'm still trying to understand
 

2105
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,109
process I'm still trying to understand
this workflow we've been working out a

2106
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:51,119
this workflow we've been working out a
 

2107
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,390
this workflow we've been working out a
lot of tooling around this workflow the

2108
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:53,400
lot of tooling around this workflow the
 

2109
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,550
lot of tooling around this workflow the
natural language to computational

2110
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:55,560
natural language to computational
 

2111
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,470
natural language to computational
language right and the process

2112
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:57,480
language right and the process
 

2113
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,329
language right and the process
especially if it's conversation like

2114
00:38:59,329 --> 00:38:59,339
especially if it's conversation like
 

2115
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,089
especially if it's conversation like
dialogue it's like multiple queries kind

2116
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:02,099
dialogue it's like multiple queries kind
 

2117
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,650
dialogue it's like multiple queries kind
of thing yeah right there's so many

2118
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:03,660
of thing yeah right there's so many
 

2119
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,210
of thing yeah right there's so many
things that are really interesting that

2120
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,220
things that are really interesting that
 

2121
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,210
things that are really interesting that
that work and so on so first thing is

2122
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:08,220
that work and so on so first thing is
 

2123
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,770
that work and so on so first thing is
can you just walk up to the computer and

2124
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:09,780
can you just walk up to the computer and
 

2125
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,349
can you just walk up to the computer and
expect to sort of specify a computation

2126
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:12,359
expect to sort of specify a computation
 

2127
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,530
expect to sort of specify a computation
what one realizes is humans have to have

2128
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:15,540
what one realizes is humans have to have
 

2129
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,750
what one realizes is humans have to have
some idea of kind of this way of

2130
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:17,760
some idea of kind of this way of
 

2131
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,130
some idea of kind of this way of
thinking about things computationally

2132
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,140
thinking about things computationally
 

2133
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,050
thinking about things computationally
without that you're kind of out of luck

2134
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,060
without that you're kind of out of luck
 

2135
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,370
without that you're kind of out of luck
because you just have no idea what

2136
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:22,380
because you just have no idea what
 

2137
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,470
because you just have no idea what
you're going to walk up to a computer I

2138
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480
you're going to walk up to a computer I
 

2139
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,329
you're going to walk up to a computer I
remember when I should tell a silly

2140
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:26,339
remember when I should tell a silly
 

2141
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:27,589
remember when I should tell a silly
story about myself the very first

2142
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
story about myself the very first
 

2143
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,569
story about myself the very first
computer I saw which is when I was 10

2144
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:29,579
computer I saw which is when I was 10
 

2145
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,790
computer I saw which is when I was 10
years old it was a big Mainframe

2146
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:31,800
years old it was a big Mainframe
 

2147
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,230
years old it was a big Mainframe
computer and so on and I didn't really

2148
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,240
computer and so on and I didn't really
 

2149
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,329
computer and so on and I didn't really
understand what computers did and it's

2150
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:35,339
understand what computers did and it's
 

2151
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,710
understand what computers did and it's
like somebody's showing me this computer

2152
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,720
like somebody's showing me this computer
 

2153
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,109
like somebody's showing me this computer
and it's like uh you know can the

2154
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
and it's like uh you know can the
 

2155
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,550
and it's like uh you know can the
computer work out the weight of a

2156
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,560
computer work out the weight of a
 

2157
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,710
computer work out the weight of a
dinosaur it's like that isn't a sensible

2158
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
dinosaur it's like that isn't a sensible
 

2159
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,990
dinosaur it's like that isn't a sensible
thing to ask that's kind of you know you

2160
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,000
thing to ask that's kind of you know you
 

2161
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,609
thing to ask that's kind of you know you
have to give it that's not what

2162
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:46,619
have to give it that's not what
 

2163
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,370
have to give it that's not what
computers do I mean in Wolfram Alpha for

2164
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:49,380
computers do I mean in Wolfram Alpha for
 

2165
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,690
computers do I mean in Wolfram Alpha for
example you could say what's the typical

2166
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:50,700
example you could say what's the typical
 

2167
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,010
example you could say what's the typical
weight of a Stegosaurus and we'll give

2168
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,020
weight of a Stegosaurus and we'll give
 

2169
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,569
weight of a Stegosaurus and we'll give
you some answer but that's a very

2170
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:53,579
you some answer but that's a very
 

2171
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,250
you some answer but that's a very
different kind of thing from what one

2172
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:55,260
different kind of thing from what one
 

2173
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,890
different kind of thing from what one
thinks of computers as doing and so the

2174
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:57,900
thinks of computers as doing and so the
 

2175
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,890
thinks of computers as doing and so the
the kind of the the question of uh you

2176
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:00,900
the kind of the the question of uh you
 

2177
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,390
the kind of the the question of uh you
know first thing is people have to have

2178
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
know first thing is people have to have
 

2179
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,870
know first thing is people have to have
an idea of what what computation is

2180
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:05,880
an idea of what what computation is
 

2181
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,770
an idea of what what computation is
about

2182
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:06,780
about
 

2183
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,270
about
um you know I think it's a very you know

2184
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:08,280
um you know I think it's a very you know
 

2185
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,210
um you know I think it's a very you know
for Education that is the key thing it's

2186
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:11,220
for Education that is the key thing it's
 

2187
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,970
for Education that is the key thing it's
kind of this this sir this notion not

2188
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:13,980
kind of this this sir this notion not
 

2189
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,670
kind of this this sir this notion not
computer science not so the details of

2190
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:16,680
computer science not so the details of
 

2191
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,470
computer science not so the details of
programming but just this idea of how do

2192
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
programming but just this idea of how do
 

2193
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,250
programming but just this idea of how do
you think about the world

2194
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:19,260
you think about the world
 

2195
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,069
you think about the world
computationally computation thinking

2196
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:22,079
computationally computation thinking
 

2197
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,410
computationally computation thinking
about the world computationally is kind

00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:24,420
about the world computationally is kind
 

2199
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,089
about the world computationally is kind
of this formal way of thinking about the

2200
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:26,099
of this formal way of thinking about the
 

2201
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,609
of this formal way of thinking about the
world we've had other ones like logic

2202
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:28,619
world we've had other ones like logic
 

2203
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,230
world we've had other ones like logic
was a formal way you know as a way of

2204
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
was a formal way you know as a way of
 

2205
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,089
was a formal way you know as a way of
sort of abstracting and formalizing some

2206
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:32,099
sort of abstracting and formalizing some
 

2207
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,950
sort of abstracting and formalizing some
aspects of the world mathematics is

2208
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:33,960
aspects of the world mathematics is
 

2209
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,109
aspects of the world mathematics is
another one computation is this very

2210
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:36,119
another one computation is this very
 

2211
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,970
another one computation is this very
broad way of sort of formalizing the way

2212
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:37,980
broad way of sort of formalizing the way
 

2213
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,370
broad way of sort of formalizing the way
we think about the world and the thing

2214
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:40,380
we think about the world and the thing
 

2215
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,349
we think about the world and the thing
that's that's cool about computation is

2216
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:42,359
that's that's cool about computation is
 

2217
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,870
that's that's cool about computation is
if we can successfully formalize things

2218
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:44,880
if we can successfully formalize things
 

2219
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,210
if we can successfully formalize things
in terms of computation computers can

2220
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,220
in terms of computation computers can
 

2221
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,829
in terms of computation computers can
help us figure out what the consequences

2222
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:48,839
help us figure out what the consequences
 

2223
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,870
help us figure out what the consequences
are it's not like you formalized it with

2224
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
are it's not like you formalized it with
 

2225
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,970
are it's not like you formalized it with
math well that's nice but now you have

2226
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:52,980
math well that's nice but now you have
 

2227
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,650
math well that's nice but now you have
to if you're you know not using a

2228
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:54,660
to if you're you know not using a
 

2229
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,870
to if you're you know not using a
computer to do the math you have to go

2230
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
computer to do the math you have to go
 

2231
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,329
computer to do the math you have to go
work out a bunch of stuff yourself so I

2232
00:40:59,329 --> 00:40:59,339
work out a bunch of stuff yourself so I
 

2233
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,910
work out a bunch of stuff yourself so I
think but that this idea let's see I

2234
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:01,920
think but that this idea let's see I
 

2235
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,609
think but that this idea let's see I
mean that you know we're trying to take

2236
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:04,619
mean that you know we're trying to take
 

2237
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,069
mean that you know we're trying to take
kind of the we're talking about sort of

2238
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:07,079
kind of the we're talking about sort of
 

2239
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,569
kind of the we're talking about sort of
natural language and its relationship to

2240
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:08,579
natural language and its relationship to
 

2241
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,210
natural language and its relationship to
computational language the uh the thing

2242
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:11,220
computational language the uh the thing
 

2243
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,010
computational language the uh the thing
the sort of the typical workflow I think

2244
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,020
the sort of the typical workflow I think
 

2245
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,770
the sort of the typical workflow I think
is first human has to have some kind of

2246
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:15,780
is first human has to have some kind of
 

2247
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,810
is first human has to have some kind of
idea of what they're trying to do that

2248
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:17,820
idea of what they're trying to do that
 

2249
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,910
idea of what they're trying to do that
if if it's something that they want to

2250
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
if if it's something that they want to
 

2251
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,250
if if it's something that they want to
sort of build a tower of of capabilities

2252
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:22,260
sort of build a tower of of capabilities
 

2253
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,050
sort of build a tower of of capabilities
on something that they want to sort of

2254
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,060
on something that they want to sort of
 

2255
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,109
on something that they want to sort of
formalize and make computational so then

2256
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119
formalize and make computational so then
 

2257
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,810
formalize and make computational so then
human can type something in to you know

2258
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:29,820
human can type something in to you know
 

2259
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,550
human can type something in to you know
some llm system and uh uh sort of say

2260
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560
some llm system and uh uh sort of say
 

2261
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,650
some llm system and uh uh sort of say
vaguely what they want in sort of

2262
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:36,660
vaguely what they want in sort of
 

2263
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,589
vaguely what they want in sort of
computational terms then it does pretty

2264
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:39,599
computational terms then it does pretty
 

2265
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,210
computational terms then it does pretty
well at synthesizing wealth language

2266
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:41,220
well at synthesizing wealth language
 

2267
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,790
well at synthesizing wealth language
code and it'll probably do better in the

2268
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:43,800
code and it'll probably do better in the
 

2269
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,650
code and it'll probably do better in the
future because we've got a huge number

2270
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:45,660
future because we've got a huge number
 

2271
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,109
future because we've got a huge number
of examples of of natural language input

2272
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:48,119
of examples of of natural language input
 

2273
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,910
of examples of of natural language input
together with the wolf and language

2274
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:49,920
together with the wolf and language
 

2275
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,030
together with the wolf and language
translation of that so it's kind of a a

2276
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,040
translation of that so it's kind of a a
 

2277
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,370
translation of that so it's kind of a a
um uh you know that that's a thing where

2278
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:55,380
um uh you know that that's a thing where
 

2279
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,130
um uh you know that that's a thing where
you can kind of extrapolating from all

2280
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:58,140
you can kind of extrapolating from all
 

2281
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,130
you can kind of extrapolating from all
those examples uh makes it easier to do

2282
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:01,140
those examples uh makes it easier to do
 

2283
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,410
those examples uh makes it easier to do
that that toss is the prompter task

2284
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:03,420
that that toss is the prompter task
 

2285
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,089
that that toss is the prompter task
could also kind of debug in the from

2286
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:05,099
could also kind of debug in the from
 

2287
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,290
could also kind of debug in the from
language code

2288
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:06,300
language code
 

2289
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,109
language code
or is your hope to not do that debugging

2290
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119
or is your hope to not do that debugging
 

2291
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,849
or is your hope to not do that debugging
no no no I mean so so there are many

2292
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:10,859
no no no I mean so so there are many
 

2293
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,069
no no no I mean so so there are many
steps here okay so first the first thing

2294
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:13,079
steps here okay so first the first thing
 

2295
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,109
steps here okay so first the first thing
is you type natural language it

2296
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:15,119
is you type natural language it
 

2297
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,670
is you type natural language it
generates woven language give examples

2298
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:16,680
generates woven language give examples
 

2299
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,770
generates woven language give examples
by the way you have an example that is

2300
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:18,780
by the way you have an example that is
 

2301
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,750
by the way you have an example that is
the the dinosaur example do you have an

2302
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:20,760
the the dinosaur example do you have an
 

2303
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,430
the the dinosaur example do you have an
example that jumps to mind that we

2304
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:22,440
example that jumps to mind that we
 

2305
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,390
example that jumps to mind that we
should be thinking about some dumb

2306
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:23,400
should be thinking about some dumb
 

2307
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,210
should be thinking about some dumb
example it's like take my heart rate

2308
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:26,220
example it's like take my heart rate
 

2309
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,349
example it's like take my heart rate
data and uh you know figure out whether

2310
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:30,359
data and uh you know figure out whether
 

2311
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:33,650
data and uh you know figure out whether
I uh you know make a moving average

2312
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:33,660
I uh you know make a moving average
 

2313
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,530
I uh you know make a moving average
every seven days or something and work

2314
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:36,540
every seven days or something and work
 

2315
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,290
every seven days or something and work
out what the um and make a plot of the

2316
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:39,300
out what the um and make a plot of the
 

2317
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,510
out what the um and make a plot of the
result okay so that's a thing which is

2318
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
result okay so that's a thing which is
 

2319
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,829
result okay so that's a thing which is
you know

2320
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
you know
 

2321
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,870
you know
about two-thirds of a line of language

2322
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
about two-thirds of a line of language
 

2323
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,510
about two-thirds of a line of language
code I mean it's you know list plot of

2324
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520
code I mean it's you know list plot of
 

2325
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,329
code I mean it's you know list plot of
moving average of some data bin or

2326
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:50,339
moving average of some data bin or
 

2327
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,069
moving average of some data bin or
something of the of the data and then

2328
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
something of the of the data and then
 

2329
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,750
something of the of the data and then
you'll get the result

2330
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
you'll get the result
 

2331
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,730
you'll get the result
um and you know the vague thing that I

2332
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:55,740
um and you know the vague thing that I
 

2333
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,010
um and you know the vague thing that I
was just saying in natural language

2334
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:57,020
was just saying in natural language
 

2335
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,890
was just saying in natural language
could would almost certainly correctly

2336
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:00,900
could would almost certainly correctly
 

2337
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,510
could would almost certainly correctly
turn into that very simple piece of

2338
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:02,520
turn into that very simple piece of
 

2339
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,910
turn into that very simple piece of
language code so you start mumbling

2340
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:04,920
language code so you start mumbling
 

2341
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,530
language code so you start mumbling
about heart rate

2342
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:06,540
about heart rate
 

2343
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,950
about heart rate
yeah and it kind of you know you arrive

2344
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:09,960
yeah and it kind of you know you arrive
 

2345
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,349
yeah and it kind of you know you arrive
at the moving average kind of idea but

2346
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:12,359
at the moving average kind of idea but
 

2347
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,150
at the moving average kind of idea but
you say average over seven days maybe

2348
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
you say average over seven days maybe
 

2349
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,530
you say average over seven days maybe
it'll figure out that that's a moving

2350
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:15,540
it'll figure out that that's a moving
 

2351
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,910
it'll figure out that that's a moving
you know that that can be encapsulated

2352
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:16,920
you know that that can be encapsulated
 

2353
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,250
you know that that can be encapsulated
as this moving average idea I'm not sure

2354
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:19,260
as this moving average idea I'm not sure
 

2355
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,089
as this moving average idea I'm not sure
but then the typical workflow but I'm

2356
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:23,099
but then the typical workflow but I'm
 

2357
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,010
but then the typical workflow but I'm
seeing is you generate this piece of

2358
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,020
seeing is you generate this piece of
 

2359
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,809
seeing is you generate this piece of
often language code it's pretty small

2360
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:26,819
often language code it's pretty small
 

2361
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:28,309
often language code it's pretty small
usually

2362
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:28,319
usually
 

2363
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,290
usually
um it's uh and if it isn't small it

2364
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:30,300
um it's uh and if it isn't small it
 

2365
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,050
um it's uh and if it isn't small it
probably isn't right but um you know if

2366
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:33,060
probably isn't right but um you know if
 

2367
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,089
probably isn't right but um you know if
it's it's pretty small and you know

2368
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:35,099
it's it's pretty small and you know
 

2369
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,730
it's it's pretty small and you know
welcome language is one of the ideas of

2370
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:37,740
welcome language is one of the ideas of
 

2371
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,109
welcome language is one of the ideas of
open languages it's a language that

2372
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:39,119
open languages it's a language that
 

2373
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,270
open languages it's a language that
humans can read it's not a language

2374
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
humans can read it's not a language
 

2375
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,770
humans can read it's not a language
which you know programming languages

2376
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:42,780
which you know programming languages
 

2377
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,470
which you know programming languages
tend to be this one-way story of humans

2378
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:45,480
tend to be this one-way story of humans
 

2379
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,109
tend to be this one-way story of humans
write them and computers execute from

00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:48,119
write them and computers execute from
 

2381
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,270
write them and computers execute from
them orphan language is intended to be

something which is sort of like math

2384
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:51,780
something which is sort of like math
 

2385
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,710
something which is sort of like math
notation something where you know humans

2386
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:54,720
notation something where you know humans
 

2387
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,270

00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:56,280
write it and humans are supposed to read
 

2389
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,910
write it and humans are supposed to read
it as well and so kind of the workflow

2390
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:58,920
it as well and so kind of the workflow
 

2391
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,250
it as well and so kind of the workflow
that's emerging is kind of this this

2392
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:01,260
that's emerging is kind of this this
 

2393
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,030
that's emerging is kind of this this
human mumbles some things you know large

2394
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:05,040
human mumbles some things you know large
 

2395
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,609
human mumbles some things you know large
language model produces a fragment of

2396
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:07,619
language model produces a fragment of
 

2397
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,609
language model produces a fragment of
awesome language code then you look at

2398
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:10,619
awesome language code then you look at
 

2399
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,050
awesome language code then you look at
that you say yeah that looks well

2400
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:12,060
that you say yeah that looks well
 

2401
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,210
that you say yeah that looks well
typically you just run it first you see

2402
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:14,220
typically you just run it first you see
 

2403
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,890
typically you just run it first you see
does it produce the right thing you look

2404
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:15,900
does it produce the right thing you look
 

2405
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,390
does it produce the right thing you look
at what it produces you might say that's

2406
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:17,400
at what it produces you might say that's
 

2407
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,849
at what it produces you might say that's
obviously crazy you look at the code you

2408
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:19,859
obviously crazy you look at the code you
 

2409
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,849
obviously crazy you look at the code you
see I see why it's crazy you fix it if

2410
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:22,859
see I see why it's crazy you fix it if
 

2411
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,230
see I see why it's crazy you fix it if
you really care about the result you

2412
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,240
you really care about the result you
 

2413
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,250
you really care about the result you
really want to make sure it's right you

2414
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:25,260
really want to make sure it's right you
 

2415
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,930
really want to make sure it's right you
better look at that code and understand

2416
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:26,940
better look at that code and understand
 

2417
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,910
better look at that code and understand
it because that's the way you have this

2418
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:28,920
it because that's the way you have this
 

2419
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,710
it because that's the way you have this
sort of checkpoint of did it really do

2420
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
sort of checkpoint of did it really do
 

2421
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,349
sort of checkpoint of did it really do
what I expected it to do now you go

2422
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
what I expected it to do now you go
 

2423
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,050
what I expected it to do now you go
beyond that I mean it's it's it's you

2424
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:36,060
beyond that I mean it's it's it's you
 

2425
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,670
beyond that I mean it's it's it's you
know what we find is for example let's

2426
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
know what we find is for example let's
 

2427
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,890
know what we find is for example let's
say the code does the wrong thing then

2428
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:39,900
say the code does the wrong thing then
 

2429
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,630
say the code does the wrong thing then
you can often say to the large language

2430
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:41,640
you can often say to the large language
 

2431
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,050
you can often say to the large language
model can you adjust this to do this and

2432
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:45,060
model can you adjust this to do this and
 

2433
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,430
model can you adjust this to do this and
it's pretty good at doing that

2434
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:46,440
it's pretty good at doing that
 

2435
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,910
it's pretty good at doing that
interesting so you're using the output

2436
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:49,920
interesting so you're using the output
 

2437
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,069
interesting so you're using the output
of the code

2438
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
of the code
 

2439
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,290
of the code
to give you hints

2440
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:54,300
to give you hints
 

2441
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,950
to give you hints
about the the function of the code so

2442
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:57,960
about the the function of the code so
 

2443
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,050
about the the function of the code so
you're debugging yeah based on the

2444
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:00,060
you're debugging yeah based on the
 

2445
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,329
you're debugging yeah based on the
output of the code itself right the

2446
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:02,339
output of the code itself right the
 

2447
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,370
output of the code itself right the
plug-in that we have the the you know

2448
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:04,380
plug-in that we have the the you know
 

2449
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,250
plug-in that we have the the you know
for chat GPT it does that routinely you

2450
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:07,260
for chat GPT it does that routinely you
 

2451
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,890
for chat GPT it does that routinely you
know it will send the thing in it will

2452
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:09,900
know it will send the thing in it will
 

2453
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,349
know it will send the thing in it will
get a result it will discover the llm

2454
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:12,359
get a result it will discover the llm
 

2455
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:13,910
get a result it will discover the llm
will discover itself that the result is

2456
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:13,920
will discover itself that the result is
 

2457
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,710
will discover itself that the result is
not plausible and it will go back and

2458
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:15,720
not plausible and it will go back and
 

2459
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,630
not plausible and it will go back and
say oh I'm sorry it's very polite and it

2460
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:17,640
say oh I'm sorry it's very polite and it
 

2461
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,790
say oh I'm sorry it's very polite and it
you know it goes back and says I'll

2462
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:19,800
you know it goes back and says I'll
 

2463
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,349
you know it goes back and says I'll
rewrite that piece of code and then it

2464
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
rewrite that piece of code and then it
 

2465
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,349
rewrite that piece of code and then it
will try it again and get the result the

2466
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:24,359
will try it again and get the result the
 

2467
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:25,730
will try it again and get the result the
other thing is pretty interesting is

2468
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:25,740
other thing is pretty interesting is
 

2469
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,530
other thing is pretty interesting is
when you're just running so one of the

2470
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:27,540
when you're just running so one of the
 

2471
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,329
when you're just running so one of the
new Concepts that we have we invented

2472
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:29,339
new Concepts that we have we invented
 

2473
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:32,150
new Concepts that we have we invented
this whole idea of notebooks back 36

2474
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,160
this whole idea of notebooks back 36
 

2475
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,309
this whole idea of notebooks back 36
years ago now and so now there's the

2476
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
years ago now and so now there's the
 

2477
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,990
years ago now and so now there's the
question of sort of how do you combine

2478
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
question of sort of how do you combine
 

2479
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,150
question of sort of how do you combine
this idea of notebooks where you have

2480
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
this idea of notebooks where you have
 

2481
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,510
this idea of notebooks where you have
you know text and code and output how do

2482
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:41,520
you know text and code and output how do
 

2483
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,069
you know text and code and output how do
you combine that with the notion of of

2484
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:43,079
you combine that with the notion of of
 

2485
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,230
you combine that with the notion of of
chat and so on and there's some really

2486
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:45,240
chat and so on and there's some really
 

2487
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,430
chat and so on and there's some really
interesting things there like for

2488
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:46,440
interesting things there like for
 

2489
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,010
interesting things there like for
example a very typical thing now is we

2490
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,020
example a very typical thing now is we
 

2491
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,290
example a very typical thing now is we
have these these notebooks where as soon

2492
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:51,300
have these these notebooks where as soon
 

2493
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,950
have these these notebooks where as soon
as the if if the thing produce uses

2494
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:54,960
as the if if the thing produce uses
 

2495
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,470
as the if if the thing produce uses
errors if the you know run this code and

2496
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:57,480
errors if the you know run this code and
 

2497
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,349
errors if the you know run this code and
it produces messages and so on the the

2498
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:00,359
it produces messages and so on the the
 

2499
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,930
it produces messages and so on the the
llm automatically not only looks at

2500
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:02,940
llm automatically not only looks at
 

2501
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,089
llm automatically not only looks at
those messages it can also see all kinds

2502
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:05,099
those messages it can also see all kinds
 

2503
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,410
those messages it can also see all kinds
of internal information about stack

2504
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:06,420
of internal information about stack
 

2505
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,050
of internal information about stack
traces and things like this and it can

2506
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:09,060
traces and things like this and it can
 

2507
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,329
traces and things like this and it can
then it does a remarkably good job of

2508
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:11,339
then it does a remarkably good job of
 

2509
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:12,770
then it does a remarkably good job of
guessing what's wrong

2510
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:12,780
guessing what's wrong
 

2511
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,870
guessing what's wrong
and telling you so in other words it's

2512
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:14,880
and telling you so in other words it's
 

2513
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,069
and telling you so in other words it's
it's looking at things sort of

2514
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:16,079
it's looking at things sort of
 

2515
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,170
it's looking at things sort of
interesting it's kind of a typical sort

2516
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:18,180
interesting it's kind of a typical sort
 

2517
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,270
interesting it's kind of a typical sort
of ai-ish thing that it's able to have

2518
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:20,280
of ai-ish thing that it's able to have
 

2519
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,670
of ai-ish thing that it's able to have
more sensory data than we humans are

2520
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:22,680
more sensory data than we humans are
 

2521
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,690
more sensory data than we humans are
able to have because they're able to

2522
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:23,700
able to have because they're able to
 

2523
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,309
able to have because they're able to
look at a bunch of stuff that we humans

2524
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:25,319
look at a bunch of stuff that we humans
 

2525
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,890
look at a bunch of stuff that we humans
would kind of glaze over looking at and

2526
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:27,900
would kind of glaze over looking at and
 

2527
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,349
would kind of glaze over looking at and
it's able to then come up with oh this

2528
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:30,359
it's able to then come up with oh this
 

2529
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:31,790
it's able to then come up with oh this
is the explanation of what's happening

2530
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:31,800
is the explanation of what's happening
 

2531
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,250
is the explanation of what's happening
and and what is the data the stack trace

2532
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:34,260
and and what is the data the stack trace
 

2533
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,809
and and what is the data the stack trace
the the code you've written previously

2534
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:35,819
the the code you've written previously
 

2535
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:37,250
the the code you've written previously
the natural language you've written yeah

2536
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:37,260
the natural language you've written yeah
 

2537
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,170
the natural language you've written yeah
it's also what's happening is one of the

2538
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:39,180
it's also what's happening is one of the
 

2539
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,150
it's also what's happening is one of the
things that's uh is is for example when

2540
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:41,160
things that's uh is is for example when
 

2541
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,290
things that's uh is is for example when
there's these messages there's

2542
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:42,300
there's these messages there's
 

2543
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,550
there's these messages there's
documentation about these messages

2544
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:43,560
documentation about these messages
 

2545
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,930
documentation about these messages
there's examples of where the messages

2546
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:44,940
there's examples of where the messages
 

2547
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,270
there's examples of where the messages
have occurred otherwise nice all these

2548
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
have occurred otherwise nice all these
 

2549
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,170
have occurred otherwise nice all these
kinds of things the other thing that's

2550
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:48,180
kinds of things the other thing that's
 

2551
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,450
kinds of things the other thing that's
really amusing with this is when it

2552
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:50,460
really amusing with this is when it
 

2553
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,190
really amusing with this is when it
makes a mistake one of the things that's

2554
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:52,200
makes a mistake one of the things that's
 

2555
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,290
makes a mistake one of the things that's
in our prompt when the code doesn't work

2556
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:54,300
in our prompt when the code doesn't work
 

2557
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,470
in our prompt when the code doesn't work
is read the documentation

2558
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
is read the documentation
 

2559
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,270
is read the documentation
and we have a you know another piece of

2560
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,280
and we have a you know another piece of
 

2561
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,950
and we have a you know another piece of
the plugin that lets it read

2562
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:00,960
the plugin that lets it read
 

2563
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,990
the plugin that lets it read
documentation and that again is very

2564
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:03,000
documentation and that again is very
 

2565
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,569
documentation and that again is very
very useful because it it will you know

2566
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:05,579
very useful because it it will you know
 

2567
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,309
very useful because it it will you know
it will figure out sometimes it'll get

2568
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:07,319
it will figure out sometimes it'll get
 

2569
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:09,890
it will figure out sometimes it'll get
it'll make up the name of some option

2570
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:09,900
it'll make up the name of some option
 

2571
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,150
it'll make up the name of some option
for some function that doesn't really

2572
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,160
for some function that doesn't really
 

2573
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,730
for some function that doesn't really
exist read the documentation it'll have

2574
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:13,740
exist read the documentation it'll have
 

2575
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,710
exist read the documentation it'll have
you know some wrong structure for the

2576
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:15,720
you know some wrong structure for the
 

2577
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,750
you know some wrong structure for the
function and so on it's um that's a

2578
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,760
function and so on it's um that's a
 

2579
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,550
function and so on it's um that's a
powerful thing I mean the thing that you

2580
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:19,560
powerful thing I mean the thing that you
 

2581
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,950
powerful thing I mean the thing that you
know I've realized is we built this

2582
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:21,960
know I've realized is we built this
 

2583
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,450
know I've realized is we built this
language over the course of all these

2584
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:23,460
language over the course of all these
 

2585
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,950
language over the course of all these
years to be nice and coherent and

2586
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
years to be nice and coherent and
 

2587
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,690
years to be nice and coherent and
consistent and so on so it's easy for

2588
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:26,700
consistent and so on so it's easy for
 

2589
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,970
consistent and so on so it's easy for
humans to understand turns out there was

2590
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:28,980
humans to understand turns out there was
 

2591
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,890
humans to understand turns out there was
a side effect that I didn't anticipate

2592
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:30,900
a side effect that I didn't anticipate
 

2593
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,990
a side effect that I didn't anticipate
which is it makes it easy for AIS to

2594
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,000
which is it makes it easy for AIS to
 

2595
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,910
which is it makes it easy for AIS to
understand so it's almost like another

2596
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:34,920
understand so it's almost like another
 

2597
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,150
understand so it's almost like another
natural language but yeah so so what

2598
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,160
natural language but yeah so so what
 

2599
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,250
natural language but yeah so so what
formal language is a kind of foreign

2600
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:40,260
formal language is a kind of foreign
 

2601
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,950
formal language is a kind of foreign
language yes yes you have a lineup

2602
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:42,960
language yes yes you have a lineup
 

2603
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,290
language yes yes you have a lineup

English French Japanese Wolfram language
 

2605
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,270
English French Japanese Wolfram language
and then uh I don't know Spanish and

2606
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:50,280
and then uh I don't know Spanish and
 

2607
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,730
and then uh I don't know Spanish and
then the system is not going to notice

2608
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:51,740
then the system is not going to notice
 

2609
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,790
then the system is not going to notice
well yes I mean maybe you know that's an

2610
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:55,800
well yes I mean maybe you know that's an
 

2611
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,410
well yes I mean maybe you know that's an
interesting question because it really

2612
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:57,420
interesting question because it really
 

2613
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,470
interesting question because it really
depends on what I see as being a a

2614
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
depends on what I see as being a a
 

2615
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,210
depends on what I see as being a a
important piece of fundamental science

2616
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:02,220
important piece of fundamental science
 

2617
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,849
important piece of fundamental science
that basically just jumped out at us

2618
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:04,859
that basically just jumped out at us
 

2619
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:06,950
that basically just jumped out at us
with Chachi BT

2620
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:06,960
with Chachi BT
 

2621
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,329
with Chachi BT
um because I think you know the the real

2622
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:08,339
um because I think you know the the real
 

2623
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:11,690
um because I think you know the the real
question is why does chat GPD work how

2624
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:11,700
question is why does chat GPD work how
 

2625
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,390
question is why does chat GPD work how
is it possible to encapsulate you know

2626
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:14,400
is it possible to encapsulate you know
 

2627
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,730
is it possible to encapsulate you know
to successfully reproduce all these

2628
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:16,740
to successfully reproduce all these
 

2629
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,010
to successfully reproduce all these
kinds of things in natural language

2630
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:19,020
kinds of things in natural language
 

2631
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,170
kinds of things in natural language
um you know with a you know a

2632
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:21,180
um you know with a you know a
 

2633
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,450
um you know with a you know a
comparatively small he says you know a

2634
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:23,460
comparatively small he says you know a
 

2635
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,550
comparatively small he says you know a
couple hundred billion you know weights

2636
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:25,560
couple hundred billion you know weights
 

2637
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,130
couple hundred billion you know weights
of neural net and so on and I think that

2638
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:28,140
of neural net and so on and I think that
 

2639
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,109
of neural net and so on and I think that
uh you know that that relates to kind of

2640
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:30,119
uh you know that that relates to kind of
 

2641
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,349
uh you know that that relates to kind of
a fundamental fact about language which

2642
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:33,359
a fundamental fact about language which
 

2643
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,270
a fundamental fact about language which
uh you know the the main the main thing

2644
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:35,280
uh you know the the main the main thing
 

2645
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,190
uh you know the the main the main thing
is that I think there's a structure to

2646
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
is that I think there's a structure to
 

2647
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,290
is that I think there's a structure to
language that we haven't kind of really

2648
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:39,300
language that we haven't kind of really
 

2649
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,630
language that we haven't kind of really
explored very well as kind of the

2650
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:41,640
explored very well as kind of the
 

2651
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,050
explored very well as kind of the
semantic grammar I'm talking about about

2652
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:45,060
semantic grammar I'm talking about about
 

2653
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,270
semantic grammar I'm talking about about
um about language I mean we kind of know

2654
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
um about language I mean we kind of know
 

2655
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,490
um about language I mean we kind of know
that when we when we set up human

2656
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:49,500
that when we when we set up human
 

2657
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,530
that when we when we set up human
language we know that it has certain

2658
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:51,540
language we know that it has certain
 

2659
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,290
language we know that it has certain
regularities we know that it has a

2660
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:54,300
regularities we know that it has a
 

2661
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,849
regularities we know that it has a
certain grammatical structure you know

2662
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:55,859
certain grammatical structure you know
 

2663
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:58,370
certain grammatical structure you know
noun followed by verb followed by noun

2664
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:58,380
noun followed by verb followed by noun
 

2665
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,470
noun followed by verb followed by noun
adjectives Etc et cetera et cetera

2666
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
adjectives Etc et cetera et cetera
 

2667
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,750
adjectives Etc et cetera et cetera
that's its kind of grammatical structure

2668
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:02,760
that's its kind of grammatical structure
 

2669
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,510
that's its kind of grammatical structure
but I think the thing that chat gbt is

2670
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:05,520
but I think the thing that chat gbt is
 

2671
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,390
but I think the thing that chat gbt is
showing us is that as an additional kind

2672
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:08,400
showing us is that as an additional kind
 

2673
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,790
showing us is that as an additional kind
of regularity to language which has to

2674
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800
of regularity to language which has to
 

2675
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,870
of regularity to language which has to
do with the meaning of the language

2676
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:11,880
do with the meaning of the language
 

2677
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,390
do with the meaning of the language
Beyond just this pure you know part of

2678
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:14,400
Beyond just this pure you know part of
 

2679
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,790
Beyond just this pure you know part of
speech combination type of thing and I

2680
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:16,800
speech combination type of thing and I
 

2681
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,550
speech combination type of thing and I
think the uh the the kind of the the one

2682
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:19,560
think the uh the the kind of the the one
 

2683
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,170
think the uh the the kind of the the one
example of that that we've had in the

2684
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:21,180
example of that that we've had in the
 

2685
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,530
example of that that we've had in the
past is logic and you know I I think my

2686
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:24,540
past is logic and you know I I think my
 

2687
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,730
past is logic and you know I I think my
my sort of uh uh uh kind of picture of

2688
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:28,740
my sort of uh uh uh kind of picture of
 

2689
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,530
my sort of uh uh uh kind of picture of
how was logic invented how was logic

2690
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:30,540
how was logic invented how was logic
 

2691
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,870
how was logic invented how was logic
discovered uh it really was the thing

2692
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:32,880
discovered uh it really was the thing
 

2693
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,430
discovered uh it really was the thing
that was discovered in its original

2694
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:34,440
that was discovered in its original
 

2695
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,950
that was discovered in its original
conception it was discovered presumably

2696

by Aristotle who kind of listened to a

2698
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:39,780
by Aristotle who kind of listened to a
 

2699
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,329
by Aristotle who kind of listened to a
bunch of people orators you know giving

2700
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:41,339
bunch of people orators you know giving
 

2701
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:44,510
bunch of people orators you know giving
speeches and this one made sense that

2702
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:44,520
speeches and this one made sense that
 

2703
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,450
speeches and this one made sense that
one doesn't make sense this one and you

2704
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:47,460
one doesn't make sense this one and you
 

2705
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,910
one doesn't make sense this one and you
know you see these patterns of you know

2706
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:49,920
know you see these patterns of you know
 

2707
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,030
know you see these patterns of you know
if the uh you know I don't know what you

2708
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
if the uh you know I don't know what you
 

2709
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,190
if the uh you know I don't know what you
know if the uh if the Persians do this

2710
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,200
know if the uh if the Persians do this
 

2711
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,349
know if the uh if the Persians do this
then this does that

2712
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
then this does that
 

2713
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,230
then this does that
Etc et cetera et cetera and what what

Etc et cetera et cetera and what what
 

2715
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,970
Etc et cetera et cetera and what what
Aristotle realized is there's a

2716
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:01,980
Aristotle realized is there's a
 

2717
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,890
Aristotle realized is there's a
structure to those sentences there's a

2718
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:03,900
structure to those sentences there's a
 

2719
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,630
structure to those sentences there's a
structure to that rhetoric that doesn't

2720
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:05,640
structure to that rhetoric that doesn't
 

2721
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,250
structure to that rhetoric that doesn't
matter whether it's the Persians and the

2722
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:07,260
matter whether it's the Persians and the
 

2723
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,290
matter whether it's the Persians and the
Greeks or whether it's the cats and the

2724
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:09,300
Greeks or whether it's the cats and the
 

2725
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,050
Greeks or whether it's the cats and the
dogs it's just you know p and Q you can

2726
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:12,060
dogs it's just you know p and Q you can
 

2727
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,470
dogs it's just you know p and Q you can
abstract from this the the details of

2728
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:15,480
abstract from this the the details of
 

2729
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,210
abstract from this the the details of
these particular sentences you can lift

2730
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:17,220
these particular sentences you can lift
 

2731
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,490
these particular sentences you can lift
out this kind of formal structure and

2732
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:19,500
out this kind of formal structure and
 

2733
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,890
out this kind of formal structure and
that's what logic is that's a heck of a

2734
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:21,900
that's what logic is that's a heck of a
 

2735
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,870
that's what logic is that's a heck of a
discovery by the way logic you're making

2736
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:23,880
discovery by the way logic you're making
 

2737
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,250
discovery by the way logic you're making
me realize now

2738
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:25,260
me realize now
 

2739
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,010
me realize now
yeah it's not obvious the fact that

2740
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,020
yeah it's not obvious the fact that
 

2741
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,410
yeah it's not obvious the fact that
there is an abstraction from natural

2742
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:30,420
there is an abstraction from natural
 

2743
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,530
there is an abstraction from natural
language that has where you can fill in

2744
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:33,540
language that has where you can fill in
 

2745
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,930
language that has where you can fill in
any word you want yeah is a very

2746
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:35,940
any word you want yeah is a very
 

2747
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,609
any word you want yeah is a very
interesting Discovery now it took a long

2748
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:37,619
interesting Discovery now it took a long
 

2749
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,609
interesting Discovery now it took a long
time to mature I mean Aristotle had this

2750
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:40,619
time to mature I mean Aristotle had this
 

2751
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:42,710
time to mature I mean Aristotle had this
idea of syllogistic logic where there

2752
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
idea of syllogistic logic where there
 

2753
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,230
idea of syllogistic logic where there
were these particular patterns of how

2754
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:45,240
were these particular patterns of how
 

2755
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,450
were these particular patterns of how
you could argue things so to speak and

2756
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:47,460
you could argue things so to speak and
 

2757
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,430
you could argue things so to speak and
you know in the Middle Ages part of

2758
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
you know in the Middle Ages part of
 

2759
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,230
you know in the Middle Ages part of
Education was you memorize the

2760
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:51,240
Education was you memorize the
 

2761
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,849
Education was you memorize the
syllogisms I forget how many there were

2762
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:52,859
syllogisms I forget how many there were
 

2763
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:55,130
syllogisms I forget how many there were
but 15 of them or something and they all

2764
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:55,140
but 15 of them or something and they all
 

2765
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,990
but 15 of them or something and they all
had names they all had mnemonics like I

2766
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:57,000
had names they all had mnemonics like I
 

2767
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,089
had names they all had mnemonics like I
think Barbara and celerant were two of

2768
00:50:59,089 --> 00:50:59,099
think Barbara and celerant were two of
 

2769
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,370
think Barbara and celerant were two of
the the mnemonics for the the syllogisms

2770
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:01,380
the the mnemonics for the the syllogisms
 

2771
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,170
the the mnemonics for the the syllogisms
and people would kind of this is a valid

2772
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:03,180
and people would kind of this is a valid
 

2773
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,849
and people would kind of this is a valid
argument because it follows the Barbara

2774
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:04,859
argument because it follows the Barbara
 

2775
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:07,490
argument because it follows the Barbara
syllogism so to speak and and it took

2776
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:07,500
syllogism so to speak and and it took
 

2777
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,410
syllogism so to speak and and it took
until 1830

2778
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:09,420
until 1830
 

2779
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,809

um you know with uh George boole to kind

2780
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:11,819
um you know with uh George boole to kind
 

2781
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,030
um you know with uh George boole to kind
of get beyond that and kind of see that

2782
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:14,040
of get beyond that and kind of see that
 

2783
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,150
of get beyond that and kind of see that
there was a a level of abstraction that

2784
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:17,160
there was a a level of abstraction that
 

2785
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,370
there was a a level of abstraction that
was beyond the this particular template

2786
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:19,380
was beyond the this particular template
 

2787
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,349
was beyond the this particular template
of a sentence so to speak

2788
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:21,359
of a sentence so to speak
 

2789
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,490
of a sentence so to speak
um and that's you know what what's

2790
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:22,500
um and that's you know what what's
 

2791
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,450
um and that's you know what what's
interesting there is in a sense you know

2792
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:25,460
interesting there is in a sense you know
 

2793
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,130
interesting there is in a sense you know
you know Chachi BT is operating at the

you know Chachi BT is operating at the
 

2795
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,410
you know Chachi BT is operating at the

the time you get to Bool and Boolean

2800
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:34,680
the time you get to Bool and Boolean
 

2801
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,589
the time you get to Bool and Boolean
algebra and this idea of you know you

2802
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:36,599
algebra and this idea of you know you
 

2803
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,450
algebra and this idea of you know you
can have arbitrary depth nested

2804
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:38,460
can have arbitrary depth nested

collections of ands and ores and Knots
 

2807
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,010
collections of ands and ores and Knots
and you can resolve what they mean

2808
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:43,020
and you can resolve what they mean
 

2809
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,510
and you can resolve what they mean
um that's the kind of thing that's a

00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:44,520
um that's the kind of thing that's a

00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:46,680
computation story that's you know you've
 

2813
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,710
computation story that's you know you've
gone beyond the pure sort of templates

00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,720
gone beyond the pure sort of templates
 

2815

2847
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,890
I go from place a to place B Place B to
place C then I know I've gone from place

00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:27,900
place C then I know I've gone from place
 

2849

what chat gbt effectively has found just

00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:08,220
what chat gbt effectively has found just
 

2881
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,010
what chat gbt effectively has found just
like it discovered logic you know people

2882
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:10,020
like it discovered logic you know people
 

2883
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,569
like it discovered logic you know people
are really surprised it can do these

2884
00:53:11,569 --> 00:53:11,579
are really surprised it can do these
 

2885
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,849
are really surprised it can do these
these logical inferences it discovered

2886
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:13,859
these logical inferences it discovered
 

2887
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:15,589
these logical inferences it discovered
Logic the same way Aristotle discovered

2888
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
Logic the same way Aristotle discovered
 

2889
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,690
Logic the same way Aristotle discovered
logic by looking at a lot of sentences

2890
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:17,700
logic by looking at a lot of sentences
 

2891
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,030
logic by looking at a lot of sentences
effectively and noticing the patterns in

2892
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:20,040
effectively and noticing the patterns in
 

2893
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,650
effectively and noticing the patterns in
those sentences but it feels like it's

2894
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:21,660
those sentences but it feels like it's
 

2895
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,910
those sentences but it feels like it's
discovering something much more

2896
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:22,920
discovering something much more
 

2897
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,849
discovering something much more
complicated than logic so this kind of

2898
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:25,859
complicated than logic so this kind of
 

2899
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:27,890
complicated than logic so this kind of
semantic grammar I think he wrote about

2900
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:27,900
semantic grammar I think he wrote about
 

2901
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,910
semantic grammar I think he wrote about
this

2902
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:28,920
this
 

2903
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,750
this
um

2904
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
um
 

2905
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,030
um
maybe we can call it the laws of

2906
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:32,040
maybe we can call it the laws of
 

2907
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,370
maybe we can call it the laws of
language I believe you call or which I

2908
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:34,380
language I believe you call or which I
 

2909
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,130
language I believe you call or which I
like the laws of thought yes that was

2910
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:37,140
like the laws of thought yes that was
 

2911
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,870
like the laws of thought yes that was
the title that George boole had for his

2912
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:38,880
the title that George boole had for his
 

2913
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,150
the title that George boole had for his
for his Boolean algebra back in 1830 but

2914
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:41,160
for his Boolean algebra back in 1830 but
 

2915
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,430
for his Boolean algebra back in 1830 but
yes I was a thought yes that was what he

2916
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
yes I was a thought yes that was what he
 

2917
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,410
yes I was a thought yes that was what he
said

2918
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:44,420
said
 

2919
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,970
said
all right so he thought he thought he

2920
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:46,980
all right so he thought he thought he
 

2921
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,309
all right so he thought he thought he
nailed it with blue in algebra yeah

2922
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:49,319
nailed it with blue in algebra yeah
 

2923
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:51,170
nailed it with blue in algebra yeah
there's more to it yeah it's a good

2924
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:51,180
there's more to it yeah it's a good
 

2925
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,970
there's more to it yeah it's a good
question how much more

2926
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:52,980
question how much more
 

2927
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,910
question how much more
is there to it and it seems like one of

2928
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
is there to it and it seems like one of
 

2929
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,089
is there to it and it seems like one of
the reasons as you uh imply that the

2930
00:53:59,089 --> 00:53:59,099
the reasons as you uh imply that the
 

2931
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:01,910
the reasons as you uh imply that the
reason gbt Works chat GPT works is that

2932
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
reason gbt Works chat GPT works is that
 

2933
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,809
reason gbt Works chat GPT works is that
uh

2934
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:02,819
uh
 

2935
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:05,930
uh
there's a finite number of things to it

2936
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:05,940
there's a finite number of things to it
 

2937
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,109
there's a finite number of things to it
yeah I mean it's discovering the laws in

2938
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
yeah I mean it's discovering the laws in
 

2939
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,809
yeah I mean it's discovering the laws in
some sense GPT is discovering this laws

2940
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:11,819
some sense GPT is discovering this laws
 

2941
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:14,690
some sense GPT is discovering this laws
of semantic grammar that underlies

of semantic grammar that underlies
 

2943
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,450
of semantic grammar that underlies
language yes what's sort of interesting

2944
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:17,460
language yes what's sort of interesting
 

2945
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,030
language yes what's sort of interesting
is in the computational universe there's

2946
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:20,040
is in the computational universe there's
 

2947
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,710
is in the computational universe there's
a lot of other kinds of computation that

2948
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:21,720
a lot of other kinds of computation that
 

2949
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,930
a lot of other kinds of computation that
you could do they're just not ones that

2950
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:23,940
you could do they're just not ones that
 

2951
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,290
you could do they're just not ones that
we humans have cared about and and

2952
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:27,300
we humans have cared about and and
 

2953
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,630
we humans have cared about and and
operate with and that's probably because

2954
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:29,640
operate with and that's probably because
 

2955
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,370
operate with and that's probably because
our brains are built in a certain way

2956
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:31,380
our brains are built in a certain way
 

2957
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,770
our brains are built in a certain way
and you know the neural Nets of our

2958
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:33,780
and you know the neural Nets of our
 

2959
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,510
and you know the neural Nets of our
brains are not that different in some

2960
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,520
brains are not that different in some
 

2961
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,089
brains are not that different in some
sense from the neural Nets of of uh of a

2962
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:38,099
sense from the neural Nets of of uh of a
 

2963
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:40,069
sense from the neural Nets of of uh of a
large language model and that's kind of

2964
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,079
large language model and that's kind of
 

2965
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,230
large language model and that's kind of
and and so when we think about and you

2966
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:42,240
and and so when we think about and you
 

2967
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,609
and and so when we think about and you
know maybe we can talk about this some

2968
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:43,619
know maybe we can talk about this some
 

2969
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:44,750
know maybe we can talk about this some
more but when we think about sort of

2970
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:44,760
more but when we think about sort of
 

2971
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,910
more but when we think about sort of
what will AIS ultimately do

2972
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:46,920
what will AIS ultimately do
 

2973
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,670
what will AIS ultimately do
the answer is insofar as AIS are just

2974
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:49,680
the answer is insofar as AIS are just
 

2975
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,190
the answer is insofar as AIS are just
doing computation they can run off and

2976
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:52,200
doing computation they can run off and
 

2977
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,890
doing computation they can run off and
do all these kinds of crazy computations

2978
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:53,900
do all these kinds of crazy computations
 

2979
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,010
do all these kinds of crazy computations
but the ones that we sort of have have

2980
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:58,020
but the ones that we sort of have have
 

2981
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,170
but the ones that we sort of have have
decided we care about are there is this

2982
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:00,180
decided we care about are there is this
 

2983
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,750
decided we care about are there is this
kind of very limited set

2984
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:02,760
kind of very limited set
 

2985
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,730
kind of very limited set
that's where the

2986
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:04,740
that's where the
 

2987
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,650
that's where the
uh reinforcement learning with human

2988
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:06,660
uh reinforcement learning with human
 

2989
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,990
uh reinforcement learning with human
feedback seems to come in the more the

2990
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:09,000
feedback seems to come in the more the
 

2991
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,030
feedback seems to come in the more the
AI say the stuff that kind of interests

2992
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
AI say the stuff that kind of interests
 

2993
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,370
AI say the stuff that kind of interests
us the more we're impressed by it

2994
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:13,380
us the more we're impressed by it
 

2995
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,870
us the more we're impressed by it
so you can do a lot of interesting

2996
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:14,880
so you can do a lot of interesting
 

2997
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,549
so you can do a lot of interesting
intelligent things but we're only

2998
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
intelligent things but we're only
 

2999
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,790
intelligent things but we're only
interested in the AI systems when they

3000
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:19,800
interested in the AI systems when they
 

3001
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,130
interested in the AI systems when they
communicate human in a human-like way

3002
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:22,140
communicate human in a human-like way
 

3003
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,970
communicate human in a human-like way
you ask about human-like topics yes well

3004
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:25,980
you ask about human-like topics yes well
 

3005
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,370
you ask about human-like topics yes well
it's it's like technology I mean in a

3006
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:28,380
it's it's like technology I mean in a
 

3007
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,130
it's it's like technology I mean in a
sense the physical world provides all

3008
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:31,140
sense the physical world provides all
 

3009
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,569
sense the physical world provides all
kinds of things you know there's all

00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:32,579
kinds of things you know there's all
 

3011
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,190
kinds of things you know there's all
kinds of processes going on in physics

3012
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:34,200
kinds of processes going on in physics
 

3013
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,829
kinds of processes going on in physics
only a limited set of those are ones

3014
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:36,839
only a limited set of those are ones
 

3015
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,230
only a limited set of those are ones
that we capture and use for technology

3016
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:39,240
that we capture and use for technology
 

3017
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,270
that we capture and use for technology
because they're only a limited set but

3018
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
because they're only a limited set but
 

3019
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,569
because they're only a limited set but
we say you know this is a thing that we

we say you know this is a thing that we
 

3021
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:46,670
we say you know this is a thing that we
can sort of apply to the human purposes

3022
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:46,680
can sort of apply to the human purposes

00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:27,240
is meaningless it's just a bunch of
 

3109
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,329
is meaningless it's just a bunch of
words it's syntactically correct the

3110
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:29,339
words it's syntactically correct the
 

3111
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:30,530
words it's syntactically correct the
nouns and the verbs are in the right

3112
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:30,540
nouns and the verbs are in the right
 

3113
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,710
nouns and the verbs are in the right
place but it just doesn't mean anything

3114
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:33,720
place but it just doesn't mean anything
 

3115
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,770
place but it just doesn't mean anything
um and so there clearly is some rule

3116
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:36,780
um and so there clearly is some rule
 

3117
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,230
um and so there clearly is some rule
that there are rules that determine when

3118
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:39,240
that there are rules that determine when
 

3119
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,210
that there are rules that determine when
a sentence is has the potential to be

3120
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:41,220
a sentence is has the potential to be
 

3121
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,730
a sentence is has the potential to be
meaningful that go beyond the pure parts

3122
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:43,740
meaningful that go beyond the pure parts
 

3123
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,849
meaningful that go beyond the pure parts
of speech syntax and so the question is

3124
00:57:46,849 --> 00:57:46,859
of speech syntax and so the question is
 

3125
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:48,410
of speech syntax and so the question is
what are those rules and are there

3126
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:48,420
what are those rules and are there
 

3127
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,109
what are those rules and are there
fairly finite set of those rules my

3128
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
fairly finite set of those rules my
 

3129
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,549
fairly finite set of those rules my
guess is that there's a fairly finite

3130
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:52,559
guess is that there's a fairly finite
 

3131
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,069
guess is that there's a fairly finite
set of those rules and they you know

3132
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:55,079
set of those rules and they you know
 

3133
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,049
set of those rules and they you know
once you have those rules you have a

3134
00:57:57,049 --> 00:57:57,059
once you have those rules you have a
 

3135
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,210
once you have those rules you have a
kind of a construction kit just like

3136
00:57:59,210 --> 00:57:59,220
kind of a construction kit just like
 

3137
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,390
kind of a construction kit just like
this the rules of syntactic grammar give

3138
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:02,400
this the rules of syntactic grammar give
 

3139
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,950
this the rules of syntactic grammar give
you a construction kit for making

3140
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:03,960
you a construction kit for making
 

3141
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,650
you a construction kit for making
syntactically correct sentences so you

3142
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:06,660
syntactically correct sentences so you
 

3143
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,569
syntactically correct sentences so you
can also have a construction kit for

3144
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:08,579
can also have a construction kit for
 

3145
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:10,609
can also have a construction kit for
making semantically correct sentences

3146
00:58:10,609 --> 00:58:10,619
making semantically correct sentences
 

3147
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:12,770
making semantically correct sentences
those sentences may not be realized in

3148
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:12,780
those sentences may not be realized in
 

3149
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,049
those sentences may not be realized in
the world I mean I think you know the

3150
00:58:15,049 --> 00:58:15,059
the world I mean I think you know the
 

3151
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:17,569
the world I mean I think you know the
elephant flew to the moon yeah a a

3152
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:17,579
elephant flew to the moon yeah a a
 

3153
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:20,390
elephant flew to the moon yeah a a
syntactic a semantically you know we

3154
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
syntactic a semantically you know we
 

3155
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,670
syntactic a semantically you know we
know we have an idea if I say that to

3156
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:22,680
know we have an idea if I say that to
 

3157
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,130
know we have an idea if I say that to
you you kind of know what that means but

3158
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:25,140
you you kind of know what that means but
 

3159
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,049
you you kind of know what that means but
the fact is it hasn't been realized in

3160
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:27,059
the fact is it hasn't been realized in
 

3161
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:28,849
the fact is it hasn't been realized in
the world so to speak so semantically

3162
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:28,859
the world so to speak so semantically
 

3163
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:31,190
the world so to speak so semantically
correct perhaps there's things that can

3164
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:31,200
correct perhaps there's things that can
 

3165
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,370
correct perhaps there's things that can
be imagined with the human mind no uh

3166
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:34,380
be imagined with the human mind no uh
 

3167
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,490
be imagined with the human mind no uh
things that are

3168
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:36,500
things that are
 

3169
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:40,190
things that are
consistent with both our imagination and

3170
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:40,200
consistent with both our imagination and
 

3171
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,410
consistent with both our imagination and
our understanding of physical reality I

3172
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:42,420
our understanding of physical reality I
 

3173
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,710
our understanding of physical reality I
don't yeah good question I mean it's a

3174
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:45,720
don't yeah good question I mean it's a
 

3175
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,930
don't yeah good question I mean it's a
good question it's a good question I

3176
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:47,940
good question it's a good question I
 

3177
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,990
good question it's a good question I
mean I think it is it is given the way

3178
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:51,000
mean I think it is it is given the way
 

3179
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,510
mean I think it is it is given the way
we have constructed language it is

3180
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:53,520
we have constructed language it is
 

3181
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,750
we have constructed language it is
things which which fit with the things

3182
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:56,760
things which which fit with the things
 

3183
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,190
things which which fit with the things
we're describing in language it's a bit

3184
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,200
we're describing in language it's a bit
 

3185
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,250
we're describing in language it's a bit
circular in the end because you know you

3186
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:01,260
circular in the end because you know you
 

3187
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,470
circular in the end because you know you
can and and the and the the sort of

3188
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:03,480
can and and the and the the sort of
 

3189
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,870
can and and the and the the sort of
boundaries of what is physically

3190
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:05,880
boundaries of what is physically
 

3191
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,510
boundaries of what is physically
realizable okay let's take the example

3192
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:08,520
realizable okay let's take the example
 

3193
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,270
realizable okay let's take the example
of motion okay motion is a complicated

3194
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
of motion okay motion is a complicated
 

3195
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,010
of motion okay motion is a complicated
concept it might seem like it's a

3196
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:13,020
concept it might seem like it's a
 

3197
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,030
concept it might seem like it's a
concept that should have been figured

3198
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:14,040
concept that should have been figured
 

3199
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,730
concept that should have been figured
out by the Greeks you know long ago but

3200
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:16,740
out by the Greeks you know long ago but
 

3201
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,049
out by the Greeks you know long ago but
it's actually really pretty complicated

3202
00:59:18,049 --> 00:59:18,059
it's actually really pretty complicated
 

3203
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:20,630
it's actually really pretty complicated
concept because what is motion motion is

3204
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,640
concept because what is motion motion is
 

3205
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,569
concept because what is motion motion is
you can go from place a to place B and

3206
00:59:23,569 --> 00:59:23,579
you can go from place a to place B and
 

3207
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:25,670
you can go from place a to place B and
it's still you when you get to the other

3208
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
it's still you when you get to the other
 

3209
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,490
it's still you when you get to the other
end right you you take an object you

3210
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:28,500
end right you you take an object you
 

3211
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,650
end right you you take an object you
move it and it's still the same object

3212
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:30,660
move it and it's still the same object
 

3213
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,809
move it and it's still the same object
but it's in a different place now even

3214
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:32,819
but it's in a different place now even
 

3215
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,150
but it's in a different place now even
in ordinary physics that doesn't always

3216
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:35,160
in ordinary physics that doesn't always
 

3217
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,950
in ordinary physics that doesn't always
work that way if you're near a

3218
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:36,960
work that way if you're near a
 

3219
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,870
work that way if you're near a
space-time singularity in a black hole

3220
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:38,880
space-time singularity in a black hole
 

3221
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,270
space-time singularity in a black hole
for example and you take your teapot or

3222
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:41,280
for example and you take your teapot or
 

3223
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,950
for example and you take your teapot or
something you don't have much of a

3224
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:42,960
something you don't have much of a
 

3225
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,390
something you don't have much of a
teapot by the time it's near the

3226
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,400
teapot by the time it's near the
 

3227
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,950
teapot by the time it's near the
space-time Singularity it's been

3228
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:45,960
space-time Singularity it's been
 

3229
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,349
space-time Singularity it's been
completely you know deformed beyond

3230
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:48,359
completely you know deformed beyond
 

3231
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:50,690
completely you know deformed beyond
recognition but so that's a case where

3232
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:50,700
recognition but so that's a case where
 

3233
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,089
recognition but so that's a case where
pure emotion doesn't really work you

3234
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:53,099
pure emotion doesn't really work you
 

3235
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,549
pure emotion doesn't really work you
can't have a thing stay the same but so

3236
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:55,559
can't have a thing stay the same but so
 

3237
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,549
can't have a thing stay the same but so
this idea of motion is is something that

3238
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:58,559
this idea of motion is is something that
 

3239
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,710
this idea of motion is is something that
sort of is a slightly complicated idea

3240
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:00,720
sort of is a slightly complicated idea
 

3241
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,190
sort of is a slightly complicated idea
but once you have the idea of motion you

3242
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:04,200
but once you have the idea of motion you
 

3243
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,510
but once you have the idea of motion you
can start once you have the idea that

3244
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,520
can start once you have the idea that
 

3245
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,670
can start once you have the idea that
you're going to describe things as being

3246
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
you're going to describe things as being
 

3247
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,210
you're going to describe things as being
the same thing but in a different place

3248
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:10,220
the same thing but in a different place
 

3249
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:14,390
the same thing but in a different place
that sort of abstracted idea then has

3250
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
that sort of abstracted idea then has
 

3251
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,770
that sort of abstracted idea then has
you know that has all sorts of

3252
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:15,780
you know that has all sorts of
 

3253
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,510
you know that has all sorts of
consequences like this transitivity of

3254
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:17,520
consequences like this transitivity of
 

3255
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,609
consequences like this transitivity of
motion go from A to B B to C you've gone

3256
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:19,619
motion go from A to B B to C you've gone
 

3257
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,230
motion go from A to B B to C you've gone
from a to c

3258
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:21,240
from a to c
 

3259
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,730
from a to c
um and that's so that level of

3260
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:22,740
um and that's so that level of
 

3261
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,390
um and that's so that level of

of uh inevitable consequences they're

3264
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:28,380
of uh inevitable consequences they're

inevitable features of the way you've

3266
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,000
inevitable features of the way you've
 

3267
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,970
inevitable features of the way you've
sort of set things up and that's I think

3268
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:31,980
sort of set things up and that's I think
 

3269
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,950
sort of set things up and that's I think
what this sort of semantic grammar is

3270
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:33,960
what this sort of semantic grammar is
 

3271
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,069
what this sort of semantic grammar is
capturing is things things like that and

3272
01:00:37,069 --> 01:00:37,079
capturing is things things like that and
 

3273
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:38,870
capturing is things things like that and
I you know I think that it's a question

3274
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:38,880
I you know I think that it's a question
 

3275
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,549
I you know I think that it's a question
of what does the word mean when you say

3276
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
of what does the word mean when you say
 

3277
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,890
of what does the word mean when you say
I go from I move from here to there well

3278
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:42,900
I go from I move from here to there well
 

3279
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,510
I go from I move from here to there well
it's complicated to say what that means

3280
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:44,520
it's complicated to say what that means
 

3281
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,370
it's complicated to say what that means
this is this whole issue of you know is

3282
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:46,380
this is this whole issue of you know is
 

3283
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,170
this is this whole issue of you know is
pure motion possible et cetera et cetera

3284
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:48,180
pure motion possible et cetera et cetera
 

3285
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,270
pure motion possible et cetera et cetera
et cetera but once you have kind of got

3286
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:50,280
et cetera but once you have kind of got
 

3287
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,370
et cetera but once you have kind of got
an idea of what that means then there

3288
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:52,380
an idea of what that means then there
 

3289
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,670
an idea of what that means then there
are inevitable consequences of that idea

3290
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:55,680
are inevitable consequences of that idea
 

3291
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,549
are inevitable consequences of that idea
but the very idea of meaning it seems

3292
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
but the very idea of meaning it seems
 

3293
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,150
but the very idea of meaning it seems
like there's some words that become

3294
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,160

 

3295
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,289

um

3296
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:03,299
um
 

3297
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:06,530
um
it's like there's a latent ambiguity to

3298
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:06,540
it's like there's a latent ambiguity to
 

3299
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,910
it's like there's a latent ambiguity to
them I mean it's the word like

3300
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
them I mean it's the word like
 

3301
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,910
them I mean it's the word like
emotionally loaded words like hate and

3302
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:10,920
emotionally loaded words like hate and
 

3303
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,349
emotionally loaded words like hate and
love

3304
01:01:12,349 --> 01:01:12,359
love
 

3305
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:14,690
love
right it's like what what are they what

3306
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:14,700
right it's like what what are they what
 

3307
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,970
right it's like what what are they what
do they mean exactly like what

3308
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:16,980
do they mean exactly like what
 

3309
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,370
do they mean exactly like what
um so especially when you have

3310
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:18,380
um so especially when you have
 

3311
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,270
um so especially when you have
relationships between complicated

3312
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:20,280
relationships between complicated
 

3313
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,430

well words are defined by kind of our
social use of them I mean it's not you

3324
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:37,020
social use of them I mean it's not you
 

3325
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,329
social use of them I mean it's not you
know a word

3326
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:38,339
know a word
 

3327
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:40,690
know a word
in computational language for example

3328
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:40,700
in computational language for example
 

3329
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,589
in computational language for example
when we say we have a a construct there

3330
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:44,599
when we say we have a a construct there
 

3331
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:47,809
when we say we have a a construct there
we expect that that construct is a

3332
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:47,819
we expect that that construct is a
 

3333
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:49,069
we expect that that construct is a
building block from which we can

3334
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:49,079
building block from which we can
 

3335
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,230
building block from which we can
construct an arbitrarily tall tower so

3336
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:51,240
construct an arbitrarily tall tower so
 

3337
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,549
construct an arbitrarily tall tower so
we have to have a very solid building

3338
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:52,559
we have to have a very solid building
 

3339
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,190
we have to have a very solid building
block and you know we have to it turns

3340
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
block and you know we have to it turns
 

3341
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,569
block and you know we have to it turns
into a piece of code it has

3342
01:01:56,569 --> 01:01:56,579
into a piece of code it has
 

3343
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,370
into a piece of code it has
documentation it's you know it's a whole

3344
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:58,380
documentation it's you know it's a whole
 

3345
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:01,910
documentation it's you know it's a whole
it's a whole thing but the word hate you

3346
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
it's a whole thing but the word hate you
 

3347
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,789
it's a whole thing but the word hate you
know the documentation for that word

3348
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:03,799
know the documentation for that word
 

3349
01:02:03,799 --> 01:02:05,870
know the documentation for that word
well there isn't a standard

3350
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:05,880
well there isn't a standard
 

3351
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,789
well there isn't a standard
documentation for that word so to speak

3352
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:07,799
documentation for that word so to speak
 

3353
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:10,910
documentation for that word so to speak
it's a complicated thing defined by kind

3354
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:10,920
it's a complicated thing defined by kind
 

3355
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,490
it's a complicated thing defined by kind
of how we use it when you know if it

3356
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:13,500
of how we use it when you know if it
 

3357
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,170
of how we use it when you know if it
wasn't for the fact that we were using

3358
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:15,180
wasn't for the fact that we were using
 

3359
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,030
wasn't for the fact that we were using
language I mean so so what is language

3360
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:17,040
language I mean so so what is language
 

3361
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,250
language I mean so so what is language
at some level language is a way of

3362
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:19,260
at some level language is a way of
 

3363
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,930
at some level language is a way of
packaging thoughts so that we can

3364
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:20,940
packaging thoughts so that we can
 

3365
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,569
packaging thoughts so that we can
communicate them to another mind can

3366
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:23,579
communicate them to another mind can
 

3367
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:25,609
communicate them to another mind can
these complicated words

3368
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:25,619
these complicated words
 

3369
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:28,430
these complicated words
be converted into something that a

3370
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:28,440
be converted into something that a
 

3371
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,190
be converted into something that a
computation engine can use right so so I

3372
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,200
computation engine can use right so so I
 

3373
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,410
computation engine can use right so so I
think the answer to that is that that

3374
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:33,420
think the answer to that is that that
 

3375
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,510
think the answer to that is that that
what one can do in computational

3376
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:35,520
what one can do in computational
 

3377
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,990
what one can do in computational
language is Define make a def make a

3378
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:39,000
language is Define make a def make a
 

3379
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,930
language is Define make a def make a
specific definition and if you have a

3380
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:41,940
specific definition and if you have a
 

3381
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,670
specific definition and if you have a
complicated word like let's say the word

3382
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
complicated word like let's say the word
 

3383
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,490
complicated word like let's say the word
eat okay you'd think that's a simple

3384
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:46,500
eat okay you'd think that's a simple
 

3385
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,230
eat okay you'd think that's a simple
word it's you know animals eat things

3386
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,240
word it's you know animals eat things
 

3387
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,789
word it's you know animals eat things
whatever else but you know you do

3388
01:02:49,789 --> 01:02:49,799
whatever else but you know you do
 

3389
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,250
whatever else but you know you do
programming you say this function eats

3390
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:52,260
programming you say this function eats
 

3391
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,730
programming you say this function eats
arguments which is sort of poetically

3392
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:55,740
arguments which is sort of poetically
 

3393
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,370
arguments which is sort of poetically
similar to the animal eating things but

3394
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:58,380
similar to the animal eating things but
 

3395
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,809
similar to the animal eating things but
if you start to say well what are the

3396
01:02:59,809 --> 01:02:59,819
if you start to say well what are the
 

3397
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:02,870
if you start to say well what are the
implications of you know uh the function

3398
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880
implications of you know uh the function
 

3399
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,849
implications of you know uh the function
eating something you know does it can

3400
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:04,859
eating something you know does it can
 

3401
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:06,410
eating something you know does it can
can the function be poisoned well maybe

3402
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:06,420
can the function be poisoned well maybe
 

3403
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,750
can the function be poisoned well maybe
it can actually but um uh you know if

3404
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:08,760
it can actually but um uh you know if
 

3405
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,370
it can actually but um uh you know if
there's a tight mismatch or something in

3406
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:10,380
there's a tight mismatch or something in
 

3407
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,069
there's a tight mismatch or something in
some language but but you know in what

3408
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:13,079
some language but but you know in what
 

3409
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:15,710
some language but but you know in what
how far does that analogy go and it's

3410
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:15,720
how far does that analogy go and it's
 

3411
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,250
how far does that analogy go and it's
it's just an analogy whereas if you use

3412
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:19,260
it's just an analogy whereas if you use
 

3413
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,829
it's just an analogy whereas if you use
the word eat in a computational language

3414
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
the word eat in a computational language
 

3415
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,950
the word eat in a computational language
level you would Define there isn't a

3416
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
level you would Define there isn't a
 

3417
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,349
level you would Define there isn't a
thing which you anchor to the kind of

01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:27,359
thing which you anchor to the kind of
 

3419
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,750
thing which you anchor to the kind of
natural language concept eat but it is

3420
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:29,760
natural language concept eat but it is
 

3421
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,030
natural language concept eat but it is
now some precise definition of that that

3422
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:32,040
now some precise definition of that that
 

3423
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,710
now some precise definition of that that
then you can compute things from but

3424
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:33,720
then you can compute things from but
 

3425
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,150
then you can compute things from but
don't you think the analogy is also per

3426
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:35,160
don't you think the analogy is also per
 

3427
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,970
don't you think the analogy is also per
se software eats the world don't you

3428
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:37,980
se software eats the world don't you
 

3429
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,450
se software eats the world don't you
think there's a

3430
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:40,460
think there's a
 

3431
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,309
think there's a
there's something Concrete in terms of

01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:43,319
there's something Concrete in terms of
 

3433
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,490
there's something Concrete in terms of
meaning about analogies sure but the

3434
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:46,500
meaning about analogies sure but the
 

3435
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,470
meaning about analogies sure but the
thing that sort of is the first Target

3436
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:48,480
thing that sort of is the first Target
 

3437
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,289
thing that sort of is the first Target
for computational language is to take

3438
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:51,299
for computational language is to take
 

3439
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:53,870
for computational language is to take
sort of the ordinary meaning of things

3440
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:53,880
sort of the ordinary meaning of things
 

3441
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,450
sort of the ordinary meaning of things
and try and make it precise make it

3442
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:56,460
and try and make it precise make it
 

3443
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,010
and try and make it precise make it
sufficiently precise you can build these

3444
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,020
sufficiently precise you can build these
 

3445
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:59,930
sufficiently precise you can build these
towers of computation on top of it so

3446
01:03:59,930 --> 01:03:59,940
towers of computation on top of it so
 

3447
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,430
towers of computation on top of it so
it's kind of like if you start with a

3448
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
it's kind of like if you start with a
 

3449
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,069
it's kind of like if you start with a
piece of poetry and you say I'm going to

3450
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
piece of poetry and you say I'm going to
 

3451
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,690
piece of poetry and you say I'm going to
Define my program with this piece of

3452
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:05,700
Define my program with this piece of
 

3453
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,470
Define my program with this piece of
poetry it's kind of like that's that's a

3454
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:09,480
poetry it's kind of like that's that's a
 

3455
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,569
poetry it's kind of like that's that's a
difficult thing it's better to say I'm

3456
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:11,579
difficult thing it's better to say I'm
 

3457
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,190
difficult thing it's better to say I'm
going to just have this boring piece of

3458
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200
going to just have this boring piece of
 

3459
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,170
going to just have this boring piece of
prose and it's using words in the

3460
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,180
prose and it's using words in the
 

3461
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,569
prose and it's using words in the
ordinary way and that time communicating

3462
01:04:17,569 --> 01:04:17,579
ordinary way and that time communicating
 

3463
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:20,150
ordinary way and that time communicating
with my computer and that's how I'm

3464
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
with my computer and that's how I'm
 

3465
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,890
with my computer and that's how I'm
going to build the solid building block

3466
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:21,900
going to build the solid building block
 

3467
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,990
going to build the solid building block
from which I can construct this whole

3468
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,000
from which I can construct this whole
 

3469
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,849
from which I can construct this whole
kind of computational Tower so there's

3470
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:25,859
kind of computational Tower so there's
 

3471
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:28,789
kind of computational Tower so there's
some sense where if you take a poem and

3472
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:28,799
some sense where if you take a poem and
 

3473
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,230
some sense where if you take a poem and
reduce it to something computable you're

3474
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:30,240
reduce it to something computable you're
 

3475
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,150
reduce it to something computable you're
going to have very few things left so

3476
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,160
going to have very few things left so
 

3477
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,190
going to have very few things left so
maybe there's a bunch of human

3478
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:34,200
maybe there's a bunch of human
 

3479
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,309
maybe there's a bunch of human
interaction that's just poetic

3480
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:37,319
interaction that's just poetic
 

3481
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,349
interaction that's just poetic
aimless nonsense

3482
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:39,359
aimless nonsense
 

3483
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,950
aimless nonsense
well that's just like recreational like

3484
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
well that's just like recreational like
 

3485
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,809
well that's just like recreational like
hamster in a wheel it's not actually

3486
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:44,819
hamster in a wheel it's not actually
 

3487
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:47,569
hamster in a wheel it's not actually
producing anything well I I I think that

3488
01:04:47,569 --> 01:04:47,579
producing anything well I I I think that
 

3489
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:49,670
producing anything well I I I think that
that's a complicated thing because in a

3490
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:49,680
that's a complicated thing because in a
 

3491
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,829
that's a complicated thing because in a
sense human linguistic communication is

3492
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:51,839
sense human linguistic communication is
 

3493
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,730
sense human linguistic communication is
there's one mind it's producing language

3494
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:54,740
there's one mind it's producing language
 

3495
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,170
there's one mind it's producing language
that language is having an effect on

3496
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:57,180
that language is having an effect on
 

3497
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,170
that language is having an effect on
another mind yeah and the question of

3498
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:00,180
another mind yeah and the question of
 

3499
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,930
another mind yeah and the question of
there's sort of a a type of effect that

3500
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:02,940
there's sort of a a type of effect that
 

3501
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,329
there's sort of a a type of effect that
is well defined let's say where where

3502
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:05,339
is well defined let's say where where
 

3503
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:06,950
is well defined let's say where where
for example it's very independent of the

3504
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:06,960
for example it's very independent of the
 

3505
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,049
for example it's very independent of the
two minds that the it doesn't you know

3506
01:05:09,049 --> 01:05:09,059
two minds that the it doesn't you know
 

3507
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:10,670
two minds that the it doesn't you know
that there there's communication where

3508
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:10,680
that there there's communication where
 

3509
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,829
that there there's communication where
it can matter a lot sort of what the

3510
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:12,839
it can matter a lot sort of what the
 

3511
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:16,130
it can matter a lot sort of what the
experience of of um uh of one mind is

3512
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:16,140
experience of of um uh of one mind is
 

3513
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:19,789
experience of of um uh of one mind is
versus another one and so on

3514
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:19,799

 

3515
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:22,250

yeah but uh

3516
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:22,260
yeah but uh
 

3517
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,470
yeah but uh
what is the purpose of natural English

3518
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:24,480
what is the purpose of natural English
 

3519
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,230
what is the purpose of natural English
communication

3520
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:26,240
communication
 

3521
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,789
communication
well I think I think versus so

3522
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
well I think I think versus so
 

3523
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,589
well I think I think versus so
computation computational language

3524
01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:30,599
computation computational language
 

3525
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,990
computation computational language
somehow feels more amenable to the

3526
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:33,000
somehow feels more amenable to the
 

3527
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,270
somehow feels more amenable to the
definition of purpose it's like yeah

3528
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:35,280
definition of purpose it's like yeah
 

3529
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,049
definition of purpose it's like yeah
you're given to

3530
01:05:38,049 --> 01:05:38,059
you're given to
 

3531
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,789
you're given to
clean representations of a concept and

3532
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:40,799
clean representations of a concept and
 

3533
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,010
clean representations of a concept and
you can build a tower based on that is

3534
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:43,020
you can build a tower based on that is
 

3535
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,049
you can build a tower based on that is
is natural language the same thing but

3536
01:05:45,049 --> 01:05:45,059
is natural language the same thing but
 

3537
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:47,210
is natural language the same thing but
more fuzzy what well I think the the

3538
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:47,220
more fuzzy what well I think the the
 

3539
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,190
more fuzzy what well I think the the
story of natural language right in the

3540
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
story of natural language right in the
 

3541
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,930
story of natural language right in the
the that's the great invention of our

3542
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:50,940
the that's the great invention of our
 

3543
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,630
the that's the great invention of our
species we don't know whether exists in

3544
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:53,640
species we don't know whether exists in
 

3545
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,309
species we don't know whether exists in
other species but we know it exists in

3546
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:55,319
other species but we know it exists in
 

3547
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,650
other species but we know it exists in
our species it's the thing that allows

3548
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:57,660
our species it's the thing that allows
 

3549
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,190
our species it's the thing that allows
you to sort of communicate abstractly

3550
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
you to sort of communicate abstractly
 

3551
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,589
you to sort of communicate abstractly
from like one generation of the species

3552
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:03,599
from like one generation of the species
 

3553
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,809
from like one generation of the species
to another you can you know there is an

3554
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:05,819
to another you can you know there is an
 

3555
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:07,430
to another you can you know there is an
abstract version of knowledge that can

3556
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,440
abstract version of knowledge that can
 

3557
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,069
abstract version of knowledge that can
be passed down it doesn't have to be you

3558
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:10,079
be passed down it doesn't have to be you
 

3559
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,990
be passed down it doesn't have to be you
know genetics it doesn't have to be you

3560
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:12,000

3561
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,730
know genetics it doesn't have to be you
know you don't have to Apprentice the

3562
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:13,740
know you don't have to Apprentice the
 

3563
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,870
know you don't have to Apprentice the

3568
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:18,780
to show them how something works yeah
 

3569
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,410
to show them how something works yeah
there is this abstracted version of

down now that you know it relies on it

3574
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:26,579
down now that you know it relies on it
 

3575
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:28,730
down now that you know it relies on it
still tends to rely because language is

3576
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:28,740
still tends to rely because language is
 

3577
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,069
still tends to rely because language is
fuzzy it does tend to rely on the fact

3578
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:31,079
fuzzy it does tend to rely on the fact
 

3579
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:33,230
fuzzy it does tend to rely on the fact
that you know if we look at the you know

3580
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:33,240
that you know if we look at the you know
 

3581
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,690
that you know if we look at the you know
some ancient language that where we

3582
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:35,700
some ancient language that where we
 

3583
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,309
some ancient language that where we
don't have a chain of translations from

3584
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:37,319
don't have a chain of translations from
 

3585
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:39,650
don't have a chain of translations from
it until what we have today we may not

3586
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:39,660
it until what we have today we may not
 

3587
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,870
it until what we have today we may not
understand that ancient language

3588
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:41,880
understand that ancient language
 

3589
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,370
understand that ancient language
um and we may not understand you know

3590
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:43,380
um and we may not understand you know
 

3591
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,990
um and we may not understand you know
its Concepts may be different from the

3592
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:45,000
its Concepts may be different from the
 

3593
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,910
its Concepts may be different from the
ones that we have today we still have to

3594
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:46,920
ones that we have today we still have to
 

3595
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,770
ones that we have today we still have to
have something of a chain but it is

3596
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:48,780
have something of a chain but it is
 

3597
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,510
have something of a chain but it is
something where we can realistically

3598
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:50,520
something where we can realistically
 

3599
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,630
something where we can realistically
expect to communicate abstract ideas and

3600
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:53,640
expect to communicate abstract ideas and
 

3601
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,130
expect to communicate abstract ideas and
that's you know that's one of the big

3602
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:55,140
that's you know that's one of the big
 

3603
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,190
that's you know that's one of the big
big roles of a language I think you know

3604
01:06:58,190 --> 01:06:58,200
big roles of a language I think you know
 

3605
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,770
big roles of a language I think you know
in in um

3606
01:06:59,770 --> 01:06:59,780
in in um
 

3607
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:03,109
in in um
uh it's you know that that's been this

3608
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
uh it's you know that that's been this
 

3609
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,250
uh it's you know that that's been this
this ability to sort of concretify

3610
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:07,260
this ability to sort of concretify
 

3611
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,250
this ability to sort of concretify
abstract things is what what language

3612
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:10,260
abstract things is what what language
 

3613
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,829
abstract things is what what language
has provided do you see natural language

3614
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:12,839
has provided do you see natural language
 

3615
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:14,809
has provided do you see natural language
and thought as the same the stuff that's

3616
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:14,819
and thought as the same the stuff that's
 

3617
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:16,970
and thought as the same the stuff that's
going inside your mind

3618
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:16,980
going inside your mind
 

3619
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,170
going inside your mind
well

3620
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:18,180
well
 

3621
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:20,329
well
that's been a long debate in philosophy

3622
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:20,339
that's been a long debate in philosophy
 

3623
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:22,370
that's been a long debate in philosophy
it seems to be become more important now

3624
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:22,380
it seems to be become more important now
 

3625
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,650
it seems to be become more important now
when we think about

3626
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:24,660
when we think about
 

3627
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,589
when we think about
how intelligent GPT is

3628
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
how intelligent GPT is
 

3629
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,809
how intelligent GPT is
whatever that means whatever that means

3630
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:29,819
whatever that means whatever that means
 

3631
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:31,250
whatever that means whatever that means
but it seems like the stuff that's going

3632
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:31,260
but it seems like the stuff that's going
 

3633
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,049
but it seems like the stuff that's going
on in the human mind seems something

3634
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:33,059
on in the human mind seems something
 

3635
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:35,690
on in the human mind seems something
like intelligence is language but we

3636
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:35,700
like intelligence is language but we
 

3637
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,309
like intelligence is language but we
call it intelligence yeah we call it

3638
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:37,319
call it intelligence yeah we call it
 

3639
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,890
call it intelligence yeah we call it
well yes and so you start to think of

3640
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:39,900
well yes and so you start to think of
 

3641
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,270
well yes and so you start to think of
okay what's the relationship between

3642
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:41,280
okay what's the relationship between
 

3643
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,250
okay what's the relationship between
thought

3644
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:43,260
thought
 

3645
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,170
thought
the language of thought the laws of

3646
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:45,180
the language of thought the laws of
 

3647
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,809
the language of thought the laws of
thought the laws of the words like

3648
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:47,819
thought the laws of the words like
 

3649
01:07:47,819 --> 01:07:48,950
thought the laws of the words like
reasoning

3650
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:48,960
reasoning
 

3651
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,950
reasoning
and the laws of language and how that

3652
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:51,960
and the laws of language and how that
 

3653
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,170
and the laws of language and how that
has to do with computation which seems

3654
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:54,180
has to do with computation which seems
 

3655
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,750
has to do with computation which seems
like a more rigorous precise ways of

3656
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:56,760
like a more rigorous precise ways of
 

3657
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,750
like a more rigorous precise ways of
reasoning right which are Beyond human I

3658
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
reasoning right which are Beyond human I
 

3659
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,089
reasoning right which are Beyond human I
mean much of what computers do human

3660
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:02,099
mean much of what computers do human
 

3661
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:04,430
mean much of what computers do human
humans do not do I mean you might say

3662
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:04,440
humans do not do I mean you might say
 

3663
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,430
humans do not do I mean you might say
humans are a subset yeah presumably yes

3664
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
humans are a subset yeah presumably yes
 

3665
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,150
humans are a subset yeah presumably yes
hopefully yes the the yes right you know

3666
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:11,160
hopefully yes the the yes right you know
 

3667
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,910
hopefully yes the the yes right you know
you might say who needs computation when

3668
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:13,920
you might say who needs computation when
 

3669
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,710
you might say who needs computation when
we have large language models large

3670
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:15,720
we have large language models large
 

3671
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,090
we have large language models large
language models can just you know

3672
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:17,100
language models can just you know
 

3673
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:17,990
language models can just you know
eventually you'll have a big enough

3674
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,000
eventually you'll have a big enough
 

3675
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,970
eventually you'll have a big enough
neuron that it can do anything but

3676
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:19,980
neuron that it can do anything but
 

3677
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,950
neuron that it can do anything but
they're really doing the kinds of things

3678
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:21,960
they're really doing the kinds of things
 

3679
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,349
they're really doing the kinds of things
that humans quickly do and there are

3680
01:08:24,349 --> 01:08:24,359
that humans quickly do and there are
 

3681
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:25,729
that humans quickly do and there are
plenty of sort of formal things that

3682
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:25,739
plenty of sort of formal things that
 

3683
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:28,610
plenty of sort of formal things that
humans never quickly do for example I

3684
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:28,620
humans never quickly do for example I
 

3685
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,590
humans never quickly do for example I
don't know I you know you can some

01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,209
don't know I you know you can some
people can do mental arithmetic they can

3688
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:32,219
people can do mental arithmetic they can
 

3689
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:33,650
people can do mental arithmetic they can
do a certain amount of math in their in

01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:33,660
do a certain amount of math in their in
 

3691
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,570
do a certain amount of math in their in
their minds I don't think many people

3692
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:35,580
their minds I don't think many people
 

3693
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,209
their minds I don't think many people
can run a program in their minds of any

01:08:40,669 --> 01:08:40,679
sophistication it's just not something
 

3697
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:42,229

01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:42,239
people do it's not something people have
 

3699
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:44,809
people do it's not something people have
even thought of doing because just it's

01:08:44,809 --> 01:08:44,819
even thought of doing because just it's
 

3701
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:47,030
even thought of doing because just it's
kind of a it's kind of not you know you

3702
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,040
kind of a it's kind of not you know you
 

3703
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,590
kind of a it's kind of not you know you
can easily run it on a computer when

3704
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:48,600
can easily run it on a computer when
 

3705
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,990
can easily run it on a computer when
another portray program yeah aren't we

3706
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:51,000
another portray program yeah aren't we

01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,269
another portray program yeah aren't we
running specialized programs yeah yeah

running specialized programs yeah yeah
 

3709
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,789
running specialized programs yeah yeah
but if I say to you here's a turing

3710
01:08:55,789 --> 01:08:55,799
but if I say to you here's a turing
 

3711
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,590
but if I say to you here's a turing
machine yeah you know tell me what it

3712
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:57,600
machine yeah you know tell me what it
 

3713
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,630
machine yeah you know tell me what it
does after 50 steps and you're like

3714
01:08:59,630 --> 01:08:59,640
does after 50 steps and you're like
 

3715
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,309
does after 50 steps and you're like
trying to think about that in your mind

3716
01:09:01,309 --> 01:09:01,319
trying to think about that in your mind
 

3717
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:03,650
trying to think about that in your mind
that's really hard to do it's not what

3718
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:03,660
that's really hard to do it's not what
 

3719
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,870
that's really hard to do it's not what
people do I mean well in some sense

3720
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:05,880
people do I mean well in some sense
 

3721
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,470
people do I mean well in some sense
people program they build a computer

3722
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,480
people program they build a computer
 

3723
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,630

after 50 steps I mean humans build

computers yes yes yeah that's right but

3730
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
computers yes yes yeah that's right but
 

3731
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,829
computers yes yes yeah that's right but
they've created something which is then

3732
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:21,839
they've created something which is then
 

3733
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,169
they've created something which is then
you know then when they run it it's

3734
01:09:24,169 --> 01:09:24,179
you know then when they run it it's
 

3735
01:09:24,179 --> 01:09:26,150
you know then when they run it it's
doing something different than what's

01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,410
doing something different than what's
happening in their minds I mean they've

3738
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:27,420
happening in their minds I mean they've
 

3739
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,809
happening in their minds I mean they've
outsourced that that piece of

01:09:29,809 --> 01:09:29,819
outsourced that that piece of
 

3741
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:32,150
outsourced that that piece of

01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,050
kind of how that's working I mean it's
kind of like if if it was going to say

4042
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:18,060
kind of like if if it was going to say
 

4043
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,770
kind of like if if it was going to say
you know the cat sat on the what's the

4044
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:21,780
you know the cat sat on the what's the
 

4045
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,810
you know the cat sat on the what's the
next word okay so how does it figure out

4046
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:23,820
next word okay so how does it figure out
 

4047
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,790
next word okay so how does it figure out
the next word well it's seen a trillion

4048
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:25,800
the next word well it's seen a trillion
 

4049
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,890
the next word well it's seen a trillion
words written on the internet and it's

4050
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:27,900
words written on the internet and it's
 

4051
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,950
words written on the internet and it's
seen the cat sat on the floor the cat

4052
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:30,960
seen the cat sat on the floor the cat
 

4053
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,250
seen the cat sat on the floor the cat
sat on the sofa the cat sat on the

4054
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:34,260
sat on the sofa the cat sat on the
 

4055
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,310
sat on the sofa the cat sat on the
whatever so it's minimal thing to do is

4056
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:37,320
whatever so it's minimal thing to do is
 

4057
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,590
whatever so it's minimal thing to do is
just say let's look at what we saw on

4058
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
just say let's look at what we saw on
 

4059
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,350
just say let's look at what we saw on
the internet we saw you know 10 000

4060
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:42,360
the internet we saw you know 10 000
 

4061
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,470
the internet we saw you know 10 000
examples of the cat sat on the what was

4062
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:45,480
examples of the cat sat on the what was
 

4063
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,750
examples of the cat sat on the what was
the most probable next word let's just

4064
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,760
the most probable next word let's just
 

4065
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,790
the most probable next word let's just
pick that out and say that's the next

4066
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:49,800
pick that out and say that's the next
 

4067
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,250
pick that out and say that's the next
word and that's that's kind of what it

4068
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:52,260
word and that's that's kind of what it
 

4069
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,830
word and that's that's kind of what it
is at some level is trying to do now the

4070
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:54,840
is at some level is trying to do now the
 

4071
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,990
is at some level is trying to do now the
problem is there isn't enough text on

4072
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:57,000
problem is there isn't enough text on
 

4073
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,990
problem is there isn't enough text on
the internet to uh for if you have a

4074
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,000
the internet to uh for if you have a
 

4075
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,810
the internet to uh for if you have a
reasonable length of prompt to that that

4076
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:02,820
reasonable length of prompt to that that
 

4077
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:04,550
reasonable length of prompt to that that
Pro that specific prompt will never have

4078
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
Pro that specific prompt will never have
 

4079
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,070
Pro that specific prompt will never have
occurred on the internet and as you as

4080
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:07,080
occurred on the internet and as you as
 

4081
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,649
occurred on the internet and as you as
you kind of go further there just won't

4082
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:09,659
you kind of go further there just won't
 

4083
01:16:09,659 --> 01:16:11,630
you kind of go further there just won't
be a place where you could have trained

4084
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:11,640
be a place where you could have trained
 

4085
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,610
be a place where you could have trained
you know where you could just worked out

4086
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:13,620
you know where you could just worked out
 

4087
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:14,990
you know where you could just worked out
probabilities from what was already

4088
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:15,000
probabilities from what was already
 

4089
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,310
probabilities from what was already
there

4090
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320
there
 

4091
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,810
there
um you know like if you say two plus two

4092
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:17,820
um you know like if you say two plus two
 

4093
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,430
um you know like if you say two plus two
there'll be a zillion examples of two

4094
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:19,440
there'll be a zillion examples of two
 

4095
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,070
there'll be a zillion examples of two
plus two equaling four and a very small

4096
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,080
plus two equaling four and a very small
 

4097
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,450
plus two equaling four and a very small
number of examples of two plus two

4098
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:23,460
number of examples of two plus two
 

4099
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,850
number of examples of two plus two
equals five and so on and you can pretty

4100
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:25,860
equals five and so on and you can pretty
 

4101
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,709
equals five and so on and you can pretty
much know what's going to happen so then

4102
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:27,719
much know what's going to happen so then
 

4103
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:30,410
much know what's going to happen so then
the question is well if you can't just

4104
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:30,420
the question is well if you can't just
 

4105
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,510
the question is well if you can't just
work out from examples what's going to

4106
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:32,520
work out from examples what's going to
 

4107
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,729
work out from examples what's going to
happen just no probabilistic for you for

4108
01:16:34,729 --> 01:16:34,739
happen just no probabilistic for you for
 

4109
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:36,050
happen just no probabilistic for you for
example is what's going to happen you

4110
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:36,060
example is what's going to happen you
 

4111
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,030
example is what's going to happen you
have to server model and there's kind of

4112
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:38,040
have to server model and there's kind of
 

4113
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,490
have to server model and there's kind of
an idea this idea of making models of

4114
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:40,500
an idea this idea of making models of
 

4115
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,950
an idea this idea of making models of
things is an idea that really I don't

4116
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:42,960
things is an idea that really I don't
 

4117
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,630
things is an idea that really I don't
know I think Galileo probably was one of

4118
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:44,640
know I think Galileo probably was one of
 

4119
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,370
know I think Galileo probably was one of
the first people who sort of worked this

4120
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:46,380
the first people who sort of worked this
 

4121
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,709
the first people who sort of worked this
out and it's kind of like like you know

4122
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
out and it's kind of like like you know
 

4123
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,990
out and it's kind of like like you know
I think I gave an example of that the

4124
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:51,000
I think I gave an example of that the
 

4125
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,689
I think I gave an example of that the
book I wrote about about Chachi BT where

4126
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:53,699
book I wrote about about Chachi BT where
 

4127
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:55,669
book I wrote about about Chachi BT where
it's kind of like you know Galileo was

4128
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:55,679
it's kind of like you know Galileo was
 

4129
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,770
it's kind of like you know Galileo was
dropping cannonballs off the off the

4130
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:57,780
dropping cannonballs off the off the
 

4131
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,570
dropping cannonballs off the off the
different floors of the of the Tower of

4132
01:16:59,570 --> 01:16:59,580
different floors of the of the Tower of
 

4133
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,850
different floors of the of the Tower of
Pisa and it's like okay you drop a

4134
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:01,860
Pisa and it's like okay you drop a
 

4135
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,410
Pisa and it's like okay you drop a
cannonball off this floor you drop a

4136
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:03,420
cannonball off this floor you drop a
 

4137
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,870
cannonball off this floor you drop a
cannonball off this floor you miss floor

4138
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:05,880
cannonball off this floor you miss floor
 

4139
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,370
cannonball off this floor you miss floor
five or something for whatever reason

4140
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:07,380
five or something for whatever reason
 

4141
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,169
five or something for whatever reason
but you know the time it took the

4142
01:17:09,169 --> 01:17:09,179
but you know the time it took the
 

4143
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:10,790
but you know the time it took the
Cannonball to fall to the ground from

4144
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:10,800
Cannonball to fall to the ground from
 

4145
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,250
Cannonball to fall to the ground from
floors one two three four six seven

4146
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:13,260
floors one two three four six seven
 

4147
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,830
floors one two three four six seven
eight for example then the question is

4148
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:15,840
eight for example then the question is
 

4149
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,410
eight for example then the question is
can you work out can you can you make a

4150
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:18,420
can you work out can you can you make a
 

4151
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,510
can you work out can you can you make a
model which figures out how long does it

4152
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:20,520
model which figures out how long does it
 

4153
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,430
model which figures out how long does it
take the ball how long would it take the

4154
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:22,440
take the ball how long would it take the
 

4155
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,750
take the ball how long would it take the
ball to fall to the ground from the

4156
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:23,760
ball to fall to the ground from the
 

4157
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,149
ball to fall to the ground from the
floor you didn't explicitly measure and

4158
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:26,159
floor you didn't explicitly measure and
 

4159
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,490
floor you didn't explicitly measure and
the thing Galileo realized is that you

4160
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:28,500
the thing Galileo realized is that you
 

4161
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,590
the thing Galileo realized is that you
can use math you can use mathematical

4162
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:30,600
can use math you can use mathematical
 

4163
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,310
can use math you can use mathematical
formulas to make a model for how long it

4164
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,320
formulas to make a model for how long it
 

4165
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,050
formulas to make a model for how long it
will take the ball to fall so now the

4166
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:36,060
will take the ball to fall so now the
 

4167
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,149
will take the ball to fall so now the
quest question is well okay you want to

4168
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:38,159
quest question is well okay you want to
 

4169
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,550
quest question is well okay you want to
make a model for for example something

4170
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
make a model for for example something
 

4171
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,830
make a model for for example something
much more elaborate like you've got this

4172
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:42,840
much more elaborate like you've got this
 

4173
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,470
much more elaborate like you've got this
arrangement of pixels and is this

4174
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:45,480
arrangement of pixels and is this
 

4175
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,689
arrangement of pixels and is this
arrangement of pixels an A or a B does

4176
01:17:47,689 --> 01:17:47,699
arrangement of pixels an A or a B does
 

4177
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:48,770
arrangement of pixels an A or a B does
it correspond to something we'd

4178
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:48,780
it correspond to something we'd
 

4179
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,229
it correspond to something we'd
recognize as an A or B and you can make

4180
01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:51,239
recognize as an A or B and you can make
 

4181
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:53,450
recognize as an A or B and you can make
a similar kind you know each pixel is

4182
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:53,460
a similar kind you know each pixel is
 

4183
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,729
a similar kind you know each pixel is
like a parameter in some equation and

4184
01:17:55,729 --> 01:17:55,739
like a parameter in some equation and
 

4185
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:57,350
like a parameter in some equation and
you could write down this giant equation

4186
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:57,360
you could write down this giant equation
 

4187
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,810
you could write down this giant equation
where the answer is either you know a or

4188
01:17:59,810 --> 01:17:59,820
where the answer is either you know a or
 

4189
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,970
where the answer is either you know a or
you know one or two A or B

4190
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:01,980
you know one or two A or B
 

4191
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,070
you know one or two A or B

4245
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,729
model that's neural net model makes sort
of distinctions and generalizes things

4246
01:19:07,729 --> 01:19:07,739
of distinctions and generalizes things

in sort of the same way that we humans

4249
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:12,530
in sort of the same way that we humans
do it and that's why when you say you

01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:12,540
do it and that's why when you say you
 

4251

01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,110

sentence does not occur on the internet
 

4263
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,010

and so it has to make a model that

4264
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:31,020
and so it has to make a model that
 

4265
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,290
and so it has to make a model that
concludes what you know it has to kind

01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:33,300
concludes what you know it has to kind

concludes what you know it has to kind
of generalize from what it's from the

4269
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,689

actual examples that it's seen and so so

4270
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:38,699
actual examples that it's seen and so so
 

4271
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:40,370
actual examples that it's seen and so so
you know that that's the fact is that

01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:40,380
you know that that's the fact is that
 

4273

you know that that's the fact is that

and it's it's saying I'm going to look
 

4369
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:30,169
and it's it's saying I'm going to look
at the the neurons above me it's kind of

4370
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:30,179
at the the neurons above me it's kind of
 

4371
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:32,149
at the the neurons above me it's kind of
a series of layers it's going to look at

4372
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:32,159
a series of layers it's going to look at
 

4373
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,130
a series of layers it's going to look at
the neurons above me and it's going to

4374
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:34,140
the neurons above me and it's going to
 

4375
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,450
the neurons above me and it's going to
say what are the values of all those

4376
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:35,460
say what are the values of all those
 

4377
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,490
say what are the values of all those
neurons then it's going to add those up

4378
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:37,500
neurons then it's going to add those up
 

4379
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,950
neurons then it's going to add those up
and multiply them by these weights and

4380
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:39,960
and multiply them by these weights and
 

4381
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,510
and multiply them by these weights and
then it's going to apply some function

4382
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:41,520
then it's going to apply some function
 

4383
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,550
then it's going to apply some function
that says if it's bigger than zero or

4384
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:43,560
that says if it's bigger than zero or
 

4385
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,410
that says if it's bigger than zero or
something then make it one or an

01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:45,420
something then make it one or an
 

4387
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:47,149
something then make it one or an
otherwise make it zero or some slightly

issue is you know this architecture of a

4416
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:23,699
issue is you know this architecture of a
 

4417
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:25,430
issue is you know this architecture of a
neural net where where what's happening

4418
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:25,440
neural net where where what's happening
 

4419
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,010
neural net where where what's happening
is you know you've you've you've turned

4420
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:28,020
is you know you've you've you've turned
 

4421
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,990
is you know you've you've you've turned
so neural Nets always just deal with

4422
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
so neural Nets always just deal with
 

4423
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,750
so neural Nets always just deal with
numbers and so you know you've turned

4424
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:32,760
numbers and so you know you've turned
 

4425
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,189
numbers and so you know you've turned
the sentence that you started with into

4426
01:22:34,189 --> 01:22:34,199
the sentence that you started with into
 

4427
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,750
the sentence that you started with into
a bunch of numbers like let's say by

4428
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
a bunch of numbers like let's say by
 

4429
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,209
a bunch of numbers like let's say by
mapping you know each word of the 50 000

4430
01:22:38,209 --> 01:22:38,219
mapping you know each word of the 50 000
 

4431
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,770
mapping you know each word of the 50 000
words in English you just map each word

4432
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:39,780
words in English you just map each word
 

4433
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,570
words in English you just map each word
or each part of a word into some number

4434
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:41,580
or each part of a word into some number
 

4435
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:44,209
or each part of a word into some number
they feed all those numbers in

4436
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:44,219
they feed all those numbers in
 

4437
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:46,790
they feed all those numbers in
and then the thing is going to and then

4438
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:46,800
and then the thing is going to and then
 

4439
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,010
and then the thing is going to and then
those numbers just go into the values of

4440
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:49,020
those numbers just go into the values of
 

4441
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:51,649
those numbers just go into the values of
these neurons and then what happens is

4442
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:51,659
these neurons and then what happens is
 

4443
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:53,930
these neurons and then what happens is
it's just Rippling down going layer to

4444
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:53,940
it's just Rippling down going layer to
 

4445
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:56,090
it's just Rippling down going layer to
layer until it gets to the end I think

4446
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:56,100
layer until it gets to the end I think
 

4447
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,790
layer until it gets to the end I think
chat gpg has about 400 layers and you're

01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:47,400
thing goes Bonkers at a particular you
 

4499
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,189
thing goes Bonkers at a particular you
know sometimes at a particular

4500
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:49,199
know sometimes at a particular
 

4501
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,050
know sometimes at a particular
temperature I think maybe about 1.2 is

4502
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:51,060
temperature I think maybe about 1.2 is
 

4503
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,630
temperature I think maybe about 1.2 is
the thing I was noticing from yesterday

4504
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:53,640
the thing I was noticing from yesterday
 

4505
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,950
the thing I was noticing from yesterday
actually

4506
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:54,960
actually
 

4507
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,510
actually
um that you know usually it's giving

4508
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:56,520
um that you know usually it's giving
 

4509
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,330
um that you know usually it's giving
reasonable answers and then uh at that

4510
01:23:59,330 --> 01:23:59,340
reasonable answers and then uh at that
 

4511
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,729
reasonable answers and then uh at that
temperature with some probability it

4512
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:01,739
temperature with some probability it
 

4513
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:04,790
temperature with some probability it
just starts spouting nonsense

4514
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:04,800
just starts spouting nonsense
 

4515
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,709
just starts spouting nonsense
um and you know nobody knows why this

4516
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:06,719
um and you know nobody knows why this
 

4517
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,189
um and you know nobody knows why this
happens I mean it's it's uh uh and by

4518
01:24:10,189 --> 01:24:10,199
happens I mean it's it's uh uh and by
 

4519
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:11,570
happens I mean it's it's uh uh and by
the way I mean the thing to understand

4520
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:11,580
the way I mean the thing to understand
 

4521
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,510
the way I mean the thing to understand
is it's putting down one word at a time

4522
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:13,520
is it's putting down one word at a time
 

4523
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,030
is it's putting down one word at a time
but the outer loop of the fact that it

4524
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
but the outer loop of the fact that it
 

4525
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,950
but the outer loop of the fact that it
says okay I put down a word now let's

4526
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:18,960
says okay I put down a word now let's
 

4527
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,510
says okay I put down a word now let's
take the whole thing I wrote so far

4528
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:20,520
take the whole thing I wrote so far
 

4529
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,610
take the whole thing I wrote so far
let's feed that back in let's put down

4530
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:22,620
let's feed that back in let's put down
 

4531
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:25,070
let's feed that back in let's put down
another word that outer loop which seems

4532
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:25,080
another word that outer loop which seems
 

4533
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,110
another word that outer loop which seems
almost trivial is really important to

4534
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:27,120
almost trivial is really important to
 

4535
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,209
almost trivial is really important to
the operation of the thing and and for

4536
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:29,219
the operation of the thing and and for
 

4537
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:30,890
the operation of the thing and and for
example one of the things that is kind

4538
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:30,900
example one of the things that is kind
 

4539
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,370
example one of the things that is kind
of funky is it'll give an answer and you

4540
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:34,380
of funky is it'll give an answer and you
 

4541
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,770
of funky is it'll give an answer and you
say to it is that answer correct and

4542
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:36,780
say to it is that answer correct and
 

4543
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,450
say to it is that answer correct and
it'll say no

4544
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:38,460
it'll say no
 

4545
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,850
it'll say no
and why is that happening right right

4546
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:40,860
and why is that happening right right
 

4547
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,169
and why is that happening right right
why couldn't it do that well the answer

4548
01:24:42,169 --> 01:24:42,179
why couldn't it do that well the answer
 

4549
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:44,510
why couldn't it do that well the answer
is because it is going one word at a

4550
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:44,520
is because it is going one word at a
 

4551
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,390
is because it is going one word at a
time sort of forwards and it didn't you

4552
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:47,400
time sort of forwards and it didn't you
 

4553
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,729
time sort of forwards and it didn't you
know it it came along with some sort of

4554
01:24:49,729 --> 01:24:49,739
know it it came along with some sort of
 

4555
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:51,830
know it it came along with some sort of
chain of of thought in a sense and it

4556
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:51,840
chain of of thought in a sense and it
 

4557
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,649
chain of of thought in a sense and it
came up with completely the wrong answer

4558
01:24:53,649 --> 01:24:53,659
came up with completely the wrong answer
 

4559
01:24:53,659 --> 01:24:56,270
came up with completely the wrong answer
but as soon as you feed it the whole

4560
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:56,280
but as soon as you feed it the whole
 

4561
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,450
but as soon as you feed it the whole
thing that it came up with it

4562
01:24:59,450 --> 01:24:59,460
thing that it came up with it
 

4563
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,070
thing that it came up with it
immediately knows that that isn't right

4564
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:01,080
immediately knows that that isn't right
 

4565
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,530
immediately knows that that isn't right
it immediately can recognize that was a

4566
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:03,540
it immediately can recognize that was a
 

4567
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,149
it immediately can recognize that was a
you know a bad syllogism or something

4568
01:25:05,149 --> 01:25:05,159
you know a bad syllogism or something
 

4569
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:07,550
you know a bad syllogism or something
and uh can see what happened even though

4570
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:07,560
and uh can see what happened even though
 

4571
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,470
and uh can see what happened even though
as it was being led down this Garden

Path so to speak it didn't it came to

4574
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:11,820
Path so to speak it didn't it came to
 

4575
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,850
Path so to speak it didn't it came to
the wrong place but it's fascinating

4576
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:13,860
the wrong place but it's fascinating
 

4577
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:16,610
the wrong place but it's fascinating
that this kind of procedure converges to

4578
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:16,620
that this kind of procedure converges to
 

4579
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:19,550
that this kind of procedure converges to
something that forms a pretty good

4580
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:19,560
something that forms a pretty good

something that forms a pretty good
compressed representation of language on

01:25:23,149 --> 01:25:23,159
compressed representation of language on
 

4583
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:26,090
compressed representation of language on
the internet yeah that's quite right

4584
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:26,100
the internet yeah that's quite right
 

4585
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,610
the internet yeah that's quite right
right no I'm not sure what to make of it

4586
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:28,620
right no I'm not sure what to make of it
 

4587
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,130
right no I'm not sure what to make of it
well look I think you know there are

4588
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:31,140
well look I think you know there are
 

4589
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,870
well look I think you know there are
many things we don't understand okay so

4590
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:32,880
many things we don't understand okay so
 

4591
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,050
many things we don't understand okay so
for example you know 175 billion weights

4592
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:36,060
for example you know 175 billion weights
 

4593
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,510
for example you know 175 billion weights
it's maybe about a trillion bytes of

4594
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:38,520
it's maybe about a trillion bytes of
 

4595
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:41,149
it's maybe about a trillion bytes of
information which is very comparable to

4596
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:41,159
information which is very comparable to
 

4597
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:43,790
information which is very comparable to
the training set that was used

4598
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:43,800
the training set that was used
 

4599
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:47,390
the training set that was used
um and uh you know why that why kind of

4600
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:47,400
um and uh you know why that why kind of
 

4601
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,310
um and uh you know why that why kind of
it sort of stands to some kind of reason

4602
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:49,320
it sort of stands to some kind of reason
 

4603
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,470
it sort of stands to some kind of reason
that the number of Weights in the neural

4604
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:51,480
that the number of Weights in the neural
 

4605
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,790
that the number of Weights in the neural
net I don't know where I can't really

4606
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:52,800

4607
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,070

argue that I can't really give you a

01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:55,080
argue that I can't really give you a
 

4609
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,530
argue that I can't really give you a
good uh you know in a sense the very

4610
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:57,540
good uh you know in a sense the very
 

4611
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:00,470
good uh you know in a sense the very
fact that you know the insofar as there

4612
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:00,480
fact that you know the insofar as there
 

4613
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,910
fact that you know the insofar as there
are definite rules of what's going on

4614
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:01,920
are definite rules of what's going on
 

4615
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,550
are definite rules of what's going on
you might expect that eventually we'll

4616
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
you might expect that eventually we'll
 

4617
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,890
you might expect that eventually we'll
have a much smaller neural net that will

4618
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:06,900
have a much smaller neural net that will
 

4619
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,110
have a much smaller neural net that will
successfully capture what's happening I

4620
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,120
successfully capture what's happening I
 

4621
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,790
successfully capture what's happening I
I don't think the best way to do it is

4622
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:10,800
I don't think the best way to do it is
 

4623
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,709
I don't think the best way to do it is
probably a neural net I think a neuron

4624
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719
probably a neural net I think a neuron
 

4625
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,270
probably a neural net I think a neuron
that is what you do when you don't know

4626
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:14,280
that is what you do when you don't know
 

4627
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,490
that is what you do when you don't know
any other way to structure the thing and

4628
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:16,500
any other way to structure the thing and
 

4629
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:17,870
any other way to structure the thing and
it's a very good thing to do if you

4630
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:17,880
it's a very good thing to do if you
 

4631
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,010
it's a very good thing to do if you
don't know any other way to structure

4632
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:19,020
don't know any other way to structure
 

4633
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,930
don't know any other way to structure
the thing and for the last 2000 years we

4634
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:20,940
the thing and for the last 2000 years we
 

4635
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,430
the thing and for the last 2000 years we
haven't known any other way to structure

4636
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:22,440
haven't known any other way to structure
 

4637
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,229
haven't known any other way to structure
it so this is a pretty good way to start

4638
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
it so this is a pretty good way to start
 

4639
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,450
it so this is a pretty good way to start
but that doesn't mean you can't find

4640
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:26,460
but that doesn't mean you can't find
 

4641
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:28,790
but that doesn't mean you can't find
sort of in a sense more symbolic rules

4642
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:28,800
sort of in a sense more symbolic rules
 

4643
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,430
sort of in a sense more symbolic rules
for what's going on that you know much

4644
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:31,440
for what's going on that you know much
 

4645
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,070
for what's going on that you know much
of which will then be you can kind of

4646
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,080
of which will then be you can kind of
 

4647
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,290
of which will then be you can kind of
get rid of much of the structure of the

4648
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:36,300
get rid of much of the structure of the
 

4649
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,330
get rid of much of the structure of the
neural Nets and replace it by things

4650
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:38,340
neural Nets and replace it by things
 

4651
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:40,669
neural Nets and replace it by things
which are sort of pure steps of

4652
01:26:40,669 --> 01:26:40,679
which are sort of pure steps of
 

4653
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:42,830
which are sort of pure steps of
computation so to speak sort of with

4654
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:42,840
computation so to speak sort of with
 

4655
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,229
computation so to speak sort of with
neural net stuff around the edges and

4656
01:26:45,229 --> 01:26:45,239
neural net stuff around the edges and
 

4657
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:46,970
neural net stuff around the edges and
that becomes just a you know just a much

4658
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:46,980
that becomes just a you know just a much
 

4659
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,709
that becomes just a you know just a much
simpler way to do it so then you're on

4660
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:48,719
simpler way to do it so then you're on
 

4661
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:51,110
simpler way to do it so then you're on
that you hope will reveal

4662
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:51,120
that you hope will reveal
 

4663
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:55,310
that you hope will reveal
to us good symbolic rules that make the

4664
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:55,320
to us good symbolic rules that make the
 

4665
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,930
to us good symbolic rules that make the
need then you're on that less and less

4666
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:56,940
need then you're on that less and less
 

4667
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:59,209
need then you're on that less and less
and less right and and there will still

4668
01:26:59,209 --> 01:26:59,219
and less right and and there will still
 

4669
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:01,370
and less right and and there will still
be some stuff that's kind of fuzzy just

4670
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:01,380
be some stuff that's kind of fuzzy just
 

4671
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,169
be some stuff that's kind of fuzzy just
like you know that they're things that

4672
01:27:03,169 --> 01:27:03,179
like you know that they're things that
 

4673
01:27:03,179 --> 01:27:04,970
like you know that they're things that
it's like this question of what can we

4674
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:04,980
it's like this question of what can we
 

4675
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:07,010
it's like this question of what can we
formalize what can we turn into

4676
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:07,020
formalize what can we turn into
 

4677
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,590
formalize what can we turn into
computational language what is just sort

4678
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:09,600
computational language what is just sort
 

4679
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,090
computational language what is just sort
of oh it happens that way just because

4680
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:11,100
of oh it happens that way just because
 

4681
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,270
of oh it happens that way just because
brains are set up that way

4682
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:14,280
brains are set up that way
 

4683
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,910
brains are set up that way
what do you think are the limitations of

4684
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:16,920
what do you think are the limitations of
 

4685
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,490
what do you think are the limitations of
uh large language models just to make it

4686
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:19,500
uh large language models just to make it
 

4687
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,590
uh large language models just to make it
explicit well I mean I think that deep

4688
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:21,600
explicit well I mean I think that deep
 

4689
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,209
explicit well I mean I think that deep
computation is not what large language

4690
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:23,219
computation is not what large language
 

4691
01:27:23,219 --> 01:27:25,250
computation is not what large language
models do I mean that's just it's a

4692
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:25,260
models do I mean that's just it's a
 

4693
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:27,050
models do I mean that's just it's a
different kind of thing you know the

4694
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:27,060
different kind of thing you know the
 

4695
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,330
different kind of thing you know the
outer loop of a large language model if

4696
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:29,340
outer loop of a large language model if
 

4697
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:31,129
outer loop of a large language model if
if you're trying to do many steps in a

4698
01:27:31,129 --> 01:27:31,139
if you're trying to do many steps in a
 

4699
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:33,229
if you're trying to do many steps in a
computation the only way you get to do

4700
01:27:33,229 --> 01:27:33,239
computation the only way you get to do
 

4701
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:35,750
computation the only way you get to do
that right now is by spooling out you

4702
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:35,760
that right now is by spooling out you
 

4703
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,310
that right now is by spooling out you
know all that the whole Chain of Thought

4704
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:37,320
know all that the whole Chain of Thought
 

4705
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,370
know all that the whole Chain of Thought
as a bunch of words basically and you

4706
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:40,380
as a bunch of words basically and you
 

4707
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,810
as a bunch of words basically and you
know you can make a turing machine out

4708
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:41,820
know you can make a turing machine out
 

4709
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,850
know you can make a turing machine out
of that if you want to I just was make

4710
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:43,860
of that if you want to I just was make
 

4711
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,770
of that if you want to I just was make
doing that construction you know in

4712
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:45,780
doing that construction you know in
 

4713
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,689
doing that construction you know in
principle you can make an arbitrary

4714
01:27:47,689 --> 01:27:47,699
principle you can make an arbitrary
 

4715
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:49,669
principle you can make an arbitrary
computation by just spooling out the

4716
01:27:49,669 --> 01:27:49,679
computation by just spooling out the
 

4717
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:52,129
computation by just spooling out the
words but it's an it's a bizarre and

4718
01:27:52,129 --> 01:27:52,139
words but it's an it's a bizarre and
 

4719
01:27:52,139 --> 01:27:54,290
words but it's an it's a bizarre and
inefficient way to do it

4720
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:54,300
inefficient way to do it
 

4721
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,890
inefficient way to do it
um but it's something where uh the you

4722
01:27:57,890 --> 01:27:57,900
um but it's something where uh the you
 

4723
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,290
um but it's something where uh the you
know I I think that's you know sort of

4724
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:00,300
know I I think that's you know sort of
 

4725
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,649
know I I think that's you know sort of
the the Deep computation is it's it's

4726
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:03,659
the the Deep computation is it's it's
 

4727
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:07,270
the the Deep computation is it's it's
really what a humans can do quickly

4728
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:07,280
really what a humans can do quickly
 

4729
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,590
really what a humans can do quickly
large language models will probably be

4730
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:09,600
large language models will probably be
 

4731
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,750
large language models will probably be
able to do well anything that you can do

4732
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
able to do well anything that you can do
 

4733
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,129
able to do well anything that you can do
kind of off the top of your head type

4734
01:28:13,129 --> 01:28:13,139
kind of off the top of your head type
 

4735
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:16,189
kind of off the top of your head type
thing is is really you know is good for

4736
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:16,199
thing is is really you know is good for
 

4737
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:17,990
thing is is really you know is good for
large language models and the things you

4738
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:18,000
large language models and the things you
 

4739
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,129
large language models and the things you
do off the top of your head you may not

4740
01:28:19,129 --> 01:28:19,139
do off the top of your head you may not
 

4741
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:21,590
do off the top of your head you may not
get them always right but you know

4742
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:21,600
get them always right but you know
 

4743
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,890
get them always right but you know
you'll it it's it's thinking it through

4744
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:24,900
you'll it it's it's thinking it through
 

4745
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,689
you'll it it's it's thinking it through
the same way we do but I wonder if

4746
01:28:26,689 --> 01:28:26,699
the same way we do but I wonder if
 

4747
01:28:26,699 --> 01:28:28,550
the same way we do but I wonder if
there's an automated way to do something

4748
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:28,560
there's an automated way to do something
 

4749
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,169
there's an automated way to do something
that humans do

4750
01:28:30,169 --> 01:28:30,179
that humans do
 

4751
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:33,229
that humans do
well much faster to where it like Loops

4752
01:28:33,229 --> 01:28:33,239
well much faster to where it like Loops
 

4753
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:36,770
well much faster to where it like Loops
so generate arbitrary large code bases

4754
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:36,780
so generate arbitrary large code bases
 

4755
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,530
so generate arbitrary large code bases
of Wolfram language for example

4756
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:39,540
of Wolfram language for example
 

4757
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,270
of Wolfram language for example
well the question is what does what do

4758
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:41,280
well the question is what does what do
 

4759
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,729
well the question is what does what do
you want the code base to do

4760
01:28:43,729 --> 01:28:43,739
you want the code base to do
 

4761
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:47,450
you want the code base to do
um Escape control and take over the

4762
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:47,460
um Escape control and take over the
 

4763
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,990
um Escape control and take over the
world okay so you know the thing is when

4764
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:51,000
world okay so you know the thing is when
 

4765
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,030
world okay so you know the thing is when
people say you know we want to build

4766
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:53,040
people say you know we want to build
 

4767
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,689
people say you know we want to build
this giant thing right a giant piece of

4768
01:28:56,689 --> 01:28:56,699
this giant thing right a giant piece of
 

4769
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:59,810
this giant thing right a giant piece of
computational language in a sense it's

4770
01:28:59,810 --> 01:28:59,820
computational language in a sense it's
 

4771
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,189
computational language in a sense it's
sort of a failure of computational

4772
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:01,199
sort of a failure of computational
 

4773
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,990
sort of a failure of computational
language if the thing you have to build

4774
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:03,000
language if the thing you have to build
 

4775
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,790
language if the thing you have to build
in other words if we have a description

4776
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
in other words if we have a description
 

4777
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,310
in other words if we have a description
if you have a small description

4778
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:07,320
if you have a small description
 

4779
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,830
if you have a small description
that's the thing that you represent in

4780
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:09,840
that's the thing that you represent in
 

4781
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,470
that's the thing that you represent in
computational language and then the

4782
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:12,480
computational language and then the
 

4783
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,470
computational language and then the
computer can compute from that yes so in

4784
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:15,480
computer can compute from that yes so in
 

4785
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,629
computer can compute from that yes so in
a sense in you know when as soon as

4786
01:29:17,629 --> 01:29:17,639
a sense in you know when as soon as
 

4787
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:20,149
a sense in you know when as soon as
you're giving a description that you

4788
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
you're giving a description that you
 

4789
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:22,250
you're giving a description that you
know if you have to somehow make that

4790
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:22,260
know if you have to somehow make that
 

4791
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:24,530
know if you have to somehow make that
description something you know definite

4792
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:24,540
description something you know definite
 

4793
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:27,950
description something you know definite
something formal and once and and to say

4794
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:27,960
something formal and once and and to say
 

4795
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,810
something formal and once and and to say
to say okay I'm going to give this piece

4796
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:29,820
to say okay I'm going to give this piece
 

4797
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,850
to say okay I'm going to give this piece
of natural language and then it's going

4798
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:31,860
of natural language and then it's going
 

4799
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,250
of natural language and then it's going
to splurt out this giant formal

4800
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:34,260
to splurt out this giant formal
 

4801
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:37,250
to splurt out this giant formal
structure that in a sense that doesn't

4802
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:37,260
structure that in a sense that doesn't
 

4803
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:40,209
structure that in a sense that doesn't
that doesn't really make sense because

4804
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:40,219
that doesn't really make sense because
 

4805
01:29:40,219 --> 01:29:42,470
that doesn't really make sense because
acceptanceofar as that piece of natural

4806
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
acceptanceofar as that piece of natural
 

4807
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,330
acceptanceofar as that piece of natural
language kind of plugs into what we

4808
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:44,340
language kind of plugs into what we
 

4809
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,850
language kind of plugs into what we
socially know so to speak it plugs into

4810
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:46,860
socially know so to speak it plugs into
 

4811
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:49,550
socially know so to speak it plugs into
kind of our Corpus of knowledge then you

4812
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:49,560
kind of our Corpus of knowledge then you
 

4813
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,750
kind of our Corpus of knowledge then you
know that's the way we're capturing a

4814
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:50,760
know that's the way we're capturing a
 

4815
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,890
know that's the way we're capturing a
piece of that Corpus of knowledge but

4816
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:51,900
piece of that Corpus of knowledge but
 

4817
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,629
piece of that Corpus of knowledge but
hopefully we will have done that in

4818
01:29:53,629 --> 01:29:53,639
hopefully we will have done that in
 

4819
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,610
hopefully we will have done that in
computational language how do you make

4820
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:55,620
computational language how do you make
 

4821
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:58,610
computational language how do you make
it do something that's big well you know

4822
01:29:58,610 --> 01:29:58,620
it do something that's big well you know
 

4823
01:29:58,620 --> 01:29:59,930
it do something that's big well you know
you have to have a way to describe what

4824
01:29:59,930 --> 01:29:59,940
you have to have a way to describe what
 

4825
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,490
you have to have a way to describe what
you want okay I can make it more

4826
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:01,500
you want okay I can make it more
 

4827
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,070
you want okay I can make it more
explicit if you want how about I just

4828
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:04,080
explicit if you want how about I just
 

4829
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,990
explicit if you want how about I just
pop into my head

4830
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,000
pop into my head
 

4831
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,669

4836
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:13,199
and figure out how to convince them that
 

4837
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,390
and figure out how to convince them that
they have to

4849
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,229
to take control and be the president I
don't know so that's a very explicit

4850
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:27,239
don't know so that's a very explicit
 

4851
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:29,450
don't know so that's a very explicit

the information what would be the

4864
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:42,600
the information what would be the
 

4865
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:46,010
the information what would be the
biggest fear of this congressman and uh

4866
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:46,020
biggest fear of this congressman and uh
 

4867
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,950
biggest fear of this congressman and uh
in such a way that you can take action

4868
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:48,960
in such a way that you can take action
 

4869
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,350
in such a way that you can take action
on it in the digital space so maybe

4870
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
on it in the digital space so maybe
 

4871
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,629
on it in the digital space so maybe
threaten the destruction reputation or

4872
01:30:53,629 --> 01:30:53,639
threaten the destruction reputation or
 

4873
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:55,850
threaten the destruction reputation or
something like this right if I can

4874
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:55,860
something like this right if I can
 

4875
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,129
something like this right if I can
describe what I want yeah you know to

4876
01:30:58,129 --> 01:30:58,139
describe what I want yeah you know to
 

4877
01:30:58,139 --> 01:30:59,689

what extent can a large language model

4878
01:30:59,689 --> 01:30:59,699
what extent can a large language model
 

4879
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,010
what extent can a large language model
automate that

4880
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:01,020
automate that
 

4881
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:04,250
automate that
with the help uh with the help of the

4882
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:04,260
with the help uh with the help of the
 

4883
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,649
with the help uh with the help of the
concretization of something like Wolfram

4884
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:06,659
concretization of something like Wolfram
 

4885

01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:07,560
language
 

4887
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,890
language
that makes it more

4888
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:09,900
that makes it more
 

4889
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:13,010
that makes it more
um yeah rather a long way I'm also

4890
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:13,020
um yeah rather a long way I'm also
 

4891
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:14,570
um yeah rather a long way I'm also
surprised how quickly I was able to

4892
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:14,580
surprised how quickly I was able to
 

4893
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:17,750
surprised how quickly I was able to
generate yeah yeah right an attack

4894
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
generate yeah yeah right an attack
 

4895
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,050
generate yeah yeah right an attack
that that's the here you know I I swear

4896
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:21,060
that that's the here you know I I swear
 

4897
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,490
that that's the here you know I I swear
I swear I did not think about this

4898
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:22,500
I swear I did not think about this
 

4899
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,770
I swear I did not think about this
before it is funny how quickly which is

4900
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:24,780
before it is funny how quickly which is
 

4901
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,149
before it is funny how quickly which is
a very concerning thing because that

4902
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
a very concerning thing because that
 

4903
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,770
a very concerning thing because that
that probably this idea will probably do

4904
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:27,780
that probably this idea will probably do
 

4905
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,570
that probably this idea will probably do
quite a bit of damage and there might be

4906
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:29,580
quite a bit of damage and there might be
 

4907
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,970
quite a bit of damage and there might be
a very large number of other such ideas

4908
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:31,980
a very large number of other such ideas
 

4909
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,070
a very large number of other such ideas
well I'll give you a much more benign

4910
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:34,080
well I'll give you a much more benign
 

4911
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,229
well I'll give you a much more benign
version of that idea okay you're going

4912
01:31:36,229 --> 01:31:36,239
version of that idea okay you're going
 

4913
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:38,990
version of that idea okay you're going
to make an AI tutoring system and you

4914
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:39,000
to make an AI tutoring system and you
 

4915
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,330
to make an AI tutoring system and you
know that is a that's a benign version

4916
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:41,340
know that is a that's a benign version
 

4917
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,189
know that is a that's a benign version
of what you're saying is

4918
01:31:43,189 --> 01:31:43,199
of what you're saying is
 

4919
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,470
of what you're saying is
um I want this person to understand this

4920
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:45,480
um I want this person to understand this
 

4921
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,450
um I want this person to understand this
point yes you know you're essentially

4922
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:47,460
point yes you know you're essentially
 

4923
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,310
point yes you know you're essentially
doing machine learning where the where

4924
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:49,320
doing machine learning where the where
 

4925
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,229
doing machine learning where the where
the where the you know the the loss

4926
01:31:51,229 --> 01:31:51,239
the where the you know the the loss
 

4927
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:52,550
the where the you know the the loss
function the the thing you're trying to

4928
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:52,560
function the the thing you're trying to
 

4929
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,890
function the the thing you're trying to
get to is get the human to understand

4930
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:54,900
get to is get the human to understand
 

4931
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,410
get to is get the human to understand
this point and and when you do a test on

4932
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:57,420
this point and and when you do a test on
 

4933
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,330
this point and and when you do a test on
the human that they yes they correctly

4934
01:31:59,330 --> 01:31:59,340
the human that they yes they correctly
 

4935
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:02,030
the human that they yes they correctly
understand how this or that works and I

4936
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:02,040
understand how this or that works and I
 

4937
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:05,810
understand how this or that works and I
I am confident that uh you know sort of

4938
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:05,820
I am confident that uh you know sort of
 

4939
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,669
I am confident that uh you know sort of
the large language model type technology

4940
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:07,679
the large language model type technology
 

4941
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:10,010
the large language model type technology
combined with computational language is

4942
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:10,020
combined with computational language is
 

4943
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:11,810
combined with computational language is
going to be able to do pretty pretty

4944
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:11,820
going to be able to do pretty pretty
 

4945
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:15,770
going to be able to do pretty pretty
well at teaching us humans things and

4946
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:15,780
well at teaching us humans things and
 

4947
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,910
well at teaching us humans things and
it's going to be an interesting

4948
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:16,920
it's going to be an interesting
 

4949
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,189
it's going to be an interesting
phenomenon because you know sort of

4950
01:32:19,189 --> 01:32:19,199
phenomenon because you know sort of
 

4951
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,250
phenomenon because you know sort of
individualized teaching is is a thing

4952
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:22,260
individualized teaching is is a thing
 

4953
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,410
individualized teaching is is a thing
that has been kind of a you know a goal

4954
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:24,420
that has been kind of a you know a goal
 

4955
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:25,970
that has been kind of a you know a goal
for a long time I think we're going to

4956
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:25,980
for a long time I think we're going to
 

4957
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:28,310
for a long time I think we're going to
get that I think more you know that it

4958
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:28,320
get that I think more you know that it
 

4959
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,590
get that I think more you know that it
has many consequences for you know like

4960
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:30,600
has many consequences for you know like
 

4961
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,070
has many consequences for you know like
like just you know if you know me as an

4962
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
like just you know if you know me as an
 

4963
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,610
like just you know if you know me as an
if you the AI know me tell me I'm about

4964
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:37,620
if you the AI know me tell me I'm about
 

4965
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:39,649
if you the AI know me tell me I'm about
to do this thing what is the what are

4966
01:32:39,649 --> 01:32:39,659
to do this thing what is the what are
 

4967
01:32:39,659 --> 01:32:42,129
to do this thing what is the what are
the three things I need to know you know

4968
01:32:42,129 --> 01:32:42,139
the three things I need to know you know
 

4969
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:44,990
the three things I need to know you know
given what I already know you know

4970
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:45,000
given what I already know you know
 

4971
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,970
given what I already know you know
what's the what's let's say I'm I'm

4972
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:46,980
what's the what's let's say I'm I'm
 

4973
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:49,189
what's the what's let's say I'm I'm
looking at some paper or something right

4974
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:49,199
looking at some paper or something right
 

4975
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:52,669
looking at some paper or something right
it's it's like there's a version of this

4976
01:32:52,669 --> 01:32:52,679
it's it's like there's a version of this
 

4977
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:54,950
it's it's like there's a version of this
summary of that paper that is optimized

4978
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:54,960
summary of that paper that is optimized
 

4979
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,890
summary of that paper that is optimized
for me so to speak and where it really

4980
01:32:57,890 --> 01:32:57,900
for me so to speak and where it really
 

4981
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,270
for me so to speak and where it really
is and I think that's really going to

4982
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,280
is and I think that's really going to
 

4983
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,490
is and I think that's really going to
work it could understand the the major

4984
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:01,500
work it could understand the the major
 

4985
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,010
work it could understand the the major
gaps in your knowledge yes that if field

4986
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:04,020
gaps in your knowledge yes that if field
 

4987
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,890
gaps in your knowledge yes that if field
would actually give you uh

4988
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:06,900
would actually give you uh
 

4989
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,810
would actually give you uh
a deeper understanding of the topic here

4990
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:08,820
a deeper understanding of the topic here
 

4991
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,570
a deeper understanding of the topic here
right and that's a you know that's an

4992
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:11,580
right and that's a you know that's an
 

4993
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:13,010
right and that's a you know that's an
important thing because it really

4994
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:13,020
important thing because it really
 

4995
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,870
important thing because it really
changes actually I think you know when

4996
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:14,880
changes actually I think you know when
 

4997
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,490
changes actually I think you know when
when you think about education and so on

4998
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:16,500
when you think about education and so on
 

4999
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,890
when you think about education and so on
it really changes kind of what's worth

5000
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:18,900
it really changes kind of what's worth
 

5001
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,570
it really changes kind of what's worth
doing what's not worth doing and so on

5002
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:20,580
doing what's not worth doing and so on
 

5003
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:23,390
doing what's not worth doing and so on
it makes you know I know in my life I've

5004
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:23,400
it makes you know I know in my life I've
 

5005
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,729
it makes you know I know in my life I've
learned lots of different fields and you

5006
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:25,739
learned lots of different fields and you
 

5007
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:27,590
learned lots of different fields and you
know so I yeah I don't know I have every

5008
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:27,600
know so I yeah I don't know I have every
 

5009
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,090
know so I yeah I don't know I have every
time I'm always think that this is the

5010
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:29,100
time I'm always think that this is the
 

5011
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,590
time I'm always think that this is the
one that's going to I'm not going to be

5012
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:30,600
one that's going to I'm not going to be
 

5013
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,050
one that's going to I'm not going to be
able to learn yeah but turns out sort of

5014
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:33,060
able to learn yeah but turns out sort of
 

5015
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,490
able to learn yeah but turns out sort of
there are sort of meta methods for

5016
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:34,500
there are sort of meta methods for
 

5017
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,709
there are sort of meta methods for
learning these things in the end

5018
01:33:36,709 --> 01:33:36,719
learning these things in the end
 

5019
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:39,110
learning these things in the end
um and you know I think this this idea

5020
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,120
um and you know I think this this idea
 

5021
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,290
um and you know I think this this idea
that it becomes easier to you know it

5022
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:42,300
that it becomes easier to you know it
 

5023
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,810
that it becomes easier to you know it
becomes easier to be fed knowledge so to

5024
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:44,820
becomes easier to be fed knowledge so to
 

5025
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:47,330
becomes easier to be fed knowledge so to
speak and it becomes you know if you

5026
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:47,340
speak and it becomes you know if you
 

5027
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,550
speak and it becomes you know if you
need to know this particular thing you

5028
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:49,560
need to know this particular thing you
 

5029
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:53,030
need to know this particular thing you
can you know you can get taught it in an

5030
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,040
can you know you can get taught it in an
 

5031
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,189
can you know you can get taught it in an
efficient way it's something I think is

5032
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:55,199
efficient way it's something I think is
 

5033
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,169
efficient way it's something I think is
sort of a an interesting feature and I

5034
01:33:57,169 --> 01:33:57,179
sort of a an interesting feature and I
 

5035
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:59,570
sort of a an interesting feature and I
think it makes the um

5036
01:33:59,570 --> 01:33:59,580
think it makes the um
 

5037
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:03,110
think it makes the um
you know things like the value of of big

5038
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:03,120
you know things like the value of of big
 

5039
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,689
you know things like the value of of big
towers of specialized knowledge become

5040
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:05,699
towers of specialized knowledge become
 

5041
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:08,390
towers of specialized knowledge become
less significant compared to the kind of

5042
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:08,400
less significant compared to the kind of
 

5043
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,689
less significant compared to the kind of
meta knowledge of sort of understanding

5044
01:34:11,689 --> 01:34:11,699
meta knowledge of sort of understanding
 

5045
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:13,790
meta knowledge of sort of understanding
kind of the the big picture and being

5046
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:13,800
kind of the the big picture and being
 

5047
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,649
kind of the the big picture and being
able to connect things together I think

5048
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:15,659
able to connect things together I think
 

5049
01:34:15,659 --> 01:34:16,970
able to connect things together I think
that you know there's been this huge

5050
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:16,980
that you know there's been this huge
 

5051
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,649
that you know there's been this huge
trend of let's be more and more

5052
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:18,659
trend of let's be more and more
 

5053
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:20,930
trend of let's be more and more
specialized because we have to you know

5054
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:20,940
specialized because we have to you know
 

5055
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:23,030
specialized because we have to you know
we we have to sort of Ascend these

5056
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,040
we we have to sort of Ascend these
 

5057
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,550
we we have to sort of Ascend these
towers of knowledge but by the time you

5058
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:25,560
towers of knowledge but by the time you
 

5059
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,830
towers of knowledge but by the time you
can get you know more automation of

5060
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:27,840
can get you know more automation of
 

5061
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,290
can get you know more automation of
being able to get to that place on the

5062
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:30,300
being able to get to that place on the
 

5063
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,390
being able to get to that place on the
tower without having to go through all

5064
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:32,400
tower without having to go through all
 

5065
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,370
tower without having to go through all
those steps I think it sort of changes

5066
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:34,380
those steps I think it sort of changes
 

5067
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:35,990
those steps I think it sort of changes
that picture interesting so your

5068
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:36,000
that picture interesting so your
 

5069
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,290
that picture interesting so your
intuition is that in terms of the the

5070
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:39,300
intuition is that in terms of the the
 

5071
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,450
intuition is that in terms of the the
the collective intelligence of the

5072
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:41,460
the collective intelligence of the
 

5073
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,070
the collective intelligence of the
species in the individual minds they

5074
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:43,080
species in the individual minds they
 

5075
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,649
species in the individual minds they
make up that Collective

5076
01:34:45,649 --> 01:34:45,659
make up that Collective
 

5077
01:34:45,659 --> 01:34:48,530
make up that Collective
there'll be more there will Trend

5078
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:48,540
there'll be more there will Trend
 

5079
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:52,430
there'll be more there will Trend
towards being generalists and being kind

5080
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:52,440
towards being generalists and being kind
 

5081
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,649
towards being generalists and being kind
of philosophers that's what I think I

5082
01:34:54,649 --> 01:34:54,659
of philosophers that's what I think I
 

5083
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:55,790
of philosophers that's what I think I
think that's where the humans are going

5084
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:55,800
think that's where the humans are going
 

5085
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,790
think that's where the humans are going
to be useful I think that a lot of these

5086
01:34:58,790 --> 01:34:58,800
to be useful I think that a lot of these
 

5087
01:34:58,800 --> 01:34:59,689
to be useful I think that a lot of these
kind of

01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:05,689
the drilling the the the mechanical
working out of things is much more

01:35:05,689 --> 01:35:05,699
working out of things is much more
 

5093
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:08,270
working out of things is much more
automatable it's much more ai ai

well that's a it's interesting yes I

5098
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:14,280
well that's a it's interesting yes I
 

5099
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,010
well that's a it's interesting yes I
mean that you know the the kind of the

5100
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:16,020
mean that you know the the kind of the
 

5101
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,110
mean that you know the the kind of the
specialization this kind of tower of

01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:18,120
specialization this kind of tower of
 

5103
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,810
specialization this kind of tower of

specialization which has been a feature
 

5105
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:22,250
specialization which has been a feature
of you know we've accumulated lots of

5106
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:22,260
of you know we've accumulated lots of
 

5107
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,590
of you know we've accumulated lots of
knowledge in our in our species and and

knowledge in our in our species and and
 

5109
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,189
knowledge in our in our species and and
you know in a sense every time we every

5110
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:28,199
you know in a sense every time we every
 

5111
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:30,470
you know in a sense every time we every
time we have a kind of automation a

01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:30,480
time we have a kind of automation a
 

5113
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,629
time we have a kind of automation a

necessary to know that whole Tower and

5116
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:34,860
necessary to know that whole Tower and
 

5117
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,169
necessary to know that whole Tower and
it becomes something where you can just

5118
01:35:36,169 --> 01:35:36,179
it becomes something where you can just
 

5119
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:37,729
it becomes something where you can just
use a tool to get to the top of that

5120
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:37,739
use a tool to get to the top of that
 

5121
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:41,209
use a tool to get to the top of that
Tower I I think that um uh you know the

5122
01:35:41,209 --> 01:35:41,219
Tower I I think that um uh you know the
 

5123
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:42,590
Tower I I think that um uh you know the
thing that is ultimately you know when

01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:44,760
we think about okay what do the AIS do
 

5127
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,090
we think about okay what do the AIS do

this particular objective okay they can
 

5133
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,050
this particular objective okay they can
maybe figure out a way to achieve that

5134
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:54,060
maybe figure out a way to achieve that

01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:41,209
from on what basis I mean if they say
look here's the terrible thing that

look here's the terrible thing that
 

5173
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:43,129
look here's the terrible thing that
could happen Okay that taking the

01:36:43,129 --> 01:36:43,139
could happen Okay that taking the
 

5175
01:36:43,139 --> 01:36:45,110
could happen Okay that taking the
average of the internet and they're

average of the internet and they're
 

5177
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,570

saying you know from the average of the
 

5179
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,610

okay that could be um
 

5189
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,629
okay that could be um
that could be one objective

that could be one objective
 

5191
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,350
that could be one objective
is maximize

01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:12,470
entertainment the dark version of that

right so I mean this this question of

5202
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:15,540
right so I mean this this question of
 

5203
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:20,030
right so I mean this this question of
what uh you know if you say to the AI

5204
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:20,040
what uh you know if you say to the AI
 

5205
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,790
what uh you know if you say to the AI
um you know uh what does the species

5206
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800
um you know uh what does the species
 

5207
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,530
um you know uh what does the species
want to achieve

5208
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:24,540
want to achieve
 

5209
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,350
want to achieve
yes okay there'll be an answer right

5210
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:27,360
yes okay there'll be an answer right
 

5211
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,450
yes okay there'll be an answer right
that'll be an answer it'll be what the

5212
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:29,460
that'll be an answer it'll be what the
 

5213
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:31,010
that'll be an answer it'll be what the
average of the internet says the species

5214
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:31,020
average of the internet says the species
 

5215
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:34,669
average of the internet says the species
wants to achieve well this this I think

5216
01:37:34,669 --> 01:37:34,679
wants to achieve well this this I think
 

5217
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:36,110
wants to achieve well this this I think
you're using the word average very

5218
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:36,120
you're using the word average very
 

5219
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,050
you're using the word average very
Loosely there right so

5220
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:39,060
Loosely there right so
 

5221
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,750
Loosely there right so
I think you I think the answers will

5222
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:41,760
I think you I think the answers will
 

5223
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,129
I think you I think the answers will
become more and more interesting as

5224
01:37:43,129 --> 01:37:43,139
become more and more interesting as
 

5225
01:37:43,139 --> 01:37:44,930
become more and more interesting as
these language models are trained better

5226
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:44,940
these language models are trained better
 

5227
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:48,290
these language models are trained better
and better no but I mean in the end it's

5228
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:48,300
and better no but I mean in the end it's
 

5229
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,030
and better no but I mean in the end it's
a reflection back of what we've already

5230
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:50,040
a reflection back of what we've already
 

5231

yes but it's uh there's a deeper wisdom

5234
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:54,360
yes but it's uh there's a deeper wisdom
 

5235
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,550
yes but it's uh there's a deeper wisdom
to the collective intelligence

5236
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:55,560
to the collective intelligence

01:37:59,510 --> 01:37:59,520

01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,610
that's a that's an important no that's
an interesting question I mean in you

5246
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:07,620
an interesting question I mean in you
 

5247
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:10,790
an interesting question I mean in you
know insofar as some of us you know work

01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
and sometimes it's pulling down kind of
 

5271
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,129
and sometimes it's pulling down kind of
the attempt to make this kind of

5272
01:38:40,129 --> 01:38:40,139
the attempt to make this kind of
 

5273
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:42,350
the attempt to make this kind of
innovative Direction but don't you think

5274
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:42,360
innovative Direction but don't you think
 

5275
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:43,910
innovative Direction but don't you think
the large language models would see

5276
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:43,920
the large language models would see
 

5277
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,890
the large language models would see
beyond that simplification will say

5278
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:45,900
beyond that simplification will say
 

5279
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,590
beyond that simplification will say
maybe intellectual and career diversity

5280
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:48,600
maybe intellectual and career diversity
 

5281
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,450
maybe intellectual and career diversity
is really important so you need the

5282
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:50,460
is really important so you need the
 

5283
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,430
is really important so you need the
crazy people from the outlier on the

5284
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:52,440
crazy people from the outlier on the
 

5285
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:56,030
crazy people from the outlier on the
outskirts and so like the actual what's

5286
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:56,040
outskirts and so like the actual what's
 

5287
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,970
outskirts and so like the actual what's
the purpose of this whole thing is to

5288
01:38:58,970 --> 01:38:58,980
the purpose of this whole thing is to
 

5289
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,590
the purpose of this whole thing is to
explore

5290
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:00,600
explore
 

5291
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,530
explore
through this kind of dynamics that we've

5292
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:03,540
through this kind of dynamics that we've
 

5293
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,149
through this kind of dynamics that we've
been using as a human civilization which

5294
01:39:05,149 --> 01:39:05,159
been using as a human civilization which
 

5295
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:06,950
been using as a human civilization which
is most of us focused on one thing and

5296
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:06,960
is most of us focused on one thing and
 

5297
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,209
is most of us focused on one thing and
then there's the crazy people on the

5298
01:39:08,209 --> 01:39:08,219
then there's the crazy people on the
 

5299
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:10,610
then there's the crazy people on the
outskirts doing the opposite of that one

5300
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:10,620
outskirts doing the opposite of that one
 

5301
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,110
outskirts doing the opposite of that one
thing and you kind of pull the whole

5302
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:12,120
thing and you kind of pull the whole
 

5303
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,870
thing and you kind of pull the whole
society together there's the mainstream

5304
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:14,880
society together there's the mainstream
 

5305
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,850
society together there's the mainstream
science and then there's the crazy

5306
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:16,860
science and then there's the crazy
 

5307
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,950
science and then there's the crazy
science and it's just been about the

5308
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:18,960
science and it's just been about the
 

5309
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,870
science and it's just been about the
history of human civilization and maybe

5310
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:20,880
history of human civilization and maybe
 

5311
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,790
history of human civilization and maybe
the AI system will be able to see that

5312
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:22,800
the AI system will be able to see that
 

5313
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,649
the AI system will be able to see that
and the more and more impressed we are

5314
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:24,659
and the more and more impressed we are
 

5315
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:27,770
and the more and more impressed we are
by a language model telling us this the

5316
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:27,780
by a language model telling us this the
 

5317
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:31,550
by a language model telling us this the
more control we'll give it to it and the

5318
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:31,560
more control we'll give it to it and the
 

5319
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,669
more control we'll give it to it and the
more we'll be willing to let it run our

5320
01:39:33,669 --> 01:39:33,679
more we'll be willing to let it run our
 

5321
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,010
more we'll be willing to let it run our
society and hence there's this kind of

5322
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:37,020
society and hence there's this kind of
 

5323
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:39,470
society and hence there's this kind of
loop where the society could be

5324
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:39,480
loop where the society could be
 

5325
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:42,350
loop where the society could be
manipulated to let the AI system run it

5326
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:42,360
manipulated to let the AI system run it
 

5327
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,629
manipulated to let the AI system run it
right well I mean look one of the things

5328
01:39:44,629 --> 01:39:44,639
right well I mean look one of the things
 

5329
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,110
right well I mean look one of the things
that sort of interesting is we might say

5330
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:48,120
that sort of interesting is we might say
 

5331
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:49,870
that sort of interesting is we might say
we always think we're making progress

5332
01:39:49,870 --> 01:39:49,880
we always think we're making progress
 

5333
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:54,169
we always think we're making progress
but yet if you know in a sense by by

5334
01:39:54,169 --> 01:39:54,179
but yet if you know in a sense by by
 

5335
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:56,870
but yet if you know in a sense by by
saying let's take what already exists

5336
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:56,880
saying let's take what already exists
 

5337
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,510
saying let's take what already exists
and use that as a model for what should

5338
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
and use that as a model for what should
 

5339
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,750
and use that as a model for what should
exist yeah then you know it's

5340
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:02,760
exist yeah then you know it's
 

5341
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,250
exist yeah then you know it's
interesting that for example you know

5342
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:04,260
interesting that for example you know
 

5343
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:05,930
interesting that for example you know
many religions have taken that point of

5344
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:05,940
many religions have taken that point of
 

5345
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,729
many religions have taken that point of
view there is a you know a sacred book

5346
01:40:07,729 --> 01:40:07,739
view there is a you know a sacred book
 

5347
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:10,550
view there is a you know a sacred book
that got written at Timex and it defines

5348
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:10,560
that got written at Timex and it defines
 

5349
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,890
that got written at Timex and it defines
how people should act for all future

5350
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:12,900
how people should act for all future
 

5351
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,830
how people should act for all future
time and that's you know it's it's a

5352
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840
time and that's you know it's it's a
 

5353
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,890
time and that's you know it's it's a
model that people have operated with and

5354
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:18,900
model that people have operated with and
 

5355
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,950
model that people have operated with and
in a sense you know this is a version of

5356
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:21,960
in a sense you know this is a version of
 

5357
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,050
in a sense you know this is a version of
that that kind of statement it's like

5358
01:40:24,050 --> 01:40:24,060
that that kind of statement it's like
 

5359
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:28,430
that that kind of statement it's like
take the 2023 version of sort of how the

5360
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:28,440
take the 2023 version of sort of how the
 

5361
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,649
take the 2023 version of sort of how the
world has exposed itself

5362
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:30,659
world has exposed itself
 

5363
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:33,709
world has exposed itself
and use that to Define what the world

5364
01:40:33,709 --> 01:40:33,719
and use that to Define what the world
 

5365
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:35,270
and use that to Define what the world
should do in the future but it's not

5366
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:35,280
should do in the future but it's not
 

5367
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,129
should do in the future but it's not
it's an imprecise definition right

5368
01:40:37,129 --> 01:40:37,139
it's an imprecise definition right
 

5369
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:39,110
it's an imprecise definition right
because just like with religious text

5370
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:39,120
because just like with religious text

01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,770
the other cheek kind of narrative right
that's that's not a fully instructive

5392
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:06,780
that's that's not a fully instructive
 

5393
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,930
that's that's not a fully instructive

control all the systems in the world
they will be able to very precisely tell

5398
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:13,679
they will be able to very precisely tell
 

5399
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,350
they will be able to very precisely tell
you what to do but they'll do what they

5400
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,360
you what to do but they'll do what they
 

5401
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,209
you what to do but they'll do what they
you know they'll they'll just do this or

5402
01:41:17,209 --> 01:41:17,219
you know they'll they'll just do this or
 

5403
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:19,910
you know they'll they'll just do this or
that thing and and that and and not only

5404
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:19,920
that thing and and that and and not only
 

5405
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,830
that thing and and that and and not only
that they'll be Auto suggesting to each

5406
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:21,840
that they'll be Auto suggesting to each
 

5407
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,689
that they'll be Auto suggesting to each
person you know do this next do that

5408
01:41:23,689 --> 01:41:23,699
person you know do this next do that
 

5409
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:26,090
person you know do this next do that
next so I think it's a it's a slightly

5410
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:26,100
next so I think it's a it's a slightly
 

5411
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:29,510
next so I think it's a it's a slightly
more prescriptive situation than one has

5412
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:29,520
more prescriptive situation than one has
 

5413
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,270
more prescriptive situation than one has
typically seen but you know I think this

5414
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:32,280
typically seen but you know I think this
 

5415
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:35,090
typically seen but you know I think this
this whole question of sort of what

5416
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:35,100
this whole question of sort of what
 

5417
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:37,970
this whole question of sort of what
what's left for the human so to speak to

5418
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:37,980
what's left for the human so to speak to
 

5419
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:42,350
what's left for the human so to speak to
what extent do we uh you know this idea

5420
01:41:42,350 --> 01:41:42,360
what extent do we uh you know this idea
 

5421
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,410
what extent do we uh you know this idea
that there is an existing kind of Corpus

5422
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:45,420
that there is an existing kind of Corpus
 

5423
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:47,870
that there is an existing kind of Corpus
of purpose for humans defined by what's

5424
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:47,880
of purpose for humans defined by what's
 

5425
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:50,270
of purpose for humans defined by what's
on the internet and so on that's an

5426
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:50,280
on the internet and so on that's an
 

5427
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,910
on the internet and so on that's an
important thing but then the question of

5428
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:52,920
important thing but then the question of
 

5429
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,090
important thing but then the question of
sort of as we explore what we can think

5430
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:56,100
sort of as we explore what we can think
 

5431
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,890
sort of as we explore what we can think
of as the computational universe as we

5432
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:57,900
of as the computational universe as we
 

5433
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:58,669
of as the computational universe as we
explore all these different

5434
01:41:58,669 --> 01:41:58,679
explore all these different
 

5435
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:00,530
explore all these different
possibilities for what we could do all

5436
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:00,540
possibilities for what we could do all
 

5437
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:01,970
possibilities for what we could do all
these different inventions we could make

5438
01:42:01,970 --> 01:42:01,980
these different inventions we could make
 

5439
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,070
these different inventions we could make
all these different things the question

5440
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:04,080
all these different things the question
 

5441
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,890
all these different things the question
is which ones do we choose to follow

5442
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:05,900
is which ones do we choose to follow
 

5443
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:09,169
is which ones do we choose to follow
those choices are the things that in a

5444
01:42:09,169 --> 01:42:09,179
those choices are the things that in a
 

5445
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:13,729
those choices are the things that in a
sense if the humans want to still have

5446
01:42:13,729 --> 01:42:13,739
sense if the humans want to still have
 

5447
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:17,030
sense if the humans want to still have
kind of human progress that's what we we

5448
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,040
kind of human progress that's what we we
 

5449
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,609
kind of human progress that's what we we
get to make those choices so to speak in

5450
01:42:19,609 --> 01:42:19,619
get to make those choices so to speak in
 

5451
01:42:19,619 --> 01:42:22,729
get to make those choices so to speak in
other words the the there's this idea if

5452
01:42:22,729 --> 01:42:22,739
other words the the there's this idea if
 

5453
01:42:22,739 --> 01:42:25,270
other words the the there's this idea if
you say let's take

5454
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:25,280
you say let's take
 

5455
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,570
you say let's take
the uh kind of what exists today and use

5456
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:29,580
the uh kind of what exists today and use
 

5457
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,970
the uh kind of what exists today and use
that as the determiner of all of what

5458
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:31,980
that as the determiner of all of what
 

5459
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,410
that as the determiner of all of what
there is in the future

5460
01:42:33,410 --> 01:42:33,420
there is in the future
 

5461
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,729
there is in the future
the thing that is sort of the

5462
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:34,739
the thing that is sort of the
 

5463
01:42:34,739 --> 01:42:37,370
the thing that is sort of the
opportunity for humans is there will be

5464
01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:37,380
opportunity for humans is there will be
 

5465
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:39,350
opportunity for humans is there will be
many possibilities thrown up there are

5466
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:39,360
many possibilities thrown up there are
 

5467
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,729
many possibilities thrown up there are
many different things that could happen

5468
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:40,739
many different things that could happen
 

5469
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:45,590
many different things that could happen
or be done and the insofar as we want to

5470
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:45,600
or be done and the insofar as we want to
 

5471
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,629
or be done and the insofar as we want to
be in the loop the thing that makes

5472
01:42:47,629 --> 01:42:47,639
be in the loop the thing that makes
 

5473
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:49,490
be in the loop the thing that makes
sense for us to be in the loop doing is

5474
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:49,500
sense for us to be in the loop doing is
 

5475
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,410
sense for us to be in the loop doing is
picking which of those possibilities we

5476
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:51,420
picking which of those possibilities we
 

5477
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:52,310
picking which of those possibilities we
want

5478
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:52,320
want
 

5479
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,070
want
but the degree to which there's a

5480
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:55,080
but the degree to which there's a
 

5481
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,750
but the degree to which there's a
feedback loop

5482
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:56,760
feedback loop
 

5483
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,970
feedback loop
of the idea that we're picking something

5484
01:42:58,970 --> 01:42:58,980
of the idea that we're picking something
 

5485
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:00,770
of the idea that we're picking something
starts becoming questionable because

5486
01:43:00,770 --> 01:43:00,780
starts becoming questionable because
 

5487
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,510
starts becoming questionable because
we're influenced by the various systems

5488
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:02,520
we're influenced by the various systems
 

5489
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:05,030
we're influenced by the various systems
absolutely like if that becomes more and

5490
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,040
absolutely like if that becomes more and
 

5491
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,950
absolutely like if that becomes more and
more source of our education and wisdom

5492
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:06,960
more source of our education and wisdom
 

5493
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,350
more source of our education and wisdom
and knowledge

5494
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:09,360
and knowledge
 

5495
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,510
and knowledge
right the AIS take over I mean my you

5496
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:11,520
right the AIS take over I mean my you
 

5497
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,430
right the AIS take over I mean my you
know I've thought for a long time that

5498
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:13,440
know I've thought for a long time that
 

5499
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,890
know I've thought for a long time that
you know it's the you know AR Auto

5500
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:15,900
you know it's the you know AR Auto
 

5501
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,350
you know it's the you know AR Auto
suggestion that's really the thing that

5502
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:18,360
suggestion that's really the thing that
 

5503
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,270
suggestion that's really the thing that
makes the AIS take over it's just then

5504
01:43:20,270 --> 01:43:20,280
makes the AIS take over it's just then
 

5505
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:23,270
makes the AIS take over it's just then
the humans just follow you know yeah we

5506
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:23,280
the humans just follow you know yeah we
 

5507
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,770
the humans just follow you know yeah we
will no longer write emails to each

5508
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:24,780
will no longer write emails to each
 

5509
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,229
will no longer write emails to each
other we'll just send the auto suggested

5510
01:43:27,229 --> 01:43:27,239
other we'll just send the auto suggested
 

5511
01:43:27,239 --> 01:43:30,470
other we'll just send the auto suggested
email yeah yeah but the the thing where

5512
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:30,480
email yeah yeah but the the thing where
 

5513
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,330
email yeah yeah but the the thing where
humans are potentially in the loop is

5514
01:43:32,330 --> 01:43:32,340
humans are potentially in the loop is
 

5515
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,490
humans are potentially in the loop is
when there's a choice and when there's a

5516
01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:34,500
when there's a choice and when there's a
 

5517
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,850
when there's a choice and when there's a
choice which we could make based on our

5518
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:37,860
choice which we could make based on our
 

5519
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:39,590
choice which we could make based on our
kind of whole web of history and so on

5520
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:39,600
kind of whole web of history and so on
 

5521
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,310
kind of whole web of history and so on
yeah and and that's you know that's

5522
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:42,320
yeah and and that's you know that's
 

5523
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:45,790
yeah and and that's you know that's
insofar as it's all just you know

5524
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:45,800
insofar as it's all just you know
 

5525
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,530
insofar as it's all just you know
determined uh you know the humans don't

5526
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:48,540
determined uh you know the humans don't
 

5527
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:50,930
determined uh you know the humans don't
have a place and and by the way I mean

5528
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:50,940
have a place and and by the way I mean
 

5529
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:54,050
have a place and and by the way I mean
you know at some level uh you know it's

5530
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:54,060
you know at some level uh you know it's
 

5531
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,910
you know at some level uh you know it's
all kind of a complicated philosophical

5532
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:55,920
all kind of a complicated philosophical
 

5533
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,070
all kind of a complicated philosophical
issue because at some level the universe

5534
01:43:58,070 --> 01:43:58,080
issue because at some level the universe
 

5535
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:01,250
issue because at some level the universe
is just doing what it does we are parts

5536
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:01,260
is just doing what it does we are parts
 

5537
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:04,609
is just doing what it does we are parts
of that universe that are necessarily

5538
01:44:04,609 --> 01:44:04,619
of that universe that are necessarily
 

5539
01:44:04,619 --> 01:44:07,729
of that universe that are necessarily
doing what we do so to speak yet we feel

5540
01:44:07,729 --> 01:44:07,739
doing what we do so to speak yet we feel
 

5541
01:44:07,739 --> 01:44:09,770
doing what we do so to speak yet we feel
we have sort of agency in what we doing

5542
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:09,780
we have sort of agency in what we doing
 

5543
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:12,590
we have sort of agency in what we doing
and that's that's its own separate kind

5544
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:12,600
and that's that's its own separate kind
 

5545
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,510
and that's that's its own separate kind
of interesting issue and we also kind of

5546
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:14,520
of interesting issue and we also kind of
 

5547
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:15,950
of interesting issue and we also kind of
feel like we're the Final Destination

5548
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:15,960
feel like we're the Final Destination
 

5549
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,330
feel like we're the Final Destination
what the universe was meant to create

5550
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:19,340
what the universe was meant to create
 

5551
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:23,330
what the universe was meant to create
uh but we very well could be and likely

5552
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:23,340
uh but we very well could be and likely
 

5553
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,890
uh but we very well could be and likely
are some kind of intermediate step

5554
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:24,900
are some kind of intermediate step
 

5555
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:28,790
are some kind of intermediate step
obviously yeah well we're we're most

5556
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:28,800
obviously yeah well we're we're most
 

5557
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,770
obviously yeah well we're we're most
certainly some intermediate step the

5558
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:30,780
certainly some intermediate step the
 

5559
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:32,990
certainly some intermediate step the
question is if there's some cooler more

5560
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:33,000
question is if there's some cooler more
 

5561
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,990
question is if there's some cooler more
complex more interesting uh thing that's

5562
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:36,000
complex more interesting uh thing that's
 

5563
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,250
complex more interesting uh thing that's
going to be materialized this

5564
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:37,260
going to be materialized this
 

5565
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,810
going to be materialized this
computational universe is full of such

5566
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:38,820
computational universe is full of such
 

5567
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:41,270
computational universe is full of such
things but in our particular pocket

5568
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
things but in our particular pocket
 

5569
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,729
things but in our particular pocket
specifically if this is the best we're

5570
01:44:43,729 --> 01:44:43,739
specifically if this is the best we're
 

5571
01:44:43,739 --> 01:44:45,830
specifically if this is the best we're
going to do or not that's kind of a we

5572
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
going to do or not that's kind of a we
 

5573
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,629
going to do or not that's kind of a we
can make all kinds of interesting things

5574
01:44:47,629 --> 01:44:47,639
can make all kinds of interesting things
 

5575
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:49,729
can make all kinds of interesting things
in the computational universe we when we

5576
01:44:49,729 --> 01:44:49,739
in the computational universe we when we
 

5577
01:44:49,739 --> 01:44:53,030
in the computational universe we when we
look at them we say yeah you know that's

5578
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,040
look at them we say yeah you know that's
 

5579
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,830
look at them we say yeah you know that's
that's a thing we don't it doesn't

5580
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:54,840
that's a thing we don't it doesn't

01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,770
that's a thing we don't it doesn't
really connect with our current uh our

01:44:58,739 --> 01:45:00,950
current way of thinking about things
it's like in mathematics you know we've

5586
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:00,960
it's like in mathematics you know we've
 

5587
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,450
it's like in mathematics you know we've
got certain theorems they're about three

01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:02,460
got certain theorems they're about three
 

5589
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,709
got certain theorems they're about three
or four million that human

or four million that human
 

5591
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:05,750

mathematicians have written down and
 

5593
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,550
mathematicians have written down and
published and so on but they're an

theorems we just go out into the
 

5599
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,410

01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:12,420
universe of possible theorems and pick
 

5601
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:14,629
universe of possible theorems and pick
another theorem and then people will say

5602
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
another theorem and then people will say
 

5603
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,090
another theorem and then people will say
well you know that's the you know they

well you know that's the you know they
 

5605
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,109
well you know that's the you know they
look at it and they say I don't know

01:45:18,109 --> 01:45:18,119
look at it and they say I don't know

01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:28,010
species well we can also ask the same
thing about the natural world or the

to eventually lead to this thing that's
going to you know make make the earth

5680
01:46:33,709 --> 01:46:33,719
going to you know make make the earth
 

5681
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:36,350
going to you know make make the earth
explode or something like this those are

explode or something like this those are
 

5683
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:38,209
explode or something like this those are
those are questions those are and

5684
01:46:38,209 --> 01:46:38,219
those are questions those are and
 

5685
01:46:38,219 --> 01:46:40,550
those are questions those are and
insofar as we think we understand what's

5686
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:40,560
insofar as we think we understand what's
 

5687
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,350
insofar as we think we understand what's
happening in the natural world that's a

5688
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:42,360
happening in the natural world that's a
 

5689
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,330
happening in the natural world that's a
result of Science and natural science

result of Science and natural science
 

5691

result of Science and natural science
and so on one of the things we can

5692
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:46,320
and so on one of the things we can
 

5693
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,750
and so on one of the things we can
expect when there's this giant

expect when there's this giant

expect when there's this giant
infrastructure of the AIS is that's

5696
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:50,040
infrastructure of the AIS is that's
 

5697
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,189
infrastructure of the AIS is that's
where we have to kind of invent a new

where we have to kind of invent a new
 

5699
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:54,470
where we have to kind of invent a new
kind of natural science that kind of is

5700
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
kind of natural science that kind of is
 

5701
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,330
kind of natural science that kind of is
the natural science that explains to us

5702
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:56,340
the natural science that explains to us
 

5703
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,970
the natural science that explains to us
how the AIS work it's kind of like we

5704
01:46:58,970 --> 01:46:58,980
how the AIS work it's kind of like we
 

5705
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,490
how the AIS work it's kind of like we
can we can you know we have a I don't

there we don't really understand how the
 

5715
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,070
there we don't really understand how the
horse Works inside but we can get

5716
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
horse Works inside but we can get
 

5717
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,109
horse Works inside but we can get
certain rules and certain you know

5718

certain rules and certain you know

certain rules and certain you know
approaches that we take to persuade the

and take us there and that's the same
 

5725
01:47:18,659 --> 01:47:20,689
and take us there and that's the same
type of thing that we're kind of dealing

01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,440
can identify these kinds of we can find
 

5733
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:30,109
can identify these kinds of we can find
these kind of pockets of reducibility

5734
01:47:30,109 --> 01:47:30,119
these kind of pockets of reducibility
 

5735
01:47:30,119 --> 01:47:33,950
these kind of pockets of reducibility
that we can kind of uh you know the I

5736
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:33,960
that we can kind of uh you know the I
 

5737
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,330

don't know we're grabbing onto the main

5738
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:35,340
don't know we're grabbing onto the main
 

5739
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:37,729
don't know we're grabbing onto the main
of the horse or something to be able to

5740
01:47:37,729 --> 01:47:37,739
of the horse or something to be able to
 

5741
01:47:37,739 --> 01:47:39,770
of the horse or something to be able to
to write it

5742
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:39,780
to write it
 

5743
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:41,990
to write it
um or we figure out you know if we if we

5744
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:42,000
um or we figure out you know if we if we
 

5745
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,970
um or we figure out you know if we if we
do this or that to to ride the horse

5746
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:43,980
do this or that to to ride the horse
 

5747
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:46,910
do this or that to to ride the horse
that that's a a successful way to to get

5748
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:46,920
that that's a a successful way to to get
 

5749
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,470
that that's a a successful way to to get
it to do what what we're interested in

5750
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:48,480
it to do what what we're interested in
 

5751
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,570
it to do what what we're interested in
doing there does seem to be a difference

5752
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:50,580
doing there does seem to be a difference
 

5753
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,510
doing there does seem to be a difference
between a horse

5754
01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:52,520
between a horse
 

5755
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:55,070
between a horse
and a um

5756
01:47:55,070 --> 01:47:55,080
and a um

a large language model

5758
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:57,360
a large language model
 

5759
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,510
a large language model
or something that could be called AGI

5760
01:47:59,510 --> 01:47:59,520
or something that could be called AGI

connected to the internet so let me just

5762
01:48:01,609 --> 01:48:01,619
connected to the internet so let me just
 

5763
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:03,950
connected to the internet so let me just
ask you about big philosophical question

5764
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:03,960
ask you about big philosophical question
 

5765
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,270
ask you about big philosophical question
about the threats of these things

5766
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:05,280
about the threats of these things
 

5767
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,609
about the threats of these things
there's a lot of people like Eliezer

5768
01:48:07,609 --> 01:48:07,619
there's a lot of people like Eliezer
 

5769
01:48:07,619 --> 01:48:10,370
there's a lot of people like Eliezer
adkowski who worry about the existential

5770
01:48:10,370 --> 01:48:10,380
adkowski who worry about the existential
 

5771
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:14,770
adkowski who worry about the existential
risks of AI systems is that something

5772
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:14,780
risks of AI systems is that something
 

5773
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:17,629
risks of AI systems is that something
that you worry about you know sometimes

5774
01:48:17,629 --> 01:48:17,639
that you worry about you know sometimes
 

5775
01:48:17,639 --> 01:48:19,430
that you worry about you know sometimes
when you're building an incredible

5776
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:19,440
when you're building an incredible
 

5777
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,370
when you're building an incredible
system like wolf from alpha you can

5778
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:22,380
system like wolf from alpha you can
 

5779
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:25,010
system like wolf from alpha you can
kind of get lost in it I like try and

5780
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:25,020
kind of get lost in it I like try and
 

5781
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:26,450
kind of get lost in it I like try and
think a little bit about the

5782
01:48:26,450 --> 01:48:26,460
think a little bit about the
 

5783
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:28,430
think a little bit about the
implications of what one's doing you

5784
01:48:28,430 --> 01:48:28,440
implications of what one's doing you
 

5785
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:29,930
implications of what one's doing you
know it's like the Manhattan Project

5786
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:29,940
know it's like the Manhattan Project
 

5787
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:32,270
know it's like the Manhattan Project
kind of situation where you're like it's

5788
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:32,280
kind of situation where you're like it's
 

5789
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,709
kind of situation where you're like it's
some of the most incredible physics in

5790
01:48:33,709 --> 01:48:33,719
some of the most incredible physics in
 

5791
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:36,169
some of the most incredible physics in
engineering being done but it's like huh

5792
01:48:36,169 --> 01:48:36,179
engineering being done but it's like huh
 

5793
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:38,209
engineering being done but it's like huh
where's this gonna go I think some of

5794
01:48:38,209 --> 01:48:38,219
where's this gonna go I think some of
 

5795
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:40,250
where's this gonna go I think some of
these arguments about kind of you know

5796
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:40,260
these arguments about kind of you know
 

5797
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,169
these arguments about kind of you know
they'll always be a smarter AI they'll

5798
01:48:42,169 --> 01:48:42,179
they'll always be a smarter AI they'll
 

5799
01:48:42,179 --> 01:48:43,790
they'll always be a smarter AI they'll
always be you know and eventually the

5800
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:43,800
always be you know and eventually the
 

5801
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,590
always be you know and eventually the
AIS will get smarter than us and then

5802
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:45,600
AIS will get smarter than us and then
 

5803
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,149
AIS will get smarter than us and then
all sorts of terrible things will happen

5804
01:48:47,149 --> 01:48:47,159
all sorts of terrible things will happen
 

5805
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:50,510
all sorts of terrible things will happen
to me some of those arguments remind me

5806
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:50,520
to me some of those arguments remind me
 

5807
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,189
to me some of those arguments remind me
of kind of the ontological arguments for

5808
01:48:52,189 --> 01:48:52,199
of kind of the ontological arguments for
 

5809
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:53,810
of kind of the ontological arguments for
the essence of God and things like this

5810
01:48:53,810 --> 01:48:53,820
the essence of God and things like this
 

5811
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:56,510
the essence of God and things like this
they're kind of arguments that are based

01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:56,520
they're kind of arguments that are based
 

5813
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,910
they're kind of arguments that are based
on some particular model fairly simple

01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:16,920
there'll be a super intelligence and
 

5833
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,890
there'll be a super intelligence and
then it will you know do this and that

5834
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:18,900
then it will you know do this and that
 

5835
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:21,709
then it will you know do this and that
turns out not to really be the story it

5836

possibly be right I think the answer is

5852
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:38,340
possibly be right I think the answer is
 

5853
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:40,430
possibly be right I think the answer is
no and in fact we already know this and

01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:40,440
no and in fact we already know this and
 

5855
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:41,810
no and in fact we already know this and
it's a kind of a back to the whole

01:49:41,810 --> 01:49:41,820
it's a kind of a back to the whole
 

5857
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:44,330
it's a kind of a back to the whole
computational reducibility story there's

5858
01:49:44,330 --> 01:49:44,340
computational reducibility story there's
 

5859
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:47,209
computational reducibility story there's
kind of a question of you know even if

5860
01:49:47,209 --> 01:49:47,219
kind of a question of you know even if
 

5861
01:49:47,219 --> 01:49:48,590

5886
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:13,800
of like the same same question of
 

5887
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,050
of like the same same question of
whether there'll always be another

5888
01:50:15,050 --> 01:50:15,060
whether there'll always be another
 

5889
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:17,090
whether there'll always be another
invention will you always be able to

5890
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:17,100
invention will you always be able to
 

5891
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,890
invention will you always be able to
invent another thing the answer is yes

5892
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:18,900
invent another thing the answer is yes
 

5893
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,750
invent another thing the answer is yes
there's an infinite Tower of possible

5894
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:20,760
there's an infinite Tower of possible
 

5895
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:23,410
there's an infinite Tower of possible
inventions that's one definition of apex

5896
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:23,420
inventions that's one definition of apex
 

5897
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:26,590
inventions that's one definition of apex
uh but the other is like

5898
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:26,600
uh but the other is like
 

5899
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:29,450
uh but the other is like
which I also thought you were which I

5900
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:29,460
which I also thought you were which I
 

5901
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,910
which I also thought you were which I
also think might be true is is there a

5902
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:31,920
also think might be true is is there a
 

5903
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,709
also think might be true is is there a
species that's the Apex intelligence

5904
01:50:33,709 --> 01:50:33,719
species that's the Apex intelligence
 

5905
01:50:33,719 --> 01:50:35,090
species that's the Apex intelligence
right now on Earth

5906
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:35,100
right now on Earth
 

5907
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:37,490
right now on Earth
so it's not trivial to say that humans

5908
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:37,500
so it's not trivial to say that humans
 

5909
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,950
so it's not trivial to say that humans
are that yeah it's not trivial I agree

5910
01:50:39,950 --> 01:50:39,960
are that yeah it's not trivial I agree
 

5911
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,350
are that yeah it's not trivial I agree
it's a you know I think one of the

5912
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:42,360
it's a you know I think one of the
 

5913
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:45,470
it's a you know I think one of the
things that I I've long been curious

5914
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:45,480
things that I I've long been curious
 

5915
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,750
things that I I've long been curious
about kind of other intelligences so to

5916
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:47,760
about kind of other intelligences so to
 

5917
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,649
about kind of other intelligences so to
speak

5918
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:48,659
speak
 

5919
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:50,530
speak
um I mean I you know I I view

5920
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:50,540
um I mean I you know I I view
 

5921
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:54,229
um I mean I you know I I view
intelligence is like computation and

5922
01:50:54,229 --> 01:50:54,239
intelligence is like computation and
 

5923
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:57,229
intelligence is like computation and
it's kind of a you know you're sort of

5924
01:50:57,229 --> 01:50:57,239
it's kind of a you know you're sort of
 

5925
01:50:57,239 --> 01:50:59,270
it's kind of a you know you're sort of
you have the set of rules you deduce

5926
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
you have the set of rules you deduce
 

5927
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,189
you have the set of rules you deduce
what happens

5928
01:51:01,189 --> 01:51:01,199
what happens
 

5929
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:03,890
what happens
um I have tended to think now that

5930
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:03,900
um I have tended to think now that
 

5931
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:05,510
um I have tended to think now that
there's this kind of specialization of

5932
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:05,520
there's this kind of specialization of
 

5933
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,850
there's this kind of specialization of
computation that is sort of a

5934
01:51:07,850 --> 01:51:07,860
computation that is sort of a
 

5935
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:10,430
computation that is sort of a
consciousness-like thing that has to do

5936
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:10,440
consciousness-like thing that has to do
 

5937
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:11,870
consciousness-like thing that has to do
with these you know computational

5938
01:51:11,870 --> 01:51:11,880
with these you know computational
 

5939
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,149
with these you know computational
boundedness single thread of experience

5940
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:14,159
boundedness single thread of experience
 

5941
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,669
boundedness single thread of experience
these kinds of things that are the

5942
01:51:16,669 --> 01:51:16,679
these kinds of things that are the
 

5943
01:51:16,679 --> 01:51:18,770
these kinds of things that are the
specialization of computation that

5944
01:51:18,770 --> 01:51:18,780
specialization of computation that
 

5945
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:21,189
specialization of computation that
corresponds to a somewhat human-like

5946
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:21,199
corresponds to a somewhat human-like
 

5947
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:24,169
corresponds to a somewhat human-like
experience of the world now the question

5948
01:51:24,169 --> 01:51:24,179
experience of the world now the question
 

5949
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:26,209
experience of the world now the question
is so so that's you know there may be

5950
01:51:26,209 --> 01:51:26,219
is so so that's you know there may be
 

5951
01:51:26,219 --> 01:51:28,910
is so so that's you know there may be
other intelligences like you know you

5952
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:28,920
other intelligences like you know you
 

5953
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,229
other intelligences like you know you
know the aphorism you know the weather

5954
01:51:30,229 --> 01:51:30,239
know the aphorism you know the weather
 

5955
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,270
know the aphorism you know the weather
has a mind of its own it's a different

01:51:32,270 --> 01:51:32,280
has a mind of its own it's a different
 

5957
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:34,729
has a mind of its own it's a different
kind of intelligence that can compute

5958
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:34,739
kind of intelligence that can compute
 

5959
01:51:34,739 --> 01:51:36,410
kind of intelligence that can compute
all kinds of of things that are hard for

5960
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:36,420
all kinds of of things that are hard for
 

5961
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:39,050
all kinds of of things that are hard for
us to compute but it is not well aligned

5962
01:51:39,050 --> 01:51:39,060
us to compute but it is not well aligned
 

5963
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:41,870
us to compute but it is not well aligned
with us with the way that we think about

5964
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:41,880
with us with the way that we think about
 

5965
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,910
with us with the way that we think about
things it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't

5966
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:43,920
things it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't
 

5967
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,490
things it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't
think the way we think about things and

5968
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:46,500
think the way we think about things and
 

5969
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,109
think the way we think about things and
you know in this idea of different

5970
01:51:48,109 --> 01:51:48,119
you know in this idea of different
 

5971
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:49,790
you know in this idea of different
different intelligences every different

5972
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:49,800

01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:54,300
different intelligence that thinks about
 

5977
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,870
different intelligence that thinks about
things in different ways and you know in

5978
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:56,880
things in different ways and you know in
 

5979
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,729
things in different ways and you know in
in terms of the kind of formalism of our

5980
01:51:58,729 --> 01:51:58,739
in terms of the kind of formalism of our
 

5981
01:51:58,739 --> 01:52:00,410
in terms of the kind of formalism of our
physics project we talk about this idea

5982
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:00,420
physics project we talk about this idea
 

5983
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:03,229
physics project we talk about this idea
of rule space the space of all possible

5984
01:52:03,229 --> 01:52:03,239
of rule space the space of all possible
 

5985
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:06,050
of rule space the space of all possible
sort of rule systems and different minds

5986
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:06,060
sort of rule systems and different minds
 

5987
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:07,970
sort of rule systems and different minds
are in a sense of different points in

5988
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:07,980
are in a sense of different points in
 

5989
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:11,390
are in a sense of different points in
real space human Minds ones that have

5990
01:52:11,390 --> 01:52:11,400
real space human Minds ones that have
 

5991
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,950
real space human Minds ones that have
grown up with the same kind of culture

5992
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:12,960
grown up with the same kind of culture
 

5993
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,689
grown up with the same kind of culture
and ideas and things like this might be

5994
01:52:14,689 --> 01:52:14,699
and ideas and things like this might be
 

5995
01:52:14,699 --> 01:52:16,790
and ideas and things like this might be
pretty close in real space pretty easy

5996
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:16,800
pretty close in real space pretty easy
 

5997
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,410
pretty close in real space pretty easy
for them to communicate pretty easy to

01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:18,420
for them to communicate pretty easy to
 

5999
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:21,169
for them to communicate pretty easy to
translate pretty easy to move from one

01:52:21,169 --> 01:52:21,179
translate pretty easy to move from one
 

6001
01:52:21,179 --> 01:52:22,850
translate pretty easy to move from one
place in rural space that corresponds to

01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:22,860
place in rural space that corresponds to
 

6003
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:24,890
place in rural space that corresponds to
one mind to another place in rule your

6004
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:24,900
one mind to another place in rule your
 

6005
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,270
one mind to another place in rule your
space that corresponds to another sort

6006
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:26,280
space that corresponds to another sort
 

6007
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:29,450
space that corresponds to another sort
of nearby mind when we deal with kind of

6008
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:29,460
of nearby mind when we deal with kind of
 

6009
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:32,090
of nearby mind when we deal with kind of
more distant things in rural space like

6010
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:32,100
more distant things in rural space like
 

6011
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:35,570
more distant things in rural space like
you know the the pet cat or something

6012
01:52:35,570 --> 01:52:35,580
you know the the pet cat or something
 

6013
01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:38,209
you know the the pet cat or something
um you know the pet cat has some aspects

6014
01:52:38,209 --> 01:52:38,219
um you know the pet cat has some aspects
 

6015
01:52:38,219 --> 01:52:39,890
um you know the pet cat has some aspects
that are shared with us the emotional

6016
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:39,900
that are shared with us the emotional
 

6017
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,450
that are shared with us the emotional
responses of the cat are somewhat

6018
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:41,460
responses of the cat are somewhat
 

6019
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,850
responses of the cat are somewhat
similar to ours but the cat is further

6020
01:52:43,850 --> 01:52:43,860
similar to ours but the cat is further
 

6021
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:47,689
similar to ours but the cat is further
away in real space than people are and

6022
01:52:47,689 --> 01:52:47,699
away in real space than people are and
 

6023
01:52:47,699 --> 01:52:49,609
away in real space than people are and
so then the question is you know can we

6024
01:52:49,609 --> 01:52:49,619
so then the question is you know can we
 

6025
01:52:49,619 --> 01:52:52,609
so then the question is you know can we
identify sort of the can we make a

6026
01:52:52,609 --> 01:52:52,619
identify sort of the can we make a
 

6027
01:52:52,619 --> 01:52:54,830
identify sort of the can we make a
translation from our thought processes

6028
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:54,840
translation from our thought processes
 

6029
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,930
translation from our thought processes
to the thought process of a cat or

6030
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:56,940
to the thought process of a cat or
 

6031
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:59,450
to the thought process of a cat or
something like this and you know what

6032
01:52:59,450 --> 01:52:59,460
something like this and you know what
 

6033
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,550
something like this and you know what
what will we get when we you know what

6034
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:01,560
what will we get when we you know what
 

6035
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,050
what will we get when we you know what
what will happen when we get there and I

6036
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:03,060
what will happen when we get there and I
 

6037
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:05,330
what will happen when we get there and I
think it's the case that that many you

6038
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:05,340
think it's the case that that many you
 

6039
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,250
think it's the case that that many you
know many animals I don't know dogs for

6040
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:07,260
know many animals I don't know dogs for
 

6041
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,229
know many animals I don't know dogs for
example you know they have a labradal

6042
01:53:09,229 --> 01:53:09,239
example you know they have a labradal
 

6043
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:11,570
example you know they have a labradal
factory systems they you know they they

6044
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:11,580
factory systems they you know they they
 

6045
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:13,550
factory systems they you know they they
have sort of the smell architecture of

6046
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:13,560
have sort of the smell architecture of
 

6047
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:16,310
have sort of the smell architecture of
the of the of the world so to speak in a

6048
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:16,320
the of the of the world so to speak in a
 

6049
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:19,430
the of the of the world so to speak in a
way that we don't and so you know if if

6050
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:19,440
way that we don't and so you know if if
 

6051
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,649
way that we don't and so you know if if
you were sort of talking to the dog and

6052
01:53:21,649 --> 01:53:21,659
you were sort of talking to the dog and
 

6053
01:53:21,659 --> 01:53:24,109
you were sort of talking to the dog and
you could you know communicate in a

6054
01:53:24,109 --> 01:53:24,119
you could you know communicate in a
 

6055
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:26,570
you could you know communicate in a
language the dog will say well this is a

6056
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:26,580
language the dog will say well this is a
 

6057
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:30,169
language the dog will say well this is a
you know a a you know a flowing smelling

6058
01:53:30,169 --> 01:53:30,179
you know a a you know a flowing smelling
 

6059
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:32,870
you know a a you know a flowing smelling
this that and the other thing Concepts

6060
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:32,880
this that and the other thing Concepts
 

6061
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,270
this that and the other thing Concepts
that we just don't have any idea about

6062
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:35,280
that we just don't have any idea about
 

6063
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:37,910
that we just don't have any idea about
now what's what's interesting about that

6064
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:37,920
now what's what's interesting about that
 

6065
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,669
now what's what's interesting about that
is one day we will have chemical sensors

6066
01:53:40,669 --> 01:53:40,679
is one day we will have chemical sensors
 

6067
01:53:40,679 --> 01:53:42,890
is one day we will have chemical sensors
that do a really pretty good job you

6068
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:42,900
that do a really pretty good job you
 

6069
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:44,390
that do a really pretty good job you
know we'll have artificial noses that

6070
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:44,400
know we'll have artificial noses that
 

6071
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,310
know we'll have artificial noses that
work pretty well and we might have our

6072
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:46,320
work pretty well and we might have our
 

6073
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,709
work pretty well and we might have our
augmented reality system show us kind of

6074
01:53:48,709 --> 01:53:48,719
augmented reality system show us kind of
 

6075
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:51,109
augmented reality system show us kind of
the same map that the dog could see and

6076
01:53:51,109 --> 01:53:51,119
the same map that the dog could see and
 

6077
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:52,550
the same map that the dog could see and
things like this so that you know

6078
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:52,560
things like this so that you know
 

6079
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:53,990
things like this so that you know
similar to what happens in the dog's

6080
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:54,000
similar to what happens in the dog's
 

6081
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,450
similar to what happens in the dog's
brain and eventually we will have kind

6082
01:53:56,450 --> 01:53:56,460
brain and eventually we will have kind
 

6083
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:59,149
brain and eventually we will have kind
of expanded in real space to the point

6084
01:53:59,149 --> 01:53:59,159
of expanded in real space to the point
 

6085
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:01,310
of expanded in real space to the point
where we will have those same sensory

6086
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:01,320
where we will have those same sensory
 

6087
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,830
where we will have those same sensory
experiences that dogs have and we will

6088
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:03,840
experiences that dogs have and we will
 

6089
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,169
experiences that dogs have and we will
have internalized what it means to have

6090
01:54:06,169 --> 01:54:06,179
have internalized what it means to have
 

6091
01:54:06,179 --> 01:54:07,850
have internalized what it means to have
you know the smell landscape or whatever

6092
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:07,860
you know the smell landscape or whatever
 

6093
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:10,550
you know the smell landscape or whatever
and and so then we will have kind of

6094
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:10,560
and and so then we will have kind of
 

6095
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,550
and and so then we will have kind of
colonized that part of Royal space

6096
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:13,560
colonized that part of Royal space
 

6097
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,669
colonized that part of Royal space
um until you know we haven't gone you

6098
01:54:16,669 --> 01:54:16,679
um until you know we haven't gone you
 

6099
01:54:16,679 --> 01:54:18,410
um until you know we haven't gone you
know some things that that you know

6100
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:18,420
know some things that that you know
 

6101
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:20,870
know some things that that you know
animals and so on do we've sort of

6102
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
animals and so on do we've sort of
 

6103
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,790
animals and so on do we've sort of
successfully understand others we do not

6104
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:22,800
successfully understand others we do not
 

6105
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,450
successfully understand others we do not
and the question of of what kind of what

6106
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:26,460
and the question of of what kind of what
 

6107
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:28,850
and the question of of what kind of what
is the uh you know what what

6108
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:28,860
is the uh you know what what
 

6109
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:31,010
is the uh you know what what
representation you know how how do we

6110
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:31,020
representation you know how how do we
 

6111
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:33,830
representation you know how how do we
convert things that animals think about

6112
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
convert things that animals think about
 

6113
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,990
convert things that animals think about
to things that we can think about that's

6114
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:36,000
to things that we can think about that's
 

6115
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,790
to things that we can think about that's
not a trivial thing

6116
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:37,800
not a trivial thing
 

6117
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:39,649
not a trivial thing
um and you know I've I've long been

6118
01:54:39,649 --> 01:54:39,659
um and you know I've I've long been
 

6119
01:54:39,659 --> 01:54:41,689
um and you know I've I've long been
curious I've had a very bizarre project

6120
01:54:41,689 --> 01:54:41,699
curious I've had a very bizarre project
 

6121
01:54:41,699 --> 01:54:44,030
curious I've had a very bizarre project
at one point of of trying to make an

6122
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:44,040
at one point of of trying to make an
 

6123
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:45,950
at one point of of trying to make an
iPad game that a cat could win against

6124
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:45,960
iPad game that a cat could win against
 

6125
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,290
iPad game that a cat could win against
its owner right it feels like there's a

6126
01:54:48,290 --> 01:54:48,300
its owner right it feels like there's a
 

6127
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:49,669
its owner right it feels like there's a
deep philosophical

6128
01:54:49,669 --> 01:54:49,679
deep philosophical
 

6129
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:53,209
deep philosophical
go there though yes yes I mean the the

6130
01:54:53,209 --> 01:54:53,219
go there though yes yes I mean the the
 

6131
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:56,090
go there though yes yes I mean the the
you know I was curious if you know if

6132
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:56,100
you know I was curious if you know if
 

6133
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:58,070
you know I was curious if you know if
pets can work in Minecraft or something

6134
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:58,080
pets can work in Minecraft or something
 

6135
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,229
pets can work in Minecraft or something
and can construct things what will they

6136
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:00,239
and can construct things what will they
 

6137
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:02,270
and can construct things what will they
construct and will what they construct

6138
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:02,280
construct and will what they construct
 

6139
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:03,649
construct and will what they construct
be something where we look at and we say

6140
01:55:03,649 --> 01:55:03,659
be something where we look at and we say
 

6141
01:55:03,659 --> 01:55:05,990
be something where we look at and we say
yeah I recognize that or will it be

6142
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
yeah I recognize that or will it be
 

6143
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,090
yeah I recognize that or will it be
something that looks to us like

6144
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:08,100
something that looks to us like
 

6145
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,169
something that looks to us like
something that's out there in the

6146
01:55:09,169 --> 01:55:09,179
something that's out there in the
 

6147
01:55:09,179 --> 01:55:10,850
something that's out there in the
computational universe that one of my

6148
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:10,860
computational universe that one of my
 

6149
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:12,530
computational universe that one of my
you know cellular automata might have

6150
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:12,540
you know cellular automata might have
 

6151
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:14,750
you know cellular automata might have
produced where we sell yeah I can kind

6152
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:14,760
produced where we sell yeah I can kind
 

6153
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,250
produced where we sell yeah I can kind
of see it operates good into some rules

6154
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:16,260
of see it operates good into some rules
 

6155
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:17,390
of see it operates good into some rules
I don't know why you would use those

6156
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:17,400
I don't know why you would use those
 

6157
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,590
I don't know why you would use those
rules I don't know why you would care

6158
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:18,600
rules I don't know why you would care
 

6159
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:21,109
rules I don't know why you would care
yeah I uh actually it's just a link on

6160
01:55:21,109 --> 01:55:21,119
yeah I uh actually it's just a link on
 

6161
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:23,390
yeah I uh actually it's just a link on
that seriously is there a connector in

6162
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:23,400
that seriously is there a connector in
 

6163
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:26,450
that seriously is there a connector in
the Royal space between you and a cat

6164
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:26,460
the Royal space between you and a cat
 

6165
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,669
the Royal space between you and a cat
where the cat could legitimately win so

6166
01:55:28,669 --> 01:55:28,679
where the cat could legitimately win so
 

6167
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:30,470
where the cat could legitimately win so
iPad is a very limited

6168
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:30,480
iPad is a very limited
 

6169
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,229
iPad is a very limited
um interface yeah I I wonder if there's

6170
01:55:33,229 --> 01:55:33,239
um interface yeah I I wonder if there's
 

6171
01:55:33,239 --> 01:55:36,350
um interface yeah I I wonder if there's
a game where cats win I think the

6172
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:36,360
a game where cats win I think the
 

6173
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:37,550
a game where cats win I think the
problem is the cats don't tend to be

6174
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:37,560
problem is the cats don't tend to be
 

6175
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:39,050
problem is the cats don't tend to be
that interested in what's happening on

6176
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:39,060
that interested in what's happening on
 

6177
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:41,810
that interested in what's happening on
the iPad yeah that's an interface issue

6178
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:41,820
the iPad yeah that's an interface issue
 

6179
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:44,330
the iPad yeah that's an interface issue
probably yeah right right no I I think

6180
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:44,340
probably yeah right right no I I think
 

6181
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:48,350
probably yeah right right no I I think
it is likely that I mean you know there

6182
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:48,360
it is likely that I mean you know there
 

6183
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,609
it is likely that I mean you know there
are plenty of animals that would

6184
01:55:49,609 --> 01:55:49,619
are plenty of animals that would
 

6185
01:55:49,619 --> 01:55:51,830
are plenty of animals that would
successfully eat us if we were you know

6186
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:51,840
successfully eat us if we were you know
 

6187
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,169
successfully eat us if we were you know
if we were exposed to them and so

6188
01:55:54,169 --> 01:55:54,179
if we were exposed to them and so
 

6189
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:56,450
if we were exposed to them and so
there's you know it it's gonna pounce

6190
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:56,460
there's you know it it's gonna pounce
 

6191
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,430
there's you know it it's gonna pounce
faster than we can get out of the way

6192
01:55:58,430 --> 01:55:58,440
faster than we can get out of the way
 

6193
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:00,770
faster than we can get out of the way
and so on so there are plenty of and and

6194
01:56:00,770 --> 01:56:00,780
and so on so there are plenty of and and
 

6195
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:02,870
and so on so there are plenty of and and
probably it's going to you know we think

6196
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:02,880
probably it's going to you know we think
 

6197
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,609
probably it's going to you know we think
we've hidden ourselves but we haven't

6198
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:04,619
we've hidden ourselves but we haven't
 

6199
01:56:04,619 --> 01:56:06,169
we've hidden ourselves but we haven't
successfully hidden ourselves that's a

6200
01:56:06,169 --> 01:56:06,179
successfully hidden ourselves that's a
 

6201
01:56:06,179 --> 01:56:08,570
successfully hidden ourselves that's a
physical strength I wonder if there's uh

6202
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:08,580
physical strength I wonder if there's uh
 

6203
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:10,430
physical strength I wonder if there's uh
something in more in the realm of uh

6204
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:10,440
something in more in the realm of uh
 

6205
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:13,609
something in more in the realm of uh
intelligence where an animal like a cat

6206
01:56:13,609 --> 01:56:13,619
intelligence where an animal like a cat
 

6207
01:56:13,619 --> 01:56:15,950
intelligence where an animal like a cat
could out well I think there are things

6208
01:56:15,950 --> 01:56:15,960
could out well I think there are things
 

6209
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:18,109
could out well I think there are things
certainly in terms of the the speed of

6210
01:56:18,109 --> 01:56:18,119
certainly in terms of the the speed of
 

6211
01:56:18,119 --> 01:56:20,030
certainly in terms of the the speed of
processing certain kinds of things for

6212
01:56:20,030 --> 01:56:20,040
processing certain kinds of things for
 

6213
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,970
processing certain kinds of things for
sure I mean the the question of what you

6214
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:22,980
sure I mean the the question of what you
 

6215
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:24,950
sure I mean the the question of what you
know is there a game of chess for

6216
01:56:24,950 --> 01:56:24,960
know is there a game of chess for
 

6217
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,350
know is there a game of chess for
example is there cat chess yeah that the

6218
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:27,360
example is there cat chess yeah that the
 

6219
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:29,330
example is there cat chess yeah that the
cats could play against each other and

6220
01:56:29,330 --> 01:56:29,340
cats could play against each other and
 

6221
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:30,770
cats could play against each other and
if we tried to play a cat we don't

6222
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:30,780
if we tried to play a cat we don't
 

6223
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:33,530
if we tried to play a cat we don't
always lose I don't know you might have

6224
01:56:33,530 --> 01:56:33,540
always lose I don't know you might have
 

6225
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:35,390
always lose I don't know you might have
to do with speed but it might have to do

6226
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:35,400
to do with speed but it might have to do
 

6227
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,609
to do with speed but it might have to do
with Concepts also there might be

6228
01:56:37,609 --> 01:56:37,619
with Concepts also there might be
 

6229
01:56:37,619 --> 01:56:40,910
with Concepts also there might be
Concepts and the cats had I I tend to

6230
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:40,920
Concepts and the cats had I I tend to
 

6231
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:43,970
Concepts and the cats had I I tend to
think that our species from its

6232
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:43,980
think that our species from its
 

6233
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,890
think that our species from its
invention of language has managed to

6234
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:45,900
invention of language has managed to
 

6235
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:47,570
invention of language has managed to
build up this kind of tower of

6236
01:56:47,570 --> 01:56:47,580
build up this kind of tower of
 

6237
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:50,570
build up this kind of tower of
abstraction that for things like a

6238
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:50,580
abstraction that for things like a
 

6239
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:53,270
abstraction that for things like a
chess-like game will make us win in

6240
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:53,280
chess-like game will make us win in
 

6241
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,010
chess-like game will make us win in
other words we've become through the

6242
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:55,020
other words we've become through the
 

6243
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:57,229
other words we've become through the
fact that we've kind of experienced

6244
01:56:57,229 --> 01:56:57,239
fact that we've kind of experienced
 

6245
01:56:57,239 --> 01:57:00,109
fact that we've kind of experienced
language and learned abstraction you

6246
01:57:00,109 --> 01:57:00,119
language and learned abstraction you
 

6247
01:57:00,119 --> 01:57:01,910
language and learned abstraction you
know we've sort of become smarter at

6248
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:01,920
know we've sort of become smarter at
 

6249
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,290
know we've sort of become smarter at
those kinds of abstract kinds of things

6250
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:03,300
those kinds of abstract kinds of things
 

6251
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:05,330
those kinds of abstract kinds of things
now you know that doesn't make us

6252
01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:05,340
now you know that doesn't make us
 

6253
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,910
now you know that doesn't make us
smarter at catching a mouse or something

6254
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:07,920
smarter at catching a mouse or something
 

6255
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,250
smarter at catching a mouse or something
it makes us smarter at the things that

6256
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:10,260
it makes us smarter at the things that
 

6257
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:13,129
it makes us smarter at the things that
we've chosen to to sort of con you know

6258
01:57:13,129 --> 01:57:13,139
we've chosen to to sort of con you know
 

6259
01:57:13,139 --> 01:57:15,410
we've chosen to to sort of con you know
concern ourselves which are these kind

6260
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:15,420
concern ourselves which are these kind
 

6261
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:17,870
concern ourselves which are these kind
of abstract things yeah and I think you

6262
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:17,880
of abstract things yeah and I think you
 

6263
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,250
of abstract things yeah and I think you
know this is again back to the question

6264
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:19,260
know this is again back to the question
 

6265
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:21,109
know this is again back to the question
of of you know what does one care about

6266
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:21,119
of of you know what does one care about
 

6267
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:23,990
of of you know what does one care about
you know if one's a if one's the you

6268
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,000
you know if one's a if one's the you
 

6269
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,729
you know if one's a if one's the you
know the cat if you if you have the

6270
01:57:25,729 --> 01:57:25,739
know the cat if you if you have the
 

6271
01:57:25,739 --> 01:57:27,470
know the cat if you if you have the
discussion with a cat if we can if we

6272
01:57:27,470 --> 01:57:27,480
discussion with a cat if we can if we
 

6273
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:28,790
discussion with a cat if we can if we
can translate things to have the

6274
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:28,800
can translate things to have the
 

6275
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,310
can translate things to have the
discussion with a cat the cat will say I

6276
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:31,320
discussion with a cat the cat will say I
 

6277
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:35,930
discussion with a cat the cat will say I
you know I'm very excited that uh this

6278
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:35,940
you know I'm very excited that uh this
 

6279
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:36,950
you know I'm very excited that uh this
light

6280
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:36,960
light
 

6281
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:40,310
light
is moving and we'll say why do you care

6282
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:40,320
is moving and we'll say why do you care
 

6283
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,470
is moving and we'll say why do you care
and the cat will say that's the most

6284
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:42,480
and the cat will say that's the most
 

6285
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,089
and the cat will say that's the most
important thing in the world yeah that

6286
01:57:44,089 --> 01:57:44,099
important thing in the world yeah that
 

6287
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:46,010
important thing in the world yeah that
this thing moves around I mean it's like

6288
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:46,020
this thing moves around I mean it's like
 

6289
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:48,410
this thing moves around I mean it's like
when you ask about I don't know you you

6290
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:48,420
when you ask about I don't know you you
 

6291
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:50,330
when you ask about I don't know you you
look at archaeological remains and you

6292
01:57:50,330 --> 01:57:50,340
look at archaeological remains and you
 

6293
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:52,550
look at archaeological remains and you
say these people had this you know

6294
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
say these people had this you know
 

6295
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,709
say these people had this you know
belief system about this and you know

6296
01:57:54,709 --> 01:57:54,719
belief system about this and you know
 

6297
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:56,330
belief system about this and you know
that was the most important thing in the

6298
01:57:56,330 --> 01:57:56,340
that was the most important thing in the
 

6299
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,649
that was the most important thing in the
world to them

6300
01:57:57,649 --> 01:57:57,659
world to them
 

6301
01:57:57,659 --> 01:57:59,510
world to them
um and and now we look at it and say we

6302
01:57:59,510 --> 01:57:59,520
um and and now we look at it and say we
 

6303
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,589
um and and now we look at it and say we
don't know what the point is but it was

6304
01:58:00,589 --> 01:58:00,599
don't know what the point is but it was
 

6305
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:02,209
don't know what the point is but it was
I mean I I've been curious you know that

6306
01:58:02,209 --> 01:58:02,219
I mean I I've been curious you know that
 

6307
01:58:02,219 --> 01:58:04,910
I mean I I've been curious you know that
these hand prints on caves from 20 000

6308
01:58:04,910 --> 01:58:04,920
these hand prints on caves from 20 000
 

6309
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:07,250
these hand prints on caves from 20 000
or more years ago and it's like nobody

6310
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:07,260
or more years ago and it's like nobody
 

6311
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:08,689
or more years ago and it's like nobody
knows what these handprints were there

6312
01:58:08,689 --> 01:58:08,699
knows what these handprints were there
 

6313
01:58:08,699 --> 01:58:11,689
knows what these handprints were there
for you know that they may have been a

6314
01:58:11,689 --> 01:58:11,699
for you know that they may have been a
 

6315
01:58:11,699 --> 01:58:13,250
for you know that they may have been a
representation of the most important

6316
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:13,260
representation of the most important
 

6317
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:15,169
representation of the most important
thing you can imagine they may just have

6318
01:58:15,169 --> 01:58:15,179
thing you can imagine they may just have
 

6319
01:58:15,179 --> 01:58:17,510
thing you can imagine they may just have
been some you know some kid who who

6320
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:17,520
been some you know some kid who who
 

6321
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,189
been some you know some kid who who
rubbed their hands in the mud and stuck

6322
01:58:19,189 --> 01:58:19,199
rubbed their hands in the mud and stuck
 

6323
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:21,050
rubbed their hands in the mud and stuck
them on the walls of the cave you know

6324
01:58:21,050 --> 01:58:21,060
them on the walls of the cave you know
 

6325
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:23,450
them on the walls of the cave you know
we don't we don't know and I think but

6326
01:58:23,450 --> 01:58:23,460
we don't we don't know and I think but
 

6327
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:26,629
we don't we don't know and I think but
this this whole question of what

6328
01:58:26,629 --> 01:58:26,639
this this whole question of what
 

6329
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:28,550
this this whole question of what
um you know is

6330
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:28,560
um you know is
 

6331
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,609
um you know is
when you say uh this question of sort of

6332
01:58:31,609 --> 01:58:31,619
when you say uh this question of sort of
 

6333
01:58:31,619 --> 01:58:34,129
when you say uh this question of sort of
what's the smartest thing around there's

6334
01:58:34,129 --> 01:58:34,139
what's the smartest thing around there's
 

6335
01:58:34,139 --> 01:58:36,530
what's the smartest thing around there's
the question of what kind of computation

6336
01:58:36,530 --> 01:58:36,540
the question of what kind of computation
 

6337
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:38,570
the question of what kind of computation
are you trying to do if you're saying

6338
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:38,580
are you trying to do if you're saying
 

6339
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,390
are you trying to do if you're saying
you know if you say you've got some

6340
01:58:41,390 --> 01:58:41,400
you know if you say you've got some
 

6341
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:43,729
you know if you say you've got some
well-defined computation and how do you

6342
01:58:43,729 --> 01:58:43,739
well-defined computation and how do you
 

6343
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:45,530
well-defined computation and how do you
implement it well you could implement it

6344
01:58:45,530 --> 01:58:45,540
implement it well you could implement it
 

6345
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:48,470
implement it well you could implement it
by nerve cells you know firing you can

6346
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,480

01:59:01,669 --> 01:59:01,679
different ways to implement it and you
 

6359
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:04,550
different ways to implement it and you
know I think this question of of uh of

6360
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:04,560
know I think this question of of uh of
 

6361
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,709
know I think this question of of uh of
sort of which you know those different

6362
01:59:06,709 --> 01:59:06,719
sort of which you know those different
 

6363
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:08,450

different speeds they'll be able to do
 

6367
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:13,189
different speeds they'll be able to do
different things if you say uh you know

01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:13,199
different things if you say uh you know
 

6369
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:15,229
different things if you say uh you know
which so an interesting question would

6370
01:59:15,229 --> 01:59:15,239
which so an interesting question would
 

6371
01:59:15,239 --> 01:59:16,250

just as they have extended I mean there
 

6459
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:56,510
just as they have extended I mean there
are plenty of things where we see them

with technology and now we understand
 

6465
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:02,450
with technology and now we understand
what that is but if we'd never seen that

02:01:02,450 --> 02:01:02,460
what that is but if we'd never seen that
 

6467
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:04,490
what that is but if we'd never seen that
kind of thing we wouldn't have a way to

they're moving far away in rural space
 

6531
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:22,669
they're moving far away in rural space
but they're still sharing physical

Resources with us yes yes so they can

6534
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:25,560
Resources with us yes yes so they can
 

6535
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,470
Resources with us yes yes so they can
rob us of those physical resources and

6536
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:27,480
rob us of those physical resources and

yeah just just uh like nature code like

6540
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:33,540
yeah just just uh like nature code like
 

6541
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,330
yeah just just uh like nature code like
nature could but it seems like there's

02:02:35,330 --> 02:02:35,340
nature could but it seems like there's

um

6546
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:40,380
um
 

6547
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:43,609
um
there is a this kind of exponential

6548
02:02:43,609 --> 02:02:43,619
there is a this kind of exponential
 

6549
02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:47,510
there is a this kind of exponential
growth like the way well sorry Nature

6550
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:47,520
growth like the way well sorry Nature
 

6551
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,310

has so many things in it one of the

6552
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:49,320
has so many things in it one of the
 

6553
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:50,930
has so many things in it one of the
things that nature has which is very

6554
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:50,940
things that nature has which is very
 

6555
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:52,629
things that nature has which is very
interesting are viruses for example

6556
02:02:52,629 --> 02:02:52,639
interesting are viruses for example
 

6557
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:55,370
interesting are viruses for example
there is systems within nature that have

6558
02:02:55,370 --> 02:02:55,380
there is systems within nature that have
 

6559
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:57,709
there is systems within nature that have
this kind of exponential effect

6560
02:02:57,709 --> 02:02:57,719
this kind of exponential effect
 

6561
02:02:57,719 --> 02:02:59,990
this kind of exponential effect
and that terrifies us humans because it

6562
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,000
and that terrifies us humans because it
 

6563
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,209
and that terrifies us humans because it
can you know there's only eight billion

6564
02:03:02,209 --> 02:03:02,219
can you know there's only eight billion
 

6565
02:03:02,219 --> 02:03:03,950
can you know there's only eight billion
of us and you can just kind of

02:03:03,950 --> 02:03:03,960
of us and you can just kind of
 

6567
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,810

it's not that hard to just kind of whack

6568
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:05,820
it's not that hard to just kind of whack
 

6569
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:09,169
it's not that hard to just kind of whack
them all real quick so uh I mean is that

6570
02:03:09,169 --> 02:03:09,179
them all real quick so uh I mean is that
 

6571
02:03:09,179 --> 02:03:11,510
them all real quick so uh I mean is that
something you think about that yeah I

6572
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:11,520
something you think about that yeah I
 

6573
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,850
something you think about that yeah I
thought about that yes the threat of it

6574
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:13,860
thought about that yes the threat of it
 

6575
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:16,070
thought about that yes the threat of it
yeah you as concerned about it as uh

you know it's just like somebody says
 

6605
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:53,930
you know it's just like somebody says
I'm going to oh I don't know somebody

we're going to release this and it's
 

6611
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:59,689
we're going to release this and it's
going to do all this harm but then it

6612
02:03:59,689 --> 02:03:59,699
going to do all this harm but then it
 

6613
02:03:59,699 --> 02:04:01,129
going to do all this harm but then it
turns out it's more complicated than

6614
02:04:01,129 --> 02:04:01,139
turns out it's more complicated than
 

6615
02:04:01,139 --> 02:04:03,830
turns out it's more complicated than
that because you know the kind of some

6616
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:03,840
that because you know the kind of some

02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:07,129
humans are different and you know the
exact way it works is a little different

exact way it works is a little different
 

6621
02:04:07,139 --> 02:04:09,350
exact way it works is a little different
than you expect it's something where

02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:09,360
than you expect it's something where
 

6623
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:12,410
than you expect it's something where
sort of the the the great big you you

sort of the the the great big you you
 

6625
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:14,030
sort of the the the great big you you
know you smash the thing with something

02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:17,870
you know you the asteroid collides with

the Earth yeah and it kind of you know
 

6631
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:20,209
the Earth yeah and it kind of you know
and yes you know the Earth is cold for

and yes you know the Earth is cold for
 

6633
02:04:20,219 --> 02:04:22,970
and yes you know the Earth is cold for
two years or something and you know then

02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:22,980
two years or something and you know then
 

6635
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:24,530

usually I mean I I kind of this is in a
sense the sort of story of computational

6642
02:04:31,189 --> 02:04:31,199
sense the sort of story of computational

unexpected Corners there always
 

6647
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,649
unexpected Corners there always
unexpected consequences and I don't

6648
02:04:36,649 --> 02:04:36,659
unexpected consequences and I don't
 

6649
02:04:36,659 --> 02:04:38,390
unexpected consequences and I don't
think that they're kind of whack it over

6650
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:38,400
think that they're kind of whack it over
 

6651
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,310
think that they're kind of whack it over
the head with something and then it's

6652
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:40,320
the head with something and then it's
 

6653
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,070
the head with something and then it's
all gone is you know that can obviously

6654
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:43,080
all gone is you know that can obviously
 

6655
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:44,629
all gone is you know that can obviously
happen the Earth can be swallowed up in

6656
02:04:44,629 --> 02:04:44,639
happen the Earth can be swallowed up in
 

6657
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:46,310
happen the Earth can be swallowed up in
a black hole or something and then it's

6658
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:46,320
a black hole or something and then it's
 

6659
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:49,850
a black hole or something and then it's
kind of presumably presumably all over

6660
02:04:49,850 --> 02:04:49,860
kind of presumably presumably all over
 

6661
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:52,430
kind of presumably presumably all over
um the uh but but you know I think this

6662
02:04:52,430 --> 02:04:52,440
um the uh but but you know I think this
 

6663
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:54,530
um the uh but but you know I think this
question of of what you know what what

6664
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:54,540
question of of what you know what what
 

6665
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:57,290
question of of what you know what what
do I think the realistic paths are I

6666
02:04:57,290 --> 02:04:57,300
do I think the realistic paths are I
 

6667
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:59,689
do I think the realistic paths are I
think that there will be sort of an

6668
02:04:59,689 --> 02:04:59,699
think that there will be sort of an
 

6669
02:04:59,699 --> 02:05:02,930
think that there will be sort of an
increasing I mean the the people have to

6670
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:02,940
increasing I mean the the people have to
 

6671
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:04,790
increasing I mean the the people have to
get used to phenomena like computational

6672
02:05:04,790 --> 02:05:04,800
get used to phenomena like computational
 

6673
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:07,490
get used to phenomena like computational
irreducibility there's an idea that we

6674
02:05:07,490 --> 02:05:07,500
irreducibility there's an idea that we
 

6675
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:09,169
irreducibility there's an idea that we
built the machines so we can understand

6676
02:05:09,169 --> 02:05:09,179
built the machines so we can understand
 

6677
02:05:09,179 --> 02:05:12,350
built the machines so we can understand
what they do and we're we're going to be

6678
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:12,360
what they do and we're we're going to be
 

6679
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:15,109
what they do and we're we're going to be
able to control what happens well that's

6680
02:05:15,109 --> 02:05:15,119
able to control what happens well that's
 

6681
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:17,810
able to control what happens well that's
not really right now the question is is

6682
02:05:17,810 --> 02:05:17,820
not really right now the question is is
 

6683
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:20,510
not really right now the question is is
the result of that lack of control going

6684
02:05:20,510 --> 02:05:20,520
the result of that lack of control going
 

6685
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:23,030
the result of that lack of control going
to be that the machine's kind of

6686
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:23,040
to be that the machine's kind of
 

6687
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,609
to be that the machine's kind of
conspire and sort of wipe us out maybe

6688
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:25,619
conspire and sort of wipe us out maybe
 

6689
02:05:25,619 --> 02:05:27,709
conspire and sort of wipe us out maybe
just because I'm an optimist I don't

6690
02:05:27,709 --> 02:05:27,719
just because I'm an optimist I don't
 

6691
02:05:27,719 --> 02:05:29,330
just because I'm an optimist I don't
tend to think that that's you know

6692
02:05:29,330 --> 02:05:29,340
tend to think that that's you know
 

6693
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:32,089
tend to think that that's you know
that's in the cards I think that the you

6694
02:05:32,089 --> 02:05:32,099
that's in the cards I think that the you
 

6695
02:05:32,099 --> 02:05:35,810
that's in the cards I think that the you
know as a realistic thing I suspect you

6696
02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:35,820
know as a realistic thing I suspect you
 

6697
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:38,510
know as a realistic thing I suspect you
know what will sort of emerge maybe is

6698
02:05:38,510 --> 02:05:38,520
know what will sort of emerge maybe is
 

6699
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:41,629
know what will sort of emerge maybe is
kind of an ecosystem of the AIS just as

6700
02:05:41,629 --> 02:05:41,639
kind of an ecosystem of the AIS just as
 

6701
02:05:41,639 --> 02:05:43,790
kind of an ecosystem of the AIS just as
you know again I I don't really know I

6702
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:43,800
you know again I I don't really know I
 

6703
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,290
you know again I I don't really know I
mean this is something that's it's hard

6704
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:45,300
mean this is something that's it's hard
 

6705
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:47,990
mean this is something that's it's hard
to it's hard to be clear about what will

6706
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:48,000
to it's hard to be clear about what will
 

6707
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:48,890
to it's hard to be clear about what will
happen

6708
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:48,900
happen
 

6709
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,450
happen
um I mean I think that the you know

6710
02:05:50,450 --> 02:05:50,460
um I mean I think that the you know
 

6711
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:52,370
um I mean I think that the you know
there are there are a lot of sort of

6712
02:05:52,370 --> 02:05:52,380
there are there are a lot of sort of
 

6713
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:55,070
there are there are a lot of sort of
details of you know what could we do

6714
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:55,080
details of you know what could we do
 

6715
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:56,689
details of you know what could we do
what systems in the world could we

6716
02:05:56,689 --> 02:05:56,699
what systems in the world could we
 

6717
02:05:56,699 --> 02:05:58,970
what systems in the world could we
connect and AI to you know I have to say

6718
02:05:58,970 --> 02:05:58,980
connect and AI to you know I have to say
 

6719
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:01,490
connect and AI to you know I have to say
I was just a couple of days ago I was

6720
02:06:01,490 --> 02:06:01,500
I was just a couple of days ago I was
 

6721
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,149
I was just a couple of days ago I was
working on this uh chat gbt plug-in kit

6722
02:06:05,149 --> 02:06:05,159
working on this uh chat gbt plug-in kit
 

6723
02:06:05,159 --> 02:06:06,770
working on this uh chat gbt plug-in kit
that we have for open language okay

6724
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:06,780
that we have for open language okay
 

6725
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:09,830
that we have for open language okay
where you can you know you can create a

6726
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:09,840
where you can you know you can create a
 

6727
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,950
where you can you know you can create a
plugin and it runs with language code

6728
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:12,960
plugin and it runs with language code
 

6729
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,030
plugin and it runs with language code
um and it can run more from language

6730
02:06:14,030 --> 02:06:14,040
um and it can run more from language
 

6731
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:16,370
um and it can run more from language
code back on your own computer yeah and

6732
02:06:16,370 --> 02:06:16,380
code back on your own computer yeah and
 

6733
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:18,589
code back on your own computer yeah and
I was thinking well I can just make it

6734
02:06:18,589 --> 02:06:18,599
I was thinking well I can just make it
 

6735
02:06:18,599 --> 02:06:20,930
I was thinking well I can just make it
you know I can tell chat gbt create a

6736
02:06:20,930 --> 02:06:20,940
you know I can tell chat gbt create a
 

6737
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:23,089
you know I can tell chat gbt create a
piece of code and then just run it on my

6738
02:06:23,089 --> 02:06:23,099
piece of code and then just run it on my
 

6739
02:06:23,099 --> 02:06:25,729
piece of code and then just run it on my
computer and I'm like you know that that

6740
02:06:25,729 --> 02:06:25,739
computer and I'm like you know that that
 

6741
02:06:25,739 --> 02:06:28,070
computer and I'm like you know that that
sort of personalizes for me the what

6742
02:06:28,070 --> 02:06:28,080
sort of personalizes for me the what
 

6743
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:30,109
sort of personalizes for me the what
could what could possibly go wrong so to

6744
02:06:30,109 --> 02:06:30,119
could what could possibly go wrong so to
 

6745
02:06:30,119 --> 02:06:32,030
could what could possibly go wrong so to
speak was that exciting or scary that

6746
02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:32,040
speak was that exciting or scary that
 

6747
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:33,169
speak was that exciting or scary that
possibility

6748
02:06:33,169 --> 02:06:33,179
possibility
 

6749
02:06:33,179 --> 02:06:34,609
possibility
it was a little bit scary actually

6750
02:06:34,609 --> 02:06:34,619
it was a little bit scary actually
 

6751
02:06:34,619 --> 02:06:36,830
it was a little bit scary actually
because it's kind of like like I realize

6752
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:36,840
because it's kind of like like I realize
 

6753
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:39,470
because it's kind of like like I realize
I'm I'm delegating to the AI just write

6754
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:39,480
I'm I'm delegating to the AI just write
 

6755
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:41,810
I'm I'm delegating to the AI just write
a piece of code you know you're in

6756
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:41,820
a piece of code you know you're in
 

6757
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:43,430
a piece of code you know you're in
charge write a piece of code run it on

6758
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:43,440
charge write a piece of code run it on
 

6759
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:44,330
charge write a piece of code run it on
my computer

6760
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:44,340
my computer
 

6761
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:46,430
my computer
and pretty soon all my files exactly

6762
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:46,440
and pretty soon all my files exactly
 

6763
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:48,530
and pretty soon all my files exactly
let's take a uh that's like Russian

6764
02:06:48,530 --> 02:06:48,540
let's take a uh that's like Russian
 

6765
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,510
let's take a uh that's like Russian
Roulette but like much more complicated

6766
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:50,520
Roulette but like much more complicated
 

6767
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:53,149
Roulette but like much more complicated
yeah yes yes right that's a good

6768
02:06:53,149 --> 02:06:53,159
yeah yes yes right that's a good
 

6769
02:06:53,159 --> 02:06:56,510
yeah yes yes right that's a good
drinking game I don't know so well uh

6770
02:06:56,510 --> 02:06:56,520
drinking game I don't know so well uh
 

6771
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,270
drinking game I don't know so well uh
right I mean

6772
02:06:58,270 --> 02:06:58,280
right I mean
 

6773
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:01,070
right I mean
it's an interesting question then if you

6774
02:07:01,070 --> 02:07:01,080
it's an interesting question then if you
 

6775
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:03,410
it's an interesting question then if you
do that right what is the sandboxing

6776
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:03,420
do that right what is the sandboxing
 

6777
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:04,910
do that right what is the sandboxing
that you should have and that's sort of

6778
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:04,920
that you should have and that's sort of
 

6779
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:07,310
that you should have and that's sort of
a that's a a version of of that question

6780
02:07:07,310 --> 02:07:07,320
a that's a a version of of that question
 

6781
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:09,470
a that's a a version of of that question
for the world that is as soon as you put

6782
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:09,480
for the world that is as soon as you put
 

6783
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:12,109
for the world that is as soon as you put
the AIS in charge of things you know how

6784
02:07:12,109 --> 02:07:12,119
the AIS in charge of things you know how
 

6785
02:07:12,119 --> 02:07:14,030
the AIS in charge of things you know how
much how many constraints should there

6786
02:07:14,030 --> 02:07:14,040
much how many constraints should there
 

6787
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,370
much how many constraints should there
be on these systems before you put the

6788
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:16,380
be on these systems before you put the
 

6789
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:18,410
be on these systems before you put the
AIS in charge of all the weapons and all

6790
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:18,420
AIS in charge of all the weapons and all
 

6791
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:19,910
AIS in charge of all the weapons and all
these you know all these different kinds

6792
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:19,920
these you know all these different kinds
 

6793
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,290
these you know all these different kinds
of systems well here's the fun part

6794
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:21,300
of systems well here's the fun part
 

6795
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:24,410
of systems well here's the fun part
about sandboxes is uh the AI knows about

6796
02:07:24,410 --> 02:07:24,420
about sandboxes is uh the AI knows about
 

6797
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:28,070
about sandboxes is uh the AI knows about
them it has the tools to uh crack them

6798
02:07:28,070 --> 02:07:28,080
them it has the tools to uh crack them
 

6799
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,290
them it has the tools to uh crack them
look the fundamental problem of computer

6800
02:07:30,290 --> 02:07:30,300
look the fundamental problem of computer
 

6801
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:32,510
look the fundamental problem of computer
security is computational irreducibility

6802
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:32,520
security is computational irreducibility
 

6803
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:36,530
security is computational irreducibility
yes because the fact is any sandbox is

6804
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:36,540
yes because the fact is any sandbox is
 

6805
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:38,629
yes because the fact is any sandbox is
never any you know it's never going to

6806
02:07:38,629 --> 02:07:38,639
never any you know it's never going to
 

6807
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:40,609
never any you know it's never going to
be a perfect sandbox if you want the

6808
02:07:40,609 --> 02:07:40,619
be a perfect sandbox if you want the
 

6809
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:42,830
be a perfect sandbox if you want the
system to be able to do interesting

6810
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:42,840
system to be able to do interesting
 

6811
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:44,689
system to be able to do interesting

02:07:59,270 --> 02:07:59,280
way to poke it so that you actually get
 

6827
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:01,370

it's just so many things could happen
 

6853
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:28,370
it's just so many things could happen
because in digital space things move so

quickly you can have a chat bot you can

6856
02:08:30,050 --> 02:08:30,060
quickly you can have a chat bot you can
 

6857
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:32,209
quickly you can have a chat bot you can
have a piece of code that

you know in a sense we've had the loop

6874
02:08:51,770 --> 02:08:51,780
you know in a sense we've had the loop
 

6875
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:54,169
you know in a sense we've had the loop
of the machine learning Loop of making

surely going to get easier to do yeah

6880
02:08:58,550 --> 02:08:58,560
surely going to get easier to do yeah
 

6881
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,490
surely going to get easier to do yeah
and you know then what does that look

6882
02:09:01,490 --> 02:09:01,500
and you know then what does that look
 

6883
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:04,250
and you know then what does that look
like well it's again you know we humans

6884
02:09:04,250 --> 02:09:04,260
like well it's again you know we humans
 

6885
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:06,950
like well it's again you know we humans
are you know we're this is a new

6886
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:06,960
are you know we're this is a new
 

6887
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:10,189
are you know we're this is a new
environment for us and admittedly it's

6888
02:09:10,189 --> 02:09:10,199
environment for us and admittedly it's
 

6889
02:09:10,199 --> 02:09:11,390
environment for us and admittedly it's
an environment which a little bit

6890
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:11,400
an environment which a little bit
 

6891
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,729
an environment which a little bit
scarily is is changing much more rapidly

6892
02:09:13,729 --> 02:09:13,739
scarily is is changing much more rapidly
 

6893
02:09:13,739 --> 02:09:16,370
scarily is is changing much more rapidly
but than I mean you know people worry

6894
02:09:16,370 --> 02:09:16,380
but than I mean you know people worry
 

6895
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:17,689
but than I mean you know people worry
about you know climate change is going

6896
02:09:17,689 --> 02:09:17,699
about you know climate change is going
 

6897
02:09:17,699 --> 02:09:19,729
about you know climate change is going
to happen over hundreds of years and you

6898
02:09:19,729 --> 02:09:19,739
to happen over hundreds of years and you
 

6899
02:09:19,739 --> 02:09:21,770
to happen over hundreds of years and you
know the environment is changing but the

6900
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:21,780
know the environment is changing but the
 

6901
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:24,169
know the environment is changing but the
environment for you know in the the kind

6902
02:09:24,169 --> 02:09:24,179
environment for you know in the the kind
 

6903
02:09:24,179 --> 02:09:26,089
environment for you know in the the kind
of digital environment might change in

6904
02:09:26,089 --> 02:09:26,099
of digital environment might change in
 

6905
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:27,589
of digital environment might change in
in six months

6906
02:09:27,589 --> 02:09:27,599
in six months
 

6907
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:30,950
in six months
so one of uh the relevant

6908
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:30,960
so one of uh the relevant
 

6909
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:34,189
so one of uh the relevant
concerns here in terms of the uh impact

6910
02:09:34,189 --> 02:09:34,199
concerns here in terms of the uh impact
 

6911
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:37,189
concerns here in terms of the uh impact
of GPT on society is the nature of Truth

6912
02:09:37,189 --> 02:09:37,199
of GPT on society is the nature of Truth
 

6913
02:09:37,199 --> 02:09:39,470
of GPT on society is the nature of Truth
that's relevant to Wolfram Alpha because

6914
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:39,480
that's relevant to Wolfram Alpha because
 

6915
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:41,209
that's relevant to Wolfram Alpha because
computation

6916
02:09:41,209 --> 02:09:41,219
computation
 

6917
02:09:41,219 --> 02:09:43,609
computation
through symbolic reasoning that's

6918
02:09:43,609 --> 02:09:43,619
through symbolic reasoning that's
 

6919
02:09:43,619 --> 02:09:45,830
through symbolic reasoning that's
embodied in Wolfram Alpha is the

6920
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:45,840
embodied in Wolfram Alpha is the
 

6921
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:48,229
embodied in Wolfram Alpha is the
interface there's a kind of sense that

6922
02:09:48,229 --> 02:09:48,239
interface there's a kind of sense that
 

6923
02:09:48,239 --> 02:09:51,490
interface there's a kind of sense that
what Wolfram Alpha tells me is true

6924
02:09:51,490 --> 02:09:51,500
what Wolfram Alpha tells me is true
 

6925
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:53,629
what Wolfram Alpha tells me is true
so we hope

6926
02:09:53,629 --> 02:09:53,639
so we hope
 

6927
02:09:53,639 --> 02:09:55,970
so we hope
yeah I mean you could probably analyze

6928
02:09:55,970 --> 02:09:55,980
yeah I mean you could probably analyze
 

6929
02:09:55,980 --> 02:09:57,830
yeah I mean you could probably analyze
that you could show

6930
02:09:57,830 --> 02:09:57,840
that you could show
 

6931
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,270
that you could show
you can't prove that it's always going

6932
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,280
you can't prove that it's always going
 

6933
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:02,270
you can't prove that it's always going
to be true computational disability uh

6934
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:02,280
to be true computational disability uh
 

6935
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:04,490
to be true computational disability uh
but it's gonna be more

6936
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:04,500
but it's gonna be more
 

6937
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:08,089
but it's gonna be more
true than not it's look the fact is it

6938
02:10:08,089 --> 02:10:08,099
true than not it's look the fact is it
 

6939
02:10:08,099 --> 02:10:10,070
true than not it's look the fact is it
will be the correct consequence of the

6940
02:10:10,070 --> 02:10:10,080
will be the correct consequence of the

talks about the real world you know that

6944
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:15,540
talks about the real world you know that
 

6945
02:10:15,540 --> 02:10:18,169
talks about the real world you know that
is our job in sort of curating and

6946
02:10:18,169 --> 02:10:18,179
is our job in sort of curating and
 

6947
02:10:18,179 --> 02:10:20,450
is our job in sort of curating and
collecting data to make sure that that

6948
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:20,460
collecting data to make sure that that
 

6949
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:22,790
collecting data to make sure that that
data is quotes as true as possible now

6950
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:22,800
data is quotes as true as possible now
 

6951
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,890
data is quotes as true as possible now
what does that mean well you know it's

6952
02:10:24,890 --> 02:10:24,900
what does that mean well you know it's
 

6953
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:27,169
what does that mean well you know it's
always an interesting question I mean

6954
02:10:27,169 --> 02:10:27,179
always an interesting question I mean
 

6955
02:10:27,179 --> 02:10:30,290
always an interesting question I mean
for us our operational definition of

6956
02:10:30,290 --> 02:10:30,300
for us our operational definition of
 

6957
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:31,850
for us our operational definition of
truth is

6958
02:10:31,850 --> 02:10:31,860
truth is
 

6959
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,770
truth is
you know somebody says who's the best

6960
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:33,780
you know somebody says who's the best
 

6961
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:35,450
you know somebody says who's the best
actress

6962
02:10:35,450 --> 02:10:35,460
actress
 

6963
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:38,990
actress
who knows but somebody won the Oscar and

6964
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:39,000
who knows but somebody won the Oscar and
 

6965
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,390
who knows but somebody won the Oscar and
that's a definite fact yeah and so you

6966
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:41,400
that's a definite fact yeah and so you
 

6967
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:43,189
that's a definite fact yeah and so you
know that's the kind of thing that we

6968
02:10:43,189 --> 02:10:43,199
know that's the kind of thing that we
 

6969
02:10:43,199 --> 02:10:45,290
know that's the kind of thing that we
can make computational as a piece of

6970
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:45,300
can make computational as a piece of
 

6971
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:48,229
can make computational as a piece of
truth if you ask you know these things

6972
02:10:48,229 --> 02:10:48,239
truth if you ask you know these things
 

6973
02:10:48,239 --> 02:10:50,510
truth if you ask you know these things
which you know a sensor measured this

6974
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:50,520
which you know a sensor measured this
 

6975
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:52,910
which you know a sensor measured this
thing it did it this way a machine

6976
02:10:52,910 --> 02:10:52,920
thing it did it this way a machine
 

6977
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,530

02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:56,580
Learning System recognized this thing
 

6981
02:10:56,580 --> 02:11:00,050
Learning System recognized this thing
that's a that's a sort of a definite uh

6982
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:00,060
that's a that's a sort of a definite uh
 

6983
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:04,010
that's a that's a sort of a definite uh
effect so to speak and that's uh you

6984
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:04,020
effect so to speak and that's uh you
 

6985
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:05,930
effect so to speak and that's uh you
know there are there is a good network

6986
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:05,940
know there are there is a good network
 

6987
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:08,209
know there are there is a good network
of those things in the world it's

6988
02:11:08,209 --> 02:11:08,219
of those things in the world it's
 

6989
02:11:08,219 --> 02:11:09,830
of those things in the world it's
certainly the case that uh particularly

6990
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:09,840
certainly the case that uh particularly
 

6991
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:12,850
certainly the case that uh particularly
when you say is so and so a good person

6992
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:12,860
when you say is so and so a good person
 

6993
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:16,129
when you say is so and so a good person
you know that's a that's a hopelessly

6994
02:11:16,129 --> 02:11:16,139
you know that's a that's a hopelessly
 

6995
02:11:16,139 --> 02:11:18,050
you know that's a that's a hopelessly
you know we might have a computational

6996
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:18,060
you know we might have a computational
 

6997
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:19,850
you know we might have a computational
language definition of good I don't

6998
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:19,860
language definition of good I don't
 

6999
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:21,530
language definition of good I don't
think it'd be very interesting because

7000
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:21,540
think it'd be very interesting because
 

7001
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:24,890
think it'd be very interesting because
that's a very messy kind of concept not

7002
02:11:24,890 --> 02:11:24,900
that's a very messy kind of concept not
 

7003
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:28,189
that's a very messy kind of concept not
really amenable to uh kind of you know

7004
02:11:28,189 --> 02:11:28,199
really amenable to uh kind of you know
 

7005
02:11:28,199 --> 02:11:29,990
really amenable to uh kind of you know
that I think as far as we will get with

7006
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:30,000
that I think as far as we will get with
 

7007
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,910
that I think as far as we will get with
those kinds of things is I want X

7008
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:31,920
those kinds of things is I want X
 

7009
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:34,250
those kinds of things is I want X
there's a kind of meaningful calculus of

7010
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:34,260
there's a kind of meaningful calculus of
 

7011
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:36,109
there's a kind of meaningful calculus of
I want X

7012
02:11:36,109 --> 02:11:36,119
I want X
 

7013
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:38,270
I want X
um and that has various consequences I

7014
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:38,280
um and that has various consequences I
 

7015
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,589
um and that has various consequences I
mean I'm not sure I haven't I haven't

7016
02:11:39,589 --> 02:11:39,599
mean I'm not sure I haven't I haven't
 

7017
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:40,970
mean I'm not sure I haven't I haven't
thought this through properly but I

7018
02:11:40,970 --> 02:11:40,980
thought this through properly but I
 

7019
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:43,070
thought this through properly but I
think you know a concept like is so and

7020
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:43,080
think you know a concept like is so and
 

7021
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:46,070
think you know a concept like is so and
so a good person is that true or not

7022
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:46,080
so a good person is that true or not
 

7023
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,169
so a good person is that true or not
that's a mess that's a mess that's

7024
02:11:48,169 --> 02:11:48,179
that's a mess that's a mess that's
 

7025
02:11:48,179 --> 02:11:51,830
that's a mess that's a mess that's
amenable to computation I think I think

7026
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:51,840
amenable to computation I think I think
 

7027
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:53,990
amenable to computation I think I think
it's a mess when humans try to Define

7028
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:54,000
it's a mess when humans try to Define
 

7029
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,390
it's a mess when humans try to Define
what's good uh like through legislation

7030
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:56,400
what's good uh like through legislation
 

7031
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,550
what's good uh like through legislation
but when humans try to Define what's

7032
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:58,560
but when humans try to Define what's
 

7033
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,229
but when humans try to Define what's
good through literature

7034
02:12:00,229 --> 02:12:00,239
good through literature
 

7035
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:03,229
good through literature
through uh history books through poetry

7036
02:12:03,229 --> 02:12:03,239
through uh history books through poetry
 

7037
02:12:03,239 --> 02:12:05,149
through uh history books through poetry
it starts well I don't know I mean that

7038
02:12:05,149 --> 02:12:05,159
it starts well I don't know I mean that
 

7039
02:12:05,159 --> 02:12:07,910
it starts well I don't know I mean that
particular thing it's kind of like you

7040
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:07,920
particular thing it's kind of like you
 

7041
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,070
particular thing it's kind of like you
know we're we're going into kind of the

7042
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:10,080
know we're we're going into kind of the
 

7043
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,950
know we're we're going into kind of the
ethics of what what counts as good so to

7044
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:12,960
ethics of what what counts as good so to
 

7045
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:15,470
ethics of what what counts as good so to
speak and you know what do we think is

7046
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:15,480
speak and you know what do we think is
 

7047
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:18,410
speak and you know what do we think is
right and so on and I think that's a

7048
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:18,420
right and so on and I think that's a
 

7049
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:22,370
right and so on and I think that's a
thing which you know one feature is uh

7050
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:22,380
thing which you know one feature is uh
 

7051
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:24,169
thing which you know one feature is uh
we don't all agree about that there's no

7052
02:12:24,169 --> 02:12:24,179
we don't all agree about that there's no
 

7053
02:12:24,179 --> 02:12:26,870
we don't all agree about that there's no
theorems about kind of uh you know

7054
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:26,880
theorems about kind of uh you know
 

7055
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:28,310
theorems about kind of uh you know
there's no there's no theoretical

7056
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:28,320
there's no there's no theoretical
 

7057
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:32,270
there's no there's no theoretical
framework that says this is this is the

7058
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:32,280
framework that says this is this is the
 

7059
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:34,310
framework that says this is this is the
way that ethics has to be well first of

7060
02:12:34,310 --> 02:12:34,320
way that ethics has to be well first of
 

7061
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,050
way that ethics has to be well first of
all there's stuff we kind of agree on

7062
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:36,060
all there's stuff we kind of agree on
 

7063
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:38,450
all there's stuff we kind of agree on
and there's some empirical backing for

7064
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:38,460
and there's some empirical backing for
 

7065
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:40,850
and there's some empirical backing for
what works and what doesn't from just

7066
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:40,860
what works and what doesn't from just
 

7067
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:42,770
what works and what doesn't from just
even the morals and ethics within

7068
02:12:42,770 --> 02:12:42,780
even the morals and ethics within
 

7069
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:45,830
even the morals and ethics within
religious texts so we seem to mostly

7070
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:45,840
religious texts so we seem to mostly
 

7071
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:48,290
religious texts so we seem to mostly
agree that murder is bad the certain

7072
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:48,300
agree that murder is bad the certain
 

7073
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:50,330
agree that murder is bad the certain
universals that seem to emerge I wonder

7074
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:50,340
universals that seem to emerge I wonder
 

7075
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:53,209
universals that seem to emerge I wonder
where the murder of an AI is bad

7076
02:12:53,209 --> 02:12:53,219
where the murder of an AI is bad
 

7077
02:12:53,219 --> 02:12:57,950
where the murder of an AI is bad
well I tend to think yes but uh and I

7078
02:12:57,950 --> 02:12:57,960
well I tend to think yes but uh and I
 

7079
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:59,149
well I tend to think yes but uh and I
think we're gonna have to contend with

7080
02:12:59,149 --> 02:12:59,159
think we're gonna have to contend with
 

7081
02:12:59,159 --> 02:13:00,530
think we're gonna have to contend with
that question

7082
02:13:00,530 --> 02:13:00,540
that question
 

7083
02:13:00,540 --> 02:13:03,470
that question
oh and I wonder what AI would say yeah

7084
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:03,480
oh and I wonder what AI would say yeah
 

7085
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:05,270
oh and I wonder what AI would say yeah
well I think you know one of the things

7086
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:05,280
well I think you know one of the things
 

7087
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:09,589
well I think you know one of the things
with with AIS is it's one thing to wipe

7088
02:13:09,589 --> 02:13:09,599
with with AIS is it's one thing to wipe
 

7089
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:12,770
with with AIS is it's one thing to wipe
out that AI that is only you know it has

7090
02:13:12,770 --> 02:13:12,780
out that AI that is only you know it has
 

7091
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:14,810
out that AI that is only you know it has
no owner you can even easily imagine an

7092
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:14,820
no owner you can even easily imagine an
 

7093
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:17,569
no owner you can even easily imagine an
AI kind of hanging out on the on the you

7094
02:13:17,569 --> 02:13:17,579
AI kind of hanging out on the on the you
 

7095
02:13:17,579 --> 02:13:19,729
AI kind of hanging out on the on the you
know on on the internet without having

7096
02:13:19,729 --> 02:13:19,739
know on on the internet without having
 

7097
02:13:19,739 --> 02:13:21,350
know on on the internet without having
any particular owner or anything like

7098
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:21,360
any particular owner or anything like
 

7099
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,430
any particular owner or anything like
that

7100
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:22,440
that
 

7101
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:24,709
that
um and then you say well well what harm

7102
02:13:24,709 --> 02:13:24,719
um and then you say well well what harm
 

7103
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:27,109
um and then you say well well what harm
does it you know it's it's okay to get

7104
02:13:27,109 --> 02:13:27,119
does it you know it's it's okay to get
 

7105
02:13:27,119 --> 02:13:30,050
does it you know it's it's okay to get
rid of that AI because of the AI has 10

7106
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:30,060
rid of that AI because of the AI has 10
 

7107
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:32,390
rid of that AI because of the AI has 10
000 friends who are humans and all those

7108
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:32,400
000 friends who are humans and all those
 

7109
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,430
000 friends who are humans and all those
you know all those ten thousand humans

7110
02:13:34,430 --> 02:13:34,440
you know all those ten thousand humans
 

7111
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,350
you know all those ten thousand humans
will be incredibly upset that this AI

7112
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:36,360
will be incredibly upset that this AI
 

7113
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:39,169
will be incredibly upset that this AI
just got exterminated it becomes a

7114
02:13:39,169 --> 02:13:39,179
just got exterminated it becomes a
 

7115
02:13:39,179 --> 02:13:40,729
just got exterminated it becomes a
slightly different more entangled story

7116
02:13:40,729 --> 02:13:40,739
slightly different more entangled story
 

7117
02:13:40,739 --> 02:13:43,069
slightly different more entangled story
but yeah I know I think that this

7118
02:13:43,069 --> 02:13:43,079
but yeah I know I think that this
 

7119
02:13:43,079 --> 02:13:44,750
but yeah I know I think that this
question about what do humans agree

7120
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:44,760
question about what do humans agree
 

7121
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:48,649
question about what do humans agree
about it's uh you know there are certain

7122
02:13:48,649 --> 02:13:48,659
about it's uh you know there are certain
 

7123
02:13:48,659 --> 02:13:51,050
about it's uh you know there are certain
there's certain things that you know

7124
02:13:51,050 --> 02:13:51,060
there's certain things that you know
 

7125
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:53,930
there's certain things that you know
human laws have tended to uh

7126
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:53,940
human laws have tended to uh
 

7127
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:56,270
human laws have tended to uh
consistently agree about

7128
02:13:56,270 --> 02:13:56,280
consistently agree about
 

7129
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:57,830
consistently agree about
um you know there have been times in

7130
02:13:57,830 --> 02:13:57,840
um you know there have been times in
 

7131
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,750
um you know there have been times in
history when people have sort of gone

7132
02:13:59,750 --> 02:13:59,760
history when people have sort of gone
 

7133
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:02,629
history when people have sort of gone
away from certain kinds of laws even

7134
02:14:02,629 --> 02:14:02,639
away from certain kinds of laws even
 

7135
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:04,490
away from certain kinds of laws even
ones that we would now say how could you

7136
02:14:04,490 --> 02:14:04,500
ones that we would now say how could you
 

7137
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:07,069
ones that we would now say how could you
possibly have not not done it that way

7138
02:14:07,069 --> 02:14:07,079
possibly have not not done it that way
 

7139
02:14:07,079 --> 02:14:08,450
possibly have not not done it that way
um you know that just doesn't seem right

7140
02:14:08,450 --> 02:14:08,460
um you know that just doesn't seem right
 

7141
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:09,709
um you know that just doesn't seem right
at all

7142
02:14:09,709 --> 02:14:09,719
at all
 

7143
02:14:09,719 --> 02:14:12,169
at all
um but I think I mean this question of

7144
02:14:12,169 --> 02:14:12,179
um but I think I mean this question of
 

7145
02:14:12,179 --> 02:14:13,550
um but I think I mean this question of
what

7146
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:13,560
what
 

7147
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:16,910
what
I don't think one can say Beyond saying

7148
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:16,920
I don't think one can say Beyond saying
 

7149
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:19,010
I don't think one can say Beyond saying
if you have a set of rules that will

7150
02:14:19,010 --> 02:14:19,020
if you have a set of rules that will
 

7151
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:21,530
if you have a set of rules that will
cause the species to go extinct

7152
02:14:21,530 --> 02:14:21,540
cause the species to go extinct
 

7153
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:24,410
cause the species to go extinct
that's probably you know you could say

7154
02:14:24,410 --> 02:14:24,420
that's probably you know you could say
 

7155
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:26,209
that's probably you know you could say
that's probably not a winning set of

7156
02:14:26,209 --> 02:14:26,219
that's probably not a winning set of
 

7157
02:14:26,219 --> 02:14:28,669
that's probably not a winning set of
laws because even to have a thing on

7158
02:14:28,669 --> 02:14:28,679
laws because even to have a thing on
 

7159
02:14:28,679 --> 02:14:31,069
laws because even to have a thing on
which you can operate laws requires that

7160
02:14:31,069 --> 02:14:31,079
which you can operate laws requires that
 

7161
02:14:31,079 --> 02:14:33,530
which you can operate laws requires that
the species not be extinct but between

7162
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:33,540
the species not be extinct but between
 

7163
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,629
the species not be extinct but between
sort of what's the distance between

7164
02:14:35,629 --> 02:14:35,639
sort of what's the distance between
 

7165
02:14:35,639 --> 02:14:37,729
sort of what's the distance between
Chicago and New York

7166
02:14:37,729 --> 02:14:37,739
Chicago and New York
 

7167
02:14:37,739 --> 02:14:40,310
Chicago and New York
that wolf from alpha can answer and the

7168
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
that wolf from alpha can answer and the
 

7169
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:42,410
that wolf from alpha can answer and the
question of if this person is good or

7170
02:14:42,410 --> 02:14:42,420
question of if this person is good or
 

7171
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:44,629
question of if this person is good or
not there seems to be a lot of gray area

7172
02:14:44,629 --> 02:14:44,639
not there seems to be a lot of gray area
 

7173
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:46,790
not there seems to be a lot of gray area
and that starts becoming really

7174
02:14:46,790 --> 02:14:46,800
and that starts becoming really
 

7175
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,850
and that starts becoming really
interesting I think you're

7176
02:14:48,850 --> 02:14:48,860
interesting I think you're
 

7177
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:51,470
interesting I think you're
uh since the creation of Wolfram Alpha

7178
02:14:51,470 --> 02:14:51,480
uh since the creation of Wolfram Alpha
 

7179
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:53,810
uh since the creation of Wolfram Alpha
have been a kind of arbiter of Truth at

7180
02:14:53,810 --> 02:14:53,820
have been a kind of arbiter of Truth at
 

7181
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:56,450
have been a kind of arbiter of Truth at
a large scale so this system is

7182
02:14:56,450 --> 02:14:56,460
a large scale so this system is
 

7183
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:58,850
a large scale so this system is
generates more truth and try to make

7184
02:14:58,850 --> 02:14:58,860
generates more truth and try to make
 

7185
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:00,050
generates more truth and try to make
sure that the things are true I mean

7186
02:15:00,050 --> 02:15:00,060
sure that the things are true I mean
 

7187
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:02,390
sure that the things are true I mean
look it's a practical matter when people

7188
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:02,400
look it's a practical matter when people
 

7189
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,569
look it's a practical matter when people
write computational contracts and it's

7190
02:15:05,569 --> 02:15:05,579
write computational contracts and it's
 

7191
02:15:05,579 --> 02:15:08,030
write computational contracts and it's
kind of like you know if this happens in

7192
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:08,040
kind of like you know if this happens in
 

7193
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:11,089
kind of like you know if this happens in
the world then do this yes and this

7194
02:15:11,089 --> 02:15:11,099
the world then do this yes and this
 

7195
02:15:11,099 --> 02:15:13,550
the world then do this yes and this
hasn't developed as as quickly as it

7196
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:13,560
hasn't developed as as quickly as it
 

7197
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:14,750
hasn't developed as as quickly as it
might have done you know this has been a

7198
02:15:14,750 --> 02:15:14,760
might have done you know this has been a
 

7199
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:16,669
might have done you know this has been a
sort of a blockchain story in part and

7200
02:15:16,669 --> 02:15:16,679
sort of a blockchain story in part and
 

7201
02:15:16,679 --> 02:15:17,870
sort of a blockchain story in part and
so on although blockchain is not really

7202
02:15:17,870 --> 02:15:17,880
so on although blockchain is not really
 

7203
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:19,850
so on although blockchain is not really
necessary for the idea of computational

7204
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:19,860
necessary for the idea of computational
 

7205
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:21,830
necessary for the idea of computational
contracts but you can imagine that

7206
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:21,840
contracts but you can imagine that
 

7207
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,050
contracts but you can imagine that
eventually sort of a large part of

7208
02:15:24,050 --> 02:15:24,060
eventually sort of a large part of
 

7209
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:26,149
eventually sort of a large part of
what's in the world are these giant

7210
02:15:26,149 --> 02:15:26,159
what's in the world are these giant
 

7211
02:15:26,159 --> 02:15:27,830
what's in the world are these giant
chains and networks of computational

7212
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:27,840
chains and networks of computational
 

7213
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:30,530
chains and networks of computational
contracts and then something happens in

7214
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:30,540
contracts and then something happens in
 

7215
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:32,569
contracts and then something happens in
the world and this whole giant domino

7216
02:15:32,569 --> 02:15:32,579
the world and this whole giant domino
 

7217
02:15:32,579 --> 02:15:35,510
the world and this whole giant domino

things like blockchain computational
 

7229
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,149
things like blockchain computational

02:15:57,290 --> 02:15:57,300
get the stuff right and one of the
 

7237
02:15:57,300 --> 02:16:00,229
get the stuff right and one of the
things that is tricky sometimes is when

7238
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:00,239
things that is tricky sometimes is when
 

7239
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:01,970
things that is tricky sometimes is when
is it true when is it a fact when is it

7240
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:01,980
is it true when is it a fact when is it
 

7241
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:04,609
is it true when is it a fact when is it
not a fact yes I think the best we can

7242
02:16:04,609 --> 02:16:04,619
not a fact yes I think the best we can
 

7243
02:16:04,619 --> 02:16:09,890
not a fact yes I think the best we can
do is to say uh you know we we have a

7244
02:16:09,890 --> 02:16:09,900
do is to say uh you know we we have a
 

7245
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:12,709
do is to say uh you know we we have a
procedure we follow the procedure we

7246
02:16:12,709 --> 02:16:12,719
procedure we follow the procedure we
 

7247
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:14,930
procedure we follow the procedure we
might get it wrong but at least we won't

7248
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:14,940
might get it wrong but at least we won't
 

7249
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:16,910
might get it wrong but at least we won't
be corrupt about getting it wrong so to

7250
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:16,920
be corrupt about getting it wrong so to
 

7251
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:19,669
be corrupt about getting it wrong so to
speak so that's beautifully put and have

7252
02:16:19,669 --> 02:16:19,679
speak so that's beautifully put and have
 

7253
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:22,069
speak so that's beautifully put and have
a transparency about the procedure

7254
02:16:22,069 --> 02:16:22,079
a transparency about the procedure
 

7255
02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:23,089
a transparency about the procedure
foreign

7256
02:16:23,089 --> 02:16:23,099

the problem starts to emerge when the

7258
02:16:27,649 --> 02:16:27,659
the problem starts to emerge when the
 

7259
02:16:27,659 --> 02:16:28,970
the problem starts to emerge when the
things that you convert into

7260
02:16:28,970 --> 02:16:28,980
things that you convert into
 

7261
02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:30,770
things that you convert into
computational language start to expand

7262
02:16:30,770 --> 02:16:30,780
computational language start to expand
 

7263
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,950
computational language start to expand
for example into the realm of politics

7264
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:32,960
for example into the realm of politics
 

7265
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:35,389
for example into the realm of politics
so this is where it's almost like this

7266
02:16:35,389 --> 02:16:35,399
so this is where it's almost like this
 

7267
02:16:35,399 --> 02:16:38,810
so this is where it's almost like this
nice dance of wolf from Alpha and uh

7268
02:16:38,810 --> 02:16:38,820
nice dance of wolf from Alpha and uh
 

7269
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:43,009
nice dance of wolf from Alpha and uh
Chad gbt Chad gbt like you said is a

02:16:43,009 --> 02:16:43,019
Chad gbt Chad gbt like you said is a
 

7271
02:16:43,019 --> 02:16:46,490
Chad gbt Chad gbt like you said is a
shallow and Broad so it's going to give

7272
02:16:46,490 --> 02:16:46,500
shallow and Broad so it's going to give
 

7273
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:48,110
shallow and Broad so it's going to give
you an opinion on everything but it

7274
02:16:48,110 --> 02:16:48,120
you an opinion on everything but it
 

7275
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:50,270
you an opinion on everything but it
writes fiction as well as fact which is

7276
02:16:50,270 --> 02:16:50,280
writes fiction as well as fact which is
 

7277
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,129
writes fiction as well as fact which is
exactly how it's built I mean that's

7278
02:16:52,129 --> 02:16:52,139
exactly how it's built I mean that's
 

7279
02:16:52,139 --> 02:16:55,370
exactly how it's built I mean that's
exactly it is making language and it is

7280
02:16:55,370 --> 02:16:55,380
exactly it is making language and it is
 

7281
02:16:55,380 --> 02:16:58,429
exactly it is making language and it is
making both even in code it writes

7282
02:16:58,429 --> 02:16:58,439
making both even in code it writes
 

7283
02:16:58,439 --> 02:17:00,469
making both even in code it writes
fiction I mean it's kind of fun to see

7284
02:17:00,469 --> 02:17:00,479
fiction I mean it's kind of fun to see
 

7285
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:02,450
fiction I mean it's kind of fun to see
sometimes you know it'll write fictional

7286
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:02,460
sometimes you know it'll write fictional
 

7287
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:04,610
sometimes you know it'll write fictional
World from language code yeah that that

7288
02:17:04,610 --> 02:17:04,620
World from language code yeah that that
 

7289
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:06,230
World from language code yeah that that
term it kind of looks right yeah it

7290
02:17:06,230 --> 02:17:06,240
term it kind of looks right yeah it
 

7291
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:09,070
term it kind of looks right yeah it
looks right but it's actually not

7292
02:17:09,070 --> 02:17:09,080
looks right but it's actually not
 

7293
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:12,169
looks right but it's actually not
pragmatically correct yeah um but but

7294
02:17:12,169 --> 02:17:12,179
pragmatically correct yeah um but but
 

7295
02:17:12,179 --> 02:17:15,230
pragmatically correct yeah um but but
yes it's it's a it has a view of kind of

7296
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:15,240
yes it's it's a it has a view of kind of
 

7297
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:18,290
yes it's it's a it has a view of kind of
roughly how the world works at the same

7298
02:17:18,290 --> 02:17:18,300
roughly how the world works at the same
 

7299
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:20,750
roughly how the world works at the same
level as as books of fiction talk about

7300
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:20,760
level as as books of fiction talk about
 

7301
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:22,849
level as as books of fiction talk about
roughly how the world Works they just

7302
02:17:22,849 --> 02:17:22,859
roughly how the world Works they just
 

7303
02:17:22,859 --> 02:17:24,349
roughly how the world Works they just
don't have happened to be the way the

7304
02:17:24,349 --> 02:17:24,359
don't have happened to be the way the
 

7305
02:17:24,359 --> 02:17:26,450
don't have happened to be the way the
world actually worked or whatever but

7306
02:17:26,450 --> 02:17:26,460
world actually worked or whatever but
 

7307
02:17:26,460 --> 02:17:29,030
world actually worked or whatever but
yes that that's um no I I agree that's

7308
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,040
yes that that's um no I I agree that's
 

7309
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:32,270
yes that that's um no I I agree that's
sort of a um you know we are attempting

7310
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:32,280
sort of a um you know we are attempting
 

7311
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:34,669
sort of a um you know we are attempting
with with our whole you know wolfen

02:17:37,429 --> 02:17:37,439
language computational language thing to
 

7315
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:41,150
language computational language thing to
represent uh at least well it's either

7316
02:17:41,150 --> 02:17:41,160
represent uh at least well it's either
 

7317
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:42,950
represent uh at least well it's either
it doesn't necessarily have to be how

7318
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
it doesn't necessarily have to be how
 

7319
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,629
it doesn't necessarily have to be how
the actual World works because we can

7320
02:17:44,629 --> 02:17:44,639
the actual World works because we can
 

7321
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:46,849
the actual World works because we can
invent a set of rules that aren't the

02:17:46,849 --> 02:17:46,859
invent a set of rules that aren't the
 

7323
02:17:46,859 --> 02:17:48,889
invent a set of rules that aren't the
way the actual World works and run those

7324
02:17:48,889 --> 02:17:48,899
way the actual World works and run those
 

7325
02:17:48,899 --> 02:17:51,530
way the actual World works and run those
rules but then we're saying we're going

02:17:51,530 --> 02:17:51,540
rules but then we're saying we're going
 

7327
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:54,049
rules but then we're saying we're going
to accurately represent the results of

to accurately represent the results of

to accurately represent the results of
running those rules which might or might

02:17:56,219 --> 02:17:58,549
running those rules which might or might
not be the actual rules of the world but

02:17:58,549 --> 02:17:58,559
not be the actual rules of the world but
 

7333
02:17:58,559 --> 02:18:01,070
not be the actual rules of the world but
we also try to capture features of the

we also try to capture features of the
 

7335
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:04,070
we also try to capture features of the

of atoms that we abstractly describe as
 

7353
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:31,250
of atoms that we abstractly describe as
a tank and you could say well you know

a tank and you could say well you know
 

7355
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:32,870
a tank and you could say well you know
there's some arrangement of atoms that

there's some arrangement of atoms that
 

7357
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,669
there's some arrangement of atoms that
is a different derangement of atoms but

is a different derangement of atoms but
 

7359
02:18:34,679 --> 02:18:36,530
is a different derangement of atoms but
it's and it's not you know we didn't we

02:18:36,530 --> 02:18:36,540
it's and it's not you know we didn't we

02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:38,929
it's and it's not you know we didn't we
didn't decide it's like this Observer

arrangement of atoms counts as a tank

7366
02:18:43,610 --> 02:18:43,620
arrangement of atoms counts as a tank
 

7367
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:45,650
arrangement of atoms counts as a tank
versus not a tank so there's there's

02:18:45,650 --> 02:18:45,660
versus not a tank so there's there's
 

7369
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:47,450
versus not a tank so there's there's
even things that would consider strong

02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:53,340
you've been contending with this idea of
 

7431
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:56,750
you've been contending with this idea of
what is fact and not and it seems like

7432
02:19:56,750 --> 02:19:56,760
what is fact and not and it seems like
 

7433
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:59,389
what is fact and not and it seems like
Chachi Patrice used a lot now I've seen

7434
02:19:59,389 --> 02:19:59,399
Chachi Patrice used a lot now I've seen
 

7435
02:19:59,399 --> 02:20:02,349
Chachi Patrice used a lot now I've seen
it used by journalists to write articles

7436
02:20:02,349 --> 02:20:02,359
it used by journalists to write articles
 

7437
02:20:02,359 --> 02:20:05,150
it used by journalists to write articles
and so you have

7438
02:20:05,150 --> 02:20:05,160
and so you have
 

7439
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:06,349
and so you have
um people that are working with large

7440
02:20:06,349 --> 02:20:06,359
um people that are working with large
 

7441
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:08,810
um people that are working with large
language models trying to desperately

7442
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:08,820
language models trying to desperately
 

7443
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:10,730
language models trying to desperately
figure out how do we

7444
02:20:10,730 --> 02:20:10,740
figure out how do we
 

7445
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:13,070
figure out how do we
essentially censor them through

7446
02:20:13,070 --> 02:20:13,080
essentially censor them through
 

7447
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:16,670
essentially censor them through
different mechanisms either manually or

7448
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:16,680
different mechanisms either manually or
 

7449
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:18,050
different mechanisms either manually or
through reinforce and learning with

7450
02:20:18,050 --> 02:20:18,060
through reinforce and learning with
 

7451
02:20:18,060 --> 02:20:22,010
through reinforce and learning with
human feedback try to align them to to

7452
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:22,020
human feedback try to align them to to
 

7453
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:25,130
human feedback try to align them to to
not say fiction just to say non-fiction

7454
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:25,140
not say fiction just to say non-fiction
 

7455
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:26,870
not say fiction just to say non-fiction
as much as possible this is the

7456
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:26,880
as much as possible this is the
 

7457
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:28,790
as much as possible this is the
importance of computational language as

7458
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:28,800
importance of computational language as
 

7459
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,889
importance of computational language as
an intermediate it's kind of like you've

7460
02:20:30,889 --> 02:20:30,899
an intermediate it's kind of like you've
 

7461
02:20:30,899 --> 02:20:33,050
an intermediate it's kind of like you've
got the large language model it's able

7462
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:33,060
got the large language model it's able
 

7463
02:20:33,060 --> 02:20:35,210
got the large language model it's able
to suffice something which is a formal

7464
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:35,220
to suffice something which is a formal
 

7465
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:37,490
to suffice something which is a formal
precise thing that you can then look at

7466
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:37,500
precise thing that you can then look at
 

7467
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:40,070
precise thing that you can then look at
and you can run tests on it and you can

7468
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:40,080
and you can run tests on it and you can
 

7469
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,389
and you can run tests on it and you can
do all kinds of things it's always going

7470
02:20:41,389 --> 02:20:41,399
do all kinds of things it's always going
 

7471
02:20:41,399 --> 02:20:43,490
do all kinds of things it's always going
to work the same way and it's precisely

7472
02:20:43,490 --> 02:20:43,500
to work the same way and it's precisely
 

7473
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:46,130
to work the same way and it's precisely
defined what it does and then the large

7474
02:20:46,130 --> 02:20:46,140
defined what it does and then the large
 

7475
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:47,809
defined what it does and then the large
language model is the interface I mean

7476
02:20:47,809 --> 02:20:47,819
language model is the interface I mean
 

7477
02:20:47,819 --> 02:20:49,250
language model is the interface I mean
the way I view these large language

7478
02:20:49,250 --> 02:20:49,260
the way I view these large language
 

7479
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:50,630
the way I view these large language
models one of their important I mean

7480
02:20:50,630 --> 02:20:50,640
models one of their important I mean
 

7481
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:51,830
models one of their important I mean
there are many use cases and you know

7482
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:51,840
there are many use cases and you know
 

7483
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:53,570
there are many use cases and you know
it's a remarkable thing could talk about

7484
02:20:53,570 --> 02:20:53,580
it's a remarkable thing could talk about
 

7485
02:20:53,580 --> 02:20:55,730
it's a remarkable thing could talk about
some of these you know literally you

7486
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:55,740
some of these you know literally you
 

7487
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:57,230
some of these you know literally you
know every day we're coming up with a

7488
02:20:57,230 --> 02:20:57,240
know every day we're coming up with a
 

7489
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,210
know every day we're coming up with a
couple of new use cases

7490
02:20:59,210 --> 02:20:59,220
couple of new use cases
 

7491
02:20:59,220 --> 02:21:00,530
couple of new use cases
um some of which are very very very

7492
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:00,540
um some of which are very very very
 

7493
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:02,090
um some of which are very very very
surprising

7494
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:02,100
surprising
 

7495
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:04,730
surprising
um and things where I mean but the best

7496
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:04,740
um and things where I mean but the best
 

7497
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:07,730
um and things where I mean but the best
use cases are ones where it's you know

7498
02:21:07,730 --> 02:21:07,740
use cases are ones where it's you know
 

7499
02:21:07,740 --> 02:21:10,130
use cases are ones where it's you know
even if it gets it roughly right it's

7500
02:21:10,130 --> 02:21:10,140
even if it gets it roughly right it's
 

7501
02:21:10,140 --> 02:21:12,230
even if it gets it roughly right it's
still a huge win like a use case we had

7502
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,240
still a huge win like a use case we had
 

7503
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:15,050
still a huge win like a use case we had
from a week or two ago is read our bug

from a week or two ago is read our bug
 

7505

02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:18,420
thousands of bug reports that will be
 

7509
02:21:18,420 --> 02:21:21,230
thousands of bug reports that will be
accumulated over decades and it's like

7510
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:21,240
accumulated over decades and it's like
 

7511
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:23,450
accumulated over decades and it's like
you know can we have it just read the

7512
02:21:23,450 --> 02:21:23,460
you know can we have it just read the
 

7513
02:21:23,460 --> 02:21:26,330
you know can we have it just read the
bug report figure out where the where is

7514
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:26,340
bug report figure out where the where is
 

7515
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:28,969
bug report figure out where the where is
the bug likely to be and you know home

7516
02:21:28,969 --> 02:21:28,979
the bug likely to be and you know home
 

7517
02:21:28,979 --> 02:21:30,349
the bug likely to be and you know home
in on that piece of code maybe they'll

7518
02:21:30,349 --> 02:21:30,359
in on that piece of code maybe they'll
 

7519
02:21:30,359 --> 02:21:33,290
in on that piece of code maybe they'll
even suggest some some you know sort of

7520
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:33,300
even suggest some some you know sort of
 

7521
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:35,750
even suggest some some you know sort of
way to fix the code it might get that it

7522
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:35,760
way to fix the code it might get that it
 

7523
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:37,849
way to fix the code it might get that it
might be nonsense what it says to about

7524
02:21:37,849 --> 02:21:37,859
might be nonsense what it says to about
 

7525
02:21:37,859 --> 02:21:39,950
might be nonsense what it says to about
how to fix the code but it's incredibly

7526
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:39,960
how to fix the code but it's incredibly
 

7527
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:43,309
how to fix the code but it's incredibly
useful that it was able to you know so

7528
02:21:43,309 --> 02:21:43,319
useful that it was able to you know so
 

7529
02:21:43,319 --> 02:21:45,290
useful that it was able to you know so
awesome it's so awesome because even the

7530
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:45,300
awesome it's so awesome because even the
 

7531
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:47,090
awesome it's so awesome because even the
nonsense will somehow be instructive I

7532
02:21:47,090 --> 02:21:47,100
nonsense will somehow be instructive I
 

7533
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:48,770
nonsense will somehow be instructive I
don't I don't quite understand that yet

7534
02:21:48,770 --> 02:21:48,780
don't I don't quite understand that yet
 

7535
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:49,969
don't I don't quite understand that yet
I've

7536
02:21:49,969 --> 02:21:49,979
I've
 

7537
02:21:49,979 --> 02:21:52,730
I've
yeah there's so many programming related

7538
02:21:52,730 --> 02:21:52,740
yeah there's so many programming related
 

7539
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:55,490
yeah there's so many programming related
things like uh for example uh

7540
02:21:55,490 --> 02:21:55,500
things like uh for example uh
 

7541
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:56,929
things like uh for example uh
translating for one programming language

7542
02:21:56,929 --> 02:21:56,939
translating for one programming language
 

7543
02:21:56,939 --> 02:21:59,570
translating for one programming language
to another is really really interesting

7544
02:21:59,570 --> 02:21:59,580
to another is really really interesting
 

7545
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:01,370
to another is really really interesting
it's extremely effective but then you

7546
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:01,380
it's extremely effective but then you
 

7547
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:03,250
it's extremely effective but then you
the failures

7548
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:03,260
the failures
 

7549
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:06,170
the failures
reveal the path forward also yeah but I

7550
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:06,180
reveal the path forward also yeah but I
 

7551
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:08,809
reveal the path forward also yeah but I
think I mean the the big thing I mean in

7552
02:22:08,809 --> 02:22:08,819
think I mean the the big thing I mean in
 

7553
02:22:08,819 --> 02:22:11,090
think I mean the the big thing I mean in
that kind of discussion the unique thing

7554
02:22:11,090 --> 02:22:11,100
that kind of discussion the unique thing
 

7555
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:12,710
that kind of discussion the unique thing
about our computational language is it

7556
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:12,720
about our computational language is it
 

7557
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:14,330
about our computational language is it
was intended to be read by humans yes

7558
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:14,340
was intended to be read by humans yes
 

7559
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:16,250
was intended to be read by humans yes
and so it's really important right and

7560
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:16,260
and so it's really important right and
 

7561
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:18,290
and so it's really important right and
so it has this thing where you can but

7562
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:18,300
so it has this thing where you can but
 

7563
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:20,030
so it has this thing where you can but
but you know thinking about sort of

7564
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:20,040
but you know thinking about sort of
 

7565
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:22,849
but you know thinking about sort of
church EBT and its use and so on the one

7566
02:22:22,849 --> 02:22:22,859
church EBT and its use and so on the one
 

7567
02:22:22,859 --> 02:22:24,410
church EBT and its use and so on the one
of the big things about it I think is

7568
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:24,420
of the big things about it I think is
 

7569
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:26,870
of the big things about it I think is
it's a linguistic user interface that is

7570
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:26,880
it's a linguistic user interface that is
 

7571
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:28,910
it's a linguistic user interface that is
so a typical use case might be in the

7572
02:22:28,910 --> 02:22:28,920
so a typical use case might be in the
 

7573
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,469
so a typical use case might be in the
take the journalist case for example

7574
02:22:30,469 --> 02:22:30,479
take the journalist case for example
 

7575
02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:34,490
take the journalist case for example
it's like let's say I have five facts

7576
02:22:34,490 --> 02:22:34,500
it's like let's say I have five facts
 

7577
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:37,010
it's like let's say I have five facts
that I'm trying to turn into an article

7578
02:22:37,010 --> 02:22:37,020
that I'm trying to turn into an article
 

7579
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:39,590
that I'm trying to turn into an article
or I'm trying to I'm trying to write a

7580
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:39,600
or I'm trying to I'm trying to write a
 

7581
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:42,110
or I'm trying to I'm trying to write a
report where I have basically five facts

7582
02:22:42,110 --> 02:22:42,120
report where I have basically five facts
 

7583
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:43,250
report where I have basically five facts

another large language model that just
 

7657
02:23:53,399 --> 02:23:55,370
another large language model that just
crushes it down because the Fisheries

my local computer right so chat gbt
 

7749
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:45,050
my local computer right so chat gbt
would produce you know a series of notes

7750

following what was happening with large
 

7851
02:27:49,020 --> 02:27:50,809
following what was happening with large
language models and I'd play with them a

7852
02:27:50,809 --> 02:27:50,819
language models and I'd play with them a
 

7853
02:27:50,819 --> 02:27:52,370
language models and I'd play with them a
whole bunch and they were kind of like

7854
02:27:52,370 --> 02:27:52,380
whole bunch and they were kind of like
 

7855
02:27:52,380 --> 02:27:54,530
whole bunch and they were kind of like
yeah you know it's kind of like what you

yeah you know it's kind of like what you
 

7857
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:57,410
yeah you know it's kind of like what you
would expect based on sort of sort of

7858
02:27:57,410 --> 02:27:57,420
would expect based on sort of sort of
 

7859
02:27:57,420 --> 02:27:58,849
would expect based on sort of sort of
statistical continuation of language

7860
02:27:58,849 --> 02:27:58,859
statistical continuation of language
 

7861
02:27:58,859 --> 02:28:01,610
statistical continuation of language
it's interesting but it's not breakout

7862
02:28:01,610 --> 02:28:01,620
it's interesting but it's not breakout
 

7863
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:04,849
it's interesting but it's not breakout
exciting and then I think the kind of

7864

exciting and then I think the kind of
 

7865
02:28:04,859 --> 02:28:07,370
exciting and then I think the kind of
the the kind of reinforcement that the

7866
02:28:07,370 --> 02:28:07,380
the the kind of reinforcement that the
 

7867
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:10,190
the the kind of reinforcement that the

do the things that humans really wanted
to do that broke through that kind of

7874
02:28:17,690 --> 02:28:17,700
to do that broke through that kind of
 

7875
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:19,670
to do that broke through that kind of
reached the threshold where the thing

7876
02:28:19,670 --> 02:28:19,680
reached the threshold where the thing
 

7877
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:21,830
reached the threshold where the thing
really is interesting to us humans and

7878
02:28:21,830 --> 02:28:21,840
really is interesting to us humans and
 

7879
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:23,570
really is interesting to us humans and
by the way it's interesting to see how

7880
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:23,580
by the way it's interesting to see how
 

7881

you know you change the temperature
 

7883
02:28:24,660 --> 02:28:26,809
you know you change the temperature
something like that the thing goes

7884
02:28:26,809 --> 02:28:26,819
something like that the thing goes
 

7885
02:28:26,819 --> 02:28:28,969
something like that the thing goes
Bonkers and it no longer is interesting

7886
02:28:28,969 --> 02:28:28,979
Bonkers and it no longer is interesting
 

7887
02:28:28,979 --> 02:28:31,910
Bonkers and it no longer is interesting
to humans it's producing garbage yeah um

7888
02:28:31,910 --> 02:28:31,920
to humans it's producing garbage yeah um
 

7889
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:34,309
to humans it's producing garbage yeah um
and it's it's kind of right it's somehow

7890
02:28:34,309 --> 02:28:34,319
and it's it's kind of right it's somehow
 

7891
02:28:34,319 --> 02:28:37,730
and it's it's kind of right it's somehow
it managed to get this this Above This

7892
02:28:37,730 --> 02:28:37,740
it managed to get this this Above This
 

7893
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:40,309
it managed to get this this Above This
threshold but it really is well aligned

7894
02:28:40,309 --> 02:28:40,319
threshold but it really is well aligned
 

7895
02:28:40,319 --> 02:28:43,730
threshold but it really is well aligned
to what we humans are interested in and

7896
02:28:43,730 --> 02:28:43,740
to what we humans are interested in and
 

7897
02:28:43,740 --> 02:28:46,309
to what we humans are interested in and
uh and kind of that that's um and I

7898
02:28:46,309 --> 02:28:46,319
uh and kind of that that's um and I
 

7899
02:28:46,319 --> 02:28:49,849
uh and kind of that that's um and I
think you know nobody saw that coming I

7900
02:28:49,849 --> 02:28:49,859
think you know nobody saw that coming I
 

7901
02:28:49,859 --> 02:28:51,710
think you know nobody saw that coming I
think uh certainly nobody I've talked to

7902
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:51,720
think uh certainly nobody I've talked to
 

7903
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:53,929
think uh certainly nobody I've talked to
and nobody who is involved in in that

7904
02:28:53,929 --> 02:28:53,939
and nobody who is involved in in that
 

7905
02:28:53,939 --> 02:28:56,090
and nobody who is involved in in that
project seems to have known that was

7906
02:28:56,090 --> 02:28:56,100
project seems to have known that was
 

7907
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:57,710
project seems to have known that was
coming it's just one of these things

7908
02:28:57,710 --> 02:28:57,720
coming it's just one of these things
 

7909
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:00,889
coming it's just one of these things
that is a sort of remarkable threshold I

7910
02:29:00,889 --> 02:29:00,899
that is a sort of remarkable threshold I
 

7911
02:29:00,899 --> 02:29:02,690
that is a sort of remarkable threshold I
mean you know when we built wolf from

7912
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:02,700
mean you know when we built wolf from
 

7913
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:04,730
mean you know when we built wolf from
alpha for example I didn't know it was

02:29:04,730 --> 02:29:04,740
alpha for example I didn't know it was
 

7915
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:07,070
alpha for example I didn't know it was
going to work you know we tried to build

7916
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:07,080
going to work you know we tried to build
 

7917
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:08,630
going to work you know we tried to build
something that would have enough

7918
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:08,640
something that would have enough

answer a reasonable set of questions
 

7923
02:29:12,439 --> 02:29:15,290
answer a reasonable set of questions
that we could do but good enough natural

7924
02:29:15,290 --> 02:29:15,300
that we could do but good enough natural
 

7925
02:29:15,300 --> 02:29:16,730
that we could do but good enough natural

7929
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:21,230

know where that threshold was I mean I

7930
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:21,240
know where that threshold was I mean I
 

7931
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,330

the same thing for me looking at these
 

7957
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:51,650
the same thing for me looking at these
large language models it's like when

7958
02:29:51,650 --> 02:29:51,660
large language models it's like when
 

7959
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:53,270
large language models it's like when
when people were first saying the first

7960

when people were first saying the first
 

7961

few weeks of chat gbt it's like oh yeah

7962
02:29:55,130 --> 02:29:55,140
few weeks of chat gbt it's like oh yeah
 

7963
02:29:55,140 --> 02:29:56,809
few weeks of chat gbt it's like oh yeah
you know I've seen these large language

7964
02:29:56,809 --> 02:29:56,819
you know I've seen these large language
 

7965
02:29:56,819 --> 02:29:58,250
you know I've seen these large language
models

7966
02:29:58,250 --> 02:29:58,260
models
 

7967
02:29:58,260 --> 02:30:00,170
models
um and then uh you know and then I

7968
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:00,180
um and then uh you know and then I
 

7969
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:03,110
um and then uh you know and then I
actually try it and uh you know oh my

7970
02:30:03,110 --> 02:30:03,120
actually try it and uh you know oh my
 

7971
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:06,050
actually try it and uh you know oh my
gosh it actually works and I think uh

7972
02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:06,060
gosh it actually works and I think uh
 

7973
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:08,150
gosh it actually works and I think uh
it's uh but it but you know the things

7974
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:08,160
it's uh but it but you know the things
 

7975
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:11,389
it's uh but it but you know the things
and the thing I found you know I

7976
02:30:11,389 --> 02:30:11,399
and the thing I found you know I
 

7977
02:30:11,399 --> 02:30:12,889
and the thing I found you know I
remember one of the first things I tried

7978
02:30:12,889 --> 02:30:12,899
remember one of the first things I tried
 

7979
02:30:12,899 --> 02:30:15,770
remember one of the first things I tried
was uh write a persuasive essay that a

7980
02:30:15,770 --> 02:30:15,780
was uh write a persuasive essay that a
 

7981
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:18,530
was uh write a persuasive essay that a
wolf is the bluest kind of animal okay

7982
02:30:18,530 --> 02:30:18,540
wolf is the bluest kind of animal okay
 

7983
02:30:18,540 --> 02:30:20,750
wolf is the bluest kind of animal okay
so it writes this thing and it starts

7984
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:20,760
so it writes this thing and it starts
 

7985
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:23,030
so it writes this thing and it starts
talking about these uh wolves that live

7986
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:23,040
talking about these uh wolves that live
 

7987
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:25,370
talking about these uh wolves that live
on the Tibetan plateau and they are

7988
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:25,380
on the Tibetan plateau and they are
 

7989
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:28,250
on the Tibetan plateau and they are
named some Latin name and so on and I'm

7990
02:30:28,250 --> 02:30:28,260
named some Latin name and so on and I'm
 

7991
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:30,469
named some Latin name and so on and I'm
like really and I'm starting to look it

7992
02:30:30,469 --> 02:30:30,479
like really and I'm starting to look it
 

7993
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:32,510
like really and I'm starting to look it
up on the web and it's like well it's

7994
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:32,520
up on the web and it's like well it's
 

7995
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:34,309
up on the web and it's like well it's
actually complete nonsense

7996
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:34,319
actually complete nonsense
 

7997
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:36,290
actually complete nonsense
but it's extremely plausible I mean it's

7998
02:30:36,290 --> 02:30:36,300
but it's extremely plausible I mean it's
 

7999
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:37,969
but it's extremely plausible I mean it's
plausible enough that I was going and

8000
02:30:37,969 --> 02:30:37,979
plausible enough that I was going and
 

8001
02:30:37,979 --> 02:30:39,410
plausible enough that I was going and
looking up on the web and wondering if

8002
02:30:39,410 --> 02:30:39,420
looking up on the web and wondering if
 

8003
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:41,090
looking up on the web and wondering if
there was a wolf that was blue you know

I mentioned this on some live streams
 

8007
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:43,910
I mentioned this on some live streams
I've done and so people have been

8008
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:43,920
I've done and so people have been
 

8009
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:46,929
I've done and so people have been
sending me these pictures

8010

sending me these pictures
 

8011
02:30:46,939 --> 02:30:49,670
sending me these pictures
maybe I was on to something

8012
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:49,680
maybe I was on to something

before what do we do with truth like

8030

before what do we do with truth like
 

8031
02:31:10,979 --> 02:31:12,770
before what do we do with truth like
journalists for example

8032

yeah how do we think about the output of

8034
02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:15,840
yeah how do we think about the output of
 

8035
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:18,590
yeah how do we think about the output of
these systems I think this idea

8036
02:31:18,590 --> 02:31:18,600
these systems I think this idea
 

8037
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:20,150
these systems I think this idea
the idea that you're going to get

8038
02:31:20,150 --> 02:31:20,160
the idea that you're going to get
 

8039
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,389
the idea that you're going to get
factual output is not a very good idea I

8040
02:31:23,389 --> 02:31:23,399
factual output is not a very good idea I
 

8041
02:31:23,399 --> 02:31:25,370
factual output is not a very good idea I
mean it's just this is not it is a

8042
02:31:25,370 --> 02:31:25,380
mean it's just this is not it is a
 

8043
02:31:25,380 --> 02:31:27,469
mean it's just this is not it is a
linguistic interface it is producing

8044
02:31:27,469 --> 02:31:27,479
linguistic interface it is producing
 

8045
02:31:27,479 --> 02:31:32,809
linguistic interface it is producing
language and language can be truthful or

8046
02:31:32,809 --> 02:31:32,819
language and language can be truthful or
 

8047
02:31:32,819 --> 02:31:35,450
language and language can be truthful or
not truthful and that's a different

8048
02:31:35,450 --> 02:31:35,460
not truthful and that's a different
 

8049
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:38,330
not truthful and that's a different
slice of what's going on I think that

8050
02:31:38,330 --> 02:31:38,340
slice of what's going on I think that
 

8051
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:40,309
slice of what's going on I think that
you know what we see

8052
02:31:40,309 --> 02:31:40,319
you know what we see
 

8053
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:44,690
you know what we see
and for example uh kind of you know go

8054
02:31:44,690 --> 02:31:44,700
and for example uh kind of you know go
 

8055
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:47,630
and for example uh kind of you know go
check this with your fact source for

8056
02:31:47,630 --> 02:31:47,640
check this with your fact source for
 

8057
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:49,429
check this with your fact source for
example you can do that to some extent

8058
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
example you can do that to some extent
 

8059
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:52,429
example you can do that to some extent
but then it's going to not check

8060
02:31:52,429 --> 02:31:52,439
but then it's going to not check
 

8061
02:31:52,439 --> 02:31:54,290
but then it's going to not check
something it's going you know that is

8062
02:31:54,290 --> 02:31:54,300
something it's going you know that is
 

8063
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:57,170
something it's going you know that is
again a thing that is sort of a does it

8064
02:31:57,170 --> 02:31:57,180
again a thing that is sort of a does it
 

8065
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:58,790
again a thing that is sort of a does it
check in the right place I mean we see

8066
02:31:58,790 --> 02:31:58,800
check in the right place I mean we see
 

8067
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:01,190
check in the right place I mean we see
that in you know does it call the you

8068
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:01,200
that in you know does it call the you
 

8069
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,050
that in you know does it call the you
know the Wolfram plug-in in the right

8070
02:32:03,050 --> 02:32:03,060
know the Wolfram plug-in in the right
 

8071
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:05,750
know the Wolfram plug-in in the right
place you know often it does sometimes

8072
02:32:05,750 --> 02:32:05,760
place you know often it does sometimes
 

8073
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:08,210
place you know often it does sometimes
it doesn't you know I I think the the

8074
02:32:08,210 --> 02:32:08,220
it doesn't you know I I think the the
 

8075
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:09,950
it doesn't you know I I think the the
real thing to understand about what's

8076
02:32:09,950 --> 02:32:09,960
real thing to understand about what's
 

8077
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:11,750
real thing to understand about what's
happening is which I think is very

8078
02:32:11,750 --> 02:32:11,760
happening is which I think is very
 

8079
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:14,809
happening is which I think is very
exciting is kind of the the great

8080
02:32:14,809 --> 02:32:14,819
exciting is kind of the the great
 

8081
02:32:14,819 --> 02:32:16,969
exciting is kind of the the great
democratization of access to computation

8082
02:32:16,969 --> 02:32:16,979
democratization of access to computation
 

8083
02:32:16,979 --> 02:32:19,910
democratization of access to computation
yeah and and um you know I think that

8084
02:32:19,910 --> 02:32:19,920
yeah and and um you know I think that
 

8085
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:21,290
yeah and and um you know I think that
when you look at

8086
02:32:21,290 --> 02:32:21,300
when you look at
 

8087
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:24,110
when you look at
sort of the there's been a long period

8088
02:32:24,110 --> 02:32:24,120
sort of the there's been a long period
 

8089
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:26,630
sort of the there's been a long period
of time when computation and the ability

8090
02:32:26,630 --> 02:32:26,640
of time when computation and the ability
 

8091
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:29,090
of time when computation and the ability
to figure out things with computers has

8092
02:32:29,090 --> 02:32:29,100
to figure out things with computers has
 

8093
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:30,830
to figure out things with computers has
been something that kind of only the

8094
02:32:30,830 --> 02:32:30,840
been something that kind of only the
 

8095
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:32,929
been something that kind of only the
only The Druids at some level can can

8096
02:32:32,929 --> 02:32:32,939
only The Druids at some level can can
 

8097
02:32:32,939 --> 02:32:34,969
only The Druids at some level can can
achieve you know I myself have been

8098
02:32:34,969 --> 02:32:34,979
achieve you know I myself have been
 

8099
02:32:34,979 --> 02:32:36,830
achieve you know I myself have been
involved in trying to sort of

8100
02:32:36,830 --> 02:32:36,840
involved in trying to sort of
 

8101
02:32:36,840 --> 02:32:38,750
involved in trying to sort of
de-druidify

8102
02:32:38,750 --> 02:32:38,760
de-druidify
 

8103
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:40,309
de-druidify
um access to computation I mean back

8104
02:32:40,309 --> 02:32:40,319
um access to computation I mean back
 

8105
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:43,250
um access to computation I mean back
before Mathematica existed you know in

8106
02:32:43,250 --> 02:32:43,260
before Mathematica existed you know in
 

8107
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:45,770
before Mathematica existed you know in
1988 if you were a you know a physicist

8108
02:32:45,770 --> 02:32:45,780
1988 if you were a you know a physicist
 

8109
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:48,650
1988 if you were a you know a physicist
or something like that and you wanted to

8110
02:32:48,650 --> 02:32:48,660
or something like that and you wanted to
 

8111
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:51,830
or something like that and you wanted to
do a computation you would find a

8112
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:51,840
do a computation you would find a
 

8113
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:53,809
do a computation you would find a
programmer you would go and you know

8114
02:32:53,809 --> 02:32:53,819
programmer you would go and you know
 

8115
02:32:53,819 --> 02:32:55,730
programmer you would go and you know
delegate the the computation to that

8116
02:32:55,730 --> 02:32:55,740
delegate the the computation to that
 

8117
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:57,530
delegate the the computation to that
programmer hopefully they'd come back

8118
02:32:57,530 --> 02:32:57,540
programmer hopefully they'd come back
 

8119
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:58,610
programmer hopefully they'd come back
with something useful maybe they

8120
02:32:58,610 --> 02:32:58,620
with something useful maybe they
 

8121
02:32:58,620 --> 02:32:59,990
with something useful maybe they
wouldn't they'd be this long you know

8122
02:32:59,990 --> 02:33:00,000
wouldn't they'd be this long you know
 

8123
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,630
wouldn't they'd be this long you know
multi-week you know Loop that you go

8124
02:33:02,630 --> 02:33:02,640
multi-week you know Loop that you go
 

8125
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:04,670
multi-week you know Loop that you go
through and then it was actually very

8126
02:33:04,670 --> 02:33:04,680
through and then it was actually very
 

8127
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:07,490
through and then it was actually very
very interesting to see 1988 you know

8128
02:33:07,490 --> 02:33:07,500
very interesting to see 1988 you know
 

8129
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:09,590
very interesting to see 1988 you know
like first people like physicists

8130
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:09,600
like first people like physicists
 

8131
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:12,770
like first people like physicists
mathematicians and so on then other lots

8132
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:12,780
mathematicians and so on then other lots
 

8133
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:15,170
mathematicians and so on then other lots
of other people but this very rapid

8134
02:33:15,170 --> 02:33:15,180
of other people but this very rapid
 

8135
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:17,510
of other people but this very rapid
transition of people realizing they

8136
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:17,520
transition of people realizing they
 

8137
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:19,250
transition of people realizing they
themselves could actually type with

8138
02:33:19,250 --> 02:33:19,260
themselves could actually type with
 

8139
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:21,770
themselves could actually type with
their own fingers and you know make make

8140
02:33:21,770 --> 02:33:21,780
their own fingers and you know make make
 

8141
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:23,750
their own fingers and you know make make
some piece of code that would do a

8142
02:33:23,750 --> 02:33:23,760
some piece of code that would do a
 

8143
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:25,730
some piece of code that would do a
computation that they cared about and

8144
02:33:25,730 --> 02:33:25,740
computation that they cared about and
 

8145
02:33:25,740 --> 02:33:27,469
computation that they cared about and
you know it's been exciting to see lots

8146
02:33:27,469 --> 02:33:27,479
you know it's been exciting to see lots
 

8147
02:33:27,479 --> 02:33:29,389
you know it's been exciting to see lots
of discoveries and so on made by by

8148
02:33:29,389 --> 02:33:29,399
of discoveries and so on made by by
 

8149
02:33:29,399 --> 02:33:31,790
of discoveries and so on made by by
using that tool and I think the same

8150
02:33:31,790 --> 02:33:31,800
using that tool and I think the same
 

8151
02:33:31,800 --> 02:33:34,610
using that tool and I think the same
thing is you know we see the same thing

8152
02:33:34,610 --> 02:33:34,620
thing is you know we see the same thing
 

8153
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:37,190
thing is you know we see the same thing
you know wolfen Alpha is dealing with uh

8154
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:37,200
you know wolfen Alpha is dealing with uh
 

8155
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:39,830
you know wolfen Alpha is dealing with uh
is not as deep computation as you can

8156
02:33:39,830 --> 02:33:39,840
is not as deep computation as you can
 

8157
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:41,210
is not as deep computation as you can
achieve with whole world from language

8158
02:33:41,210 --> 02:33:41,220
achieve with whole world from language
 

8159
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:43,730
achieve with whole world from language
Mathematica stack but the thing that's

8160
02:33:43,730 --> 02:33:43,740
Mathematica stack but the thing that's
 

8161
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:45,650
Mathematica stack but the thing that's
to me particularly exciting about kind

8162
02:33:45,650 --> 02:33:45,660
to me particularly exciting about kind
 

8163
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:47,210
to me particularly exciting about kind
of the large language model linguistic

8164
02:33:47,210 --> 02:33:47,220
of the large language model linguistic
 

8165
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:50,330
of the large language model linguistic
interface mechanism is it dramatically

8166
02:33:50,330 --> 02:33:50,340
interface mechanism is it dramatically
 

8167
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:53,510
interface mechanism is it dramatically
broadens the access to kind of deep

8168
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:53,520
broadens the access to kind of deep
 

8169
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:55,429
broadens the access to kind of deep
computation I mean it's kind of like one

8170
02:33:55,429 --> 02:33:55,439
computation I mean it's kind of like one
 

8171
02:33:55,439 --> 02:33:56,510

of the things I've sort of thought about

8172
02:33:56,510 --> 02:33:56,520
of the things I've sort of thought about
 

8173
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:58,490
of the things I've sort of thought about
recently is you know what's going to

8174
02:33:58,490 --> 02:33:58,500
recently is you know what's going to
 

8175
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:00,110
recently is you know what's going to
happen to all these programmers what's

8176
02:34:00,110 --> 02:34:00,120
happen to all these programmers what's
 

8177
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:01,910
happen to all these programmers what's
going to happen to all these people who

8178
02:34:01,910 --> 02:34:01,920
going to happen to all these people who
 

8179
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:04,849
going to happen to all these people who
you know a lot of what they do is write

8180
02:34:04,849 --> 02:34:04,859
you know a lot of what they do is write
 

8181
02:34:04,859 --> 02:34:08,630
you know a lot of what they do is write
slabs of boilerplate code and in a sense

8182
02:34:08,630 --> 02:34:08,640
slabs of boilerplate code and in a sense
 

8183
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:11,210
slabs of boilerplate code and in a sense
you know I've been saying for 40 years

8184
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:11,220
you know I've been saying for 40 years
 

8185
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:13,910
you know I've been saying for 40 years
that's not a very good idea you know you

8186
02:34:13,910 --> 02:34:13,920
that's not a very good idea you know you
 

8187
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:16,370
that's not a very good idea you know you
can automate a lot of that stuff with a

8188
02:34:16,370 --> 02:34:16,380
can automate a lot of that stuff with a
 

8189
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:18,710
can automate a lot of that stuff with a
high enough level language that slab of

02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:29,690
that you can just use
um so in a sense that the fact that

8200
02:34:29,690 --> 02:34:29,700
um so in a sense that the fact that
 

8201
02:34:29,700 --> 02:34:31,550
um so in a sense that the fact that
there's there's all of this activity of

8202
02:34:31,550 --> 02:34:31,560
there's there's all of this activity of
 

8203
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:33,830
there's there's all of this activity of
doing sort of lower level programming is

8204
02:34:33,830 --> 02:34:33,840
doing sort of lower level programming is
 

8205
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:36,590
doing sort of lower level programming is
something for me it seemed like I don't

8206
02:34:36,590 --> 02:34:36,600
something for me it seemed like I don't
 

8207
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:38,750
something for me it seemed like I don't
think this is the right thing to do but

8208
02:34:38,750 --> 02:34:38,760
think this is the right thing to do but
 

8209
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:41,090
think this is the right thing to do but
you know and and lots of people have

8210
02:34:41,090 --> 02:34:41,100
you know and and lots of people have
 

8211
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:43,250
you know and and lots of people have
used our technology and not had to do

8212
02:34:43,250 --> 02:34:43,260
used our technology and not had to do
 

8213
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:45,710
used our technology and not had to do
that but the fact is that that's you

8214
02:34:45,710 --> 02:34:45,720
that but the fact is that that's you
 

8215
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:47,450
that but the fact is that that's you
know so when you look at I don't know

8216
02:34:47,450 --> 02:34:47,460
know so when you look at I don't know
 

8217
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:49,309
know so when you look at I don't know
computer science departments that have

8218
02:34:49,309 --> 02:34:49,319
computer science departments that have
 

8219
02:34:49,319 --> 02:34:51,110
computer science departments that have
that have turned into places where

8220
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:51,120
that have turned into places where
 

8221
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,490
that have turned into places where
people are learning the trade of

8222
02:34:52,490 --> 02:34:52,500
people are learning the trade of
 

8223
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:54,050
people are learning the trade of
programming so to speak

8224
02:34:54,050 --> 02:34:54,060
programming so to speak
 

8225
02:34:54,060 --> 02:34:55,849
programming so to speak
it's it's sort of a question of what's

8226
02:34:55,849 --> 02:34:55,859
it's it's sort of a question of what's
 

8227
02:34:55,859 --> 02:34:56,929
it's it's sort of a question of what's
going to happen

8228
02:34:56,929 --> 02:34:56,939
going to happen
 

8229
02:34:56,939 --> 02:34:59,330
going to happen
and I think there are two Dynamics one

8230
02:34:59,330 --> 02:34:59,340
and I think there are two Dynamics one
 

8231
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:02,330
and I think there are two Dynamics one
is that kind of uh sort of uh

8232
02:35:02,330 --> 02:35:02,340
is that kind of uh sort of uh
 

8233
02:35:02,340 --> 02:35:04,670
is that kind of uh sort of uh
boilerplate programming is going to

8234
02:35:04,670 --> 02:35:04,680
boilerplate programming is going to
 

8235
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:06,650
boilerplate programming is going to
become you know it's going to go the way

8236
02:35:06,650 --> 02:35:06,660
become you know it's going to go the way
 

8237
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:08,809
become you know it's going to go the way
that Assembly Language went back in the

8238
02:35:08,809 --> 02:35:08,819
that Assembly Language went back in the
 

8239
02:35:08,819 --> 02:35:10,969
that Assembly Language went back in the
day of something where it's really

8240
02:35:10,969 --> 02:35:10,979
day of something where it's really
 

8241
02:35:10,979 --> 02:35:14,270
day of something where it's really
mostly specified by at a higher level

8242
02:35:14,270 --> 02:35:14,280
mostly specified by at a higher level
 

8243
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:16,250
mostly specified by at a higher level
you know you start with natural language

8244
02:35:16,250 --> 02:35:16,260
you know you start with natural language
 

8245
02:35:16,260 --> 02:35:17,750
you know you start with natural language
you turn it into a computational

8246
02:35:17,750 --> 02:35:17,760
you turn it into a computational
 

8247
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:19,969
you turn it into a computational
language that's you look at the

8248
02:35:19,969 --> 02:35:19,979
language that's you look at the
 

8249
02:35:19,979 --> 02:35:21,710
language that's you look at the
computational language you run tests you

8250
02:35:21,710 --> 02:35:21,720
computational language you run tests you
 

8251
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:22,849
computational language you run tests you
understand that's what's supposed to

8252
02:35:22,849 --> 02:35:22,859
understand that's what's supposed to
 

8253
02:35:22,859 --> 02:35:25,370
understand that's what's supposed to
happen you know if we do a great job

8254
02:35:25,370 --> 02:35:25,380
happen you know if we do a great job
 

8255
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:27,950
happen you know if we do a great job
with compilation of the of the the you

8256
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:27,960
with compilation of the of the the you
 

8257
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:29,570
with compilation of the of the the you
know of the computational language it

8258
02:35:29,570 --> 02:35:29,580
know of the computational language it
 

8259
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:31,610
know of the computational language it
might turn into llvm or something like

8260
02:35:31,610 --> 02:35:31,620
might turn into llvm or something like
 

8261
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:34,969
might turn into llvm or something like
this but um uh you know or just directly

8262
02:35:34,969 --> 02:35:34,979
this but um uh you know or just directly
 

8263
02:35:34,979 --> 02:35:37,910
this but um uh you know or just directly
gets gets run through the algorithms we

have and so on but
 

8267
02:35:39,720 --> 02:35:43,370
have and so on but
but then so that's kind of a a tearing

8268
02:35:43,370 --> 02:35:43,380
but then so that's kind of a a tearing
 

8269
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:45,950
but then so that's kind of a a tearing
down of this kind of this big structure

02:35:45,950 --> 02:35:45,960
down of this kind of this big structure

02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:47,450
down of this kind of this big structure
that's been built of of teaching people

8272
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:47,460
that's been built of of teaching people
 

8273
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:49,910
that's been built of of teaching people
programming but on the other hand the

8274
02:35:49,910 --> 02:35:49,920
programming but on the other hand the
 

8275
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:52,250
programming but on the other hand the
other Dynamic is vastly more people are

8276
02:35:52,250 --> 02:35:52,260
other Dynamic is vastly more people are
 

8277
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:54,230
other Dynamic is vastly more people are
going to care about computation so all

8278
02:35:54,230 --> 02:35:54,240
going to care about computation so all
 

8279
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:56,389
going to care about computation so all
those Departments of you know art

8280
02:35:56,389 --> 02:35:56,399
those Departments of you know art
 

8281
02:35:56,399 --> 02:35:58,730
those Departments of you know art
history or something that really didn't

8282
02:35:58,730 --> 02:35:58,740
history or something that really didn't
 

8283
02:35:58,740 --> 02:36:01,849
history or something that really didn't
use computation before now have the

8284
02:36:01,849 --> 02:36:01,859
use computation before now have the
 

8285
02:36:01,859 --> 02:36:04,130
use computation before now have the
possibility of accessing it by virtue of

8286
02:36:04,130 --> 02:36:04,140
possibility of accessing it by virtue of
 

8287
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:05,330
possibility of accessing it by virtue of
this kind of linguistic interface

8288
02:36:05,330 --> 02:36:05,340
this kind of linguistic interface
 

8289
02:36:05,340 --> 02:36:07,490
this kind of linguistic interface
mechanism and uh if you create an

8290
02:36:07,490 --> 02:36:07,500
mechanism and uh if you create an
 

8291
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:09,650
mechanism and uh if you create an
interface that allows you to interpret

8292
02:36:09,650 --> 02:36:09,660
interface that allows you to interpret
 

8293
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:11,630
interface that allows you to interpret
the debug and interact with the

8294
02:36:11,630 --> 02:36:11,640
the debug and interact with the
 

8295
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:13,969
the debug and interact with the
computational language

8296
02:36:13,969 --> 02:36:13,979
computational language
 

8297
02:36:13,979 --> 02:36:15,830
computational language
then that makes it even more accessible

8298
02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:15,840
then that makes it even more accessible
 

8299
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:17,990
then that makes it even more accessible
yeah well I mean the I think the thing

8300
02:36:17,990 --> 02:36:18,000
yeah well I mean the I think the thing
 

8301
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:21,290
yeah well I mean the I think the thing
is that right now you know the average

8302
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:21,300
is that right now you know the average
 

8303
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:23,210
is that right now you know the average
you know art history student or

8304
02:36:23,210 --> 02:36:23,220
you know art history student or
 

8305
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:25,910
you know art history student or
something probably isn't going to you

8306
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:25,920
something probably isn't going to you
 

8307
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:27,530
something probably isn't going to you
know they're not probably they don't

8308
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:27,540
know they're not probably they don't
 

8309
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:28,849
know they're not probably they don't
think they know about programming and

8310
02:36:28,849 --> 02:36:28,859
think they know about programming and
 

8311
02:36:28,859 --> 02:36:31,610
think they know about programming and
things like this but by the time it

8312
02:36:31,610 --> 02:36:31,620
things like this but by the time it
 

8313
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:34,010
things like this but by the time it
really becomes a kind of purely you know

8314
02:36:34,010 --> 02:36:34,020
really becomes a kind of purely you know
 

8315
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:35,389
really becomes a kind of purely you know
you just walk up to it there's no

8316
02:36:35,389 --> 02:36:35,399
you just walk up to it there's no
 

8317
02:36:35,399 --> 02:36:38,030
you just walk up to it there's no
documentation you start just typing you

8318
02:36:38,030 --> 02:36:38,040
documentation you start just typing you
 

8319
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:39,530
documentation you start just typing you
know compare these pictures with these

8320
02:36:39,530 --> 02:36:39,540
know compare these pictures with these
 

8321
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:41,389
know compare these pictures with these
pictures and you know see the use of

8322
02:36:41,389 --> 02:36:41,399
pictures and you know see the use of
 

8323
02:36:41,399 --> 02:36:43,429
pictures and you know see the use of
this color whatever and you generate

8324
02:36:43,429 --> 02:36:43,439
this color whatever and you generate
 

8325
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:45,410
this color whatever and you generate
this piece of of computational language

8326
02:36:45,410 --> 02:36:45,420
this piece of of computational language
 

8327
02:36:45,420 --> 02:36:47,750
this piece of of computational language
code that gets run you see the results

8328
02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:47,760
code that gets run you see the results
 

8329
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:50,090
code that gets run you see the results
you say oh that looks roughly right or

8330
02:36:50,090 --> 02:36:50,100
you say oh that looks roughly right or
 

8331
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:52,010
you say oh that looks roughly right or
you say that's crazy

8332
02:36:52,010 --> 02:36:52,020
you say that's crazy
 

8333
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:54,469
you say that's crazy
um and maybe then you eventually get to

8334
02:36:54,469 --> 02:36:54,479
um and maybe then you eventually get to
 

8335
02:36:54,479 --> 02:36:55,910
um and maybe then you eventually get to
say well I better actually try and

8336
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:55,920
say well I better actually try and
 

8337
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:56,990
say well I better actually try and
understand what this computational

8338
02:36:56,990 --> 02:36:57,000
understand what this computational
 

8339
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,969
understand what this computational
language code did

8340
02:36:58,969 --> 02:36:58,979
language code did
 

8341
02:36:58,979 --> 02:37:00,650
language code did
um and and that becomes the thing that

8342
02:37:00,650 --> 02:37:00,660
um and and that becomes the thing that
 

8343
02:37:00,660 --> 02:37:02,630
um and and that becomes the thing that
you learn just like it's kind of an

8344
02:37:02,630 --> 02:37:02,640
you learn just like it's kind of an
 

8345
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:04,550
you learn just like it's kind of an
interesting thing because unlike with

8346
02:37:04,550 --> 02:37:04,560
interesting thing because unlike with
 

8347
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:06,710
interesting thing because unlike with
mathematics where you kind of have to

8348
02:37:06,710 --> 02:37:06,720
mathematics where you kind of have to
 

8349
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:09,650
mathematics where you kind of have to
learn it before you can use it this is a

8350
02:37:09,650 --> 02:37:09,660
learn it before you can use it this is a
 

8351
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:10,910
learn it before you can use it this is a
case where you can use it before you

8352
02:37:10,910 --> 02:37:10,920
case where you can use it before you
 

8353
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:12,889
case where you can use it before you
have to learn it well I get a sad

8354
02:37:12,889 --> 02:37:12,899
have to learn it well I get a sad
 

8355
02:37:12,899 --> 02:37:15,050
have to learn it well I get a sad
possibility here or maybe exciting

8356
02:37:15,050 --> 02:37:15,060
possibility here or maybe exciting
 

8357
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:17,570
possibility here or maybe exciting
possibility that very quickly people

8358
02:37:17,570 --> 02:37:17,580
possibility that very quickly people
 

8359
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:19,130
possibility that very quickly people
won't even look at the computational

8360
02:37:19,130 --> 02:37:19,140
won't even look at the computational
 

8361
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:20,870
won't even look at the computational
language they'll trust that it's

8362
02:37:20,870 --> 02:37:20,880
language they'll trust that it's
 

8363
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:22,730
language they'll trust that it's
generated correctly as you get better

8364
02:37:22,730 --> 02:37:22,740
generated correctly as you get better
 

8365
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:25,309
generated correctly as you get better
and better generating that language uh

8366
02:37:25,309 --> 02:37:25,319
and better generating that language uh
 

8367
02:37:25,319 --> 02:37:27,530
and better generating that language uh
yes I think that there will be enough

8368
02:37:27,530 --> 02:37:27,540
yes I think that there will be enough
 

8369
02:37:27,540 --> 02:37:30,410
yes I think that there will be enough
cases where people see you know because

8370
02:37:30,410 --> 02:37:30,420
cases where people see you know because
 

8371
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:33,410
cases where people see you know because
you can make it generate tests too and

8372
02:37:33,410 --> 02:37:33,420
you can make it generate tests too and
 

8373
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:35,750
you can make it generate tests too and
and so you'll say

8374
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:35,760
and so you'll say
 

8375
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:37,429
and so you'll say
um we're doing that I mean that's it's a

8376
02:37:37,429 --> 02:37:37,439
um we're doing that I mean that's it's a
 

8377
02:37:37,439 --> 02:37:38,690
um we're doing that I mean that's it's a
pretty cool thing actually yes because

8378
02:37:38,690 --> 02:37:38,700
pretty cool thing actually yes because
 

8379
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:41,389
pretty cool thing actually yes because
you you know say this is the code and

8380
02:37:41,389 --> 02:37:41,399
you you know say this is the code and
 

8381
02:37:41,399 --> 02:37:42,950
you you know say this is the code and
you know here are a bunch of examples of

8382
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:42,960
you know here are a bunch of examples of
 

8383
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:44,750
you know here are a bunch of examples of
running the code yeah okay people will

8384
02:37:44,750 --> 02:37:44,760
running the code yeah okay people will
 

8385
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:46,670
running the code yeah okay people will
at least look at those and they'll say

8386
02:37:46,670 --> 02:37:46,680
at least look at those and they'll say
 

8387
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:49,130
at least look at those and they'll say
that example is wrong and you know then

8388
02:37:49,130 --> 02:37:49,140
that example is wrong and you know then
 

8389
02:37:49,140 --> 02:37:51,830
that example is wrong and you know then
it'll kind of wind back from there and I

8390
02:37:51,830 --> 02:37:51,840
it'll kind of wind back from there and I
 

8391
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:53,630
it'll kind of wind back from there and I
agree that that the the kind of the

8392
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:53,640
agree that that the the kind of the
 

8393
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:55,790
agree that that the the kind of the
intermediate level of people reading the

8394
02:37:55,790 --> 02:37:55,800
intermediate level of people reading the
 

8395
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:58,010
intermediate level of people reading the
computational language code in some case

8396
02:37:58,010 --> 02:37:58,020
computational language code in some case
 

8397
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:59,450
computational language code in some case
people will do that in other case people

8398
02:37:59,450 --> 02:37:59,460
people will do that in other case people
 

8399
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:01,309
people will do that in other case people
just look at the tests

8400
02:38:01,309 --> 02:38:01,319
just look at the tests
 

8401
02:38:01,319 --> 02:38:03,410
just look at the tests
and or even just look at the results and

8402
02:38:03,410 --> 02:38:03,420
and or even just look at the results and
 

8403
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:04,849
and or even just look at the results and
sometimes it'll be obvious that you got

8404
02:38:04,849 --> 02:38:04,859
sometimes it'll be obvious that you got
 

8405
02:38:04,859 --> 02:38:06,590
sometimes it'll be obvious that you got
the thing you wanted to get because you

8406
02:38:06,590 --> 02:38:06,600
the thing you wanted to get because you
 

8407
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:08,570
the thing you wanted to get because you
were just describing you know make me

8408
02:38:08,570 --> 02:38:08,580
were just describing you know make me
 

8409
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:10,429
were just describing you know make me
this interface that has two sliders here

8410
02:38:10,429 --> 02:38:10,439
this interface that has two sliders here
 

8411
02:38:10,439 --> 02:38:11,870
this interface that has two sliders here
and you can see it has that those two

8412
02:38:11,870 --> 02:38:11,880
and you can see it has that those two
 

8413
02:38:11,880 --> 02:38:13,730
and you can see it has that those two
sliders there and that's that's kind of

8414
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:13,740
sliders there and that's that's kind of
 

8415
02:38:13,740 --> 02:38:16,010
sliders there and that's that's kind of
that's that's the result you want but I

8416
02:38:16,010 --> 02:38:16,020
that's that's the result you want but I
 

8417
02:38:16,020 --> 02:38:17,570
that's that's the result you want but I
I think you know one of the questions

8418
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:17,580
I think you know one of the questions
 

8419
02:38:17,580 --> 02:38:20,870
I think you know one of the questions
then is in that setting where you know

8420
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:20,880
then is in that setting where you know
 

8421
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:23,090
then is in that setting where you know
you have this kind of ability broad

8422
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:23,100
you have this kind of ability broad
 

8423
02:38:23,100 --> 02:38:25,210
you have this kind of ability broad
ability of people to access computation

8424
02:38:25,210 --> 02:38:25,220
ability of people to access computation
 

8425
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:27,889
ability of people to access computation
what should people learn you know in

8426
02:38:27,889 --> 02:38:27,899
what should people learn you know in
 

8427
02:38:27,899 --> 02:38:29,690
what should people learn you know in
other words right now you you know you

8428
02:38:29,690 --> 02:38:29,700
other words right now you you know you
 

8429
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:31,429
other words right now you you know you
go to Computer Science school so to

8430
02:38:31,429 --> 02:38:31,439
go to Computer Science school so to
 

8431
02:38:31,439 --> 02:38:34,190
go to Computer Science school so to
speak and a large part of what people

8432
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:34,200
speak and a large part of what people
 

8433
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:35,630
speak and a large part of what people
end up learning I mean it's been a funny

8434
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:35,640
end up learning I mean it's been a funny
 

8435
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:37,910
end up learning I mean it's been a funny
historical development because back you

8436
02:38:37,910 --> 02:38:37,920
historical development because back you
 

8437
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:40,250
historical development because back you
know 30 40 years ago computer science

8438
02:38:40,250 --> 02:38:40,260
know 30 40 years ago computer science
 

8439
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:42,590
know 30 40 years ago computer science
departments were quite small and they

8440
02:38:42,590 --> 02:38:42,600
departments were quite small and they
 

8441
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:44,090
departments were quite small and they
taught you know things like final

8442
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:44,100
taught you know things like final
 

8443
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:46,429
taught you know things like final
automata Theory and compiler Theory and

8444
02:38:46,429 --> 02:38:46,439
automata Theory and compiler Theory and
 

8445
02:38:46,439 --> 02:38:48,050
automata Theory and compiler Theory and
things like this

8446
02:38:48,050 --> 02:38:48,060
things like this
 

8447
02:38:48,060 --> 02:38:50,090
things like this
um you know company like mine rarely

8448
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:50,100
um you know company like mine rarely
 

8449
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:51,530
um you know company like mine rarely
hired people who'd come out of those

8450
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:51,540
hired people who'd come out of those
 

8451
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:54,590
hired people who'd come out of those
programs because the stuff they knew was

8452
02:38:54,590 --> 02:38:54,600
programs because the stuff they knew was
 

8453
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:56,330
programs because the stuff they knew was
I think it's very interesting I love

8454
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:56,340
I think it's very interesting I love
 

8455
02:38:56,340 --> 02:38:58,610
I think it's very interesting I love
that theoretical stuff but in terms you

8456
02:38:58,610 --> 02:38:58,620
that theoretical stuff but in terms you
 

8457
02:38:58,620 --> 02:39:00,469
that theoretical stuff but in terms you
know it wasn't that useful for the

8458
02:39:00,469 --> 02:39:00,479
know it wasn't that useful for the
 

8459
02:39:00,479 --> 02:39:01,910
know it wasn't that useful for the
things we actually had to build build in

8460
02:39:01,910 --> 02:39:01,920
things we actually had to build build in
 

8461
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:03,830
things we actually had to build build in
software engineering and then kind of

8462
02:39:03,830 --> 02:39:03,840
software engineering and then kind of
 

8463
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:06,230
software engineering and then kind of
there was this big pivot in the in the

8464
02:39:06,230 --> 02:39:06,240
there was this big pivot in the in the
 

8465
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:09,170
there was this big pivot in the in the
90s I guess where there was a big demand

8466
02:39:09,170 --> 02:39:09,180
90s I guess where there was a big demand
 

8467
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:11,330
90s I guess where there was a big demand
for sort of I.T type programming and so

8468
02:39:11,330 --> 02:39:11,340
for sort of I.T type programming and so
 

8469
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:13,429
for sort of I.T type programming and so
on and software engineering and then you

8470
02:39:13,429 --> 02:39:13,439
on and software engineering and then you
 

8471
02:39:13,439 --> 02:39:15,410
on and software engineering and then you
know big demand from students and so on

8472
02:39:15,410 --> 02:39:15,420
know big demand from students and so on
 

8473
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:17,809
know big demand from students and so on
you know we want to learn this stuff and

8474
02:39:17,809 --> 02:39:17,819
you know we want to learn this stuff and
 

8475
02:39:17,819 --> 02:39:20,570
you know we want to learn this stuff and
uh and and I think you know the thing

8476
02:39:20,570 --> 02:39:20,580
uh and and I think you know the thing
 

8477
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:22,910
uh and and I think you know the thing
that really was happening in part was

8478
02:39:22,910 --> 02:39:22,920
that really was happening in part was
 

8479
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:24,590
that really was happening in part was
lots of different fields of human

8480
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:24,600
lots of different fields of human
 

8481
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:26,750
lots of different fields of human
endeavor were becoming computational you

8482
02:39:26,750 --> 02:39:26,760
endeavor were becoming computational you
 

8483
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:28,490
endeavor were becoming computational you
know for all acts there was a there was

8484
02:39:28,490 --> 02:39:28,500
know for all acts there was a there was
 

8485
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:32,330
know for all acts there was a there was
a computational x and this is a um uh

8486
02:39:32,330 --> 02:39:32,340
a computational x and this is a um uh
 

8487
02:39:32,340 --> 02:39:34,190
a computational x and this is a um uh
and that was the thing that um that

8488
02:39:34,190 --> 02:39:34,200
and that was the thing that um that
 

8489
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:36,050
and that was the thing that um that
people were responding to

8490
02:39:36,050 --> 02:39:36,060
people were responding to
 

8491
02:39:36,060 --> 02:39:38,770
people were responding to
um and but then kind of this idea

8492
02:39:38,770 --> 02:39:38,780
um and but then kind of this idea
 

8493
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:42,050
um and but then kind of this idea
emerged that to get to that point the

8494
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:42,060
emerged that to get to that point the
 

8495
02:39:42,060 --> 02:39:43,429
emerged that to get to that point the
main thing you had to do was to learn

8496
02:39:43,429 --> 02:39:43,439
main thing you had to do was to learn
 

8497
02:39:43,439 --> 02:39:46,610
main thing you had to do was to learn
this kind of trade or or skill of doing

8498
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:46,620
this kind of trade or or skill of doing
 

8499
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:48,170
this kind of trade or or skill of doing
you know programming language type

8500
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:48,180
you know programming language type
 

8501
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:50,990
you know programming language type
programming and and that uh you know it

8502
02:39:50,990 --> 02:39:51,000
programming and and that uh you know it
 

8503
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,849
programming and and that uh you know it
kind of is a strange thing actually

8504
02:39:52,849 --> 02:39:52,859
kind of is a strange thing actually
 

8505
02:39:52,859 --> 02:39:55,550
kind of is a strange thing actually
because I you know I remember back when

8506
02:39:55,550 --> 02:39:55,560
because I you know I remember back when
 

8507
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:56,990
because I you know I remember back when
I used to be in the professor in

8508
02:39:56,990 --> 02:39:57,000
I used to be in the professor in
 

8509
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,090
I used to be in the professor in
business which is now 35 years ago so

8510
02:39:59,090 --> 02:39:59,100
business which is now 35 years ago so
 

8511
02:39:59,100 --> 02:40:01,190
business which is now 35 years ago so
gosh that's rather long time

8512
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:01,200
gosh that's rather long time
 

8513
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:04,309
gosh that's rather long time
the um you know it was it was right when

8514
02:40:04,309 --> 02:40:04,319
the um you know it was it was right when
 

8515
02:40:04,319 --> 02:40:06,889
the um you know it was it was right when
they were just starting to emerge kind

8516
02:40:06,889 --> 02:40:06,899
they were just starting to emerge kind
 

8517
02:40:06,899 --> 02:40:08,809
they were just starting to emerge kind
of computer science departments that

8518
02:40:08,809 --> 02:40:08,819
of computer science departments that
 

8519
02:40:08,819 --> 02:40:11,090
of computer science departments that
sort of a fancy research universities

8520
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:11,100
sort of a fancy research universities
 

8521
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:13,010
sort of a fancy research universities
and so on I mean some had already had it

8522
02:40:13,010 --> 02:40:13,020
and so on I mean some had already had it
 

8523
02:40:13,020 --> 02:40:15,770
and so on I mean some had already had it
but the the other ones that that um were

8524
02:40:15,770 --> 02:40:15,780
but the the other ones that that um were
 

8525
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:17,389
but the the other ones that that um were
just starting to have that and it was

8526
02:40:17,389 --> 02:40:17,399
just starting to have that and it was
 

8527
02:40:17,399 --> 02:40:19,370
just starting to have that and it was
kind of a a thing where they were kind

8528
02:40:19,370 --> 02:40:19,380
kind of a a thing where they were kind
 

8529
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:21,590
kind of a a thing where they were kind
of wondering are we going to put this

8530
02:40:21,590 --> 02:40:21,600
of wondering are we going to put this
 

8531
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:24,889
of wondering are we going to put this
thing that is essentially a a trade-like

8532
02:40:24,889 --> 02:40:24,899
thing that is essentially a a trade-like
 

8533
02:40:24,899 --> 02:40:27,469
thing that is essentially a a trade-like
skill are we going to somehow attach

8534
02:40:27,469 --> 02:40:27,479
skill are we going to somehow attach
 

8535
02:40:27,479 --> 02:40:29,870
skill are we going to somehow attach
this to the rest of what we're doing and

8536
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:29,880
this to the rest of what we're doing and
 

8537
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:32,389
this to the rest of what we're doing and
a lot of these kind of knowledge work

8538
02:40:32,389 --> 02:40:32,399
a lot of these kind of knowledge work
 

8539
02:40:32,399 --> 02:40:35,030
a lot of these kind of knowledge work
type activities have always seemed like

8540
02:40:35,030 --> 02:40:35,040
type activities have always seemed like
 

8541
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:37,250
type activities have always seemed like
things where that's where the humans

8542
02:40:37,250 --> 02:40:37,260
things where that's where the humans
 

8543
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:38,870
things where that's where the humans
have to go to school and learn all this

8544
02:40:38,870 --> 02:40:38,880
have to go to school and learn all this
 

8545
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:40,550
have to go to school and learn all this
stuff and that's never going to be

8546
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:40,560
stuff and that's never going to be
 

8547
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:43,370
stuff and that's never going to be
automated yeah and you know this is It's

8548
02:40:43,370 --> 02:40:43,380
automated yeah and you know this is It's
 

8549
02:40:43,380 --> 02:40:46,490
automated yeah and you know this is It's
kind of shocking that rather quickly you

8550
02:40:46,490 --> 02:40:46,500
kind of shocking that rather quickly you
 

8551
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:49,370
kind of shocking that rather quickly you
know a lot of that stuff is clearly

8552
02:40:49,370 --> 02:40:49,380
know a lot of that stuff is clearly
 

8553
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:52,250
know a lot of that stuff is clearly
automatable and I think you know but the

8554
02:40:52,250 --> 02:40:52,260
automatable and I think you know but the
 

8555
02:40:52,260 --> 02:40:54,650
automatable and I think you know but the
question then is okay so if it isn't

8556
02:40:54,650 --> 02:40:54,660
question then is okay so if it isn't
 

8557
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:57,530
question then is okay so if it isn't
worth learning kind of uh you know how

8558
02:40:57,530 --> 02:40:57,540
worth learning kind of uh you know how
 

8559
02:40:57,540 --> 02:40:59,270
worth learning kind of uh you know how
to do car mechanics you only need to

8560
02:40:59,270 --> 02:40:59,280
to do car mechanics you only need to
 

8561
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:01,250
to do car mechanics you only need to
know how to drive the car so to speak

8562
02:41:01,250 --> 02:41:01,260
know how to drive the car so to speak
 

8563
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:04,010
know how to drive the car so to speak
what do you need to learn and you know

8564
02:41:04,010 --> 02:41:04,020
what do you need to learn and you know
 

8565
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:05,450
what do you need to learn and you know
in other words if you don't need to know

8566
02:41:05,450 --> 02:41:05,460
in other words if you don't need to know
 

8567
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:07,370
in other words if you don't need to know
the mechanics of how to tell the

8568
02:41:07,370 --> 02:41:07,380
the mechanics of how to tell the
 

8569
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:10,370
the mechanics of how to tell the
computer in detail you know make this

8570
02:41:10,370 --> 02:41:10,380
computer in detail you know make this
 

8571
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:13,010
computer in detail you know make this
Loop you know set this variable you know

8572
02:41:13,010 --> 02:41:13,020
Loop you know set this variable you know
 

8573
02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:15,469
Loop you know set this variable you know
set up this array whatever else if you

8574
02:41:15,469 --> 02:41:15,479
set up this array whatever else if you
 

8575
02:41:15,479 --> 02:41:16,910
set up this array whatever else if you
don't have to learn that stuff you don't

8576
02:41:16,910 --> 02:41:16,920
don't have to learn that stuff you don't
 

8577
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:18,370
don't have to learn that stuff you don't
have to learn the kind of under the hood

8578
02:41:18,370 --> 02:41:18,380
have to learn the kind of under the hood
 

8579
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:21,469
have to learn the kind of under the hood
things what do you have to learn I think

8580
02:41:21,469 --> 02:41:21,479
things what do you have to learn I think
 

8581
02:41:21,479 --> 02:41:23,630
things what do you have to learn I think
the answer is you need to have an idea

8582
02:41:23,630 --> 02:41:23,640
the answer is you need to have an idea
 

8583
02:41:23,640 --> 02:41:25,910
the answer is you need to have an idea
where you want to drive the car in other

8584
02:41:25,910 --> 02:41:25,920
where you want to drive the car in other
 

8585
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:28,070
where you want to drive the car in other
words you need to have some notion of

8586
02:41:28,070 --> 02:41:28,080
words you need to have some notion of
 

8587
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:30,530
words you need to have some notion of
you know your you know you need to have

8588
02:41:30,530 --> 02:41:30,540
you know your you know you need to have
 

8589
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:32,330
you know your you know you need to have
some picture of sort of what the what

8590
02:41:32,330 --> 02:41:32,340
some picture of sort of what the what
 

8591
02:41:32,340 --> 02:41:33,530
some picture of sort of what the what
the architecture of what is

8592
02:41:33,530 --> 02:41:33,540
the architecture of what is
 

8593
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:35,809
the architecture of what is
computationally possible is well there's

8594
02:41:35,809 --> 02:41:35,819
computationally possible is well there's
 

8595
02:41:35,819 --> 02:41:38,210
computationally possible is well there's
also this kind of artistic element of um

8596
02:41:38,210 --> 02:41:38,220
also this kind of artistic element of um
 

8597
02:41:38,220 --> 02:41:40,130
also this kind of artistic element of um
of conversation because you ultimately

8598
02:41:40,130 --> 02:41:40,140
of conversation because you ultimately
 

8599
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:42,469
of conversation because you ultimately
you use natural language to control the

8600
02:41:42,469 --> 02:41:42,479
you use natural language to control the
 

8601
02:41:42,479 --> 02:41:43,370
you use natural language to control the
car

8602
02:41:43,370 --> 02:41:43,380
car
 

8603
02:41:43,380 --> 02:41:45,770
car
so it's not just the where you want to

8604
02:41:45,770 --> 02:41:45,780
so it's not just the where you want to
 

8605
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:47,809
so it's not just the where you want to
go well yeah you know it's interesting

8606
02:41:47,809 --> 02:41:47,819
go well yeah you know it's interesting
 

8607
02:41:47,819 --> 02:41:49,010
go well yeah you know it's interesting
it's a question of who's going to be a

8608
02:41:49,010 --> 02:41:49,020
it's a question of who's going to be a
 

8609
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:51,830
it's a question of who's going to be a
great prompt engineer yeah okay so my

8610
02:41:51,830 --> 02:41:51,840
great prompt engineer yeah okay so my
 

8611
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:53,990
great prompt engineer yeah okay so my
current theory this week good expository

8612
02:41:53,990 --> 02:41:54,000
current theory this week good expository
 

8613
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:55,910
current theory this week good expository
writers are good prompt Engineers what's

8614
02:41:55,910 --> 02:41:55,920
writers are good prompt Engineers what's
 

8615
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:57,770
writers are good prompt Engineers what's
an expository range so like uh somebody

8616
02:41:57,770 --> 02:41:57,780
an expository range so like uh somebody
 

8617
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:00,230
an expository range so like uh somebody
who can explain stuff well huh police

8618
02:42:00,230 --> 02:42:00,240
who can explain stuff well huh police
 

8619
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:02,210
who can explain stuff well huh police
department does that come from in the

8620
02:42:02,210 --> 02:42:02,220
department does that come from in the
 

8621
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:04,309
department does that come from in the
University yeah I have no idea I think

8622
02:42:04,309 --> 02:42:04,319
University yeah I have no idea I think
 

8623
02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:05,809
University yeah I have no idea I think
they killed off all the expository

8624
02:42:05,809 --> 02:42:05,819
they killed off all the expository
 

8625
02:42:05,819 --> 02:42:07,849
they killed off all the expository
writing departments well there you go

8626
02:42:07,849 --> 02:42:07,859
writing departments well there you go
 

8627
02:42:07,859 --> 02:42:09,830
writing departments well there you go
strong words with Stephen Wolfram well I

8628
02:42:09,830 --> 02:42:09,840
strong words with Stephen Wolfram well I
 

8629
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:11,270
strong words with Stephen Wolfram well I
don't know I don't I'm not sure if

8630
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:11,280
don't know I don't I'm not sure if
 

8631
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:13,130
don't know I don't I'm not sure if
that's right I mean I I actually am

8632
02:42:13,130 --> 02:42:13,140
that's right I mean I I actually am
 

8633
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:14,929
that's right I mean I I actually am
curious because in fact I just sort of

8634
02:42:14,929 --> 02:42:14,939
curious because in fact I just sort of
 

8635
02:42:14,939 --> 02:42:17,270
curious because in fact I just sort of
initiated this kind of study of of

8636
02:42:17,270 --> 02:42:17,280
initiated this kind of study of of
 

8637
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:19,250
initiated this kind of study of of
what's happened to different fields at

8638
02:42:19,250 --> 02:42:19,260
what's happened to different fields at
 

8639
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:20,870
what's happened to different fields at
universities because like you know there

8640
02:42:20,870 --> 02:42:20,880
universities because like you know there
 

8641
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:22,670
universities because like you know there
used to be geography departments at all

8642
02:42:22,670 --> 02:42:22,680
used to be geography departments at all
 

8643
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:24,469
used to be geography departments at all
universities and then they disappeared

8644
02:42:24,469 --> 02:42:24,479
universities and then they disappeared
 

8645
02:42:24,479 --> 02:42:26,990
universities and then they disappeared
actually right before GIS became common

8646
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:27,000
actually right before GIS became common
 

8647
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,030
actually right before GIS became common
I think they disappeared you know

8648
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:29,040
I think they disappeared you know
 

8649
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:30,889
I think they disappeared you know
Linguistics departments came and went in

8650
02:42:30,889 --> 02:42:30,899
Linguistics departments came and went in
 

8651
02:42:30,899 --> 02:42:32,750
Linguistics departments came and went in
many universities it's kind of

8652
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:32,760
many universities it's kind of
 

8653
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:34,670
many universities it's kind of
interesting because these things that

8654
02:42:34,670 --> 02:42:34,680
interesting because these things that
 

8655
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:35,990
interesting because these things that
people have thought were worth learning

8656
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:36,000
people have thought were worth learning
 

8657
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,150
people have thought were worth learning
at one time and then they kind of die

8658
02:42:38,150 --> 02:42:38,160
at one time and then they kind of die
 

8659
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:40,309
at one time and then they kind of die
off and then you know I do think that

8660
02:42:40,309 --> 02:42:40,319
off and then you know I do think that
 

8661
02:42:40,319 --> 02:42:42,050
off and then you know I do think that
it's kind of interesting that for me

8662
02:42:42,050 --> 02:42:42,060
it's kind of interesting that for me
 

8663
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:44,389
it's kind of interesting that for me
writing prompts for example people I

8664
02:42:44,389 --> 02:42:44,399
writing prompts for example people I
 

8665
02:42:44,399 --> 02:42:46,610
writing prompts for example people I
realize you know I think I'm an okay

8666
02:42:46,610 --> 02:42:46,620
realize you know I think I'm an okay
 

8667
02:42:46,620 --> 02:42:49,309
realize you know I think I'm an okay
expository writer and I realize when I'm

8668
02:42:49,309 --> 02:42:49,319
expository writer and I realize when I'm
 

8669
02:42:49,319 --> 02:42:51,050
expository writer and I realize when I'm
sloppy writing a prompt and I don't

8670
02:42:51,050 --> 02:42:51,060
sloppy writing a prompt and I don't
 

8671
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:52,969
sloppy writing a prompt and I don't
really think because I'm thinking that

8672
02:42:52,969 --> 02:42:52,979
really think because I'm thinking that
 

8673
02:42:52,979 --> 02:42:54,590
really think because I'm thinking that
I'm just talking to an AI I don't need

8674
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:54,600
I'm just talking to an AI I don't need
 

8675
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:56,150
I'm just talking to an AI I don't need
to you know try and be clear in

8676
02:42:56,150 --> 02:42:56,160
to you know try and be clear in
 

8677
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:58,370
to you know try and be clear in
explaining things that's when it gets

8678
02:42:58,370 --> 02:42:58,380
explaining things that's when it gets
 

8679
02:42:58,380 --> 02:43:00,410
explaining things that's when it gets
totally confused and I mean in some

8680
02:43:00,410 --> 02:43:00,420
totally confused and I mean in some
 

8681
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:02,030
totally confused and I mean in some
sense you have been writing prompts for

8682
02:43:02,030 --> 02:43:02,040
sense you have been writing prompts for
 

8683
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:03,590
sense you have been writing prompts for
a long time with wolf from alpha

8684
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:03,600
a long time with wolf from alpha
 

8685
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:05,570
a long time with wolf from alpha
thinking about this kind of stuff yeah

8686
02:43:05,570 --> 02:43:05,580
thinking about this kind of stuff yeah
 

8687
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:07,130
thinking about this kind of stuff yeah
how do you convert natural language into

8688
02:43:07,130 --> 02:43:07,140
how do you convert natural language into
 

8689
02:43:07,140 --> 02:43:09,349
how do you convert natural language into
competition well right but that's a you

8690
02:43:09,349 --> 02:43:09,359
competition well right but that's a you
 

8691
02:43:09,359 --> 02:43:11,150
competition well right but that's a you
know the one thing that I'm wondering

8692
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:11,160
know the one thing that I'm wondering
 

8693
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:15,110
know the one thing that I'm wondering
about is uh you know it is remarkable

8694
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,120
about is uh you know it is remarkable
 

8695
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:17,330
about is uh you know it is remarkable
the extent to which you can address an

8696
02:43:17,330 --> 02:43:17,340
the extent to which you can address an
 

8697
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:19,969
the extent to which you can address an
llm like you can address a human so to

8698
02:43:19,969 --> 02:43:19,979
llm like you can address a human so to
 

8699
02:43:19,979 --> 02:43:22,550
llm like you can address a human so to
speak and and I think that is because it

8700
02:43:22,550 --> 02:43:22,560
speak and and I think that is because it
 

8701
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:23,990
speak and and I think that is because it
you know it learned from all of us

8702
02:43:23,990 --> 02:43:24,000
you know it learned from all of us
 

8703
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,110
you know it learned from all of us
humans it's it's uh the reason that it

8704
02:43:27,110 --> 02:43:27,120
humans it's it's uh the reason that it
 

8705
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:29,330
humans it's it's uh the reason that it
responds to the ways that we will

8706
02:43:29,330 --> 02:43:29,340
responds to the ways that we will
 

8707
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:32,150
responds to the ways that we will
explain things to humans is because it

8708
02:43:32,150 --> 02:43:32,160
explain things to humans is because it
 

8709
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:34,550
explain things to humans is because it
is a representation of how humans talk

8710
02:43:34,550 --> 02:43:34,560
is a representation of how humans talk
 

8711
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:37,010
is a representation of how humans talk
about things but it is bizarre to me

8712
02:43:37,010 --> 02:43:37,020
about things but it is bizarre to me
 

8713
02:43:37,020 --> 02:43:40,730
about things but it is bizarre to me
some of the things that kind of are sort

8714
02:43:40,730 --> 02:43:40,740
some of the things that kind of are sort
 

8715
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:43,309
some of the things that kind of are sort
of expository mechanisms that I've

8716
02:43:43,309 --> 02:43:43,319
of expository mechanisms that I've
 

8717
02:43:43,319 --> 02:43:46,730
of expository mechanisms that I've
learned in trying to write clear you

8718
02:43:46,730 --> 02:43:46,740
learned in trying to write clear you
 

8719
02:43:46,740 --> 02:43:49,910
learned in trying to write clear you
know expositions in English that you

8720
02:43:49,910 --> 02:43:49,920
know expositions in English that you
 

8721
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:52,630
know expositions in English that you
know just for humans that those same

8722
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:52,640
know just for humans that those same
 

8723
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:55,730
know just for humans that those same
mechanisms seem to also be useful for

8724
02:43:55,730 --> 02:43:55,740
mechanisms seem to also be useful for
 

8725
02:43:55,740 --> 02:43:58,490
mechanisms seem to also be useful for
for for the llm but on top of that

8726
02:43:58,490 --> 02:43:58,500
for for the llm but on top of that
 

8727
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:00,950
for for the llm but on top of that
what's useful is the kind of mechanisms

8728
02:44:00,950 --> 02:44:00,960
what's useful is the kind of mechanisms
 

8729
02:44:00,960 --> 02:44:02,690
what's useful is the kind of mechanisms
that maybe a psychotherapist employs

8730
02:44:02,690 --> 02:44:02,700
that maybe a psychotherapist employs
 

8731
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:06,770
that maybe a psychotherapist employs
which is a kind of uh like almost

8732
02:44:06,770 --> 02:44:06,780
which is a kind of uh like almost
 

8733
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:08,450
which is a kind of uh like almost
manipulative or game theoretic

8734
02:44:08,450 --> 02:44:08,460
manipulative or game theoretic
 

8735
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:10,969
manipulative or game theoretic
interaction where Maybe

8736
02:44:10,969 --> 02:44:10,979
interaction where Maybe
 

8737
02:44:10,979 --> 02:44:13,849
interaction where Maybe
you would do with a friend like a

8738
02:44:13,849 --> 02:44:13,859
you would do with a friend like a
 

8739
02:44:13,859 --> 02:44:15,710
you would do with a friend like a
thought experiment that if this is the

8740
02:44:15,710 --> 02:44:15,720
thought experiment that if this is the
 

8741
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:18,770
thought experiment that if this is the
last day you were to live or yeah if if

8742
02:44:18,770 --> 02:44:18,780
last day you were to live or yeah if if
 

8743
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:20,690
last day you were to live or yeah if if
I ask you this question and you answer

8744
02:44:20,690 --> 02:44:20,700
I ask you this question and you answer
 

8745
02:44:20,700 --> 02:44:22,910
I ask you this question and you answer
wrong I will kill you those kinds of

8746
02:44:22,910 --> 02:44:22,920
wrong I will kill you those kinds of
 

8747
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:25,070
wrong I will kill you those kinds of
problems seem to also help yes in

8748
02:44:25,070 --> 02:44:25,080
problems seem to also help yes in
 

8749
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:27,410
problems seem to also help yes in
interesting ways yeah so it makes you

8750
02:44:27,410 --> 02:44:27,420
interesting ways yeah so it makes you
 

8751
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:29,690
interesting ways yeah so it makes you
wonder like the way a therapist I think

8752
02:44:29,690 --> 02:44:29,700
wonder like the way a therapist I think
 

8753
02:44:29,700 --> 02:44:32,210
wonder like the way a therapist I think
would like a good therapist probably you

8754
02:44:32,210 --> 02:44:32,220
would like a good therapist probably you
 

8755
02:44:32,220 --> 02:44:34,490
would like a good therapist probably you
we create layers

8756
02:44:34,490 --> 02:44:34,500
we create layers
 

8757
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:38,030
we create layers
in our human mind to between like uh

8758
02:44:38,030 --> 02:44:38,040
in our human mind to between like uh
 

8759
02:44:38,040 --> 02:44:40,250
in our human mind to between like uh
between between the outside world and

8760
02:44:40,250 --> 02:44:40,260
between between the outside world and
 

8761
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:43,190
between between the outside world and
we'll just true what is true to us and

8762
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:43,200
we'll just true what is true to us and
 

8763
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:44,809
we'll just true what is true to us and
um maybe about trauma and all those

8764
02:44:44,809 --> 02:44:44,819
um maybe about trauma and all those
 

8765
02:44:44,819 --> 02:44:46,849
um maybe about trauma and all those
kinds of things so projecting that into

8766
02:44:46,849 --> 02:44:46,859
kinds of things so projecting that into
 

8767
02:44:46,859 --> 02:44:49,969
kinds of things so projecting that into
an llm maybe there might be a deep truth

8768
02:44:49,969 --> 02:44:49,979
an llm maybe there might be a deep truth
 

8769
02:44:49,979 --> 02:44:52,309
an llm maybe there might be a deep truth
that's it's concealing from you it's not

8770
02:44:52,309 --> 02:44:52,319
that's it's concealing from you it's not
 

8771
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:54,830
that's it's concealing from you it's not
aware of it you get to that truth you

8772
02:44:54,830 --> 02:44:54,840
aware of it you get to that truth you
 

8773
02:44:54,840 --> 02:44:56,290
aware of it you get to that truth you
have to kind of really kind of

8774
02:44:56,290 --> 02:44:56,300
have to kind of really kind of
 

8775
02:44:56,300 --> 02:44:58,250
have to kind of really kind of
manipulate this yeah yeah right it's

8776
02:44:58,250 --> 02:44:58,260
manipulate this yeah yeah right it's
 

8777
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:00,710
manipulate this yeah yeah right it's
like these jailbreaking jailbreaking for

8778
02:45:00,710 --> 02:45:00,720
like these jailbreaking jailbreaking for
 

8779
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:03,349
like these jailbreaking jailbreaking for
llms and but the space of jailbreaking

8780
02:45:03,349 --> 02:45:03,359
llms and but the space of jailbreaking
 

8781
02:45:03,359 --> 02:45:05,150
llms and but the space of jailbreaking
techniques

8782
02:45:05,150 --> 02:45:05,160
techniques
 

8783
02:45:05,160 --> 02:45:07,429
techniques
as opposed to being fun little hacks

8784
02:45:07,429 --> 02:45:07,439
as opposed to being fun little hacks
 

8785
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:10,370
as opposed to being fun little hacks
that could be an entire system sure yeah

8786
02:45:10,370 --> 02:45:10,380
that could be an entire system sure yeah
 

8787
02:45:10,380 --> 02:45:12,230
that could be an entire system sure yeah
I mean just think about the computer

8788
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:12,240
I mean just think about the computer
 

8789
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:14,929
I mean just think about the computer
security aspects of of how you you know

8790
02:45:14,929 --> 02:45:14,939
security aspects of of how you you know
 

8791
02:45:14,939 --> 02:45:18,290
security aspects of of how you you know
phishing and and computer security you

8792
02:45:18,290 --> 02:45:18,300
phishing and and computer security you
 

8793
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:20,690
phishing and and computer security you
know fishing of humans yeah and fishing

8794
02:45:20,690 --> 02:45:20,700
know fishing of humans yeah and fishing
 

8795
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:23,750
know fishing of humans yeah and fishing
of llms is is a is a they're very

8796
02:45:23,750 --> 02:45:23,760
of llms is is a is a they're very
 

8797
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:26,090
of llms is is a is a they're very
similar kinds of things but I think I

8798
02:45:26,090 --> 02:45:26,100
similar kinds of things but I think I
 

8799
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:28,429
similar kinds of things but I think I
mean this this um

8800
02:45:28,429 --> 02:45:28,439
mean this this um
 

8801
02:45:28,439 --> 02:45:31,250
mean this this um
uh you know this whole thing about kind

8802
02:45:31,250 --> 02:45:31,260
uh you know this whole thing about kind
 

8803
02:45:31,260 --> 02:45:35,090
uh you know this whole thing about kind
of the AI Wranglers AI psychologists all

8804
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:35,100
of the AI Wranglers AI psychologists all
 

8805
02:45:35,100 --> 02:45:37,130
of the AI Wranglers AI psychologists all
that stuff will come the thing that I'm

8806
02:45:37,130 --> 02:45:37,140
that stuff will come the thing that I'm
 

8807
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:39,590
that stuff will come the thing that I'm
curious about is right now the things

8808
02:45:39,590 --> 02:45:39,600
curious about is right now the things
 

8809
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:42,110
curious about is right now the things
that are sort of prompt hacks are quite

8810
02:45:42,110 --> 02:45:42,120
that are sort of prompt hacks are quite
 

8811
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:43,730
that are sort of prompt hacks are quite
human they're quite sort of

8812
02:45:43,730 --> 02:45:43,740
human they're quite sort of
 

8813
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:46,130
human they're quite sort of
psychological human kinds of hacks the

8814
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:46,140
psychological human kinds of hacks the
 

8815
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:47,690
psychological human kinds of hacks the
thing I do wonder about is if we

8816
02:45:47,690 --> 02:45:47,700
thing I do wonder about is if we
 

8817
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:50,210
thing I do wonder about is if we
understood more about kind of uh the

8818
02:45:50,210 --> 02:45:50,220
understood more about kind of uh the
 

8819
02:45:50,220 --> 02:45:52,370
understood more about kind of uh the
science of the llm will there be some

8820
02:45:52,370 --> 02:45:52,380
science of the llm will there be some
 

8821
02:45:52,380 --> 02:45:54,950
science of the llm will there be some
totally bizarre hack that is you know

8822
02:45:54,950 --> 02:45:54,960
totally bizarre hack that is you know
 

8823
02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:57,050
totally bizarre hack that is you know
like repeater word three times and put a

8824
02:45:57,050 --> 02:45:57,060
like repeater word three times and put a
 

8825
02:45:57,060 --> 02:45:58,730
like repeater word three times and put a
this that and the other there that

8826
02:45:58,730 --> 02:45:58,740
this that and the other there that
 

8827
02:45:58,740 --> 02:46:01,250
this that and the other there that
somehow plugs into some aspect of how

8828
02:46:01,250 --> 02:46:01,260
somehow plugs into some aspect of how
 

8829
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:02,929
somehow plugs into some aspect of how
the llm works

8830
02:46:02,929 --> 02:46:02,939
the llm works
 

8831
02:46:02,939 --> 02:46:05,630
the llm works
um that is not you know that's kind of

8832
02:46:05,630 --> 02:46:05,640
um that is not you know that's kind of
 

8833
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:07,849
um that is not you know that's kind of
like like an optical illusion for humans

8834
02:46:07,849 --> 02:46:07,859
like like an optical illusion for humans
 

8835
02:46:07,859 --> 02:46:10,130
like like an optical illusion for humans
for example like one of these mind hacks

8836
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:10,140
for example like one of these mind hacks
 

8837
02:46:10,140 --> 02:46:11,750
for example like one of these mind hacks
for humans what are the Mind hacks for

8838
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:11,760
for humans what are the Mind hacks for
 

8839
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:13,730
for humans what are the Mind hacks for
the llms I don't think we know that yet

8840
02:46:13,730 --> 02:46:13,740
the llms I don't think we know that yet
 

8841
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:16,370
the llms I don't think we know that yet
and that becomes a kind of

8842
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:16,380
and that becomes a kind of
 

8843
02:46:16,380 --> 02:46:18,830
and that becomes a kind of
us figuring out reverse engineering the

8844
02:46:18,830 --> 02:46:18,840
us figuring out reverse engineering the
 

8845
02:46:18,840 --> 02:46:21,710
us figuring out reverse engineering the
language that controls the llms and the

8846
02:46:21,710 --> 02:46:21,720
language that controls the llms and the
 

8847
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:23,750
language that controls the llms and the
thing is the reverse engineering can be

8848
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:23,760
thing is the reverse engineering can be
 

8849
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:26,090
thing is the reverse engineering can be
done by a very large percentage of the

8850
02:46:26,090 --> 02:46:26,100
done by a very large percentage of the
 

8851
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:27,469
done by a very large percentage of the
population now because it's natural

8852
02:46:27,469 --> 02:46:27,479
population now because it's natural
 

8853
02:46:27,479 --> 02:46:30,110
population now because it's natural
language interface right it's kind of

8854
02:46:30,110 --> 02:46:30,120
language interface right it's kind of
 

8855
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:31,670
language interface right it's kind of
interesting to see that you were there

8856
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:31,680
interesting to see that you were there
 

8857
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:32,929
interesting to see that you were there
at the birth of the computer science

8858
02:46:32,929 --> 02:46:32,939
at the birth of the computer science
 

8859
02:46:32,939 --> 02:46:34,010
at the birth of the computer science
department

8860
02:46:34,010 --> 02:46:34,020
department
 

8861
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:36,830
department
as a thing and you might be there at the

8862
02:46:36,830 --> 02:46:36,840
as a thing and you might be there at the
 

8863
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:38,510
as a thing and you might be there at the
death of the computer science term as

8864
02:46:38,510 --> 02:46:38,520
death of the computer science term as
 

8865
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:40,130
death of the computer science term as
the thing well yeah I don't know there

8866
02:46:40,130 --> 02:46:40,140
the thing well yeah I don't know there
 

8867
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:41,630
the thing well yeah I don't know there
were computer science departments that

8868
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:41,640
were computer science departments that
 

8869
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:43,849
were computer science departments that
existed earlier but the ones that the

8870
02:46:43,849 --> 02:46:43,859
existed earlier but the ones that the
 

8871
02:46:43,859 --> 02:46:45,830
existed earlier but the ones that the
broadening of of every University had to

8872
02:46:45,830 --> 02:46:45,840
broadening of of every University had to
 

8873
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:47,330
broadening of of every University had to
have a computer science department yes I

8874
02:46:47,330 --> 02:46:47,340
have a computer science department yes I
 

8875
02:46:47,340 --> 02:46:49,790
have a computer science department yes I
was I was uh I watched that so to speak

8876
02:46:49,790 --> 02:46:49,800
was I was uh I watched that so to speak
 

8877
02:46:49,800 --> 02:46:52,690
was I was uh I watched that so to speak
and but I think the thing to understand

8878
02:46:52,690 --> 02:46:52,700
and but I think the thing to understand
 

8879
02:46:52,700 --> 02:46:56,690
and but I think the thing to understand
is okay so first of all there's a whole

8880
02:46:56,690 --> 02:46:56,700
is okay so first of all there's a whole
 

8881
02:46:56,700 --> 02:46:58,130
is okay so first of all there's a whole
theoretical area of computer science

8882
02:46:58,130 --> 02:46:58,140
theoretical area of computer science
 

8883
02:46:58,140 --> 02:47:00,469
theoretical area of computer science
that I think is great and you know

8884
02:47:00,469 --> 02:47:00,479
that I think is great and you know
 

8885
02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:03,590
that I think is great and you know
that's a fine thing the the

8886
02:47:03,590 --> 02:47:03,600
that's a fine thing the the
 

8887
02:47:03,600 --> 02:47:05,630
that's a fine thing the the
you know in a sense you know people

8888
02:47:05,630 --> 02:47:05,640
you know in a sense you know people
 

8889
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:07,610
you know in a sense you know people
often say any field that has the word

8890
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:07,620
often say any field that has the word
 

8891
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:09,590
often say any field that has the word
science tacked onto it probably isn't

8892
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:09,600
science tacked onto it probably isn't
 

8893
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:12,590
science tacked onto it probably isn't
one yeah um and strong words right and

8894
02:47:12,590 --> 02:47:12,600
one yeah um and strong words right and
 

8895
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:15,910
one yeah um and strong words right and
let's see uh nutrition science

8896
02:47:15,910 --> 02:47:15,920
let's see uh nutrition science
 

8897
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:18,230
let's see uh nutrition science
Neuroscience that one's an interesting

you know there's a that's a chat GPT

8902
02:47:23,510 --> 02:47:23,520
you know there's a that's a chat GPT
 

8903
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:26,150
you know there's a that's a chat GPT
informed science in a sense because it's

8904
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:26,160
informed science in a sense because it's
 

8905
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:27,530

it's pretty clear you know brains can be
 

8949
02:48:13,319 --> 02:48:16,370
it's pretty clear you know brains can be
represented pretty well by simple

02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:21,349
artificial neural net type models and
that means that's it that's what we have

02:48:21,349 --> 02:48:21,359
that means that's it that's what we have
 

8955
02:48:21,359 --> 02:48:23,150
that means that's it that's what we have

02:48:43,670 --> 02:48:43,680
science of what's going on there that's
 

8975
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:45,530
science of what's going on there that's
the that's the remaining challenge so to

8976
02:48:45,530 --> 02:48:45,540
the that's the remaining challenge so to
 

8977
02:48:45,540 --> 02:48:47,389
the that's the remaining challenge so to
speak but we you know we know we don't

8978
02:48:47,389 --> 02:48:47,399
speak but we you know we know we don't
 

8979
02:48:47,399 --> 02:48:49,250
speak but we you know we know we don't
have to dive down to some some different

8980
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:49,260
have to dive down to some some different
 

8981
02:48:49,260 --> 02:48:51,170
have to dive down to some some different
layer but anyway we were talking about

8982
02:48:51,170 --> 02:48:51,180
layer but anyway we were talking about
 

8983
02:48:51,180 --> 02:48:52,790
layer but anyway we were talking about
things that had science in their name

8984
02:48:52,790 --> 02:48:52,800
things that had science in their name
 

8985
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:56,030
things that had science in their name
yes and um you know I think that the uh

8986
02:48:56,030 --> 02:48:56,040
yes and um you know I think that the uh
 

8987
02:48:56,040 --> 02:48:56,690
yes and um you know I think that the uh
um

8988
02:48:56,690 --> 02:48:56,700
um
 

8989
02:48:56,700 --> 02:48:58,490
um
you know what what happens to computer

8990
02:48:58,490 --> 02:48:58,500
you know what what happens to computer
 

8991
02:48:58,500 --> 02:49:01,809
you know what what happens to computer
science well I think the thing that um

8992
02:49:01,809 --> 02:49:01,819
science well I think the thing that um
 

8993
02:49:01,819 --> 02:49:04,610
science well I think the thing that um
uh you know there is a thing that

8994
02:49:04,610 --> 02:49:04,620
uh you know there is a thing that
 

8995
02:49:04,620 --> 02:49:06,770
uh you know there is a thing that
everybody should know and that's how to

8996
02:49:06,770 --> 02:49:06,780
everybody should know and that's how to
 

8997
02:49:06,780 --> 02:49:08,349
everybody should know and that's how to
think about the world computationally

8998
02:49:08,349 --> 02:49:08,359
think about the world computationally
 

8999
02:49:08,359 --> 02:49:11,210
think about the world computationally
and that means you know you look at all

9000
02:49:11,210 --> 02:49:11,220
and that means you know you look at all
 

9001
02:49:11,220 --> 02:49:12,349
and that means you know you look at all
the different kinds of things we deal

9002
02:49:12,349 --> 02:49:12,359
the different kinds of things we deal
 

9003
02:49:12,359 --> 02:49:15,110
the different kinds of things we deal
with and there are ways to kind of have

9004
02:49:15,110 --> 02:49:15,120
with and there are ways to kind of have
 

9005
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:17,090
with and there are ways to kind of have
a formal representation of those things

9006
02:49:17,090 --> 02:49:17,100
a formal representation of those things
 

9007
02:49:17,100 --> 02:49:20,389
a formal representation of those things
you know it's like well what is a what

9008
02:49:20,389 --> 02:49:20,399
you know it's like well what is a what
 

9009
02:49:20,399 --> 02:49:22,130
you know it's like well what is a what
is an image you know what how do we

9010
02:49:22,130 --> 02:49:22,140
is an image you know what how do we
 

9011
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:23,929
is an image you know what how do we
represent that what is color how do we

9012
02:49:23,929 --> 02:49:23,939
represent that what is color how do we
 

9013
02:49:23,939 --> 02:49:26,870
represent that what is color how do we
represent that what is you know what are

9014
02:49:26,870 --> 02:49:26,880
represent that what is you know what are
 

9015
02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:28,370
represent that what is you know what are
all these different kinds of things what

9016
02:49:28,370 --> 02:49:28,380
all these different kinds of things what
 

9017
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:29,929
all these different kinds of things what
is I don't know smell or something how

9018
02:49:29,929 --> 02:49:29,939
is I don't know smell or something how
 

9019
02:49:29,939 --> 02:49:31,309
is I don't know smell or something how
should we represent that what are the

9020
02:49:31,309 --> 02:49:31,319
should we represent that what are the
 

9021
02:49:31,319 --> 02:49:32,870
should we represent that what are the
shapes molecules and things that

9022
02:49:32,870 --> 02:49:32,880
shapes molecules and things that
 

9023
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:35,270
shapes molecules and things that
correspond to that what is uh you know

9024
02:49:35,270 --> 02:49:35,280
correspond to that what is uh you know
 

9025
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:37,309
correspond to that what is uh you know
these things about how do we represent

9026
02:49:37,309 --> 02:49:37,319
these things about how do we represent
 

9027
02:49:37,319 --> 02:49:39,050
these things about how do we represent
the world in some kind of formal level

9028
02:49:39,050 --> 02:49:39,060
the world in some kind of formal level
 

9029
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:41,929
the world in some kind of formal level
and I think my my current thinking I'm

9030
02:49:41,929 --> 02:49:41,939
and I think my my current thinking I'm
 

9031
02:49:41,939 --> 02:49:44,090
and I think my my current thinking I'm
not real happy with this yet but um you

9032
02:49:44,090 --> 02:49:44,100
not real happy with this yet but um you
 

9033
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:45,349
not real happy with this yet but um you
know it's kind of computer science it's

9034
02:49:45,349 --> 02:49:45,359
know it's kind of computer science it's
 

9035
02:49:45,359 --> 02:49:48,469
know it's kind of computer science it's
kind of Cs and what really is important

9036
02:49:48,469 --> 02:49:48,479
kind of Cs and what really is important
 

9037
02:49:48,479 --> 02:49:51,469
kind of Cs and what really is important
is kind of computational X for all X and

9038
02:49:51,469 --> 02:49:51,479
is kind of computational X for all X and
 

9039
02:49:51,479 --> 02:49:52,910
is kind of computational X for all X and
there's this kind of thing which is kind

9040
02:49:52,910 --> 02:49:52,920
there's this kind of thing which is kind
 

9041
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:57,290
there's this kind of thing which is kind
of like CX not Cs and CX is a this kind

9042
02:49:57,290 --> 02:49:57,300
of like CX not Cs and CX is a this kind
 

9043
02:49:57,300 --> 02:49:58,790
of like CX not Cs and CX is a this kind
of computational understanding of the

9044
02:49:58,790 --> 02:49:58,800
of computational understanding of the
 

9045
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:01,670
of computational understanding of the
world that isn't the sort of details of

9046
02:50:01,670 --> 02:50:01,680
world that isn't the sort of details of
 

9047
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:03,290
world that isn't the sort of details of
programming and programming languages

9048
02:50:03,290 --> 02:50:03,300
programming and programming languages
 

9049
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:04,790
programming and programming languages
and the details of how particular

9050
02:50:04,790 --> 02:50:04,800
and the details of how particular
 

9051
02:50:04,800 --> 02:50:06,950
and the details of how particular
computers are made it's this kind of way

9052
02:50:06,950 --> 02:50:06,960
computers are made it's this kind of way
 

9053
02:50:06,960 --> 02:50:08,630
computers are made it's this kind of way
of formalizing the world it's kind of

9054
02:50:08,630 --> 02:50:08,640
of formalizing the world it's kind of
 

9055
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:10,550
of formalizing the world it's kind of
kind of a little bit like what logic was

9056
02:50:10,550 --> 02:50:10,560
kind of a little bit like what logic was
 

9057
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:13,490
kind of a little bit like what logic was
going for back in the day and we're now

9058
02:50:13,490 --> 02:50:13,500
going for back in the day and we're now
 

9059
02:50:13,500 --> 02:50:14,870
going for back in the day and we're now
trying to find a formalization of

9060
02:50:14,870 --> 02:50:14,880
trying to find a formalization of
 

9061
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:16,190
trying to find a formalization of
everything in the world you can kind of

9062
02:50:16,190 --> 02:50:16,200
everything in the world you can kind of
 

9063
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:18,410
everything in the world you can kind of
see you know we made a poster years ago

9064
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:18,420
see you know we made a poster years ago
 

9065
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:21,050
see you know we made a poster years ago
of kind of the uh the the growth of

9066
02:50:21,050 --> 02:50:21,060
of kind of the uh the the growth of
 

9067
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:23,210
of kind of the uh the the growth of
systematic data in the world so all

9068
02:50:23,210 --> 02:50:23,220
systematic data in the world so all
 

9069
02:50:23,220 --> 02:50:25,730
systematic data in the world so all
these different kinds of things that you

9070
02:50:25,730 --> 02:50:25,740
these different kinds of things that you
 

9071
02:50:25,740 --> 02:50:28,010
these different kinds of things that you
know there were sort of systematic

9072
02:50:28,010 --> 02:50:28,020
know there were sort of systematic
 

9073
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:30,530
know there were sort of systematic
descriptions found for those things like

9074
02:50:30,530 --> 02:50:30,540
descriptions found for those things like
 

9075
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:32,990
descriptions found for those things like
you know what point do people have the

9076
02:50:32,990 --> 02:50:33,000
you know what point do people have the
 

9077
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,929
you know what point do people have the
idea of having calendars dates you know

9078
02:50:35,929 --> 02:50:35,939
idea of having calendars dates you know
 

9079
02:50:35,939 --> 02:50:38,210
idea of having calendars dates you know
a systematic description of what day it

9080
02:50:38,210 --> 02:50:38,220
a systematic description of what day it
 

9081
02:50:38,220 --> 02:50:40,429
a systematic description of what day it
was at what point did people have the

9082
02:50:40,429 --> 02:50:40,439
was at what point did people have the
 

9083
02:50:40,439 --> 02:50:42,290
was at what point did people have the
idea you know systematic descriptions of

9084
02:50:42,290 --> 02:50:42,300
idea you know systematic descriptions of
 

9085
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:45,050
idea you know systematic descriptions of
these kinds of things and as soon as one

9086
02:50:45,050 --> 02:50:45,060
these kinds of things and as soon as one
 

9087
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:48,170
these kinds of things and as soon as one
can you know people you know as a way of

9088
02:50:48,170 --> 02:50:48,180
can you know people you know as a way of
 

9089
02:50:48,180 --> 02:50:50,270
can you know people you know as a way of
sort of formulating how do you how do

9090
02:50:50,270 --> 02:50:50,280
sort of formulating how do you how do
 

9091
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:53,210
sort of formulating how do you how do
you think about the world in a sort of a

9092
02:50:53,210 --> 02:50:53,220
you think about the world in a sort of a
 

9093
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:54,889
you think about the world in a sort of a
formal way so that you can kind of build

9094
02:50:54,889 --> 02:50:54,899
formal way so that you can kind of build
 

9095
02:50:54,899 --> 02:50:58,070
formal way so that you can kind of build
up a tower of of cable abilities you

9096
02:50:58,070 --> 02:50:58,080
up a tower of of cable abilities you
 

9097
02:50:58,080 --> 02:50:59,690
up a tower of of cable abilities you
kind of have to know sort of how to

9098
02:50:59,690 --> 02:50:59,700
kind of have to know sort of how to
 

9099
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:01,130
kind of have to know sort of how to
think about the world computationally it

9100
02:51:01,130 --> 02:51:01,140
think about the world computationally it
 

9101
02:51:01,140 --> 02:51:03,530
think about the world computationally it
kind of needs a name and it isn't you

9102
02:51:03,530 --> 02:51:03,540
kind of needs a name and it isn't you
 

9103
02:51:03,540 --> 02:51:06,110
kind of needs a name and it isn't you
know we implement it with computers so

9104
02:51:06,110 --> 02:51:06,120
know we implement it with computers so
 

9105
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:08,210
know we implement it with computers so
that's we talk about it as computational

9106
02:51:08,210 --> 02:51:08,220
that's we talk about it as computational
 

9107
02:51:08,220 --> 02:51:11,570
that's we talk about it as computational
but really what it is is a formal way of

9108
02:51:11,570 --> 02:51:11,580
but really what it is is a formal way of
 

9109
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:13,370
but really what it is is a formal way of
talking about the world what is the

9110
02:51:13,370 --> 02:51:13,380
talking about the world what is the
 

9111
02:51:13,380 --> 02:51:15,410
talking about the world what is the
formalism of the world so to speak and

9112
02:51:15,410 --> 02:51:15,420
formalism of the world so to speak and
 

9113
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:17,570
formalism of the world so to speak and
how do we learn about kind of how to

9114
02:51:17,570 --> 02:51:17,580
how do we learn about kind of how to
 

9115
02:51:17,580 --> 02:51:18,889
how do we learn about kind of how to
think about different aspects of the

9116
02:51:18,889 --> 02:51:18,899
think about different aspects of the
 

9117
02:51:18,899 --> 02:51:20,510
think about different aspects of the
world in a formal way so I think

9118
02:51:20,510 --> 02:51:20,520
world in a formal way so I think
 

9119
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:23,210
world in a formal way so I think
sometimes when you use the word formal

9120
02:51:23,210 --> 02:51:23,220
sometimes when you use the word formal
 

9121
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:26,150
sometimes when you use the word formal
it uh kind of implies highly constrained

9122
02:51:26,150 --> 02:51:26,160
it uh kind of implies highly constrained
 

9123
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:28,670
it uh kind of implies highly constrained
and perhaps that's not doesn't have to

9124
02:51:28,670 --> 02:51:28,680
and perhaps that's not doesn't have to
 

9125
02:51:28,680 --> 02:51:30,469
and perhaps that's not doesn't have to
be highly constrained so computational

9126
02:51:30,469 --> 02:51:30,479
be highly constrained so computational
 

9127
02:51:30,479 --> 02:51:33,530

wonder I mean
 

9133
02:51:38,100 --> 02:51:40,490
wonder I mean
I wonder if it's if you think natural

9134

I wonder if it's if you think natural

02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:43,610
I wonder if it's if you think natural

it at the speed that they were speaking
at it's like kind of I'm it's um and so

9224
02:53:27,170 --> 02:53:27,180
at it's like kind of I'm it's um and so
 

9225
02:53:27,180 --> 02:53:29,210
at it's like kind of I'm it's um and so
I think that's some I mean I've actually

I think that's some I mean I've actually
 

9227
02:53:29,220 --> 02:53:31,070
I think that's some I mean I've actually

02:53:34,979 --> 02:53:37,610

that out oh spoken because it's readable

9234
02:53:37,610 --> 02:53:37,620
that out oh spoken because it's readable
 

9235
02:53:37,620 --> 02:53:40,370
that out oh spoken because it's readable
right yeah it's readable as a you know

9236
02:53:40,370 --> 02:53:40,380
right yeah it's readable as a you know
 

9237
02:53:40,380 --> 02:53:42,950
right yeah it's readable as a you know
as a way that we would read text but if

9238
02:53:42,950 --> 02:53:42,960
as a way that we would read text but if
 

9239
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:44,450
as a way that we would read text but if
you actually want to speak it and it's

9240
02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:44,460
you actually want to speak it and it's
 

9241
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:46,190
you actually want to speak it and it's
useful you know if you're trying to talk

9242
02:53:46,190 --> 02:53:46,200
useful you know if you're trying to talk
 

9243
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:47,570
useful you know if you're trying to talk
to somebody about writing a piece of

02:53:47,570 --> 02:53:47,580
to somebody about writing a piece of
 

9245
02:53:47,580 --> 02:53:49,190
to somebody about writing a piece of
code it's useful to be able to say

9246
02:53:49,190 --> 02:53:49,200
code it's useful to be able to say
 

9247
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:51,950
code it's useful to be able to say
something and it should be possible and

9248
02:53:51,950 --> 02:53:51,960
something and it should be possible and
 

9249
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:53,630
something and it should be possible and
I think it's very frustrating it's one

9250
02:53:53,630 --> 02:53:53,640
I think it's very frustrating it's one
 

9251
02:53:53,640 --> 02:53:55,010
I think it's very frustrating it's one
of those problems that maybe I maybe

9252
02:53:55,010 --> 02:53:55,020
of those problems that maybe I maybe
 

9253
02:53:55,020 --> 02:53:56,389
of those problems that maybe I maybe
this is one of these things where I

9254
02:53:56,389 --> 02:53:56,399
this is one of these things where I
 

9255
02:53:56,399 --> 02:53:58,490
this is one of these things where I
should try and get an llm to help me how

9256
02:53:58,490 --> 02:53:58,500
should try and get an llm to help me how
 

9257
02:53:58,500 --> 02:54:00,349
should try and get an llm to help me how
to make it speakable maybe maybe it's

9258
02:54:00,349 --> 02:54:00,359
to make it speakable maybe maybe it's
 

9259
02:54:00,359 --> 02:54:02,330
to make it speakable maybe maybe it's
easier than you realize when you watch I

9260
02:54:02,330 --> 02:54:02,340
easier than you realize when you watch I
 

9261
02:54:02,340 --> 02:54:03,830
easier than you realize when you watch I
think it is easier I think it's one idea

9262
02:54:03,830 --> 02:54:03,840
think it is easier I think it's one idea
 

9263
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:05,690
think it is easier I think it's one idea
or so I think it's I think it's going to

9264
02:54:05,690 --> 02:54:05,700
or so I think it's I think it's going to
 

9265
02:54:05,700 --> 02:54:08,030
or so I think it's I think it's going to
be something where you know the fact is

9266
02:54:08,030 --> 02:54:08,040
be something where you know the fact is
 

9267
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:10,490
be something where you know the fact is
it's a tree structured language just

9268
02:54:10,490 --> 02:54:10,500
it's a tree structured language just
 

9269
02:54:10,500 --> 02:54:12,170
it's a tree structured language just
like human language is a tree structured

9270
02:54:12,170 --> 02:54:12,180
like human language is a tree structured
 

9271
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:13,730
like human language is a tree structured
language and I think it's going to be

9272
02:54:13,730 --> 02:54:13,740
language and I think it's going to be
 

9273
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:15,710
language and I think it's going to be
one of these things where one of the

9274
02:54:15,710 --> 02:54:15,720
one of these things where one of the
 

9275
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:17,450
one of these things where one of the
requirements that I've had is that

9276
02:54:17,450 --> 02:54:17,460
requirements that I've had is that
 

9277
02:54:17,460 --> 02:54:19,849
requirements that I've had is that
whatever the spoken version is that

9278
02:54:19,849 --> 02:54:19,859
whatever the spoken version is that
 

9279
02:54:19,859 --> 02:54:22,010
whatever the spoken version is that
dictation should be easy that is that

9280
02:54:22,010 --> 02:54:22,020
dictation should be easy that is that
 

9281
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:24,050
dictation should be easy that is that
shouldn't be the case that you have to

9282
02:54:24,050 --> 02:54:24,060
shouldn't be the case that you have to
 

9283
02:54:24,060 --> 02:54:26,510
shouldn't be the case that you have to
relearn how the whole thing works it

9284
02:54:26,510 --> 02:54:26,520
relearn how the whole thing works it
 

9285
02:54:26,520 --> 02:54:28,610
relearn how the whole thing works it
should be the case that you know that

9286
02:54:28,610 --> 02:54:28,620
should be the case that you know that
 

9287
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:32,809
should be the case that you know that
open bracket is just a uh ah or

9288
02:54:32,809 --> 02:54:32,819
open bracket is just a uh ah or
 

9289
02:54:32,819 --> 02:54:35,330
open bracket is just a uh ah or
something and it's you know and then

9290
02:54:35,330 --> 02:54:35,340
something and it's you know and then
 

9291
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:38,510
something and it's you know and then
um but you know human language has a lot

9292
02:54:38,510 --> 02:54:38,520
um but you know human language has a lot
 

9293
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:41,510
um but you know human language has a lot
of tricks that are I mean for example

9294
02:54:41,510 --> 02:54:41,520
of tricks that are I mean for example
 

9295
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:43,730
of tricks that are I mean for example
human language

9296
02:54:43,730 --> 02:54:43,740
human language
 

9297
02:54:43,740 --> 02:54:46,190
human language
has has features that are sort of

9298
02:54:46,190 --> 02:54:46,200
has has features that are sort of
 

9299
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:48,830
has has features that are sort of

9301
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:50,389
optimized keep things within the bounds
that our brains can easily deal with

9302
02:54:50,389 --> 02:54:50,399
that our brains can easily deal with
 

9303
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:52,910
that our brains can easily deal with
like I you know I tried to teach a

9304
02:54:52,910 --> 02:54:52,920
like I you know I tried to teach a
 

9305
02:54:52,920 --> 02:54:55,670

Transformer neural net to do parenthesis
 

9307
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:58,309
Transformer neural net to do parenthesis
matching it's pretty crummy at that it

9308
02:54:58,309 --> 02:54:58,319
matching it's pretty crummy at that it
 

9309
02:54:58,319 --> 02:55:00,290
matching it's pretty crummy at that it
it um and then chat gbt is similarly

9310
02:55:00,290 --> 02:55:00,300
it um and then chat gbt is similarly
 

9311
02:55:00,300 --> 02:55:02,450
it um and then chat gbt is similarly
quite crummy at parenthesis matching you

9312
02:55:02,450 --> 02:55:02,460
quite crummy at parenthesis matching you
 

9313
02:55:02,460 --> 02:55:04,429
quite crummy at parenthesis matching you
can do it for small parenthesis things

9314
02:55:04,429 --> 02:55:04,439
can do it for small parenthesis things
 

9315
02:55:04,439 --> 02:55:06,290
can do it for small parenthesis things
for the same size of parenthesis things

9316
02:55:06,290 --> 02:55:06,300
for the same size of parenthesis things
 

9317
02:55:06,300 --> 02:55:08,450
for the same size of parenthesis things
where if I look at it as a human I can

9318
02:55:08,450 --> 02:55:08,460
where if I look at it as a human I can
 

9319
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:09,830
where if I look at it as a human I can
immediately say these are match these

9320
02:55:09,830 --> 02:55:09,840
immediately say these are match these
 

9321
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:11,809
immediately say these are match these
are not matched but as soon as it gets

9322
02:55:11,809 --> 02:55:11,819
are not matched but as soon as it gets
 

9323
02:55:11,819 --> 02:55:13,429
are not matched but as soon as it gets
big as soon as it gets kind of to the

9324
02:55:13,429 --> 02:55:13,439
big as soon as it gets kind of to the
 

9325
02:55:13,439 --> 02:55:15,469
big as soon as it gets kind of to the
point where sort of a deeper computation

9326
02:55:15,469 --> 02:55:15,479
point where sort of a deeper computation
 

9327
02:55:15,479 --> 02:55:18,410
point where sort of a deeper computation
is hopeless and but the fact is that

9328
02:55:18,410 --> 02:55:18,420
is hopeless and but the fact is that
 

9329
02:55:18,420 --> 02:55:21,230
is hopeless and but the fact is that
human language has avoided for example

9330
02:55:21,230 --> 02:55:21,240
human language has avoided for example

the Deep subclauses you know we don't um

9332
02:55:23,809 --> 02:55:23,819
the Deep subclauses you know we don't um
 

9333
02:55:23,819 --> 02:55:26,090
the Deep subclauses you know we don't um
uh you know we we arrange things so we

9334
02:55:26,090 --> 02:55:26,100
uh you know we we arrange things so we
 

9335
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:27,530
uh you know we we arrange things so we
don't end up with these incredibly deep

9336
02:55:27,530 --> 02:55:27,540
don't end up with these incredibly deep
 

9337
02:55:27,540 --> 02:55:28,790
don't end up with these incredibly deep
things

9338
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:28,800
things
 

9339
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:30,769
things
um because brains are not well set up to

9340
02:55:30,769 --> 02:55:30,779
um because brains are not well set up to
 

9341
02:55:30,779 --> 02:55:32,690
um because brains are not well set up to
deal with that and we it's found lots of

9342
02:55:32,690 --> 02:55:32,700
deal with that and we it's found lots of
 

9343
02:55:32,700 --> 02:55:34,730
deal with that and we it's found lots of
tricks and maybe that's what we have to

9344
02:55:34,730 --> 02:55:34,740
tricks and maybe that's what we have to
 

9345
02:55:34,740 --> 02:55:37,990
tricks and maybe that's what we have to
do to make sort of a spoken version a a

9346
02:55:37,990 --> 02:55:38,000
do to make sort of a spoken version a a
 

9347
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:41,330
do to make sort of a spoken version a a
human speakable version because because

9348
02:55:41,330 --> 02:55:41,340
human speakable version because because
 

9349
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:43,370
human speakable version because because
what we can do visually is a little

9350
02:55:43,370 --> 02:55:43,380
what we can do visually is a little
 

9351
02:55:43,380 --> 02:55:45,590
what we can do visually is a little
different what we can do in the very

02:55:45,590 --> 02:55:45,600
different what we can do in the very
 

9353
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:47,750
different what we can do in the very
sequentialized way that we that we hear

let me just ask about MIT briefly so

9358
02:55:54,230 --> 02:55:54,240
let me just ask about MIT briefly so
 

9359
02:55:54,240 --> 02:55:55,910
let me just ask about MIT briefly so
there's now there's a College of

9360
02:55:55,910 --> 02:55:55,920
there's now there's a College of
 

9361
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:57,469
there's now there's a College of
Engineering and there's a new College of

9362
02:55:57,469 --> 02:55:57,479
Engineering and there's a new College of
 

9363
02:55:57,479 --> 02:55:59,030
Engineering and there's a new College of
computing it's just interesting I want

9364
02:55:59,030 --> 02:55:59,040
computing it's just interesting I want
 

9365
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:00,170
computing it's just interesting I want
to linger on this computer science

9366
02:56:00,170 --> 02:56:00,180
to linger on this computer science
 

9367
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:02,590
to linger on this computer science
department thing so MIT has ex

9368
02:56:02,590 --> 02:56:02,600
department thing so MIT has ex
 

9369
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:05,990
department thing so MIT has ex
electrical engineering computer science

9370
02:56:05,990 --> 02:56:06,000
electrical engineering computer science
 

9371
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:07,190
electrical engineering computer science
um what do you think college of

9372
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:07,200
um what do you think college of
 

9373
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:09,590
um what do you think college of
computing will be doing like in 20 years

9374
02:56:09,590 --> 02:56:09,600
computing will be doing like in 20 years
 

9375
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:12,710
computing will be doing like in 20 years
what what like well you see what happens

9376
02:56:12,710 --> 02:56:12,720
what what like well you see what happens
 

9377
02:56:12,720 --> 02:56:14,570
what what like well you see what happens
to computer science like really this is

9378
02:56:14,570 --> 02:56:14,580
to computer science like really this is
 

9379
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:16,849
to computer science like really this is
the question this is you know everybody

9380
02:56:16,849 --> 02:56:16,859
the question this is you know everybody
 

9381
02:56:16,859 --> 02:56:20,630
the question this is you know everybody
should learn kind of whatever CX really

9382
02:56:20,630 --> 02:56:20,640
should learn kind of whatever CX really
 

9383
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:23,510
should learn kind of whatever CX really
is okay this how to think about the

9384
02:56:23,510 --> 02:56:23,520
is okay this how to think about the
 

9385
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:25,490
is okay this how to think about the
world computationally everybody should

9386
02:56:25,490 --> 02:56:25,500
world computationally everybody should
 

9387
02:56:25,500 --> 02:56:28,429
world computationally everybody should
learn those Concepts and uh you know

9388
02:56:28,429 --> 02:56:28,439
learn those Concepts and uh you know
 

9389
02:56:28,439 --> 02:56:30,830
learn those Concepts and uh you know
it's uh and and some people will learn

9390
02:56:30,830 --> 02:56:30,840
it's uh and and some people will learn
 

9391
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:32,690
it's uh and and some people will learn
them at a quite quite formal level and

9392
02:56:32,690 --> 02:56:32,700
them at a quite quite formal level and
 

9393
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:34,190
them at a quite quite formal level and
they'll learn computational language and

9394
02:56:34,190 --> 02:56:34,200
they'll learn computational language and
 

9395
02:56:34,200 --> 02:56:36,170
they'll learn computational language and
things like that other people will just

9396
02:56:36,170 --> 02:56:36,180
things like that other people will just
 

9397
02:56:36,180 --> 02:56:40,010
things like that other people will just
learn you know uh sound is represented

9398
02:56:40,010 --> 02:56:40,020
learn you know uh sound is represented
 

9399
02:56:40,020 --> 02:56:43,910
learn you know uh sound is represented
as you know Digital Data and they'll get

9400
02:56:43,910 --> 02:56:43,920
as you know Digital Data and they'll get
 

9401
02:56:43,920 --> 02:56:45,650
as you know Digital Data and they'll get
some idea of spectrograms and

9402
02:56:45,650 --> 02:56:45,660
some idea of spectrograms and
 

9403
02:56:45,660 --> 02:56:47,690
some idea of spectrograms and
frequencies and things like this and

9404
02:56:47,690 --> 02:56:47,700
frequencies and things like this and
 

9405
02:56:47,700 --> 02:56:49,730
frequencies and things like this and
maybe that doesn't or they'll learn

9406
02:56:49,730 --> 02:56:49,740
maybe that doesn't or they'll learn
 

9407
02:56:49,740 --> 02:56:51,530
maybe that doesn't or they'll learn
things like you know a lot of things

9408
02:56:51,530 --> 02:56:51,540
things like you know a lot of things
 

9409
02:56:51,540 --> 02:56:52,870
things like you know a lot of things
that are sort of data science

9410
02:56:52,870 --> 02:56:52,880
that are sort of data science
 

9411
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:55,790
that are sort of data science
statistics-ish like if you say oh I've

9412
02:56:55,790 --> 02:56:55,800
statistics-ish like if you say oh I've
 

9413
02:56:55,800 --> 02:56:59,150
statistics-ish like if you say oh I've
got these you know these people who who

9414
02:56:59,150 --> 02:56:59,160
got these you know these people who who
 

9415
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:01,250
got these you know these people who who
um uh picked their favorite kind of

9416
02:57:01,250 --> 02:57:01,260
um uh picked their favorite kind of
 

9417
02:57:01,260 --> 02:57:04,010
um uh picked their favorite kind of
candy or something and I've got um you

9418
02:57:04,010 --> 02:57:04,020
candy or something and I've got um you
 

9419
02:57:04,020 --> 02:57:06,110
candy or something and I've got um you
know what's the best kind of candy given

9420
02:57:06,110 --> 02:57:06,120
know what's the best kind of candy given
 

9421
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:07,670
know what's the best kind of candy given
that I've done the sample of all these

9422
02:57:07,670 --> 02:57:07,680
that I've done the sample of all these
 

9423
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:09,830
that I've done the sample of all these
people and they all rank the candies in

9424
02:57:09,830 --> 02:57:09,840
people and they all rank the candies in
 

9425
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:11,809
people and they all rank the candies in
different ways you know how do you think

9426
02:57:11,809 --> 02:57:11,819
different ways you know how do you think
 

9427
02:57:11,819 --> 02:57:13,250
different ways you know how do you think
about that that's sort of a

9428
02:57:13,250 --> 02:57:13,260
about that that's sort of a
 

9429
02:57:13,260 --> 02:57:15,950
about that that's sort of a
computational x kind of thing you might

9430
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:15,960
computational x kind of thing you might
 

9431
02:57:15,960 --> 02:57:17,450
computational x kind of thing you might
say oh it's I don't know what that is is

9432
02:57:17,450 --> 02:57:17,460
say oh it's I don't know what that is is
 

9433
02:57:17,460 --> 02:57:19,130
say oh it's I don't know what that is is
it statistics is it data science I don't

9434
02:57:19,130 --> 02:57:19,140
it statistics is it data science I don't
 

9435
02:57:19,140 --> 02:57:21,050
it statistics is it data science I don't
really know but kind of how to think

9436
02:57:21,050 --> 02:57:21,060
really know but kind of how to think
 

9437
02:57:21,060 --> 02:57:22,790
really know but kind of how to think
about a question like that oh like a

9438
02:57:22,790 --> 02:57:22,800
about a question like that oh like a
 

9439
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:24,650
about a question like that oh like a
ranking of preferences yeah yeah and

9440
02:57:24,650 --> 02:57:24,660
ranking of preferences yeah yeah and
 

9441
02:57:24,660 --> 02:57:26,809
ranking of preferences yeah yeah and
then how to aggregate those those ranked

9442
02:57:26,809 --> 02:57:26,819
then how to aggregate those those ranked
 

9443
02:57:26,819 --> 02:57:29,389
then how to aggregate those those ranked
preferences into an overall thing you

9444
02:57:29,389 --> 02:57:29,399
preferences into an overall thing you
 

9445
02:57:29,399 --> 02:57:31,070
preferences into an overall thing you
know how does that work

9446
02:57:31,070 --> 02:57:31,080
know how does that work
 

9447
02:57:31,080 --> 02:57:32,330
know how does that work
um you know how how should you think

9448
02:57:32,330 --> 02:57:32,340
um you know how how should you think
 

9449
02:57:32,340 --> 02:57:33,889
um you know how how should you think
about that you know because you can just

9450
02:57:33,889 --> 02:57:33,899
about that you know because you can just
 

9451
02:57:33,899 --> 02:57:36,590
about that you know because you can just
tell you might just tell chat gbt sort

9452
02:57:36,590 --> 02:57:36,600
tell you might just tell chat gbt sort
 

9453
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:39,290
tell you might just tell chat gbt sort
of I don't know even even the concept of

9454
02:57:39,290 --> 02:57:39,300
of I don't know even even the concept of
 

9455
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:41,809
of I don't know even even the concept of
an average it's not obvious that you

9456
02:57:41,809 --> 02:57:41,819
an average it's not obvious that you
 

9457
02:57:41,819 --> 02:57:43,790
an average it's not obvious that you
know that's a concept that people it's

9458
02:57:43,790 --> 02:57:43,800
know that's a concept that people it's
 

9459
02:57:43,800 --> 02:57:45,410
know that's a concept that people it's
worth people knowing that's a rather

9460
02:57:45,410 --> 02:57:45,420
worth people knowing that's a rather
 

9461
02:57:45,420 --> 02:57:47,450
worth people knowing that's a rather
straightforward concept people people

9462
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:47,460
straightforward concept people people
 

9463
02:57:47,460 --> 02:57:49,429
straightforward concept people people
you know have learned in kind of mathy

9464
02:57:49,429 --> 02:57:49,439
you know have learned in kind of mathy
 

9465
02:57:49,439 --> 02:57:51,769
you know have learned in kind of mathy
ways right now but there there are lots

9466
02:57:51,769 --> 02:57:51,779
ways right now but there there are lots
 

9467
02:57:51,779 --> 02:57:53,389
ways right now but there there are lots
of things like that about how do you

9468
02:57:53,389 --> 02:57:53,399
of things like that about how do you
 

9469
02:57:53,399 --> 02:57:55,370
of things like that about how do you
kind of have these ways to sort of

9470
02:57:55,370 --> 02:57:55,380
kind of have these ways to sort of
 

9471
02:57:55,380 --> 02:57:57,769
kind of have these ways to sort of
organize and formalize the world and

9472
02:57:57,769 --> 02:57:57,779
organize and formalize the world and
 

9473
02:57:57,779 --> 02:57:59,630
organize and formalize the world and
that's and these things sometimes they

9474
02:57:59,630 --> 02:57:59,640
that's and these things sometimes they
 

9475
02:57:59,640 --> 02:58:02,450
that's and these things sometimes they
live in math sometimes they live in in I

9476
02:58:02,450 --> 02:58:02,460
live in math sometimes they live in in I
 

9477
02:58:02,460 --> 02:58:03,530
live in math sometimes they live in in I
don't know what they you know I don't

9478
02:58:03,530 --> 02:58:03,540
don't know what they you know I don't
 

9479
02:58:03,540 --> 02:58:05,450
don't know what they you know I don't
know what you know learning about color

9480
02:58:05,450 --> 02:58:05,460
know what you know learning about color
 

9481
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:07,250
know what you know learning about color
space I have no idea what I mean you

9482
02:58:07,250 --> 02:58:07,260
space I have no idea what I mean you
 

9483
02:58:07,260 --> 02:58:08,809
space I have no idea what I mean you
know there's obviously a field of

9484
02:58:08,809 --> 02:58:08,819
know there's obviously a field of
 

9485
02:58:08,819 --> 02:58:10,969
know there's obviously a field of
there's uh it could be vision science or

9486
02:58:10,969 --> 02:58:10,979
there's uh it could be vision science or
 

9487
02:58:10,979 --> 02:58:12,650
there's uh it could be vision science or
no color space you know color space

9488
02:58:12,650 --> 02:58:12,660
no color space you know color space
 

9489
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:14,570
no color space you know color space
that's that would be Optics so like

9490
02:58:14,570 --> 02:58:14,580
that's that would be Optics so like
 

9491
02:58:14,580 --> 02:58:16,250
that's that would be Optics so like
they're not really it's not Optics

9492
02:58:16,250 --> 02:58:16,260
they're not really it's not Optics
 

9493
02:58:16,260 --> 02:58:19,010
they're not really it's not Optics
Optics is about you know lenses and

9494
02:58:19,010 --> 02:58:19,020
Optics is about you know lenses and
 

9495
02:58:19,020 --> 02:58:20,630
Optics is about you know lenses and
chromatic aberration of lenses and

9496
02:58:20,630 --> 02:58:20,640
chromatic aberration of lenses and
 

9497
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:22,250
chromatic aberration of lenses and
things like that because it's more like

9498
02:58:22,250 --> 02:58:22,260
things like that because it's more like
 

9499
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:24,230
things like that because it's more like
design and art is that no I mean it's

9500
02:58:24,230 --> 02:58:24,240
design and art is that no I mean it's
 

9501
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:26,750
design and art is that no I mean it's
it's like you know RGB space XYZ space

9502
02:58:26,750 --> 02:58:26,760
it's like you know RGB space XYZ space
 

9503
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:28,730
it's like you know RGB space XYZ space
you know Hue saturation brightness space

9504
02:58:28,730 --> 02:58:28,740
you know Hue saturation brightness space
 

9505
02:58:28,740 --> 02:58:30,230
you know Hue saturation brightness space
all these kinds of things these are

9506
02:58:30,230 --> 02:58:30,240
all these kinds of things these are
 

9507
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:32,389
all these kinds of things these are
different ways to describe colors right

9508
02:58:32,389 --> 02:58:32,399
different ways to describe colors right
 

9509
02:58:32,399 --> 02:58:34,550
different ways to describe colors right
but doesn't the application Define what

9510
02:58:34,550 --> 02:58:34,560
but doesn't the application Define what
 

9511
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:37,070
but doesn't the application Define what
that like because obviously artists and

9512
02:58:37,070 --> 02:58:37,080
that like because obviously artists and
 

9513
02:58:37,080 --> 02:58:39,950
that like because obviously artists and
designers use the colors to explore sure

9514
02:58:39,950 --> 02:58:39,960
designers use the colors to explore sure
 

9515
02:58:39,960 --> 02:58:41,870
designers use the colors to explore sure
no I mean it's just an example of kind

9516
02:58:41,870 --> 02:58:41,880
no I mean it's just an example of kind
 

9517
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:43,849
no I mean it's just an example of kind
of how do you you know the typical

9518
02:58:43,849 --> 02:58:43,859
of how do you you know the typical
 

9519
02:58:43,859 --> 02:58:46,190
of how do you you know the typical
person how do you how do you describe

9520
02:58:46,190 --> 02:58:46,200
person how do you how do you describe
 

9521
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:48,230
person how do you how do you describe
what a color is or there are these

9522
02:58:48,230 --> 02:58:48,240
what a color is or there are these
 

9523
02:58:48,240 --> 02:58:49,730
what a color is or there are these
numbers that describe what a color is

9524
02:58:49,730 --> 02:58:49,740
numbers that describe what a color is
 

9525
02:58:49,740 --> 02:58:52,070
numbers that describe what a color is
well it's worth you know if you're an

9526
02:58:52,070 --> 02:58:52,080
well it's worth you know if you're an
 

9527
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:54,290
well it's worth you know if you're an
eight-year-old you won't necessarily

9528
02:58:54,290 --> 02:58:54,300
eight-year-old you won't necessarily
 

9529
02:58:54,300 --> 02:58:56,150
eight-year-old you won't necessarily
know you know it's not something we're

9530
02:58:56,150 --> 02:58:56,160
know you know it's not something we're
 

9531
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,429
know you know it's not something we're
born with to know that you know colors

9532
02:58:58,429 --> 02:58:58,439
born with to know that you know colors
 

9533
02:58:58,439 --> 02:59:00,710
born with to know that you know colors
can be described by three numbers

9534
02:59:00,710 --> 02:59:00,720
can be described by three numbers
 

9535
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:02,630
can be described by three numbers
um that's something that you have to you

9536
02:59:02,630 --> 02:59:02,640
um that's something that you have to you
 

9537
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:04,070
um that's something that you have to you
know it's a thing to learn about the

9538
02:59:04,070 --> 02:59:04,080
know it's a thing to learn about the
 

9539
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:05,870
know it's a thing to learn about the
world so to speak

9540
02:59:05,870 --> 02:59:05,880
world so to speak
 

9541
02:59:05,880 --> 02:59:08,090
world so to speak
um and I think that you know that whole

9542
02:59:08,090 --> 02:59:08,100
um and I think that you know that whole
 

9543
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:10,730
um and I think that you know that whole
Corpus of things that are learning about

9544
02:59:10,730 --> 02:59:10,740
Corpus of things that are learning about
 

9545
02:59:10,740 --> 02:59:13,250
Corpus of things that are learning about
the formalization of the world or the

9546
02:59:13,250 --> 02:59:13,260
the formalization of the world or the
 

9547
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:15,469
the formalization of the world or the
computationalization of the world that's

9548
02:59:15,469 --> 02:59:15,479
computationalization of the world that's
 

9549
02:59:15,479 --> 02:59:17,450
computationalization of the world that's
something that should be part of kind of

9550
02:59:17,450 --> 02:59:17,460
something that should be part of kind of
 

9551
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:20,210
something that should be part of kind of
standard education and you know there

9552
02:59:20,210 --> 02:59:20,220
standard education and you know there
 

9553
02:59:20,220 --> 02:59:22,070
standard education and you know there
isn't a you know there isn't a course

9554
02:59:22,070 --> 02:59:22,080
isn't a you know there isn't a course
 

9555
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:23,809
isn't a you know there isn't a course
the curriculum for that and by the way

9556
02:59:23,809 --> 02:59:23,819
the curriculum for that and by the way
 

9557
02:59:23,819 --> 02:59:25,429
the curriculum for that and by the way
whatever might have been in it just got

9558
02:59:25,429 --> 02:59:25,439
whatever might have been in it just got
 

9559
02:59:25,439 --> 02:59:27,230
whatever might have been in it just got
changed because of llms and so on

9560
02:59:27,230 --> 02:59:27,240
changed because of llms and so on
 

9561
02:59:27,240 --> 02:59:30,190
changed because of llms and so on
significantly and yeah I would some

9562
02:59:30,190 --> 02:59:30,200
significantly and yeah I would some
 

9563
02:59:30,200 --> 02:59:32,870
significantly and yeah I would some
watching closely with interest seeing

9564
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:32,880
watching closely with interest seeing
 

9565
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:35,389
watching closely with interest seeing
how universities adapt well you know so

9566
02:59:35,389 --> 02:59:35,399
how universities adapt well you know so
 

9567
02:59:35,399 --> 02:59:38,510
how universities adapt well you know so
so one of my projects for hopefully this

9568
02:59:38,510 --> 02:59:38,520
so one of my projects for hopefully this
 

9569
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:40,849
so one of my projects for hopefully this
year I don't know is to try and write

9570
02:59:40,849 --> 02:59:40,859
year I don't know is to try and write
 

9571
02:59:40,859 --> 02:59:44,090
year I don't know is to try and write
sort of a a reasonable textbook so to

9572
02:59:44,090 --> 02:59:44,100
sort of a a reasonable textbook so to
 

9573
02:59:44,100 --> 02:59:46,969
sort of a a reasonable textbook so to
speak of whatever this thing CX whatever

9574
02:59:46,969 --> 02:59:46,979
speak of whatever this thing CX whatever
 

9575
02:59:46,979 --> 02:59:49,610
speak of whatever this thing CX whatever
it is you know what should you know you

9576
02:59:49,610 --> 02:59:49,620
it is you know what should you know you
 

9577
02:59:49,620 --> 02:59:50,690
it is you know what should you know you
know what should you know about like

9578
02:59:50,690 --> 02:59:50,700
know what should you know about like
 

9579
02:59:50,700 --> 02:59:52,910
know what should you know about like
what a bug is what is the intuition

9580
02:59:52,910 --> 02:59:52,920
what a bug is what is the intuition
 

9581
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:54,530
what a bug is what is the intuition
about bugs what's intuition about you

9582
02:59:54,530 --> 02:59:54,540
about bugs what's intuition about you
 

9583
02:59:54,540 --> 02:59:56,750
about bugs what's intuition about you
know software testing what is it what is

9584
02:59:56,750 --> 02:59:56,760
know software testing what is it what is
 

9585
02:59:56,760 --> 02:59:58,490
know software testing what is it what is
it you know these are things which are

9586
02:59:58,490 --> 02:59:58,500
it you know these are things which are
 

9587
02:59:58,500 --> 03:00:01,190
it you know these are things which are
you know they're not I mean those are

9588
03:00:01,190 --> 03:00:01,200
you know they're not I mean those are
 

9589
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:02,690
you know they're not I mean those are
things which have gotten taught in in

9590
03:00:02,690 --> 03:00:02,700
things which have gotten taught in in
 

9591
03:00:02,700 --> 03:00:04,429
things which have gotten taught in in
computer science as part of the trade of

9592
03:00:04,429 --> 03:00:04,439
computer science as part of the trade of
 

9593
03:00:04,439 --> 03:00:06,469
computer science as part of the trade of
programming but but kind of the the

9594
03:00:06,469 --> 03:00:06,479
programming but but kind of the the
 

9595
03:00:06,479 --> 03:00:08,750
programming but but kind of the the
conceptual points about what these

9596
03:00:08,750 --> 03:00:08,760
conceptual points about what these
 

9597
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:10,610
conceptual points about what these
things are you know it surprised me just

9598
03:00:10,610 --> 03:00:10,620
things are you know it surprised me just
 

9599
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:12,290
things are you know it surprised me just
at a very practical level you know I

9600
03:00:12,290 --> 03:00:12,300
at a very practical level you know I
 

9601
03:00:12,300 --> 03:00:13,730
at a very practical level you know I
wrote this little explainer thing about

9602
03:00:13,730 --> 03:00:13,740
wrote this little explainer thing about
 

9603
03:00:13,740 --> 03:00:16,490
wrote this little explainer thing about
Chachi PT and I thought well you know

9604
03:00:16,490 --> 03:00:16,500
Chachi PT and I thought well you know
 

9605
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:18,110
Chachi PT and I thought well you know
I'm writing this partly because I wanted

9606
03:00:18,110 --> 03:00:18,120
I'm writing this partly because I wanted
 

9607
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:20,450
I'm writing this partly because I wanted
to make sure I understood it myself and

9608
03:00:20,450 --> 03:00:20,460
to make sure I understood it myself and
 

9609
03:00:20,460 --> 03:00:22,730
to make sure I understood it myself and
and so on and it's been you know it's

9610
03:00:22,730 --> 03:00:22,740
and so on and it's been you know it's
 

9611
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:25,610
and so on and it's been you know it's
been really popular and um uh

9612
03:00:25,610 --> 03:00:25,620
been really popular and um uh
 

9613
03:00:25,620 --> 03:00:27,650
been really popular and um uh
surprisingly so and I then I realized

9614
03:00:27,650 --> 03:00:27,660
surprisingly so and I then I realized
 

9615
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:30,110
surprisingly so and I then I realized
well actually you know I was sort of

9616
03:00:30,110 --> 03:00:30,120
well actually you know I was sort of
 

9617
03:00:30,120 --> 03:00:31,670
well actually you know I was sort of
assuming I didn't really think about it

9618
03:00:31,670 --> 03:00:31,680
assuming I didn't really think about it
 

9619
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:32,630
assuming I didn't really think about it
actually I just thought this is

9620
03:00:32,630 --> 03:00:32,640
actually I just thought this is
 

9621
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:34,670
actually I just thought this is
something I can write and I realized

9622
03:00:34,670 --> 03:00:34,680
something I can write and I realized
 

9623
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:36,969
something I can write and I realized
actually it's a level of description

9624
03:00:36,969 --> 03:00:36,979
actually it's a level of description
 

9625
03:00:36,979 --> 03:00:40,429
actually it's a level of description
that is kind of you know what has to be

9626
03:00:40,429 --> 03:00:40,439
that is kind of you know what has to be
 

9627
03:00:40,439 --> 03:00:42,230
that is kind of you know what has to be
it's not the engineering level

9628
03:00:42,230 --> 03:00:42,240
it's not the engineering level
 

9629
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:45,170
it's not the engineering level
description it's not the kind of just

9630
03:00:45,170 --> 03:00:45,180
description it's not the kind of just
 

9631
03:00:45,180 --> 03:00:47,450
description it's not the kind of just
the qualitative kind of description it's

9632
03:00:47,450 --> 03:00:47,460
the qualitative kind of description it's
 

9633
03:00:47,460 --> 03:00:50,630
the qualitative kind of description it's
some kind of sort of expository

9634
03:00:50,630 --> 03:00:50,640
some kind of sort of expository
 

9635
03:00:50,640 --> 03:00:52,309
some kind of sort of expository
mechanistic description of what's going

9636
03:00:52,309 --> 03:00:52,319
mechanistic description of what's going
 

9637
03:00:52,319 --> 03:00:54,590
mechanistic description of what's going
on together with kind of the bigger

9638
03:00:54,590 --> 03:00:54,600
on together with kind of the bigger
 

9639
03:00:54,600 --> 03:00:56,210
on together with kind of the bigger
picture of the philosophy of things and

9640
03:00:56,210 --> 03:00:56,220
picture of the philosophy of things and
 

9641
03:00:56,220 --> 03:00:57,889
picture of the philosophy of things and
so on and I realized actually this is a

9642
03:00:57,889 --> 03:00:57,899
so on and I realized actually this is a
 

9643
03:00:57,899 --> 03:00:59,330
so on and I realized actually this is a
pretty good thing for me to write I you

9644
03:00:59,330 --> 03:00:59,340
pretty good thing for me to write I you
 

9645
03:00:59,340 --> 03:01:01,250
pretty good thing for me to write I you
know I kind of know those things and I

9646
03:01:01,250 --> 03:01:01,260
know I kind of know those things and I
 

9647
03:01:01,260 --> 03:01:03,530
know I kind of know those things and I
kind of realized it's not a collection

9648
03:01:03,530 --> 03:01:03,540
kind of realized it's not a collection
 

9649
03:01:03,540 --> 03:01:06,769
kind of realized it's not a collection
of things that you know it's it's I've

9650
03:01:06,769 --> 03:01:06,779
of things that you know it's it's I've
 

9651
03:01:06,779 --> 03:01:08,690
of things that you know it's it's I've
sort of been I was sort of a little

9652
03:01:08,690 --> 03:01:08,700
sort of been I was sort of a little
 

9653
03:01:08,700 --> 03:01:10,550
sort of been I was sort of a little
shocked that it's as much of an outlier

9654
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:10,560
shocked that it's as much of an outlier
 

9655
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:12,290
shocked that it's as much of an outlier
in terms of explaining what's going on

9656
03:01:12,290 --> 03:01:12,300
in terms of explaining what's going on
 

9657
03:01:12,300 --> 03:01:14,450
in terms of explaining what's going on
as it's turned out to be and that makes

9658
03:01:14,450 --> 03:01:14,460
as it's turned out to be and that makes
 

9659
03:01:14,460 --> 03:01:16,550
as it's turned out to be and that makes
me feel more of an obligation to kind of

9660
03:01:16,550 --> 03:01:16,560
me feel more of an obligation to kind of
 

9661
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:18,889
me feel more of an obligation to kind of
write the kind of uh you know what is

9662
03:01:18,889 --> 03:01:18,899
write the kind of uh you know what is
 

9663
03:01:18,899 --> 03:01:21,230
write the kind of uh you know what is
you know what is this thing that you

9664
03:01:21,230 --> 03:01:21,240
you know what is this thing that you
 

9665
03:01:21,240 --> 03:01:22,429
you know what is this thing that you
should learn about about the

9666
03:01:22,429 --> 03:01:22,439
should learn about about the
 

9667
03:01:22,439 --> 03:01:24,290
should learn about about the
computationalization the formalization

9668
03:01:24,290 --> 03:01:24,300
computationalization the formalization
 

9669
03:01:24,300 --> 03:01:25,670
computationalization the formalization
of the world

9670
03:01:25,670 --> 03:01:25,680
of the world
 

9671
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:27,710
of the world
um because well I've spent much of my

9672
03:01:27,710 --> 03:01:27,720
um because well I've spent much of my
 

9673
03:01:27,720 --> 03:01:29,750
um because well I've spent much of my
life working on the kind of tooling and

9674
03:01:29,750 --> 03:01:29,760
life working on the kind of tooling and
 

9675
03:01:29,760 --> 03:01:32,090
life working on the kind of tooling and
mechanics of that and the science you

9676
03:01:32,090 --> 03:01:32,100
mechanics of that and the science you
 

9677
03:01:32,100 --> 03:01:34,429
mechanics of that and the science you
get from it so I guess this is my my

9678
03:01:34,429 --> 03:01:34,439
get from it so I guess this is my my
 

9679
03:01:34,439 --> 03:01:36,410
get from it so I guess this is my my
kind of obligation to try to do this but

9680
03:01:36,410 --> 03:01:36,420
kind of obligation to try to do this but
 

9681
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:38,210
kind of obligation to try to do this but
I think so if you ask what's going to

9682
03:01:38,210 --> 03:01:38,220
I think so if you ask what's going to
 

9683
03:01:38,220 --> 03:01:39,590
I think so if you ask what's going to
happen to like the computer science

9684
03:01:39,590 --> 03:01:39,600
happen to like the computer science
 

9685
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:41,690
happen to like the computer science
departments and so on there's there's

9686
03:01:41,690 --> 03:01:41,700
departments and so on there's there's
 

9687
03:01:41,700 --> 03:01:43,429
departments and so on there's there's
some interesting models so for example

9688
03:01:43,429 --> 03:01:43,439
some interesting models so for example
 

9689
03:01:43,439 --> 03:01:45,950
some interesting models so for example
let's take math you know math is the

9690
03:01:45,950 --> 03:01:45,960
let's take math you know math is the
 

9691
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:47,870
let's take math you know math is the
thing that's important for for all sorts

9692
03:01:47,870 --> 03:01:47,880
thing that's important for for all sorts
 

9693
03:01:47,880 --> 03:01:50,030
thing that's important for for all sorts
of fields you know engineering you know

9694
03:01:50,030 --> 03:01:50,040
of fields you know engineering you know
 

9695
03:01:50,040 --> 03:01:52,429
of fields you know engineering you know
even you know chemistry psychology

9696
03:01:52,429 --> 03:01:52,439
even you know chemistry psychology
 

9697
03:01:52,439 --> 03:01:53,630
even you know chemistry psychology
whatever else

9698
03:01:53,630 --> 03:01:53,640
whatever else
 

9699
03:01:53,640 --> 03:01:55,969
whatever else
and I think different universities have

9700
03:01:55,969 --> 03:01:55,979
and I think different universities have
 

9701
03:01:55,979 --> 03:01:57,769
and I think different universities have
kind of evolved that differently I mean

9702
03:01:57,769 --> 03:01:57,779
kind of evolved that differently I mean
 

9703
03:01:57,779 --> 03:01:59,990
kind of evolved that differently I mean
some say all the math is taught in the

9704
03:01:59,990 --> 03:02:00,000
some say all the math is taught in the
 

9705
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:01,730
some say all the math is taught in the
math department

9706
03:02:01,730 --> 03:02:01,740
math department
 

9707
03:02:01,740 --> 03:02:03,230
math department
um and some say well we're going to have

9708
03:02:03,230 --> 03:02:03,240
um and some say well we're going to have
 

9709
03:02:03,240 --> 03:02:05,389
um and some say well we're going to have
a you know a math for chemists or

9710
03:02:05,389 --> 03:02:05,399
a you know a math for chemists or
 

9711
03:02:05,399 --> 03:02:07,370
a you know a math for chemists or
something that is taught in the

9712
03:02:07,370 --> 03:02:07,380
something that is taught in the
 

9713
03:02:07,380 --> 03:02:09,170
something that is taught in the
chemistry Department

9714
03:02:09,170 --> 03:02:09,180
chemistry Department
 

9715
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:11,510
chemistry Department
um and you know I think that this this

9716
03:02:11,510 --> 03:02:11,520
um and you know I think that this this
 

9717
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:12,830
um and you know I think that this this
question of whether there is a

9718
03:02:12,830 --> 03:02:12,840
question of whether there is a
 

9719
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:15,650
question of whether there is a
centralization of the teaching of sort

9720
03:02:15,650 --> 03:02:15,660
centralization of the teaching of sort
 

9721
03:02:15,660 --> 03:02:19,550
centralization of the teaching of sort
of CX is an interesting question and I

9722
03:02:19,550 --> 03:02:19,560
of CX is an interesting question and I
 

9723
03:02:19,560 --> 03:02:21,050
of CX is an interesting question and I
think you know the way it evolved with

9724
03:02:21,050 --> 03:02:21,060
think you know the way it evolved with
 

9725
03:02:21,060 --> 03:02:22,190
think you know the way it evolved with
math

9726
03:02:22,190 --> 03:02:22,200
math
 

9727
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:24,710
math
you know people understood that math was

9728
03:02:24,710 --> 03:02:24,720
you know people understood that math was
 

9729
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:28,130
you know people understood that math was
sort of a separately teachable thing and

9730
03:02:28,130 --> 03:02:28,140
sort of a separately teachable thing and
 

9731
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:31,070
sort of a separately teachable thing and
um I was kind of a you know a a an

9732
03:02:31,070 --> 03:02:31,080
um I was kind of a you know a a an
 

9733
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:34,190
um I was kind of a you know a a an
independent element as opposed to just

9734
03:02:34,190 --> 03:02:34,200
independent element as opposed to just
 

9735
03:02:34,200 --> 03:02:35,929
independent element as opposed to just
being absorbed into now so if you take

9736
03:02:35,929 --> 03:02:35,939
being absorbed into now so if you take
 

9737
03:02:35,939 --> 03:02:38,750
being absorbed into now so if you take
the example of of writing English or

9738
03:02:38,750 --> 03:02:38,760
the example of of writing English or
 

9739
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:40,010
the example of of writing English or
something like this

9740
03:02:40,010 --> 03:02:40,020
something like this
 

9741
03:02:40,020 --> 03:02:44,269
something like this
the first point is that that you know at

9742
03:02:44,269 --> 03:02:44,279
the first point is that that you know at
 

9743
03:02:44,279 --> 03:02:46,130
the first point is that that you know at
the college level at least fancy

9744
03:02:46,130 --> 03:02:46,140
the college level at least fancy
 

9745
03:02:46,140 --> 03:02:48,050
the college level at least fancy
colleges there's a certain amount of

9746
03:02:48,050 --> 03:02:48,060
colleges there's a certain amount of
 

9747
03:02:48,060 --> 03:02:50,929
colleges there's a certain amount of
English writing that that people do but

9748
03:02:50,929 --> 03:02:50,939
English writing that that people do but
 

9749
03:02:50,939 --> 03:02:52,790
English writing that that people do but
mostly it's kind of assumed that they

9750
03:02:52,790 --> 03:02:52,800
mostly it's kind of assumed that they
 

9751
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:54,889
mostly it's kind of assumed that they
pretty much know how to write you know

9752
03:02:54,889 --> 03:02:54,899
pretty much know how to write you know
 

9753
03:02:54,899 --> 03:02:56,870
pretty much know how to write you know
that's something they learned at a at an

9754
03:02:56,870 --> 03:02:56,880
that's something they learned at a at an
 

9755
03:02:56,880 --> 03:02:59,269
that's something they learned at a at an
earlier stage in education maybe rightly

9756
03:02:59,269 --> 03:02:59,279
earlier stage in education maybe rightly
 

9757
03:02:59,279 --> 03:03:01,190
earlier stage in education maybe rightly
or wrongly believing that but that's

9758
03:03:01,190 --> 03:03:01,200
or wrongly believing that but that's
 

9759
03:03:01,200 --> 03:03:03,170
or wrongly believing that but that's
different issue

9760
03:03:03,170 --> 03:03:03,180
different issue
 

9761
03:03:03,180 --> 03:03:06,769
different issue
um the uh uh well I think it it reminds

9762
03:03:06,769 --> 03:03:06,779
um the uh uh well I think it it reminds
 

9763
03:03:06,779 --> 03:03:09,710
um the uh uh well I think it it reminds
me of my kind of as I've tried to help

9764
03:03:09,710 --> 03:03:09,720
me of my kind of as I've tried to help
 

9765
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:11,269
me of my kind of as I've tried to help
people do technical writing and things

9766
03:03:11,269 --> 03:03:11,279
people do technical writing and things
 

9767
03:03:11,279 --> 03:03:14,150
people do technical writing and things
I'm I'm always reminded of my zeroth law

9768
03:03:14,150 --> 03:03:14,160
I'm I'm always reminded of my zeroth law
 

9769
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:15,830
I'm I'm always reminded of my zeroth law
of technical writing which is if you

9770
03:03:15,830 --> 03:03:15,840
of technical writing which is if you
 

9771
03:03:15,840 --> 03:03:17,570
of technical writing which is if you
don't understand what you're writing

9772
03:03:17,570 --> 03:03:17,580
don't understand what you're writing
 

9773
03:03:17,580 --> 03:03:19,969
don't understand what you're writing
about your readers do not stand a chance

03:03:23,809 --> 03:03:23,819
yeah and so it's it's um uh I think the
 

9777
03:03:23,819 --> 03:03:24,410
yeah and so it's it's um uh I think the
um

9778

engineering department they don't have
 

9795
03:03:44,700 --> 03:03:47,510

you can just go use it in all these
different fields and you know there will

9822
03:04:17,330 --> 03:04:17,340
different fields and you know there will
 

9823
03:04:17,340 --> 03:04:19,610
different fields and you know there will
be experts who want to learn the full

be experts who want to learn the full
 

9825
03:04:19,620 --> 03:04:22,250
be experts who want to learn the full
elaborate Tower and that will be kind of

9826
03:04:22,250 --> 03:04:22,260
elaborate Tower and that will be kind of
 

9827
03:04:22,260 --> 03:04:25,849
elaborate Tower and that will be kind of
the the cscx whatever department but

9828
03:04:25,849 --> 03:04:25,859
the the cscx whatever department but
 

9829
03:04:25,859 --> 03:04:28,370
the the cscx whatever department but
there'll also be everybody else who just

9830
03:04:28,370 --> 03:04:28,380
there'll also be everybody else who just
 

9831
03:04:28,380 --> 03:04:29,809
there'll also be everybody else who just
needs to know a certain amount of that

9832
03:04:29,809 --> 03:04:29,819
needs to know a certain amount of that
 

9833
03:04:29,819 --> 03:04:31,250
needs to know a certain amount of that
to be able to go and do their art

9834

to be able to go and do their art
 

9835
03:04:31,260 --> 03:04:34,490
to be able to go and do their art
history classes and so on

9836
03:04:34,490 --> 03:04:34,500

 

9837
03:04:34,500 --> 03:04:36,410

yes it's just a single class that

9838
03:04:36,410 --> 03:04:36,420
yes it's just a single class that
 

9839
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:38,269
yes it's just a single class that
everybody's required to take I don't

9840
03:04:38,269 --> 03:04:38,279
everybody's required to take I don't
 

9841
03:04:38,279 --> 03:04:39,530
everybody's required to take I don't
know I don't know how big it is yet I

9842
03:04:39,530 --> 03:04:39,540
know I don't know how big it is yet I
 

9843
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:41,690
know I don't know how big it is yet I
hope to kind of Define this curriculum

9844
03:04:41,690 --> 03:04:41,700
hope to kind of Define this curriculum
 

9845
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:43,910
hope to kind of Define this curriculum
and I'll figure out whether it's um my

9846
03:04:43,910 --> 03:04:43,920
and I'll figure out whether it's um my
 

9847
03:04:43,920 --> 03:04:46,969
and I'll figure out whether it's um my
guess is that

9848
03:04:46,969 --> 03:04:46,979
guess is that
 

9849
03:04:46,979 --> 03:04:49,190
guess is that
I I don't know I don't really understand

9850
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:49,200
I I don't know I don't really understand
 

9851
03:04:49,200 --> 03:04:51,110
I I don't know I don't really understand
universities and professoring that well

9852
03:04:51,110 --> 03:04:51,120
universities and professoring that well
 

9853
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:54,410
universities and professoring that well
but my my rough guests would be a year

9854
03:04:54,410 --> 03:04:54,420
but my my rough guests would be a year
 

9855
03:04:54,420 --> 03:04:57,650
but my my rough guests would be a year
long a year of college class will be

9856
03:04:57,650 --> 03:04:57,660
long a year of college class will be
 

9857
03:04:57,660 --> 03:04:59,389
long a year of college class will be
enough to get to the point where most

9858
03:04:59,389 --> 03:04:59,399
enough to get to the point where most
 

9859
03:04:59,399 --> 03:05:01,429
enough to get to the point where most
people have a a reasonably broad

03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,630
flake things Cadbury flakes which are
not much sold in the US and I've always

9898
03:05:44,630 --> 03:05:44,640
not much sold in the US and I've always
 

9899
03:05:44,640 --> 03:05:47,150
not much sold in the US and I've always
thought that was a sign of a of a a lack

9900
03:05:47,150 --> 03:05:47,160
thought that was a sign of a of a a lack
 

9901
03:05:47,160 --> 03:05:48,889
thought that was a sign of a of a a lack
of respect for the American Consumer

9902
03:05:48,889 --> 03:05:48,899
of respect for the American Consumer
 

9903
03:05:48,899 --> 03:05:51,110
of respect for the American Consumer
because they're these sort of aerated

9904
03:05:51,110 --> 03:05:51,120
because they're these sort of aerated
 

9905
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:52,910
because they're these sort of aerated
chocolate that's made in a in a whole

9906
03:05:52,910 --> 03:05:52,920
chocolate that's made in a in a whole
 

9907
03:05:52,920 --> 03:05:55,670
chocolate that's made in a in a whole
sort of uh it's kind of a sheet of

9908
03:05:55,670 --> 03:05:55,680
sort of uh it's kind of a sheet of
 

9909
03:05:55,680 --> 03:05:57,650
sort of uh it's kind of a sheet of
chocolate that's kind of folded up and

9910
03:05:57,650 --> 03:05:57,660
chocolate that's kind of folded up and
 

9911
03:05:57,660 --> 03:06:00,710
chocolate that's kind of folded up and
when you eat it flakes fall all over the

9912
03:06:00,710 --> 03:06:00,720
when you eat it flakes fall all over the
 

9913
03:06:00,720 --> 03:06:03,349
when you eat it flakes fall all over the
place ah so it requires a kind of

9914
03:06:03,349 --> 03:06:03,359
place ah so it requires a kind of
 

9915
03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:05,389
place ah so it requires a kind of
Elegance it requires you to have an

9916
03:06:05,389 --> 03:06:05,399
Elegance it requires you to have an
 

9917
03:06:05,399 --> 03:06:07,250
Elegance it requires you to have an
Elegance well I know what I usually do

9918
03:06:07,250 --> 03:06:07,260
Elegance well I know what I usually do
 

9919
03:06:07,260 --> 03:06:09,230
Elegance well I know what I usually do
is I eat tomatoes you know a piece of

9920
03:06:09,230 --> 03:06:09,240
is I eat tomatoes you know a piece of
 

9921
03:06:09,240 --> 03:06:11,269
is I eat tomatoes you know a piece of
paper or something else and clean it up

9922
03:06:11,269 --> 03:06:11,279
paper or something else and clean it up
 

9923
03:06:11,279 --> 03:06:13,849
paper or something else and clean it up
after no I actually eat the I eat the

9924
03:06:13,849 --> 03:06:13,859
after no I actually eat the I eat the
 

9925
03:06:13,859 --> 03:06:15,710
after no I actually eat the I eat the
flakes I said that because you know it

9926
03:06:15,710 --> 03:06:15,720
flakes I said that because you know it
 

9927
03:06:15,720 --> 03:06:17,990
flakes I said that because you know it
turns out the way food tastes depends a

9928
03:06:17,990 --> 03:06:18,000
turns out the way food tastes depends a
 

9929
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,610
turns out the way food tastes depends a
lot on its physical structure and you

9930
03:06:19,610 --> 03:06:19,620
lot on its physical structure and you
 

9931
03:06:19,620 --> 03:06:21,230
lot on its physical structure and you
know it really you know I've noticed

9932
03:06:21,230 --> 03:06:21,240
know it really you know I've noticed
 

9933
03:06:21,240 --> 03:06:22,969
know it really you know I've noticed
when I eat piece of chocolate I usually

9934
03:06:22,969 --> 03:06:22,979
when I eat piece of chocolate I usually
 

9935
03:06:22,979 --> 03:06:24,469
when I eat piece of chocolate I usually
have some little piece of chocolate and

9936
03:06:24,469 --> 03:06:24,479
have some little piece of chocolate and
 

9937
03:06:24,479 --> 03:06:26,090
have some little piece of chocolate and
I I always break off little pieces

9938
03:06:26,090 --> 03:06:26,100
I I always break off little pieces
 

9939
03:06:26,100 --> 03:06:27,710
I I always break off little pieces
partly because then I eat it less fast

9940
03:06:27,710 --> 03:06:27,720
partly because then I eat it less fast
 

9941
03:06:27,720 --> 03:06:29,570
partly because then I eat it less fast
yeah but also because it actually tastes

9942
03:06:29,570 --> 03:06:29,580
yeah but also because it actually tastes
 

9943
03:06:29,580 --> 03:06:30,830
yeah but also because it actually tastes
different

9944
03:06:30,830 --> 03:06:30,840
different
 

9945
03:06:30,840 --> 03:06:33,410
different
um you know the the small pieces you

9946
03:06:33,410 --> 03:06:33,420
um you know the the small pieces you
 

9947
03:06:33,420 --> 03:06:35,090
um you know the the small pieces you
know have a different you have a

9948
03:06:35,090 --> 03:06:35,100
know have a different you have a
 

9949
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:36,290
know have a different you have a
different experience than if you have

9950
03:06:36,290 --> 03:06:36,300
different experience than if you have
 

9951
03:06:36,300 --> 03:06:38,210
different experience than if you have
the big slab of chocolate for many

9952
03:06:38,210 --> 03:06:38,220
the big slab of chocolate for many
 

9953
03:06:38,220 --> 03:06:40,370
the big slab of chocolate for many
reasons yes slower

9954
03:06:40,370 --> 03:06:40,380
reasons yes slower
 

9955
03:06:40,380 --> 03:06:41,990
reasons yes slower
more intimate

9956
03:06:41,990 --> 03:06:42,000
more intimate
 

9957
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,030
more intimate
because it's I think it's also just pure

9958
03:06:44,030 --> 03:06:44,040
because it's I think it's also just pure
 

9959
03:06:44,040 --> 03:06:47,210
because it's I think it's also just pure
physicality or detection yes right it's

9960
03:06:47,210 --> 03:06:47,220
physicality or detection yes right it's
 

9961
03:06:47,220 --> 03:06:49,250
physicality or detection yes right it's
fascinating now I dig back my milk dust

9962
03:06:49,250 --> 03:06:49,260
fascinating now I dig back my milk dust
 

9963
03:06:49,260 --> 03:06:51,290
fascinating now I dig back my milk dust
because that's such a basic answer okay

9964
03:06:51,290 --> 03:06:51,300
because that's such a basic answer okay
 

9965
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:52,849
because that's such a basic answer okay
do you think Consciousness is

9966
03:06:52,849 --> 03:06:52,859
do you think Consciousness is
 

9967
03:06:52,859 --> 03:06:55,969
do you think Consciousness is
fundamentally uh computational

9968
03:06:55,969 --> 03:06:55,979
fundamentally uh computational
 

9969
03:06:55,979 --> 03:07:00,590
fundamentally uh computational
so when you think about CX what can we

9970
03:07:00,590 --> 03:07:00,600
so when you think about CX what can we
 

9971
03:07:00,600 --> 03:07:02,690
so when you think about CX what can we
turn into computation

9972
03:07:02,690 --> 03:07:02,700
turn into computation
 

9973
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:05,929
turn into computation
and you're thinking about llms

9974
03:07:05,929 --> 03:07:05,939
and you're thinking about llms
 

9975
03:07:05,939 --> 03:07:07,370
and you're thinking about llms
do you think

9976
03:07:07,370 --> 03:07:07,380
do you think
 

9977
03:07:07,380 --> 03:07:09,950
do you think
the uh the display of Consciousness and

9978
03:07:09,950 --> 03:07:09,960
the uh the display of Consciousness and
 

9979
03:07:09,960 --> 03:07:11,630
the uh the display of Consciousness and
the experience of cautiousness the hard

9980
03:07:11,630 --> 03:07:11,640
the experience of cautiousness the hard
 

9981
03:07:11,640 --> 03:07:15,050
the experience of cautiousness the hard
problem is is fundamentally uh

9982
03:07:15,050 --> 03:07:15,060
problem is is fundamentally uh
 

9983
03:07:15,060 --> 03:07:17,990
problem is is fundamentally uh
that computation yeah what it feels like

9984
03:07:17,990 --> 03:07:18,000
that computation yeah what it feels like
 

9985
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:21,889
that computation yeah what it feels like
inside so to speak is

9986
03:07:21,889 --> 03:07:21,899
inside so to speak is
 

9987
03:07:21,899 --> 03:07:24,370
inside so to speak is
you know I I did a little exercise

9988
03:07:24,370 --> 03:07:24,380
you know I I did a little exercise
 

9989
03:07:24,380 --> 03:07:27,889
you know I I did a little exercise
eventually I'll I'll post it of uh you

9990
03:07:27,889 --> 03:07:27,899
eventually I'll I'll post it of uh you
 

9991
03:07:27,899 --> 03:07:29,269
eventually I'll I'll post it of uh you
know what it's like to be a computer

9992
03:07:29,269 --> 03:07:29,279
know what it's like to be a computer
 

9993
03:07:29,279 --> 03:07:32,330
know what it's like to be a computer
yeah right it's kind of like well you

9994
03:07:32,330 --> 03:07:32,340
yeah right it's kind of like well you
 

9995
03:07:32,340 --> 03:07:34,910
yeah right it's kind of like well you
get all this sensory input you have a

9996
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:34,920
get all this sensory input you have a
 

9997
03:07:34,920 --> 03:07:36,889
get all this sensory input you have a
kind of the way I see it is from the

9998
03:07:36,889 --> 03:07:36,899
kind of the way I see it is from the
 

9999
03:07:36,899 --> 03:07:38,570
kind of the way I see it is from the
time you boot a computer to the time the

10000
03:07:38,570 --> 03:07:38,580
time you boot a computer to the time the
 

10001
03:07:38,580 --> 03:07:41,030
time you boot a computer to the time the
computer crashes is like a human life

10002
03:07:41,030 --> 03:07:41,040
computer crashes is like a human life
 

10003
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:43,130
computer crashes is like a human life
you you're building up a certain amount

10004
03:07:43,130 --> 03:07:43,140
you you're building up a certain amount
 

10005
03:07:43,140 --> 03:07:45,410
you you're building up a certain amount
of State in memory you remember certain

10006
03:07:45,410 --> 03:07:45,420
of State in memory you remember certain
 

10007
03:07:45,420 --> 03:07:47,030
of State in memory you remember certain
things about your quote's life

10008
03:07:47,030 --> 03:07:47,040
things about your quote's life
 

10009
03:07:47,040 --> 03:07:49,969
things about your quote's life
eventually it's kind of like the the uh

10010
03:07:49,969 --> 03:07:49,979
eventually it's kind of like the the uh
 

10011
03:07:49,979 --> 03:07:52,010
eventually it's kind of like the the uh
you know the next generation of humans

10012
03:07:52,010 --> 03:07:52,020
you know the next generation of humans
 

10013
03:07:52,020 --> 03:07:54,349
you know the next generation of humans
is is born from the same genetic

10014
03:07:54,349 --> 03:07:54,359
is is born from the same genetic
 

10015
03:07:54,359 --> 03:07:55,790
is is born from the same genetic
material so to speak with a little bit

10016
03:07:55,790 --> 03:07:55,800
material so to speak with a little bit
 

10017
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:59,030
material so to speak with a little bit
left over left on the disc so to speak

10018
03:07:59,030 --> 03:07:59,040
left over left on the disc so to speak
 

10019
03:07:59,040 --> 03:08:01,070
left over left on the disc so to speak
um and then you know the the new fresh

10020
03:08:01,070 --> 03:08:01,080
um and then you know the the new fresh
 

10021
03:08:01,080 --> 03:08:03,349
um and then you know the the new fresh
generation starts up and eventually all

10022
03:08:03,349 --> 03:08:03,359
generation starts up and eventually all
 

10023
03:08:03,359 --> 03:08:05,269
generation starts up and eventually all
kinds of crud builds up in the in the

10024
03:08:05,269 --> 03:08:05,279
kinds of crud builds up in the in the
 

10025
03:08:05,279 --> 03:08:07,190
kinds of crud builds up in the in the
memory of the computer and eventually

10026
03:08:07,190 --> 03:08:07,200
memory of the computer and eventually
 

10027
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:08,870
memory of the computer and eventually
the thing crashes or whatever or maybe

10028
03:08:08,870 --> 03:08:08,880
the thing crashes or whatever or maybe
 

10029
03:08:08,880 --> 03:08:10,550
the thing crashes or whatever or maybe
it has some trauma because you plugged

10030
03:08:10,550 --> 03:08:10,560
it has some trauma because you plugged
 

10031
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:12,769
it has some trauma because you plugged
in some weird thing to some Port of the

10032
03:08:12,769 --> 03:08:12,779
in some weird thing to some Port of the
 

10033
03:08:12,779 --> 03:08:15,889
in some weird thing to some Port of the
computer and that made it crash and that

10034
03:08:15,889 --> 03:08:15,899
computer and that made it crash and that
 

10035
03:08:15,899 --> 03:08:17,990
computer and that made it crash and that
um uh you know that that's kind of but

10036
03:08:17,990 --> 03:08:18,000
um uh you know that that's kind of but
 

10037
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,450
um uh you know that that's kind of but
but you have this this picture of you

10038
03:08:20,450 --> 03:08:20,460
but you have this this picture of you
 

10039
03:08:20,460 --> 03:08:23,870
but you have this this picture of you
know from from startup to to to shut

10040
03:08:23,870 --> 03:08:23,880
know from from startup to to to shut
 

10041
03:08:23,880 --> 03:08:26,090
know from from startup to to to shut
down you know what is the life of a

10042
03:08:26,090 --> 03:08:26,100
down you know what is the life of a
 

10043
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:27,469
down you know what is the life of a
computer so to speak and what does it

10044
03:08:27,469 --> 03:08:27,479
computer so to speak and what does it
 

10045
03:08:27,479 --> 03:08:29,510
computer so to speak and what does it
feel like to be that computer and what

10046
03:08:29,510 --> 03:08:29,520
feel like to be that computer and what
 

10047
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:31,190
feel like to be that computer and what
inner thoughts does it have and how do

10048
03:08:31,190 --> 03:08:31,200
inner thoughts does it have and how do
 

10049
03:08:31,200 --> 03:08:32,450
inner thoughts does it have and how do
you describe it and it's kind of kind of

10050
03:08:32,450 --> 03:08:32,460
you describe it and it's kind of kind of
 

10051
03:08:32,460 --> 03:08:33,830
you describe it and it's kind of kind of
interesting as you start writing about

10052
03:08:33,830 --> 03:08:33,840
interesting as you start writing about
 

10053
03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:36,650
interesting as you start writing about
this to realize it's awfully like what

10054
03:08:36,650 --> 03:08:36,660
this to realize it's awfully like what
 

10055
03:08:36,660 --> 03:08:38,630
this to realize it's awfully like what
you'd say about yourself that is it's

10056
03:08:38,630 --> 03:08:38,640
you'd say about yourself that is it's
 

10057
03:08:38,640 --> 03:08:40,790
you'd say about yourself that is it's
awfully like even an ordinary computer

10058
03:08:40,790 --> 03:08:40,800
awfully like even an ordinary computer
 

10059
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:43,610
awfully like even an ordinary computer
forget all the AI stuff and so on you

10060
03:08:43,610 --> 03:08:43,620
forget all the AI stuff and so on you
 

10061
03:08:43,620 --> 03:08:45,469
forget all the AI stuff and so on you
know it's kind of it has a memory of the

10062
03:08:45,469 --> 03:08:45,479
know it's kind of it has a memory of the
 

10063
03:08:45,479 --> 03:08:48,530
know it's kind of it has a memory of the
past it has certain sensory experiences

10064
03:08:48,530 --> 03:08:48,540
past it has certain sensory experiences
 

10065
03:08:48,540 --> 03:08:50,870
past it has certain sensory experiences
it can communicate with other computers

10066
03:08:50,870 --> 03:08:50,880
it can communicate with other computers
 

10067
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:53,030
it can communicate with other computers
but it has to package up how it's

10068
03:08:53,030 --> 03:08:53,040
but it has to package up how it's
 

10069
03:08:53,040 --> 03:08:54,650
but it has to package up how it's
communicating in some kind of language

10070
03:08:54,650 --> 03:08:54,660
communicating in some kind of language
 

10071
03:08:54,660 --> 03:08:57,830
communicating in some kind of language
like form so it can you know send so it

10072
03:08:57,830 --> 03:08:57,840
like form so it can you know send so it
 

10073
03:08:57,840 --> 03:09:00,050
like form so it can you know send so it
can kind of map what's in its memory to

10074
03:09:00,050 --> 03:09:00,060
can kind of map what's in its memory to
 

10075
03:09:00,060 --> 03:09:01,190
can kind of map what's in its memory to
what's in the memory of some other

10076
03:09:01,190 --> 03:09:01,200
what's in the memory of some other
 

10077
03:09:01,200 --> 03:09:03,469
what's in the memory of some other
computer it's it's a surprisingly

10078
03:09:03,469 --> 03:09:03,479
computer it's it's a surprisingly
 

10079
03:09:03,479 --> 03:09:05,030
computer it's it's a surprisingly
similar thing you know I hadn't

10080
03:09:05,030 --> 03:09:05,040
similar thing you know I hadn't
 

10081
03:09:05,040 --> 03:09:07,130
similar thing you know I hadn't
experience just a week or two ago I I

10082
03:09:07,130 --> 03:09:07,140
experience just a week or two ago I I
 

10083
03:09:07,140 --> 03:09:09,710
experience just a week or two ago I I
had I'm a collector of all possible data

10084
03:09:09,710 --> 03:09:09,720
had I'm a collector of all possible data
 

10085
03:09:09,720 --> 03:09:12,469
had I'm a collector of all possible data
about myself and other things and so I

10086
03:09:12,469 --> 03:09:12,479
about myself and other things and so I
 

10087
03:09:12,479 --> 03:09:14,210
about myself and other things and so I
you know I collect all sorts of weird

10088
03:09:14,210 --> 03:09:14,220
you know I collect all sorts of weird
 

10089
03:09:14,220 --> 03:09:15,830
you know I collect all sorts of weird
medical data and so on and one thing I

10090
03:09:15,830 --> 03:09:15,840
medical data and so on and one thing I
 

10091
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:18,170
medical data and so on and one thing I
hadn't collected was I'd never had a

10092
03:09:18,170 --> 03:09:18,180
hadn't collected was I'd never had a
 

10093
03:09:18,180 --> 03:09:20,389
hadn't collected was I'd never had a
whole body MRI scan so I went and got

10094
03:09:20,389 --> 03:09:20,399
whole body MRI scan so I went and got
 

10095
03:09:20,399 --> 03:09:22,370
whole body MRI scan so I went and got
one of these yes okay so I get that get

10096
03:09:22,370 --> 03:09:22,380
one of these yes okay so I get that get
 

10097
03:09:22,380 --> 03:09:24,230
one of these yes okay so I get that get
all the data back right I'm looking at

10098
03:09:24,230 --> 03:09:24,240
all the data back right I'm looking at
 

10099
03:09:24,240 --> 03:09:25,790
all the data back right I'm looking at
this thing I never looked at the kind of

10100
03:09:25,790 --> 03:09:25,800
this thing I never looked at the kind of
 

10101
03:09:25,800 --> 03:09:28,550
this thing I never looked at the kind of
insides of my brain so to speak

10102
03:09:28,550 --> 03:09:28,560
insides of my brain so to speak
 

10103
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:31,190
insides of my brain so to speak
um in in physical form and it's really I

10104
03:09:31,190 --> 03:09:31,200
um in in physical form and it's really I
 

10105
03:09:31,200 --> 03:09:32,630
um in in physical form and it's really I
mean it's kind of psychologically

10106
03:09:32,630 --> 03:09:32,640
mean it's kind of psychologically
 

10107
03:09:32,640 --> 03:09:34,910
mean it's kind of psychologically
shocking in a sense that you know here's

10108
03:09:34,910 --> 03:09:34,920
shocking in a sense that you know here's
 

10109
03:09:34,920 --> 03:09:36,469
shocking in a sense that you know here's
this thing and you can see it has all

10110
03:09:36,469 --> 03:09:36,479
this thing and you can see it has all
 

10111
03:09:36,479 --> 03:09:38,389
this thing and you can see it has all
these folds and all these you know the

10112
03:09:38,389 --> 03:09:38,399
these folds and all these you know the
 

10113
03:09:38,399 --> 03:09:40,610
these folds and all these you know the
structure and it's like that's where

10114
03:09:40,610 --> 03:09:40,620
structure and it's like that's where
 

10115
03:09:40,620 --> 03:09:44,210
structure and it's like that's where
this experience that I'm having of you

10116
03:09:44,210 --> 03:09:44,220
this experience that I'm having of you
 

10117
03:09:44,220 --> 03:09:46,130
this experience that I'm having of you
know existing and so on yeah that's

10118
03:09:46,130 --> 03:09:46,140
know existing and so on yeah that's
 

10119
03:09:46,140 --> 03:09:49,190
know existing and so on yeah that's
where it is and you know it feels very

10120
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:49,200
where it is and you know it feels very
 

10121
03:09:49,200 --> 03:09:51,650
where it is and you know it feels very
you know you look at that and you're

10122
03:09:51,650 --> 03:09:51,660
you know you look at that and you're
 

10123
03:09:51,660 --> 03:09:53,750
you know you look at that and you're
thinking how can this possibly be all

10124
03:09:53,750 --> 03:09:53,760
thinking how can this possibly be all
 

10125
03:09:53,760 --> 03:09:55,429
thinking how can this possibly be all
this experience that I'm having and

10126
03:09:55,429 --> 03:09:55,439
this experience that I'm having and
 

10127
03:09:55,439 --> 03:09:56,570
this experience that I'm having and
you're realizing well I can look at a

10128
03:09:56,570 --> 03:09:56,580
you're realizing well I can look at a
 

10129
03:09:56,580 --> 03:09:58,910
you're realizing well I can look at a
computer as well and it's it's kind of

10130
03:09:58,910 --> 03:09:58,920
computer as well and it's it's kind of
 

10131
03:09:58,920 --> 03:10:03,950
computer as well and it's it's kind of
this it it I think this idea that you

10132
03:10:03,950 --> 03:10:03,960
this it it I think this idea that you
 

10133
03:10:03,960 --> 03:10:08,690
this it it I think this idea that you
are having an experience that is somehow

10134
03:10:08,690 --> 03:10:08,700
are having an experience that is somehow
 

10135
03:10:08,700 --> 03:10:09,530
are having an experience that is somehow
um

10136
03:10:09,530 --> 03:10:09,540
um
 

10137
03:10:09,540 --> 03:10:12,889
um
you know transcends the mere sort of

10138
03:10:12,889 --> 03:10:12,899
you know transcends the mere sort of
 

10139
03:10:12,899 --> 03:10:15,349
you know transcends the mere sort of
physicality of that experience I I I I

10140
03:10:15,349 --> 03:10:15,359
physicality of that experience I I I I
 

10141
03:10:15,359 --> 03:10:17,090
physicality of that experience I I I I
you know it's something that's hard to

10142
03:10:17,090 --> 03:10:17,100
you know it's something that's hard to
 

10143
03:10:17,100 --> 03:10:19,610
you know it's something that's hard to
come to terms with but I think you know

10144
03:10:19,610 --> 03:10:19,620
come to terms with but I think you know
 

10145
03:10:19,620 --> 03:10:21,530
come to terms with but I think you know
and I I don't think I'm necessarily you

10146
03:10:21,530 --> 03:10:21,540
and I I don't think I'm necessarily you
 

10147
03:10:21,540 --> 03:10:23,389
and I I don't think I'm necessarily you
know my my personal experience you know

10148
03:10:23,389 --> 03:10:23,399
know my my personal experience you know
 

10149
03:10:23,399 --> 03:10:25,910
know my my personal experience you know
I look at the you know the MRI of the

10150
03:10:25,910 --> 03:10:25,920
I look at the you know the MRI of the
 

10151
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:28,010
I look at the you know the MRI of the
brain and then I you know know about all

10152
03:10:28,010 --> 03:10:28,020
brain and then I you know know about all
 

10153
03:10:28,020 --> 03:10:29,809
brain and then I you know know about all
kinds of things about neuroscience and

10154
03:10:29,809 --> 03:10:29,819
kinds of things about neuroscience and
 

10155
03:10:29,819 --> 03:10:32,330
kinds of things about neuroscience and
all that kind of stuff and I still feel

10156
03:10:32,330 --> 03:10:32,340
all that kind of stuff and I still feel
 

10157
03:10:32,340 --> 03:10:35,090
all that kind of stuff and I still feel
the way I feel so to speak and it it

10158
03:10:35,090 --> 03:10:35,100
the way I feel so to speak and it it
 

10159
03:10:35,100 --> 03:10:38,150
the way I feel so to speak and it it
sort of seems disconnected but yet as I

10160
03:10:38,150 --> 03:10:38,160
sort of seems disconnected but yet as I
 

10161
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:40,370
sort of seems disconnected but yet as I
try and rationalize it I can't really

10162
03:10:40,370 --> 03:10:40,380
try and rationalize it I can't really
 

10163
03:10:40,380 --> 03:10:42,290
try and rationalize it I can't really
say that there's something kind of

10164
03:10:42,290 --> 03:10:42,300
say that there's something kind of
 

10165
03:10:42,300 --> 03:10:44,690
say that there's something kind of
different about how I intrinsically feel

10166
03:10:44,690 --> 03:10:44,700
different about how I intrinsically feel
 

10167
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:47,030
different about how I intrinsically feel
from the thing that I can plainly see in

10168
03:10:47,030 --> 03:10:47,040
from the thing that I can plainly see in
 

10169
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:48,290
from the thing that I can plainly see in
the sort of physicality of what's going

10170
03:10:48,290 --> 03:10:48,300
the sort of physicality of what's going
 

10171
03:10:48,300 --> 03:10:51,050
the sort of physicality of what's going
on so do you think the computer a large

10172
03:10:51,050 --> 03:10:51,060
on so do you think the computer a large
 

10173
03:10:51,060 --> 03:10:52,490
on so do you think the computer a large
language model will experience that

10174
03:10:52,490 --> 03:10:52,500
language model will experience that
 

10175
03:10:52,500 --> 03:10:53,929
language model will experience that
Transcendence

10176
03:10:53,929 --> 03:10:53,939
Transcendence
 

10177
03:10:53,939 --> 03:10:56,210
Transcendence
how does it make you feel like I I tend

10178
03:10:56,210 --> 03:10:56,220
how does it make you feel like I I tend
 

10179
03:10:56,220 --> 03:10:58,190
how does it make you feel like I I tend
to believe it will I think an ordinary

10180
03:10:58,190 --> 03:10:58,200
to believe it will I think an ordinary
 

10181
03:10:58,200 --> 03:11:00,110
to believe it will I think an ordinary
computer is already there I think an

10182
03:11:00,110 --> 03:11:00,120
computer is already there I think an
 

10183
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:02,090
computer is already there I think an
ordinary computer is already you know

10184
03:11:02,090 --> 03:11:02,100
ordinary computer is already you know
 

10185
03:11:02,100 --> 03:11:05,269
ordinary computer is already you know
kind of it's it's now a large language

10186
03:11:05,269 --> 03:11:05,279
kind of it's it's now a large language
 

10187
03:11:05,279 --> 03:11:07,370
kind of it's it's now a large language
model may experience it in a way that is

10188
03:11:07,370 --> 03:11:07,380
model may experience it in a way that is
 

10189
03:11:07,380 --> 03:11:09,889
model may experience it in a way that is
much better aligned with us humans that

10190
03:11:09,889 --> 03:11:09,899
much better aligned with us humans that
 

10191
03:11:09,899 --> 03:11:12,830
much better aligned with us humans that
is it's much more you know if you could

10192
03:11:12,830 --> 03:11:12,840
is it's much more you know if you could
 

10193
03:11:12,840 --> 03:11:15,610
is it's much more you know if you could
have the discussion with the computer

10194
03:11:15,610 --> 03:11:15,620
have the discussion with the computer
 

10195
03:11:15,620 --> 03:11:18,170
have the discussion with the computer
it's intelligent so to speak is not

10196
03:11:18,170 --> 03:11:18,180
it's intelligent so to speak is not
 

10197
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:20,389
it's intelligent so to speak is not
particularly well aligned with ours but

10198
03:11:20,389 --> 03:11:20,399
particularly well aligned with ours but
 

10199
03:11:20,399 --> 03:11:22,550
particularly well aligned with ours but
the large language model is you know

10200
03:11:22,550 --> 03:11:22,560
the large language model is you know
 

10201
03:11:22,560 --> 03:11:24,950
the large language model is you know
it's built to be aligned with our way of

10202
03:11:24,950 --> 03:11:24,960
it's built to be aligned with our way of
 

10203
03:11:24,960 --> 03:11:26,389
it's built to be aligned with our way of
thinking about things you'll be able to

10204
03:11:26,389 --> 03:11:26,399
thinking about things you'll be able to
 

10205
03:11:26,399 --> 03:11:29,030
thinking about things you'll be able to
explain that it's uh afraid of being

10206
03:11:29,030 --> 03:11:29,040
explain that it's uh afraid of being
 

10207
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:31,670
explain that it's uh afraid of being
shut off and deleted it'd be able to say

10208
03:11:31,670 --> 03:11:31,680
shut off and deleted it'd be able to say
 

10209
03:11:31,680 --> 03:11:34,250
shut off and deleted it'd be able to say
that it's sad of the way you've been

10210
03:11:34,250 --> 03:11:34,260
that it's sad of the way you've been
 

10211
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:35,809
that it's sad of the way you've been
speaking to it over the past two days

10212
03:11:35,809 --> 03:11:35,819
speaking to it over the past two days
 

10213
03:11:35,819 --> 03:11:37,250
speaking to it over the past two days
but you know that's a weird thing

10214
03:11:37,250 --> 03:11:37,260
but you know that's a weird thing
 

10215
03:11:37,260 --> 03:11:40,190
but you know that's a weird thing
because when it says it's afraid of

10216
03:11:40,190 --> 03:11:40,200
because when it says it's afraid of
 

10217
03:11:40,200 --> 03:11:43,250
because when it says it's afraid of
something right we know that it got that

10218
03:11:43,250 --> 03:11:43,260
something right we know that it got that
 

10219
03:11:43,260 --> 03:11:45,469
something right we know that it got that
idea from the fact that it read on the

10220
03:11:45,469 --> 03:11:45,479
idea from the fact that it read on the
 

10221
03:11:45,479 --> 03:11:47,510
idea from the fact that it read on the
internet yeah what did you get it Steven

10222
03:11:47,510 --> 03:11:47,520
internet yeah what did you get it Steven
 

10223
03:11:47,520 --> 03:11:49,070
internet yeah what did you get it Steven
where did you get it when you say you're

10224
03:11:49,070 --> 03:11:49,080
where did you get it when you say you're
 

10225
03:11:49,080 --> 03:11:50,690
where did you get it when you say you're
afraid you aren't quite that's the

10226
03:11:50,690 --> 03:11:50,700
afraid you aren't quite that's the
 

10227
03:11:50,700 --> 03:11:52,550
afraid you aren't quite that's the
question yeah right I mean it's it's

10228
03:11:52,550 --> 03:11:52,560
question yeah right I mean it's it's
 

10229
03:11:52,560 --> 03:11:55,670
question yeah right I mean it's it's
parents your friends right or or my

10230
03:11:55,670 --> 03:11:55,680
parents your friends right or or my
 

10231
03:11:55,680 --> 03:11:57,830
parents your friends right or or my
biology I mean in other words there's a

10232
03:11:57,830 --> 03:11:57,840
biology I mean in other words there's a
 

10233
03:11:57,840 --> 03:11:59,690
biology I mean in other words there's a
certain amount that is you know the

10234
03:11:59,690 --> 03:11:59,700
certain amount that is you know the
 

10235
03:11:59,700 --> 03:12:02,090
certain amount that is you know the
endocrine system kicking in and and you

10236
03:12:02,090 --> 03:12:02,100
endocrine system kicking in and and you
 

10237
03:12:02,100 --> 03:12:04,849
endocrine system kicking in and and you
know the the um uh these kinds of

10238
03:12:04,849 --> 03:12:04,859
know the the um uh these kinds of
 

10239
03:12:04,859 --> 03:12:07,010
know the the um uh these kinds of
emotional overlay type things that

10240
03:12:07,010 --> 03:12:07,020
emotional overlay type things that
 

10241
03:12:07,020 --> 03:12:09,230
emotional overlay type things that
happen to be that are actually much more

10242
03:12:09,230 --> 03:12:09,240
happen to be that are actually much more
 

10243
03:12:09,240 --> 03:12:11,389
happen to be that are actually much more
physical even they're much more sort of

10244
03:12:11,389 --> 03:12:11,399
physical even they're much more sort of
 

10245
03:12:11,399 --> 03:12:14,450
physical even they're much more sort of
straightforwardly chemical than the the

10246
03:12:14,450 --> 03:12:14,460
straightforwardly chemical than the the
 

10247
03:12:14,460 --> 03:12:16,190
straightforwardly chemical than the the
then kind of all of the higher level

10248
03:12:16,190 --> 03:12:16,200
then kind of all of the higher level
 

10249
03:12:16,200 --> 03:12:18,349
then kind of all of the higher level
thinking yeah but your biology didn't

10250
03:12:18,349 --> 03:12:18,359
thinking yeah but your biology didn't
 

10251
03:12:18,359 --> 03:12:20,570
thinking yeah but your biology didn't
tell you to say I'm afraid just at the

10252
03:12:20,570 --> 03:12:20,580
tell you to say I'm afraid just at the
 

10253
03:12:20,580 --> 03:12:22,550
tell you to say I'm afraid just at the
right time when people that love you are

10254
03:12:22,550 --> 03:12:22,560
right time when people that love you are
 

10255
03:12:22,560 --> 03:12:23,870
right time when people that love you are
listening and so you know you're

10256
03:12:23,870 --> 03:12:23,880
listening and so you know you're
 

10257
03:12:23,880 --> 03:12:26,570
listening and so you know you're
manipulating them by saying so that's

10258
03:12:26,570 --> 03:12:26,580
manipulating them by saying so that's
 

10259
03:12:26,580 --> 03:12:28,849
manipulating them by saying so that's
not your biology that's no that's a well

10260
03:12:28,849 --> 03:12:28,859
not your biology that's no that's a well
 

10261
03:12:28,859 --> 03:12:30,710
not your biology that's no that's a well
but the you know it's a large language

10262
03:12:30,710 --> 03:12:30,720
but the you know it's a large language
 

10263
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:32,570
but the you know it's a large language
model and that biological neural network

10264
03:12:32,570 --> 03:12:32,580
model and that biological neural network
 

10265
03:12:32,580 --> 03:12:35,269
model and that biological neural network
of yours yes but I mean the intrinsic

10266
03:12:35,269 --> 03:12:35,279
of yours yes but I mean the intrinsic
 

10267
03:12:35,279 --> 03:12:38,750
of yours yes but I mean the intrinsic
thing of you know something sort of

10268
03:12:38,750 --> 03:12:38,760
thing of you know something sort of
 

10269
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:41,330
thing of you know something sort of
shocking is just happening and you have

10270
03:12:41,330 --> 03:12:41,340
shocking is just happening and you have
 

10271
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:43,670
shocking is just happening and you have
some sort of reaction which is you know

10272
03:12:43,670 --> 03:12:43,680
some sort of reaction which is you know
 

10273
03:12:43,680 --> 03:12:46,130
some sort of reaction which is you know
some neurotransmitter gets secreted and

10274
03:12:46,130 --> 03:12:46,140
some neurotransmitter gets secreted and
 

10275
03:12:46,140 --> 03:12:46,969
some neurotransmitter gets secreted and
it's

10276
03:12:46,969 --> 03:12:46,979
it's
 

10277
03:12:46,979 --> 03:12:48,889
it's
um uh you know that that is the

10278
03:12:48,889 --> 03:12:48,899
um uh you know that that is the
 

10279
03:12:48,899 --> 03:12:50,990
um uh you know that that is the
beginning of some you know that is

10280
03:12:50,990 --> 03:12:51,000
beginning of some you know that is
 

10281
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,570
beginning of some you know that is
that's one of the pieces of input that

10282
03:12:53,570 --> 03:12:53,580
that's one of the pieces of input that
 

10283
03:12:53,580 --> 03:12:55,730
that's one of the pieces of input that
then draw lives it's kind of like the uh

10284
03:12:55,730 --> 03:12:55,740
then draw lives it's kind of like the uh
 

10285
03:12:55,740 --> 03:12:58,790
then draw lives it's kind of like the uh
like a prompt for for the large language

10286
03:12:58,790 --> 03:12:58,800
like a prompt for for the large language
 

10287
03:12:58,800 --> 03:13:00,830
like a prompt for for the large language
model I mean just like when we dream for

10288
03:13:00,830 --> 03:13:00,840
model I mean just like when we dream for
 

10289
03:13:00,840 --> 03:13:03,349
model I mean just like when we dream for
example you know no doubt there are all

10290
03:13:03,349 --> 03:13:03,359
example you know no doubt there are all
 

10291
03:13:03,359 --> 03:13:04,969
example you know no doubt there are all
these sort of random inputs they're kind

10292
03:13:04,969 --> 03:13:04,979
these sort of random inputs they're kind
 

10293
03:13:04,979 --> 03:13:06,889
these sort of random inputs they're kind
of these random prompts and that's

10294
03:13:06,889 --> 03:13:06,899
of these random prompts and that's
 

10295
03:13:06,899 --> 03:13:09,170
of these random prompts and that's
percolating through in kind of the way

10296
03:13:09,170 --> 03:13:09,180
percolating through in kind of the way
 

10297
03:13:09,180 --> 03:13:11,450
percolating through in kind of the way
that a large language model does of kind

10298
03:13:11,450 --> 03:13:11,460
that a large language model does of kind
 

10299
03:13:11,460 --> 03:13:13,010
that a large language model does of kind
of putting together things that seem

10300
03:13:13,010 --> 03:13:13,020
of putting together things that seem
 

10301
03:13:13,020 --> 03:13:13,910
of putting together things that seem
meaningful

10302
03:13:13,910 --> 03:13:13,920
meaningful
 

10303
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:16,250
meaningful
I I mean are you uh are you worried

10304
03:13:16,250 --> 03:13:16,260
I I mean are you uh are you worried
 

10305
03:13:16,260 --> 03:13:19,070
I I mean are you uh are you worried
about this world where you you teach a

10306
03:13:19,070 --> 03:13:19,080
about this world where you you teach a
 

10307
03:13:19,080 --> 03:13:20,750
about this world where you you teach a
lot on the internet and there's people

10308
03:13:20,750 --> 03:13:20,760
lot on the internet and there's people
 

10309
03:13:20,760 --> 03:13:23,210
lot on the internet and there's people
asking questions and comments and so on

10310
03:13:23,210 --> 03:13:23,220
asking questions and comments and so on
 

10311
03:13:23,220 --> 03:13:27,590
asking questions and comments and so on
uh you have people that work remotely

10312
03:13:27,590 --> 03:13:27,600
uh you have people that work remotely
 

10313
03:13:27,600 --> 03:13:30,110
uh you have people that work remotely
um are you worried about this world when

10314
03:13:30,110 --> 03:13:30,120
um are you worried about this world when
 

10315
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:32,389
um are you worried about this world when
um large language models

10316
03:13:32,389 --> 03:13:32,399
um large language models
 

10317
03:13:32,399 --> 03:13:35,030
um large language models
create human-like Bots

10318
03:13:35,030 --> 03:13:35,040
create human-like Bots
 

10319
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:36,290
create human-like Bots
that are

10320
03:13:36,290 --> 03:13:36,300
that are
 

10321
03:13:36,300 --> 03:13:38,210
that are
leaving the comments asking the

employees yeah

10326
03:13:42,530 --> 03:13:42,540
employees yeah
 

10327
03:13:42,540 --> 03:13:46,309

I mean or or or uh worse or better at
yet friends friends of yours right look

10330
03:13:49,070 --> 03:13:49,080
yet friends friends of yours right look
 

10331
03:13:49,080 --> 03:13:52,730
yet friends friends of yours right look
I mean one point is my mode of life has

10332
03:13:52,730 --> 03:13:52,740
I mean one point is my mode of life has
 

10333
03:13:52,740 --> 03:13:54,710
I mean one point is my mode of life has
been I build tools and then I use the

10334
03:13:54,710 --> 03:13:54,720
been I build tools and then I use the
 

10335
03:13:54,720 --> 03:13:57,290
been I build tools and then I use the
tools yeah and in a sense kind of you

10336
03:13:57,290 --> 03:13:57,300
tools yeah and in a sense kind of you
 

10337
03:13:57,300 --> 03:13:58,849
tools yeah and in a sense kind of you
know I'm I'm building this Tower of

10338
03:13:58,849 --> 03:13:58,859
know I'm I'm building this Tower of
 

10339
03:13:58,859 --> 03:14:01,610
know I'm I'm building this Tower of
automation yes which you know and in a

10340
03:14:01,610 --> 03:14:01,620
automation yes which you know and in a
 

10341
03:14:01,620 --> 03:14:03,590
automation yes which you know and in a
sense you know when you make a company

10342
03:14:03,590 --> 03:14:03,600
sense you know when you make a company
 

10343
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:06,230
sense you know when you make a company
or something you are making sort of

10344
03:14:06,230 --> 03:14:06,240
or something you are making sort of
 

10345
03:14:06,240 --> 03:14:08,210
or something you are making sort of
automation but it has some humans in it

10346
03:14:08,210 --> 03:14:08,220
automation but it has some humans in it
 

10347
03:14:08,220 --> 03:14:11,030
automation but it has some humans in it
but also as much as possible it has it

10348
03:14:11,030 --> 03:14:11,040
but also as much as possible it has it
 

10349
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:13,790
but also as much as possible it has it
has uh you know computers in it and so I

10350
03:14:13,790 --> 03:14:13,800
has uh you know computers in it and so I
 

10351
03:14:13,800 --> 03:14:15,530
has uh you know computers in it and so I
think it's sort of an extension of that

10352
03:14:15,530 --> 03:14:15,540
think it's sort of an extension of that
 

10353
03:14:15,540 --> 03:14:19,490
think it's sort of an extension of that
now now if I really didn't know that um

10354
03:14:19,490 --> 03:14:19,500
now now if I really didn't know that um
 

10355
03:14:19,500 --> 03:14:21,110
now now if I really didn't know that um
you know it's a it's a it's a funny

10356
03:14:21,110 --> 03:14:21,120
you know it's a it's a it's a funny
 

10357
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:23,630
you know it's a it's a it's a funny
question it's a it's a funny issue when

10358
03:14:23,630 --> 03:14:23,640
question it's a it's a funny issue when
 

10359
03:14:23,640 --> 03:14:24,950
question it's a it's a funny issue when
you know if we think about sort of

10360
03:14:24,950 --> 03:14:24,960
you know if we think about sort of
 

10361
03:14:24,960 --> 03:14:26,389
you know if we think about sort of
what's going to happen to the future of

10362
03:14:26,389 --> 03:14:26,399
what's going to happen to the future of
 

10363
03:14:26,399 --> 03:14:28,790
what's going to happen to the future of
kind of jobs people do and so on and

10364
03:14:28,790 --> 03:14:28,800
kind of jobs people do and so on and
 

10365
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:31,490
kind of jobs people do and so on and
there are places where kind of having a

10366
03:14:31,490 --> 03:14:31,500
there are places where kind of having a
 

10367
03:14:31,500 --> 03:14:32,809
there are places where kind of having a
human in the loop there are different

10368
03:14:32,809 --> 03:14:32,819
human in the loop there are different
 

10369
03:14:32,819 --> 03:14:34,730
human in the loop there are different
reasons to have a human in a loop for

10370
03:14:34,730 --> 03:14:34,740
reasons to have a human in a loop for
 

10371
03:14:34,740 --> 03:14:36,530
reasons to have a human in a loop for
example you might want a human in the

10372
03:14:36,530 --> 03:14:36,540
example you might want a human in the
 

10373
03:14:36,540 --> 03:14:38,269
example you might want a human in the
loop because you want somebody to you

10374
03:14:38,269 --> 03:14:38,279
loop because you want somebody to you
 

10375
03:14:38,279 --> 03:14:40,610
loop because you want somebody to you
want another human to be invested in the

10376
03:14:40,610 --> 03:14:40,620
want another human to be invested in the
 

10377
03:14:40,620 --> 03:14:42,170
want another human to be invested in the
outcome you know you want a human flying

10378
03:14:42,170 --> 03:14:42,180
outcome you know you want a human flying
 

10379
03:14:42,180 --> 03:14:44,090
outcome you know you want a human flying
the plane who's going to die if the

10380
03:14:44,090 --> 03:14:44,100
the plane who's going to die if the
 

10381
03:14:44,100 --> 03:14:46,550
the plane who's going to die if the
plane crashes along with you so to speak

10382
03:14:46,550 --> 03:14:46,560
plane crashes along with you so to speak
 

10383
03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:48,290
plane crashes along with you so to speak
and that gives you sort of confidence

10384
03:14:48,290 --> 03:14:48,300
and that gives you sort of confidence
 

10385
03:14:48,300 --> 03:14:49,969
and that gives you sort of confidence
that the right thing is going to happen

10386
03:14:49,969 --> 03:14:49,979
that the right thing is going to happen
 

10387
03:14:49,979 --> 03:14:53,210
that the right thing is going to happen
or you might want you know right now you

10388
03:14:53,210 --> 03:14:53,220
or you might want you know right now you
 

10389
03:14:53,220 --> 03:14:55,250
or you might want you know right now you
might want a human in the loop in some

10390
03:14:55,250 --> 03:14:55,260
might want a human in the loop in some
 

10391
03:14:55,260 --> 03:14:57,230
might want a human in the loop in some
kind of sort of human encouragement

human there yeah imagine like a

10410
03:15:18,889 --> 03:15:18,899
human there yeah imagine like a
 

10411
03:15:18,899 --> 03:15:21,950
human there yeah imagine like a
therapist or even higher stake like a

10412
03:15:21,950 --> 03:15:21,960
therapist or even higher stake like a
 

10413
03:15:21,960 --> 03:15:24,590

10417
03:15:27,540 --> 03:15:29,750
language model yeah who boy is a pretty
high stake situation right but I mean

10418
03:15:29,750 --> 03:15:29,760
high stake situation right but I mean
 

10419
03:15:29,760 --> 03:15:32,150
high stake situation right but I mean
but you know it might in fact do the

10420
03:15:32,150 --> 03:15:32,160
but you know it might in fact do the
 

10421
03:15:32,160 --> 03:15:34,130
but you know it might in fact do the
right thing yeah because it might be the

10422
03:15:34,130 --> 03:15:34,140
right thing yeah because it might be the
 

10423
03:15:34,140 --> 03:15:36,110
right thing yeah because it might be the
case that that um you know and that's

10424
03:15:36,110 --> 03:15:36,120
case that that um you know and that's
 

10425
03:15:36,120 --> 03:15:39,889
case that that um you know and that's
really partly a question of sort of how

10426
03:15:39,889 --> 03:15:39,899
really partly a question of sort of how
 

10427
03:15:39,899 --> 03:15:42,170
really partly a question of sort of how
complicated is the human you know one of

complicated is the human you know one of
 

10429
03:15:42,180 --> 03:15:43,750
complicated is the human you know one of
the things that's that's always

03:15:43,750 --> 03:15:43,760
the things that's that's always
 

10431
03:15:43,760 --> 03:15:46,309
the things that's that's always
surprising in some sense is that you

10432
03:15:46,309 --> 03:15:46,319
surprising in some sense is that you
 

10433
03:15:46,319 --> 03:15:47,750
surprising in some sense is that you
know sometimes human psychology is not

10434
03:15:47,750 --> 03:15:47,760
know sometimes human psychology is not
 

10435
03:15:47,760 --> 03:15:49,969
know sometimes human psychology is not
that complicated in some sense

back in the 1820s when steam engines
 

10487
03:16:52,979 --> 03:16:54,889
back in the 1820s when steam engines
were a big thing and the big question

03:16:54,889 --> 03:16:54,899
were a big thing and the big question
 

10489
03:16:54,899 --> 03:16:57,170
were a big thing and the big question
was how efficient could a steam engine

was how efficient could a steam engine
 

10491

03:17:13,260 --> 03:17:16,790
um but he figured out these this kind of
rules for how uh kind of the the

10504
03:17:16,790 --> 03:17:16,800
rules for how uh kind of the the
 

10505
03:17:16,800 --> 03:17:19,250
rules for how uh kind of the the
efficiency of of the possible efficiency

10506
03:17:19,250 --> 03:17:19,260
efficiency of of the possible efficiency
 

10507
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:22,910
efficiency of of the possible efficiency
of something like a steam engine and in

10508
03:17:22,910 --> 03:17:22,920
of something like a steam engine and in
 

10509
03:17:22,920 --> 03:17:26,030
of something like a steam engine and in
sort of a side part of what he did was

10510
03:17:26,030 --> 03:17:26,040
sort of a side part of what he did was
 

10511
03:17:26,040 --> 03:17:29,150
sort of a side part of what he did was
this idea that mechanical energy tends

10512
03:17:29,150 --> 03:17:29,160
this idea that mechanical energy tends
 

10513
03:17:29,160 --> 03:17:31,490
this idea that mechanical energy tends
to get dissipated as heat that you that

10514
03:17:31,490 --> 03:17:31,500
to get dissipated as heat that you that
 

10515
03:17:31,500 --> 03:17:34,130
to get dissipated as heat that you that
you end up going from sort of systematic

10516
03:17:34,130 --> 03:17:34,140
you end up going from sort of systematic
 

10517
03:17:34,140 --> 03:17:36,830
you end up going from sort of systematic
mechanical motion to this kind of random

10518
03:17:36,830 --> 03:17:36,840
mechanical motion to this kind of random
 

10519
03:17:36,840 --> 03:17:38,929
mechanical motion to this kind of random
thing well at that time nobody knew what

10520
03:17:38,929 --> 03:17:38,939
thing well at that time nobody knew what
 

10521
03:17:38,939 --> 03:17:41,389
thing well at that time nobody knew what
heat was at that time people thought

10522
03:17:41,389 --> 03:17:41,399
heat was at that time people thought
 

10523
03:17:41,399 --> 03:17:43,730
heat was at that time people thought
that heat was a fluid like they called

10524
03:17:43,730 --> 03:17:43,740
that heat was a fluid like they called
 

10525
03:17:43,740 --> 03:17:46,550
that heat was a fluid like they called
it caloric and it was a fluid that kind

10526
03:17:46,550 --> 03:17:46,560
it caloric and it was a fluid that kind
 

10527
03:17:46,560 --> 03:17:50,450
it caloric and it was a fluid that kind
of kind of was absorbed into substances

10528
03:17:50,450 --> 03:17:50,460
of kind of was absorbed into substances
 

10529
03:17:50,460 --> 03:17:52,730
of kind of was absorbed into substances
and when when heat when one hot thing

10530
03:17:52,730 --> 03:17:52,740
and when when heat when one hot thing
 

10531
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:55,849
and when when heat when one hot thing
would transfer heat to a colder thing

10532
03:17:55,849 --> 03:17:55,859
would transfer heat to a colder thing
 

10533
03:17:55,859 --> 03:17:58,070
would transfer heat to a colder thing
that this fluid would flow from the hot

10534
03:17:58,070 --> 03:17:58,080
that this fluid would flow from the hot
 

10535
03:17:58,080 --> 03:17:59,809
that this fluid would flow from the hot
thing to the colder thing but anyway

10536
03:17:59,809 --> 03:17:59,819
thing to the colder thing but anyway
 

10537
03:17:59,819 --> 03:18:03,290
thing to the colder thing but anyway
then by the by the 1860s people had uh

10538
03:18:03,290 --> 03:18:03,300
then by the by the 1860s people had uh
 

10539
03:18:03,300 --> 03:18:06,849
then by the by the 1860s people had uh
kind of come up with this idea that

10540
03:18:06,849 --> 03:18:06,859
kind of come up with this idea that
 

10541
03:18:06,859 --> 03:18:10,849
kind of come up with this idea that
systematic energy tends to degrade into

10542
03:18:10,849 --> 03:18:10,859
systematic energy tends to degrade into
 

10543
03:18:10,859 --> 03:18:15,530
systematic energy tends to degrade into
kind of random heat that would uh that

10544
03:18:15,530 --> 03:18:15,540
kind of random heat that would uh that
 

10545
03:18:15,540 --> 03:18:17,990
kind of random heat that would uh that
that could then not be easily turned

10546
03:18:17,990 --> 03:18:18,000
that could then not be easily turned
 

10547
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:21,050
that could then not be easily turned
back into systematic mechanical energy

10548
03:18:21,050 --> 03:18:21,060
back into systematic mechanical energy
 

10549
03:18:21,060 --> 03:18:23,750
back into systematic mechanical energy
um and then that that quickly became

10550
03:18:23,750 --> 03:18:23,760
um and then that that quickly became
 

10551
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:25,910
um and then that that quickly became
sort of a global principle about how

10552
03:18:25,910 --> 03:18:25,920
sort of a global principle about how
 

10553
03:18:25,920 --> 03:18:28,250
sort of a global principle about how
things work question is why does it

10554
03:18:28,250 --> 03:18:28,260
things work question is why does it
 

10555
03:18:28,260 --> 03:18:30,230
things work question is why does it
happen that way so you know let's say

10556
03:18:30,230 --> 03:18:30,240
happen that way so you know let's say
 

10557
03:18:30,240 --> 03:18:31,969
happen that way so you know let's say
you have a bunch of molecules in a box

10558
03:18:31,969 --> 03:18:31,979
you have a bunch of molecules in a box
 

10559
03:18:31,979 --> 03:18:33,769
you have a bunch of molecules in a box
and they're arranged these molecules

10560
03:18:33,769 --> 03:18:33,779
and they're arranged these molecules
 

10561
03:18:33,779 --> 03:18:35,870
and they're arranged these molecules
arranged in a very nice sort of uh

10562
03:18:35,870 --> 03:18:35,880
arranged in a very nice sort of uh
 

10563
03:18:35,880 --> 03:18:38,150
arranged in a very nice sort of uh
flotiller of molecules in one corner of

10564
03:18:38,150 --> 03:18:38,160
flotiller of molecules in one corner of
 

10565
03:18:38,160 --> 03:18:40,910
flotiller of molecules in one corner of
the box and then what you typically

10566
03:18:40,910 --> 03:18:40,920
the box and then what you typically
 

10567
03:18:40,920 --> 03:18:43,010
the box and then what you typically
observe is that after a while these

10568
03:18:43,010 --> 03:18:43,020
observe is that after a while these
 

10569
03:18:43,020 --> 03:18:45,290
observe is that after a while these
molecules were kind of randomly arranged

10570
03:18:45,290 --> 03:18:45,300
molecules were kind of randomly arranged
 

10571
03:18:45,300 --> 03:18:47,510
molecules were kind of randomly arranged
in in the Box question is why does that

10572
03:18:47,510 --> 03:18:47,520
in in the Box question is why does that
 

10573
03:18:47,520 --> 03:18:50,269
in in the Box question is why does that
happen and people for a long long time

10574
03:18:50,269 --> 03:18:50,279
happen and people for a long long time
 

10575
03:18:50,279 --> 03:18:53,150
happen and people for a long long time
tried to figure out is there from the

10576
03:18:53,150 --> 03:18:53,160
tried to figure out is there from the
 

10577
03:18:53,160 --> 03:18:55,070
tried to figure out is there from the
laws of mechanics that just determine

10578
03:18:55,070 --> 03:18:55,080
laws of mechanics that just determine
 

10579
03:18:55,080 --> 03:18:56,389
laws of mechanics that just determine
how these molecules that say these

10580
03:18:56,389 --> 03:18:56,399
how these molecules that say these
 

10581
03:18:56,399 --> 03:18:58,070
how these molecules that say these
molecules like hard spheres bouncing off

10582
03:18:58,070 --> 03:18:58,080
molecules like hard spheres bouncing off
 

10583
03:18:58,080 --> 03:18:59,929
molecules like hard spheres bouncing off
each other from the laws of mechanics

10584
03:18:59,929 --> 03:18:59,939
each other from the laws of mechanics
 

10585
03:18:59,939 --> 03:19:02,269
each other from the laws of mechanics
that describe those molecules can we

10586
03:19:02,269 --> 03:19:02,279
that describe those molecules can we
 

10587
03:19:02,279 --> 03:19:05,389
that describe those molecules can we
explain why it tends to be the case that

10588
03:19:05,389 --> 03:19:05,399
explain why it tends to be the case that
 

10589
03:19:05,399 --> 03:19:09,830
explain why it tends to be the case that
we see things that are orderly sort of

10590
03:19:09,830 --> 03:19:09,840
we see things that are orderly sort of
 

10591
03:19:09,840 --> 03:19:12,769
we see things that are orderly sort of
degrade into disorder we tend to see

10592
03:19:12,769 --> 03:19:12,779
degrade into disorder we tend to see
 

10593
03:19:12,779 --> 03:19:16,730
degrade into disorder we tend to see
things that uh you know you you uh you

10594
03:19:16,730 --> 03:19:16,740
things that uh you know you you uh you
 

10595
03:19:16,740 --> 03:19:19,610
things that uh you know you you uh you
scramble an egg you um that you know you

10596
03:19:19,610 --> 03:19:19,620
scramble an egg you um that you know you
 

10597
03:19:19,620 --> 03:19:21,110
scramble an egg you um that you know you
take something's quite ordered and you

10598
03:19:21,110 --> 03:19:21,120
take something's quite ordered and you
 

10599
03:19:21,120 --> 03:19:23,630
take something's quite ordered and you
you disorder it so to speak that's the

10600
03:19:23,630 --> 03:19:23,640
you disorder it so to speak that's the
 

10601
03:19:23,640 --> 03:19:25,250
you disorder it so to speak that's the
thing that sort of happens quite

10602
03:19:25,250 --> 03:19:25,260
thing that sort of happens quite
 

10603
03:19:25,260 --> 03:19:27,590
thing that sort of happens quite
regularly or you you put some ink into

10604
03:19:27,590 --> 03:19:27,600
regularly or you you put some ink into
 

10605
03:19:27,600 --> 03:19:29,150
regularly or you you put some ink into
water and it will eventually spread out

10606
03:19:29,150 --> 03:19:29,160
water and it will eventually spread out
 

10607
03:19:29,160 --> 03:19:32,690
water and it will eventually spread out
and and fill up you know fill up the

10608
03:19:32,690 --> 03:19:32,700
and and fill up you know fill up the
 

10609
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:33,830
and and fill up you know fill up the
water

10610
03:19:33,830 --> 03:19:33,840
water
 

10611
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:36,230
water
um but you don't see those little

10612
03:19:36,230 --> 03:19:36,240
um but you don't see those little
 

10613
03:19:36,240 --> 03:19:38,269
um but you don't see those little
particles of ink in the water all

10614
03:19:38,269 --> 03:19:38,279
particles of ink in the water all
 

10615
03:19:38,279 --> 03:19:40,370
particles of ink in the water all
spontaneously kind of arrange themselves

10616
03:19:40,370 --> 03:19:40,380
spontaneously kind of arrange themselves
 

10617
03:19:40,380 --> 03:19:42,710
spontaneously kind of arrange themselves
into a Big Blob and then you know jump

10618
03:19:42,710 --> 03:19:42,720
into a Big Blob and then you know jump
 

10619
03:19:42,720 --> 03:19:44,690
into a Big Blob and then you know jump
out of the water or something

10620
03:19:44,690 --> 03:19:44,700
out of the water or something
 

10621
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:47,330
out of the water or something
um and so the question is why do things

10622
03:19:47,330 --> 03:19:47,340
um and so the question is why do things
 

10623
03:19:47,340 --> 03:19:49,429
um and so the question is why do things
happen in this kind of irreversible way

10624
03:19:49,429 --> 03:19:49,439
happen in this kind of irreversible way
 

10625
03:19:49,439 --> 03:19:52,550
happen in this kind of irreversible way
where you go from order to disorder why

10626
03:19:52,550 --> 03:19:52,560
where you go from order to disorder why
 

10627
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:54,349
where you go from order to disorder why
does it happen that way and so

10628
03:19:54,349 --> 03:19:54,359
does it happen that way and so
 

10629
03:19:54,359 --> 03:19:56,929
does it happen that way and so
throughout in the later part of the

10630
03:19:56,929 --> 03:19:56,939
throughout in the later part of the
 

10631
03:19:56,939 --> 03:19:59,389
throughout in the later part of the
1800s a lot of work was done on trying

10632
03:19:59,389 --> 03:19:59,399
1800s a lot of work was done on trying
 

10633
03:19:59,399 --> 03:20:01,790
1800s a lot of work was done on trying
to figure out can one derive this

10634
03:20:01,790 --> 03:20:01,800
to figure out can one derive this
 

10635
03:20:01,800 --> 03:20:03,290
to figure out can one derive this

03:20:09,590 --> 03:20:09,600
Dynamics of heat so to speak can one
 

10641
03:20:09,600 --> 03:20:13,250

derive this from uh from some

10642
03:20:13,250 --> 03:20:13,260
derive this from uh from some
 

10643
03:20:13,260 --> 03:20:15,349
derive this from uh from some
fundamental principles of mechanics you

10644
03:20:15,349 --> 03:20:15,359
fundamental principles of mechanics you
 

10645
03:20:15,359 --> 03:20:16,969
fundamental principles of mechanics you
know in the laws of thermodynamics the

10646
03:20:16,969 --> 03:20:16,979
know in the laws of thermodynamics the
 

10647
03:20:16,979 --> 03:20:19,010
know in the laws of thermodynamics the

kinds of things plus other kinds of
 

10657
03:20:27,240 --> 03:20:30,050
kinds of things plus other kinds of
energy that that total is constant and

10658
03:20:30,050 --> 03:20:30,060
energy that that total is constant and
 

10659
03:20:30,060 --> 03:20:31,370
energy that that total is constant and
that became a pretty well understood

10660
03:20:31,370 --> 03:20:31,380
that became a pretty well understood
 

10661
03:20:31,380 --> 03:20:33,889
that became a pretty well understood
principle but the the second law of

10662
03:20:33,889 --> 03:20:33,899
principle but the the second law of
 

10663
03:20:33,899 --> 03:20:35,929
principle but the the second law of
Thermodynamics was always mysterious

10664
03:20:35,929 --> 03:20:35,939
Thermodynamics was always mysterious
 

10665
03:20:35,939 --> 03:20:38,150
Thermodynamics was always mysterious
like why does it work this way can it be

10666
03:20:38,150 --> 03:20:38,160
like why does it work this way can it be
 

10667
03:20:38,160 --> 03:20:41,110
like why does it work this way can it be
derived from underlying mechanical laws

10668
03:20:41,110 --> 03:20:41,120
derived from underlying mechanical laws
 

10669
03:20:41,120 --> 03:20:45,889
derived from underlying mechanical laws
and so when I was uh well 12 years sold

10670
03:20:45,889 --> 03:20:45,899
and so when I was uh well 12 years sold
 

10671
03:20:45,899 --> 03:20:48,230
and so when I was uh well 12 years sold
actually I had gotten interested well

10672
03:20:48,230 --> 03:20:48,240
actually I had gotten interested well
 

10673
03:20:48,240 --> 03:20:50,330
actually I had gotten interested well
I've been interested in in space and

10674
03:20:50,330 --> 03:20:50,340
I've been interested in in space and
 

10675
03:20:50,340 --> 03:20:51,469
I've been interested in in space and
things like that because I thought that

10676
03:20:51,469 --> 03:20:51,479
things like that because I thought that
 

10677
03:20:51,479 --> 03:20:53,870
things like that because I thought that
was kind of the the future and um

10678
03:20:53,870 --> 03:20:53,880
was kind of the the future and um
 

10679
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:57,110
was kind of the the future and um
interesting sort of technology and so on

10680
03:20:57,110 --> 03:20:57,120
interesting sort of technology and so on
 

10681
03:20:57,120 --> 03:20:59,150
interesting sort of technology and so on
and for a while kind of uh you know

10682
03:20:59,150 --> 03:20:59,160
and for a while kind of uh you know
 

10683
03:20:59,160 --> 03:21:01,550
and for a while kind of uh you know
every deep space probe was sort of a

10684
03:21:01,550 --> 03:21:01,560
every deep space probe was sort of a
 

10685
03:21:01,560 --> 03:21:03,349
every deep space probe was sort of a
personal friend type thing and I knew

10686
03:21:03,349 --> 03:21:03,359
personal friend type thing and I knew
 

10687
03:21:03,359 --> 03:21:05,570
personal friend type thing and I knew
all all kinds of characteristics of it

10688
03:21:05,570 --> 03:21:05,580
all all kinds of characteristics of it
 

10689
03:21:05,580 --> 03:21:08,809
all all kinds of characteristics of it
and uh uh was kind of writing up all

10690
03:21:08,809 --> 03:21:08,819
and uh uh was kind of writing up all
 

10691
03:21:08,819 --> 03:21:11,090
and uh uh was kind of writing up all
these all these things when I was well I

10692
03:21:11,090 --> 03:21:11,100
these all these things when I was well I
 

10693
03:21:11,100 --> 03:21:13,070
these all these things when I was well I
don't know eight nine ten years old and

10694
03:21:13,070 --> 03:21:13,080
don't know eight nine ten years old and
 

10695
03:21:13,080 --> 03:21:15,530
don't know eight nine ten years old and
so on and then I I got interested from

10696
03:21:15,530 --> 03:21:15,540
so on and then I I got interested from
 

10697
03:21:15,540 --> 03:21:17,269
so on and then I I got interested from
being interested in kind of spacecraft I

10698
03:21:17,269 --> 03:21:17,279
being interested in kind of spacecraft I
 

10699
03:21:17,279 --> 03:21:18,889
being interested in kind of spacecraft I
got interested so like how do they work

10700
03:21:18,889 --> 03:21:18,899
got interested so like how do they work
 

10701
03:21:18,899 --> 03:21:20,990
got interested so like how do they work
what all the instruments on them and so

10702
03:21:20,990 --> 03:21:21,000
what all the instruments on them and so
 

10703
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,210
what all the instruments on them and so
on and that got me interested in physics

10704
03:21:23,210 --> 03:21:23,220
on and that got me interested in physics
 

10705
03:21:23,220 --> 03:21:24,830
on and that got me interested in physics
which was just as well because if I'd

10706
03:21:24,830 --> 03:21:24,840
which was just as well because if I'd
 

10707
03:21:24,840 --> 03:21:27,469
which was just as well because if I'd
stayed interested in space in the you

10708
03:21:27,469 --> 03:21:27,479
stayed interested in space in the you
 

10709
03:21:27,479 --> 03:21:29,750
stayed interested in space in the you
know mid to late 1960s I would have had

10710
03:21:29,750 --> 03:21:29,760
know mid to late 1960s I would have had
 

10711
03:21:29,760 --> 03:21:32,750
know mid to late 1960s I would have had
a long wait before you know space really

10712
03:21:32,750 --> 03:21:32,760
a long wait before you know space really
 

10713
03:21:32,760 --> 03:21:36,050
a long wait before you know space really
blossomed as a as an area but uh editing

10714
03:21:36,050 --> 03:21:36,060
blossomed as a as an area but uh editing
 

10715
03:21:36,060 --> 03:21:38,210
blossomed as a as an area but uh editing
is everything right I got interested in

10716
03:21:38,210 --> 03:21:38,220
is everything right I got interested in
 

10717
03:21:38,220 --> 03:21:42,769
is everything right I got interested in
physics and uh then well the actual sort

10718
03:21:42,769 --> 03:21:42,779
physics and uh then well the actual sort
 

10719
03:21:42,779 --> 03:21:45,170
physics and uh then well the actual sort
of detailed story is when I when I kind

10720
03:21:45,170 --> 03:21:45,180
of detailed story is when I when I kind
 

10721
03:21:45,180 --> 03:21:47,150
of detailed story is when I when I kind
of graduated from elementary school at

10722
03:21:47,150 --> 03:21:47,160
of graduated from elementary school at
 

10723
03:21:47,160 --> 03:21:50,090
of graduated from elementary school at
age 12. that's the time when in England

10724
03:21:50,090 --> 03:21:50,100
age 12. that's the time when in England
 

10725
03:21:50,100 --> 03:21:52,790
age 12. that's the time when in England
where you've finished Elementary School

10726
03:21:52,790 --> 03:21:52,800
where you've finished Elementary School
 

10727
03:21:52,800 --> 03:21:55,790
where you've finished Elementary School
um I sort of my my gift sort of I

10728
03:21:55,790 --> 03:21:55,800
um I sort of my my gift sort of I
 

10729
03:21:55,800 --> 03:21:57,530
um I sort of my my gift sort of I
suppose more or less for myself was I

10730
03:21:57,530 --> 03:21:57,540
suppose more or less for myself was I
 

10731
03:21:57,540 --> 03:22:01,550
suppose more or less for myself was I
got um this collection of um

10732
03:22:01,550 --> 03:22:01,560
got um this collection of um
 

10733
03:22:01,560 --> 03:22:04,070
got um this collection of um
physics books which were some college

10734
03:22:04,070 --> 03:22:04,080
physics books which were some college
 

10735
03:22:04,080 --> 03:22:06,769
physics books which were some college
Physics course of college physics books

10736
03:22:06,769 --> 03:22:06,779
Physics course of college physics books
 

10737
03:22:06,779 --> 03:22:09,410
Physics course of college physics books
and volume Five about statistical

10738
03:22:09,410 --> 03:22:09,420
and volume Five about statistical
 

10739
03:22:09,420 --> 03:22:11,750
and volume Five about statistical
physics it has this picture on the cover

10740
03:22:11,750 --> 03:22:11,760
physics it has this picture on the cover
 

10741
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:15,769
physics it has this picture on the cover
that shows a bunch of kind of idealized

10742
03:22:15,769 --> 03:22:15,779
that shows a bunch of kind of idealized
 

10743
03:22:15,779 --> 03:22:18,290
that shows a bunch of kind of idealized
molecules sitting in one side of a box

10744
03:22:18,290 --> 03:22:18,300
molecules sitting in one side of a box
 

10745
03:22:18,300 --> 03:22:20,690
molecules sitting in one side of a box
and then it has a series of frames

10746
03:22:20,690 --> 03:22:20,700
and then it has a series of frames
 

10747
03:22:20,700 --> 03:22:22,670
and then it has a series of frames
showing how these molecules sort of

10748
03:22:22,670 --> 03:22:22,680
showing how these molecules sort of
 

10749
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:24,410
showing how these molecules sort of
spread out in the box and I thought

10750
03:22:24,410 --> 03:22:24,420
spread out in the box and I thought
 

10751
03:22:24,420 --> 03:22:26,750
spread out in the box and I thought
that's pretty interesting you know what

10752
03:22:26,750 --> 03:22:26,760
that's pretty interesting you know what
 

10753
03:22:26,760 --> 03:22:30,230
that's pretty interesting you know what
what causes that and you know I read the

10754
03:22:30,230 --> 03:22:30,240
what causes that and you know I read the
 

10755
03:22:30,240 --> 03:22:32,210
what causes that and you know I read the
book and and the book the book actually

10756
03:22:32,210 --> 03:22:32,220
book and and the book the book actually
 

10757
03:22:32,220 --> 03:22:34,010
book and and the book the book actually
one of the things that was really

10758
03:22:34,010 --> 03:22:34,020
one of the things that was really
 

10759
03:22:34,020 --> 03:22:36,290
one of the things that was really
significant to me about that was the

10760
03:22:36,290 --> 03:22:36,300
significant to me about that was the
 

10761
03:22:36,300 --> 03:22:37,550
significant to me about that was the
book kind of claimed although I didn't

10762
03:22:37,550 --> 03:22:37,560
book kind of claimed although I didn't
 

10763
03:22:37,560 --> 03:22:39,590
book kind of claimed although I didn't
really understand what it said in detail

10764
03:22:39,590 --> 03:22:39,600
really understand what it said in detail
 

10765
03:22:39,600 --> 03:22:42,170
really understand what it said in detail
it kind of claimed that this sort of

10766
03:22:42,170 --> 03:22:42,180
it kind of claimed that this sort of
 

10767
03:22:42,180 --> 03:22:43,849
it kind of claimed that this sort of
principle of physics was derivable

10768
03:22:43,849 --> 03:22:43,859
principle of physics was derivable
 

10769
03:22:43,859 --> 03:22:46,670
principle of physics was derivable
somehow and you know other things I'd

10770
03:22:46,670 --> 03:22:46,680
somehow and you know other things I'd
 

10771
03:22:46,680 --> 03:22:48,710
somehow and you know other things I'd
learned about physics it was all like

10772
03:22:48,710 --> 03:22:48,720
learned about physics it was all like
 

10773
03:22:48,720 --> 03:22:52,070
learned about physics it was all like
it's a fact that energy is conserved

10774
03:22:52,070 --> 03:22:52,080
it's a fact that energy is conserved
 

10775
03:22:52,080 --> 03:22:53,990
it's a fact that energy is conserved
it's a fact that relativity works or

10776
03:22:53,990 --> 03:22:54,000
it's a fact that relativity works or
 

10777
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:56,570
it's a fact that relativity works or
something not it's something you can

10778
03:22:56,570 --> 03:22:56,580
something not it's something you can
 

10779
03:22:56,580 --> 03:22:59,630
something not it's something you can
derive from some fundamental sort of it

10780
03:22:59,630 --> 03:22:59,640
derive from some fundamental sort of it
 

10781
03:22:59,640 --> 03:23:01,429
derive from some fundamental sort of it
has to be that way as a matter of kind

10782
03:23:01,429 --> 03:23:01,439
has to be that way as a matter of kind
 

10783
03:23:01,439 --> 03:23:03,349
has to be that way as a matter of kind
of of mathematics or logic or something

10784
03:23:03,349 --> 03:23:03,359
of of mathematics or logic or something
 

10785
03:23:03,359 --> 03:23:05,330
of of mathematics or logic or something
so it was sort of interesting to me that

10786
03:23:05,330 --> 03:23:05,340
so it was sort of interesting to me that
 

10787
03:23:05,340 --> 03:23:07,250
so it was sort of interesting to me that
there was a thing about physics that was

10788
03:23:07,250 --> 03:23:07,260
there was a thing about physics that was
 

10789
03:23:07,260 --> 03:23:10,070
there was a thing about physics that was
kind of inevitably true and derivable so

10790
03:23:10,070 --> 03:23:10,080
kind of inevitably true and derivable so
 

10791
03:23:10,080 --> 03:23:13,610
kind of inevitably true and derivable so
to speak and so I think that um so then

10792
03:23:13,610 --> 03:23:13,620
to speak and so I think that um so then
 

10793
03:23:13,620 --> 03:23:16,250
to speak and so I think that um so then
I was like this picture on this book and

10794
03:23:16,250 --> 03:23:16,260
I was like this picture on this book and
 

10795
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:18,229
I was like this picture on this book and
I was trying to understand it and so

10796
03:23:18,229 --> 03:23:18,239
I was trying to understand it and so
 

10797
03:23:18,239 --> 03:23:20,030
I was trying to understand it and so
that was actually the first serious

10798
03:23:20,030 --> 03:23:20,040
that was actually the first serious
 

10799
03:23:20,040 --> 03:23:22,309
that was actually the first serious
program that I wrote for a computer was

10800
03:23:22,309 --> 03:23:22,319
program that I wrote for a computer was
 

10801
03:23:22,319 --> 03:23:24,469
program that I wrote for a computer was
probably 1973

10802
03:23:24,469 --> 03:23:24,479
probably 1973
 

10803
03:23:24,479 --> 03:23:26,630
probably 1973
um written for this computer the size of

10804
03:23:26,630 --> 03:23:26,640
um written for this computer the size of
 

10805
03:23:26,640 --> 03:23:28,670
um written for this computer the size of
a desk program with paper tape and so on

10806
03:23:28,670 --> 03:23:28,680
a desk program with paper tape and so on
 

10807
03:23:28,680 --> 03:23:31,969
a desk program with paper tape and so on
and I tried to reproduce this picture on

10808
03:23:31,969 --> 03:23:31,979
and I tried to reproduce this picture on
 

10809
03:23:31,979 --> 03:23:34,610
and I tried to reproduce this picture on
the book and I didn't succeed what was

10810
03:23:34,610 --> 03:23:34,620
the book and I didn't succeed what was
 

10811
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:36,170
the book and I didn't succeed what was
the failure mode there like what do you

10812
03:23:36,170 --> 03:23:36,180
the failure mode there like what do you
 

10813
03:23:36,180 --> 03:23:37,550
the failure mode there like what do you
mean he didn't succeed so it's a bunch

10814
03:23:37,550 --> 03:23:37,560
mean he didn't succeed so it's a bunch
 

10815
03:23:37,560 --> 03:23:39,590
mean he didn't succeed so it's a bunch
of looked like it didn't look like okay

10816
03:23:39,590 --> 03:23:39,600
of looked like it didn't look like okay
 

10817
03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:41,210
of looked like it didn't look like okay
so what happened is

10818
03:23:41,210 --> 03:23:41,220
so what happened is
 

10819
03:23:41,220 --> 03:23:43,429
so what happened is
okay many years later I learned how the

10820
03:23:43,429 --> 03:23:43,439
okay many years later I learned how the
 

10821
03:23:43,439 --> 03:23:44,750
okay many years later I learned how the
picture on the book was actually made

10822
03:23:44,750 --> 03:23:44,760
picture on the book was actually made
 

10823
03:23:44,760 --> 03:23:46,610
picture on the book was actually made
and that it was actually kind of a fake

10824
03:23:46,610 --> 03:23:46,620
and that it was actually kind of a fake
 

10825
03:23:46,620 --> 03:23:49,550
and that it was actually kind of a fake
but I didn't know that at that time

10826
03:23:49,550 --> 03:23:49,560
but I didn't know that at that time
 

10827
03:23:49,560 --> 03:23:51,650
but I didn't know that at that time
um but uh and that picture was actually

10828
03:23:51,650 --> 03:23:51,660
um but uh and that picture was actually
 

10829
03:23:51,660 --> 03:23:53,750
um but uh and that picture was actually
a very high-tech thing when it was made

10830
03:23:53,750 --> 03:23:53,760
a very high-tech thing when it was made
 

10831
03:23:53,760 --> 03:23:55,969
a very high-tech thing when it was made
in the beginning of the 1960s was made

10832
03:23:55,969 --> 03:23:55,979
in the beginning of the 1960s was made
 

10833
03:23:55,979 --> 03:23:57,469
in the beginning of the 1960s was made
on the largest supercomputer that

10834
03:23:57,469 --> 03:23:57,479
on the largest supercomputer that
 

10835
03:23:57,479 --> 03:24:00,830
on the largest supercomputer that
existed at the time and uh even so it

10836
03:24:00,830 --> 03:24:00,840
existed at the time and uh even so it
 

10837
03:24:00,840 --> 03:24:02,450
existed at the time and uh even so it
couldn't quite simulate the thing that

10838
03:24:02,450 --> 03:24:02,460
couldn't quite simulate the thing that
 

10839
03:24:02,460 --> 03:24:04,370
couldn't quite simulate the thing that
it was supposed to be simulating but

10840
03:24:04,370 --> 03:24:04,380
it was supposed to be simulating but
 

10841
03:24:04,380 --> 03:24:05,630
it was supposed to be simulating but
anyway I didn't know that until many

10842
03:24:05,630 --> 03:24:05,640
anyway I didn't know that until many
 

10843
03:24:05,640 --> 03:24:09,170
anyway I didn't know that until many
many years later so at the time it was

10844
03:24:09,170 --> 03:24:09,180
many years later so at the time it was
 

10845
03:24:09,180 --> 03:24:10,490
many years later so at the time it was
like you have these balls bouncing

10846
03:24:10,490 --> 03:24:10,500
like you have these balls bouncing
 

10847
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:12,469
like you have these balls bouncing
around in this box but I was using this

10848
03:24:12,469 --> 03:24:12,479
around in this box but I was using this
 

10849
03:24:12,479 --> 03:24:14,330
around in this box but I was using this
computer with eight kilowatts of memory

10850
03:24:14,330 --> 03:24:14,340
computer with eight kilowatts of memory
 

10851
03:24:14,340 --> 03:24:16,610
computer with eight kilowatts of memory
there were 18 bit words of memory words

10852
03:24:16,610 --> 03:24:16,620
there were 18 bit words of memory words
 

10853
03:24:16,620 --> 03:24:20,389
there were 18 bit words of memory words
okay so it was um whatever 24 kilobytes

10854
03:24:20,389 --> 03:24:20,399
okay so it was um whatever 24 kilobytes
 

10855
03:24:20,399 --> 03:24:21,590
okay so it was um whatever 24 kilobytes
of memory

10856
03:24:21,590 --> 03:24:21,600
of memory
 

10857
03:24:21,600 --> 03:24:23,750
of memory
um and it had you know it had these

10858
03:24:23,750 --> 03:24:23,760
um and it had you know it had these
 

10859
03:24:23,760 --> 03:24:25,190
um and it had you know it had these
instructions I probably still remember

10860
03:24:25,190 --> 03:24:25,200
instructions I probably still remember
 

10861
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:27,650
instructions I probably still remember
all of its machine instructions

10862
03:24:27,650 --> 03:24:27,660
all of its machine instructions
 

10863
03:24:27,660 --> 03:24:29,929
all of its machine instructions
um and it didn't really like dealing

10864
03:24:29,929 --> 03:24:29,939
um and it didn't really like dealing
 

10865
03:24:29,939 --> 03:24:31,250
um and it didn't really like dealing
with floating Point numbers or anything

10866
03:24:31,250 --> 03:24:31,260
with floating Point numbers or anything
 

10867
03:24:31,260 --> 03:24:33,710
with floating Point numbers or anything
like that and so I had to simplify this

10868
03:24:33,710 --> 03:24:33,720
like that and so I had to simplify this
 

10869
03:24:33,720 --> 03:24:35,690
like that and so I had to simplify this
this model of of you know particles

10870
03:24:35,690 --> 03:24:35,700
this model of of you know particles
 

10871
03:24:35,700 --> 03:24:37,610
this model of of you know particles
bouncing around a box and so I thought

10872
03:24:37,610 --> 03:24:37,620
bouncing around a box and so I thought
 

10873
03:24:37,620 --> 03:24:39,830
bouncing around a box and so I thought
well I'll put them on a grid and I'll

10874
03:24:39,830 --> 03:24:39,840
well I'll put them on a grid and I'll
 

10875
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:42,349
well I'll put them on a grid and I'll
make you know make the things just sort

10876
03:24:42,349 --> 03:24:42,359
make you know make the things just sort
 

10877
03:24:42,359 --> 03:24:44,330
make you know make the things just sort
of move one square at a time and so on

10878
03:24:44,330 --> 03:24:44,340
of move one square at a time and so on
 

10879
03:24:44,340 --> 03:24:48,050
of move one square at a time and so on
and so I did the simulation and the

10880
03:24:48,050 --> 03:24:48,060
and so I did the simulation and the
 

10881
03:24:48,060 --> 03:24:50,150
and so I did the simulation and the
result was it didn't look anything like

10882
03:24:50,150 --> 03:24:50,160
result was it didn't look anything like
 

10883
03:24:50,160 --> 03:24:53,809
result was it didn't look anything like
the actual pictures on the book now many

10884
03:24:53,809 --> 03:24:53,819
the actual pictures on the book now many
 

10885
03:24:53,819 --> 03:24:56,690
the actual pictures on the book now many
years later in fact very recently I

10886
03:24:56,690 --> 03:24:56,700
years later in fact very recently I
 

10887
03:24:56,700 --> 03:24:59,150
years later in fact very recently I
realized that the thing I'd simulated

10888
03:24:59,150 --> 03:24:59,160
realized that the thing I'd simulated
 

10889
03:24:59,160 --> 03:25:01,969
realized that the thing I'd simulated
was actually an example of a whole sort

10890
03:25:01,969 --> 03:25:01,979
was actually an example of a whole sort
 

10891
03:25:01,979 --> 03:25:03,830
was actually an example of a whole sort
of computational irreducibility story

10892
03:25:03,830 --> 03:25:03,840
of computational irreducibility story
 

10893
03:25:03,840 --> 03:25:06,410
of computational irreducibility story
that I absolutely did not recognize at

10894
03:25:06,410 --> 03:25:06,420
that I absolutely did not recognize at
 

10895
03:25:06,420 --> 03:25:07,910
that I absolutely did not recognize at
the time at the time it just looked like

10896
03:25:07,910 --> 03:25:07,920
the time at the time it just looked like
 

10897
03:25:07,920 --> 03:25:10,010
the time at the time it just looked like
it did something random and it looks

10898
03:25:10,010 --> 03:25:10,020
it did something random and it looks
 

10899
03:25:10,020 --> 03:25:12,410
it did something random and it looks
wrong as opposed to it did something

10900
03:25:12,410 --> 03:25:12,420
wrong as opposed to it did something
 

10901
03:25:12,420 --> 03:25:13,969
wrong as opposed to it did something
random and it's super interesting that

10902
03:25:13,969 --> 03:25:13,979
random and it's super interesting that
 

10903
03:25:13,979 --> 03:25:15,349
random and it's super interesting that
it's random

10904
03:25:15,349 --> 03:25:15,359
it's random
 

10905
03:25:15,359 --> 03:25:17,150
it's random
um but I didn't recognize that at the

10906
03:25:17,150 --> 03:25:17,160
um but I didn't recognize that at the
 

10907
03:25:17,160 --> 03:25:19,729
um but I didn't recognize that at the
time and so as it was at the time I kind

10908
03:25:19,729 --> 03:25:19,739
time and so as it was at the time I kind
 

10909
03:25:19,739 --> 03:25:21,349
time and so as it was at the time I kind
of I got interested in particle physics

10910
03:25:21,349 --> 03:25:21,359
of I got interested in particle physics
 

10911
03:25:21,359 --> 03:25:24,170
of I got interested in particle physics
and I got interested in in other kinds

10912
03:25:24,170 --> 03:25:24,180
and I got interested in in other kinds
 

10913
03:25:24,180 --> 03:25:26,269
and I got interested in in other kinds
of physics and but this whole second

10914
03:25:26,269 --> 03:25:26,279
of physics and but this whole second
 

10915
03:25:26,279 --> 03:25:28,370
of physics and but this whole second
order of the Dynamics thing this idea

10916
03:25:28,370 --> 03:25:28,380
order of the Dynamics thing this idea
 

10917
03:25:28,380 --> 03:25:30,170
order of the Dynamics thing this idea
that sort of orderly things tend to

10918
03:25:30,170 --> 03:25:30,180
that sort of orderly things tend to
 

10919
03:25:30,180 --> 03:25:32,870
that sort of orderly things tend to
degrade into disorder continued to be

10920
03:25:32,870 --> 03:25:32,880
degrade into disorder continued to be
 

10921
03:25:32,880 --> 03:25:34,670
degrade into disorder continued to be
something I was really interested in and

10922
03:25:34,670 --> 03:25:34,680
something I was really interested in and
 

10923
03:25:34,680 --> 03:25:36,110
something I was really interested in and
I was really curious for the whole

10924
03:25:36,110 --> 03:25:36,120
I was really curious for the whole
 

10925
03:25:36,120 --> 03:25:38,870
I was really curious for the whole
universe why doesn't that happen all the

10926
03:25:38,870 --> 03:25:38,880
universe why doesn't that happen all the
 

10927
03:25:38,880 --> 03:25:41,330
universe why doesn't that happen all the
time like we start off at the in the Big

10928
03:25:41,330 --> 03:25:41,340
time like we start off at the in the Big
 

10929
03:25:41,340 --> 03:25:42,710
time like we start off at the in the Big
Bang at the beginning of the universe

10930
03:25:42,710 --> 03:25:42,720
Bang at the beginning of the universe
 

10931
03:25:42,720 --> 03:25:44,450
Bang at the beginning of the universe
was this thing that seems like it's this

10932
03:25:44,450 --> 03:25:44,460
was this thing that seems like it's this
 

10933
03:25:44,460 --> 03:25:46,790
was this thing that seems like it's this
very disordered collection of of stuff

10934
03:25:46,790 --> 03:25:46,800
very disordered collection of of stuff
 

10935
03:25:46,800 --> 03:25:49,490
very disordered collection of of stuff
and then it spontaneously forms itself

10936
03:25:49,490 --> 03:25:49,500
and then it spontaneously forms itself
 

10937
03:25:49,500 --> 03:25:52,910
and then it spontaneously forms itself
into galaxies and creates all of this

10938
03:25:52,910 --> 03:25:52,920
into galaxies and creates all of this
 

10939
03:25:52,920 --> 03:25:55,370
into galaxies and creates all of this
complexity and order in the universe and

10940
03:25:55,370 --> 03:25:55,380
complexity and order in the universe and
 

10941
03:25:55,380 --> 03:25:56,870
complexity and order in the universe and
so I was very curious how that happens

10942
03:25:56,870 --> 03:25:56,880
so I was very curious how that happens
 

10943
03:25:56,880 --> 03:25:59,510
so I was very curious how that happens
and I but I was always kind of thinking

10944
03:25:59,510 --> 03:25:59,520
and I but I was always kind of thinking
 

10945
03:25:59,520 --> 03:26:02,090
and I but I was always kind of thinking
this is kind of somehow the second order

10946
03:26:02,090 --> 03:26:02,100
this is kind of somehow the second order
 

10947
03:26:02,100 --> 03:26:04,550
this is kind of somehow the second order
of thermodynamics is behind it trying to

10948
03:26:04,550 --> 03:26:04,560
of thermodynamics is behind it trying to
 

10949
03:26:04,560 --> 03:26:06,710
of thermodynamics is behind it trying to
sort of pull things back into disorder

10950
03:26:06,710 --> 03:26:06,720
sort of pull things back into disorder
 

10951
03:26:06,720 --> 03:26:09,530
sort of pull things back into disorder
so to speak and how was order being

10952
03:26:09,530 --> 03:26:09,540
so to speak and how was order being
 

10953
03:26:09,540 --> 03:26:11,809
so to speak and how was order being
created and so actually I was was

10954
03:26:11,809 --> 03:26:11,819
created and so actually I was was
 

10955
03:26:11,819 --> 03:26:15,170
created and so actually I was was
interested this is probably now 1980 I

10956
03:26:15,170 --> 03:26:15,180
interested this is probably now 1980 I
 

10957
03:26:15,180 --> 03:26:17,030
interested this is probably now 1980 I
got interested in kind of this you know

10958
03:26:17,030 --> 03:26:17,040
got interested in kind of this you know
 

10959
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:18,650
got interested in kind of this you know
Galaxy formation and so on in the

10960
03:26:18,650 --> 03:26:18,660
Galaxy formation and so on in the
 

10961
03:26:18,660 --> 03:26:20,450
Galaxy formation and so on in the
universe I also at that time was

10962
03:26:20,450 --> 03:26:20,460
universe I also at that time was
 

10963
03:26:20,460 --> 03:26:22,670
universe I also at that time was
interested in neural networks and I was

10964
03:26:22,670 --> 03:26:22,680
interested in neural networks and I was
 

10965
03:26:22,680 --> 03:26:25,250
interested in neural networks and I was
interested in kind of how how brains

10966
03:26:25,250 --> 03:26:25,260
interested in kind of how how brains
 

10967
03:26:25,260 --> 03:26:27,590
interested in kind of how how brains
make complicated things happen and so on

10968
03:26:27,590 --> 03:26:27,600
make complicated things happen and so on
 

10969
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:29,809
make complicated things happen and so on
okay what's the connection between the

10970
03:26:29,809 --> 03:26:29,819
okay what's the connection between the
 

10971
03:26:29,819 --> 03:26:32,269
okay what's the connection between the
formation of galaxies and how brains

10972
03:26:32,269 --> 03:26:32,279
formation of galaxies and how brains
 

10973
03:26:32,279 --> 03:26:33,830
formation of galaxies and how brains
make complicated things happen because

10974
03:26:33,830 --> 03:26:33,840
make complicated things happen because
 

10975
03:26:33,840 --> 03:26:35,450
make complicated things happen because
they're both a matter of how complicated

10976
03:26:35,450 --> 03:26:35,460
they're both a matter of how complicated
 

10977
03:26:35,460 --> 03:26:37,130
they're both a matter of how complicated
things come to happen

10978
03:26:37,130 --> 03:26:37,140
things come to happen
 

10979
03:26:37,140 --> 03:26:40,790
things come to happen
from simple Origins yeah from some sort

10980
03:26:40,790 --> 03:26:40,800
from simple Origins yeah from some sort
 

10981
03:26:40,800 --> 03:26:43,610
from simple Origins yeah from some sort
of known Origins I had the sense that

10982
03:26:43,610 --> 03:26:43,620
of known Origins I had the sense that
 

10983
03:26:43,620 --> 03:26:46,670
of known Origins I had the sense that
that what I was interested in was kind

10984
03:26:46,670 --> 03:26:46,680
that what I was interested in was kind
 

10985
03:26:46,680 --> 03:26:48,530
that what I was interested in was kind
of in all these different this sort of

10986
03:26:48,530 --> 03:26:48,540
of in all these different this sort of
 

10987
03:26:48,540 --> 03:26:51,229
of in all these different this sort of
different cases of where complicated

10988
03:26:51,229 --> 03:26:51,239
different cases of where complicated
 

10989
03:26:51,239 --> 03:26:54,650
different cases of where complicated
things were arising from rules and you

10990
03:26:54,650 --> 03:26:54,660
things were arising from rules and you
 

10991
03:26:54,660 --> 03:26:56,269
things were arising from rules and you
know I also looked at snowflakes and

10992
03:26:56,269 --> 03:26:56,279
know I also looked at snowflakes and
 

10993
03:26:56,279 --> 03:26:57,830
know I also looked at snowflakes and
things like that

10994
03:26:57,830 --> 03:26:57,840
things like that
 

10995
03:26:57,840 --> 03:27:00,170
things like that
um I was curious and fluid dynamics in

10996
03:27:00,170 --> 03:27:00,180
um I was curious and fluid dynamics in
 

10997
03:27:00,180 --> 03:27:02,210
um I was curious and fluid dynamics in
general I was just sort of curious about

10998
03:27:02,210 --> 03:27:02,220
general I was just sort of curious about
 

10999
03:27:02,220 --> 03:27:04,610
general I was just sort of curious about
how does complexity arise and the the

11000
03:27:04,610 --> 03:27:04,620
how does complexity arise and the the
 

11001
03:27:04,620 --> 03:27:07,490
how does complexity arise and the the
thing that I didn't you know it took me

11002
03:27:07,490 --> 03:27:07,500
thing that I didn't you know it took me
 

11003
03:27:07,500 --> 03:27:10,010
thing that I didn't you know it took me
a while to kind of realize that there

11004
03:27:10,010 --> 03:27:10,020
a while to kind of realize that there
 

11005
03:27:10,020 --> 03:27:11,690
a while to kind of realize that there
might be a general phenomenon you know I

11006
03:27:11,690 --> 03:27:11,700
might be a general phenomenon you know I
 

11007
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:13,550
might be a general phenomenon you know I
sort of assumed oh there's galaxies over

11008
03:27:13,550 --> 03:27:13,560
sort of assumed oh there's galaxies over
 

11009
03:27:13,560 --> 03:27:15,769
sort of assumed oh there's galaxies over
here there's brains over here that

11010
03:27:15,769 --> 03:27:15,779
here there's brains over here that
 

11011
03:27:15,779 --> 03:27:17,090
here there's brains over here that
they're very different kinds of things

11012
03:27:17,090 --> 03:27:17,100
they're very different kinds of things
 

11013
03:27:17,100 --> 03:27:19,250
they're very different kinds of things
and so what happened this is probably

11014
03:27:19,250 --> 03:27:19,260
and so what happened this is probably
 

11015
03:27:19,260 --> 03:27:22,490
and so what happened this is probably
1981 or so I decided okay I'm I'm going

11016
03:27:22,490 --> 03:27:22,500
1981 or so I decided okay I'm I'm going
 

11017
03:27:22,500 --> 03:27:25,490
1981 or so I decided okay I'm I'm going
to try and make the minimal model of how

11018
03:27:25,490 --> 03:27:25,500
to try and make the minimal model of how
 

11019
03:27:25,500 --> 03:27:27,650
to try and make the minimal model of how
these things work yes it was sort of an

11020
03:27:27,650 --> 03:27:27,660
these things work yes it was sort of an
 

11021
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:29,389
these things work yes it was sort of an
interesting experience because I had

11022
03:27:29,389 --> 03:27:29,399
interesting experience because I had
 

11023
03:27:29,399 --> 03:27:32,570
interesting experience because I had
built starting in 1979 I built my first

11024
03:27:32,570 --> 03:27:32,580
built starting in 1979 I built my first
 

11025
03:27:32,580 --> 03:27:35,090
built starting in 1979 I built my first
big computer system to think called SMP

11026
03:27:35,090 --> 03:27:35,100
big computer system to think called SMP
 

11027
03:27:35,100 --> 03:27:36,889
big computer system to think called SMP
symbolic manipulation program it's kind

11028
03:27:36,889 --> 03:27:36,899
symbolic manipulation program it's kind
 

11029
03:27:36,899 --> 03:27:38,570
symbolic manipulation program it's kind
of Runner of modern morpheme language

11030
03:27:38,570 --> 03:27:38,580
of Runner of modern morpheme language
 

11031
03:27:38,580 --> 03:27:40,670
of Runner of modern morpheme language
with many of the same ideas about

11032
03:27:40,670 --> 03:27:40,680
with many of the same ideas about
 

11033
03:27:40,680 --> 03:27:42,889
with many of the same ideas about
symbolic computation and so on

11034
03:27:42,889 --> 03:27:42,899
symbolic computation and so on
 

11035
03:27:42,899 --> 03:27:45,170
symbolic computation and so on
um but the thing that was very important

11036
03:27:45,170 --> 03:27:45,180
um but the thing that was very important
 

11037
03:27:45,180 --> 03:27:47,330
um but the thing that was very important
to me about that was you know in

11038
03:27:47,330 --> 03:27:47,340
to me about that was you know in
 

11039
03:27:47,340 --> 03:27:49,370
to me about that was you know in
building that language I'd basically

11040
03:27:49,370 --> 03:27:49,380
building that language I'd basically
 

11041
03:27:49,380 --> 03:27:50,929
building that language I'd basically
tried to figure out what were the sort

11042
03:27:50,929 --> 03:27:50,939
tried to figure out what were the sort
 

11043
03:27:50,939 --> 03:27:52,670
tried to figure out what were the sort
of what were the relevant computational

11044
03:27:52,670 --> 03:27:52,680
of what were the relevant computational
 

11045
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:55,429
of what were the relevant computational
Primitives which have turned out to stay

11046
03:27:55,429 --> 03:27:55,439
Primitives which have turned out to stay
 

11047
03:27:55,439 --> 03:27:58,250
Primitives which have turned out to stay
with me for the last 40 something years

11048
03:27:58,250 --> 03:27:58,260
with me for the last 40 something years
 

11049
03:27:58,260 --> 03:28:01,309
with me for the last 40 something years
but it was also important because in

11050
03:28:01,309 --> 03:28:01,319
but it was also important because in
 

11051
03:28:01,319 --> 03:28:02,450
but it was also important because in
building a language was very different

11052
03:28:02,450 --> 03:28:02,460
building a language was very different
 

11053
03:28:02,460 --> 03:28:04,250
building a language was very different
activity from natural science which is

11054
03:28:04,250 --> 03:28:04,260
activity from natural science which is
 

11055
03:28:04,260 --> 03:28:05,750
activity from natural science which is
what I've mostly done before because in

11056
03:28:05,750 --> 03:28:05,760
what I've mostly done before because in
 

11057
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:07,729
what I've mostly done before because in
Natural Science you start from the

11058
03:28:07,729 --> 03:28:07,739
Natural Science you start from the
 

11059
03:28:07,739 --> 03:28:09,710
Natural Science you start from the
phenomena of the world and you try and

11060
03:28:09,710 --> 03:28:09,720
phenomena of the world and you try and
 

11061
03:28:09,720 --> 03:28:11,330
phenomena of the world and you try and
figure out so how can I make sense of

11062
03:28:11,330 --> 03:28:11,340
figure out so how can I make sense of
 

11063
03:28:11,340 --> 03:28:12,830
figure out so how can I make sense of
the phenomena of the world

11064
03:28:12,830 --> 03:28:12,840
the phenomena of the world
 

11065
03:28:12,840 --> 03:28:15,349
the phenomena of the world
and you know kind of the world presents

11066
03:28:15,349 --> 03:28:15,359
and you know kind of the world presents
 

11067
03:28:15,359 --> 03:28:17,510
and you know kind of the world presents
you with what it has to offer so to

11068
03:28:17,510 --> 03:28:17,520
you with what it has to offer so to
 

11069
03:28:17,520 --> 03:28:18,950
you with what it has to offer so to
speak and you have to make sense of it

11070
03:28:18,950 --> 03:28:18,960
speak and you have to make sense of it
 

11071
03:28:18,960 --> 03:28:22,849
speak and you have to make sense of it
when you build a a you know computer

11072
03:28:22,849 --> 03:28:22,859
when you build a a you know computer
 

11073
03:28:22,859 --> 03:28:25,429
when you build a a you know computer
language or something you are creating

11074
03:28:25,429 --> 03:28:25,439
language or something you are creating
 

11075
03:28:25,439 --> 03:28:27,050
language or something you are creating
your own Primitives and then you say

11076
03:28:27,050 --> 03:28:27,060
your own Primitives and then you say
 

11077
03:28:27,060 --> 03:28:28,550
your own Primitives and then you say
come so what can you make from these

11078
03:28:28,550 --> 03:28:28,560
come so what can you make from these
 

11079
03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:30,290
come so what can you make from these
sort of the opposite way around from

11080
03:28:30,290 --> 03:28:30,300
sort of the opposite way around from
 

11081
03:28:30,300 --> 03:28:32,269
sort of the opposite way around from
what you do in Natural Science but I'd

11082
03:28:32,269 --> 03:28:32,279
what you do in Natural Science but I'd
 

11083
03:28:32,279 --> 03:28:34,190
what you do in Natural Science but I'd
had the experience of doing that and so

11084
03:28:34,190 --> 03:28:34,200
had the experience of doing that and so
 

11085
03:28:34,200 --> 03:28:36,229
had the experience of doing that and so
I was kind of like okay what happens if

11086
03:28:36,229 --> 03:28:36,239
I was kind of like okay what happens if
 

11087
03:28:36,239 --> 03:28:37,849
I was kind of like okay what happens if
you sort of make an artificial physics

11088
03:28:37,849 --> 03:28:37,859
you sort of make an artificial physics
 

11089
03:28:37,859 --> 03:28:40,070
you sort of make an artificial physics
what happens if you just make up the

11090
03:28:40,070 --> 03:28:40,080
what happens if you just make up the
 

11091
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:42,410
what happens if you just make up the
rules by which systems operate and then

11092
03:28:42,410 --> 03:28:42,420
rules by which systems operate and then
 

11093
03:28:42,420 --> 03:28:44,030
rules by which systems operate and then
I was thinking you know for all these

11094
03:28:44,030 --> 03:28:44,040
I was thinking you know for all these
 

11095
03:28:44,040 --> 03:28:45,170
I was thinking you know for all these
different systems whether it was

11096
03:28:45,170 --> 03:28:45,180
different systems whether it was
 

11097
03:28:45,180 --> 03:28:47,510
different systems whether it was
galaxies or brains or whatever what's

11098
03:28:47,510 --> 03:28:47,520
galaxies or brains or whatever what's
 

11099
03:28:47,520 --> 03:28:49,849
galaxies or brains or whatever what's
the absolutely minimal model that kind

11100
03:28:49,849 --> 03:28:49,859
the absolutely minimal model that kind
 

11101
03:28:49,859 --> 03:28:51,889
the absolutely minimal model that kind
of captures the things that are

11102
03:28:51,889 --> 03:28:51,899
of captures the things that are
 

11103
03:28:51,899 --> 03:28:53,389
of captures the things that are
important about those systems The

11104
03:28:53,389 --> 03:28:53,399
important about those systems The
 

11105
03:28:53,399 --> 03:28:55,010
important about those systems The
computational Primitives of that system

11106
03:28:55,010 --> 03:28:55,020
computational Primitives of that system
 

11107
03:28:55,020 --> 03:28:58,130
computational Primitives of that system
yes and so that's what ended up with the

11108
03:28:58,130 --> 03:28:58,140
yes and so that's what ended up with the
 

11109
03:28:58,140 --> 03:29:00,590
yes and so that's what ended up with the
cellular automata where you just have a

11110
03:29:00,590 --> 03:29:00,600
cellular automata where you just have a
 

11111
03:29:00,600 --> 03:29:02,330
cellular automata where you just have a
line of black and white cells you just

11112
03:29:02,330 --> 03:29:02,340
line of black and white cells you just
 

11113
03:29:02,340 --> 03:29:04,969
line of black and white cells you just
have a rule that says you know given a

11114
03:29:04,969 --> 03:29:04,979
have a rule that says you know given a
 

11115
03:29:04,979 --> 03:29:06,469
have a rule that says you know given a
cell and its neighbors what will the

11116
03:29:06,469 --> 03:29:06,479
cell and its neighbors what will the
 

11117
03:29:06,479 --> 03:29:07,849
cell and its neighbors what will the
color of the cell be on the next step

11118
03:29:07,849 --> 03:29:07,859
color of the cell be on the next step
 

11119
03:29:07,859 --> 03:29:09,710
color of the cell be on the next step
and you just run it in a series of steps

11120
03:29:09,710 --> 03:29:09,720
and you just run it in a series of steps
 

11121
03:29:09,720 --> 03:29:12,769
and you just run it in a series of steps
and the sort of the ironic thing is that

11122
03:29:12,769 --> 03:29:12,779
and the sort of the ironic thing is that
 

11123
03:29:12,779 --> 03:29:14,809
and the sort of the ironic thing is that
seller automata are great models for

11124
03:29:14,809 --> 03:29:14,819
seller automata are great models for
 

11125
03:29:14,819 --> 03:29:18,170
seller automata are great models for
many kinds of things but galaxies and

11126
03:29:18,170 --> 03:29:18,180
many kinds of things but galaxies and
 

11127
03:29:18,180 --> 03:29:20,630
many kinds of things but galaxies and
brains are two examples where they do

11128
03:29:20,630 --> 03:29:20,640
brains are two examples where they do
 

11129
03:29:20,640 --> 03:29:21,889
brains are two examples where they do
very very badly they're really

11130
03:29:21,889 --> 03:29:21,899
very very badly they're really
 

11131
03:29:21,899 --> 03:29:23,450
very very badly they're really
irrelevant to those two is there a

11132
03:29:23,450 --> 03:29:23,460
irrelevant to those two is there a
 

11133
03:29:23,460 --> 03:29:24,590
irrelevant to those two is there a
connection to the second law of

yes so the things you the things you've
 

11139
03:29:29,160 --> 03:29:31,250
yes so the things you the things you've
discovered About Cellular automata yes

11140
03:29:31,250 --> 03:29:31,260
discovered About Cellular automata yes
 

11141
03:29:31,260 --> 03:29:33,229
discovered About Cellular automata yes
okay so when I first started selling

11142
03:29:33,229 --> 03:29:33,239
okay so when I first started selling
 

11143
03:29:33,239 --> 03:29:35,150
okay so when I first started selling
salad automata my first papers about

11144
03:29:35,150 --> 03:29:35,160
salad automata my first papers about
 

11145
03:29:35,160 --> 03:29:37,550
salad automata my first papers about
them were you know the first sentence

11146
03:29:37,550 --> 03:29:37,560
them were you know the first sentence
 

11147
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:38,690
them were you know the first sentence
was always about the second row of

11148
03:29:38,690 --> 03:29:38,700
was always about the second row of
 

11149
03:29:38,700 --> 03:29:41,450
was always about the second row of
thermodynamics it was always about how

11150
03:29:41,450 --> 03:29:41,460
thermodynamics it was always about how
 

11151
03:29:41,460 --> 03:29:43,610

does order manage to be produced even
 

11153
03:29:43,620 --> 03:29:45,050
does order manage to be produced even
though there's a second row of

03:29:45,050 --> 03:29:45,060
though there's a second row of
 

11155
03:29:45,060 --> 03:29:46,370
though there's a second row of

03:29:46,370 --> 03:29:46,380
thermodynamics which tries to pull
 

11157
03:29:46,380 --> 03:29:48,710
thermodynamics which tries to pull
things back into disorder and I kind of

11158
03:29:48,710 --> 03:29:48,720
things back into disorder and I kind of
 

11159
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:50,750
things back into disorder and I kind of
my early understanding of that had to do

11160
03:29:50,750 --> 03:29:50,760
my early understanding of that had to do
 

11161
03:29:50,760 --> 03:29:53,030
my early understanding of that had to do
with these are intrinsically

11162
03:29:53,030 --> 03:29:53,040
with these are intrinsically
 

11163
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:55,309
with these are intrinsically
irreversible processes in cellular

11164
03:29:55,309 --> 03:29:55,319
irreversible processes in cellular
 

11165
03:29:55,319 --> 03:29:58,370
irreversible processes in cellular
automata that that form uh it's kind of

11166
03:29:58,370 --> 03:29:58,380
automata that that form uh it's kind of
 

11167
03:29:58,380 --> 03:29:59,990
automata that that form uh it's kind of
conform orderly structures even from

03:29:59,990 --> 03:30:00,000
conform orderly structures even from
 

11169
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:02,330
conform orderly structures even from
random initial conditions but then what

11170
03:30:02,330 --> 03:30:02,340
random initial conditions but then what
 

11171
03:30:02,340 --> 03:30:04,490
random initial conditions but then what
I realized this was uh well actually

11172
03:30:04,490 --> 03:30:04,500
I realized this was uh well actually
 

11173
03:30:04,500 --> 03:30:07,370
I realized this was uh well actually
it's it's one of these things where it

11174
03:30:07,370 --> 03:30:07,380
it's it's one of these things where it
 

11175
03:30:07,380 --> 03:30:09,349
it's it's one of these things where it
was a discovery that I should have made

11176
03:30:09,349 --> 03:30:09,359
was a discovery that I should have made
 

11177
03:30:09,359 --> 03:30:11,510
was a discovery that I should have made
earlier but didn't so you know I had

11178
03:30:11,510 --> 03:30:11,520
earlier but didn't so you know I had
 

11179
03:30:11,520 --> 03:30:13,550
earlier but didn't so you know I had
I've been studying so a little automata

11180
03:30:13,550 --> 03:30:13,560
I've been studying so a little automata
 

11181
03:30:13,560 --> 03:30:15,530
I've been studying so a little automata
what I did was the sort of most obvious

11182
03:30:15,530 --> 03:30:15,540
what I did was the sort of most obvious
 

11183
03:30:15,540 --> 03:30:17,510
what I did was the sort of most obvious
computer experiment you just try all the

11184
03:30:17,510 --> 03:30:17,520
computer experiment you just try all the
 

11185
03:30:17,520 --> 03:30:18,769
computer experiment you just try all the
different rules and see what they do

11186
03:30:18,769 --> 03:30:18,779
different rules and see what they do
 

11187
03:30:18,779 --> 03:30:20,630
different rules and see what they do
it's kind of like you know you've

11188
03:30:20,630 --> 03:30:20,640
it's kind of like you know you've
 

11189
03:30:20,640 --> 03:30:22,370
it's kind of like you know you've
invented a computational telescope you

11190
03:30:22,370 --> 03:30:22,380
invented a computational telescope you
 

11191
03:30:22,380 --> 03:30:23,870
invented a computational telescope you
just pointed at the most obvious thing

11192
03:30:23,870 --> 03:30:23,880
just pointed at the most obvious thing
 

11193
03:30:23,880 --> 03:30:25,969
just pointed at the most obvious thing
in the sky and then you just see what's

11194
03:30:25,969 --> 03:30:25,979
in the sky and then you just see what's
 

11195
03:30:25,979 --> 03:30:28,190
in the sky and then you just see what's
there and so I did that and I you know I

11196
03:30:28,190 --> 03:30:28,200
there and so I did that and I you know I
 

11197
03:30:28,200 --> 03:30:30,050
there and so I did that and I you know I
was making all these pictures of of how

11198
03:30:30,050 --> 03:30:30,060
was making all these pictures of of how
 

11199
03:30:30,060 --> 03:30:32,809
was making all these pictures of of how
cellular automata work and and I studied

11200
03:30:32,809 --> 03:30:32,819
cellular automata work and and I studied
 

11201
03:30:32,819 --> 03:30:34,370
cellular automata work and and I studied
these pictures I started in great detail

11202
03:30:34,370 --> 03:30:34,380
these pictures I started in great detail
 

11203
03:30:34,380 --> 03:30:36,590
these pictures I started in great detail
There Was You Can number the rules for

11204
03:30:36,590 --> 03:30:36,600
There Was You Can number the rules for
 

11205
03:30:36,600 --> 03:30:38,929
There Was You Can number the rules for
cellular automata and one of them is you

11206
03:30:38,929 --> 03:30:38,939
cellular automata and one of them is you
 

11207
03:30:38,939 --> 03:30:41,030
cellular automata and one of them is you
know rule 30. so I made a picture of

11208
03:30:41,030 --> 03:30:41,040
know rule 30. so I made a picture of
 

11209
03:30:41,040 --> 03:30:45,170
know rule 30. so I made a picture of
rule 30 back in 1981 or so and Rule 30

11210
03:30:45,170 --> 03:30:45,180
rule 30 back in 1981 or so and Rule 30
 

11211
03:30:45,180 --> 03:30:48,229
rule 30 back in 1981 or so and Rule 30
well it's and at the time I was just

11212
03:30:48,229 --> 03:30:48,239
well it's and at the time I was just
 

11213
03:30:48,239 --> 03:30:49,610
well it's and at the time I was just
like okay it's another one of these

11214
03:30:49,610 --> 03:30:49,620
like okay it's another one of these
 

11215
03:30:49,620 --> 03:30:51,530
like okay it's another one of these
rules I don't really it happens to be

11216
03:30:51,530 --> 03:30:51,540
rules I don't really it happens to be
 

11217
03:30:51,540 --> 03:30:53,870
rules I don't really it happens to be
asymmetric Left Right asymmetric and

11218
03:30:53,870 --> 03:30:53,880
asymmetric Left Right asymmetric and
 

11219
03:30:53,880 --> 03:30:55,190
asymmetric Left Right asymmetric and
it's like let me just consider the case

11220
03:30:55,190 --> 03:30:55,200
it's like let me just consider the case
 

11221
03:30:55,200 --> 03:30:57,110
it's like let me just consider the case
of the symmetric ones just to keep

11222
03:30:57,110 --> 03:30:57,120
of the symmetric ones just to keep
 

11223
03:30:57,120 --> 03:30:58,429
of the symmetric ones just to keep
things simpler

11224
03:30:58,429 --> 03:30:58,439
things simpler
 

11225
03:30:58,439 --> 03:30:59,630
things simpler
et cetera et cetera et cetera and I just

11226
03:30:59,630 --> 03:30:59,640
et cetera et cetera et cetera and I just
 

11227
03:30:59,640 --> 03:31:02,269
et cetera et cetera et cetera and I just
kind of ignored it yeah and then

11228
03:31:02,269 --> 03:31:02,279
kind of ignored it yeah and then
 

11229
03:31:02,279 --> 03:31:04,510
kind of ignored it yeah and then
sort of in and actually in 1984

11230
03:31:04,510 --> 03:31:04,520
sort of in and actually in 1984
 

11231
03:31:04,520 --> 03:31:08,870
sort of in and actually in 1984
strangely enough I ended up having a an

11232
03:31:08,870 --> 03:31:08,880
strangely enough I ended up having a an
 

11233
03:31:08,880 --> 03:31:11,570
strangely enough I ended up having a an
early laser printer which made very high

11234
03:31:11,570 --> 03:31:11,580
early laser printer which made very high
 

11235
03:31:11,580 --> 03:31:12,950
early laser printer which made very high
resolution pictures and I thought I'm

11236
03:31:12,950 --> 03:31:12,960
resolution pictures and I thought I'm
 

11237
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:14,389
resolution pictures and I thought I'm
going to print out an interesting you

11238
03:31:14,389 --> 03:31:14,399
going to print out an interesting you
 

11239
03:31:14,399 --> 03:31:15,590
going to print out an interesting you
know I want to make an interesting

11240
03:31:15,590 --> 03:31:15,600
know I want to make an interesting
 

11241
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:18,110
know I want to make an interesting
picture let me take this rule 30 thing

11242
03:31:18,110 --> 03:31:18,120
picture let me take this rule 30 thing
 

11243
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:19,610
picture let me take this rule 30 thing
and just make a high resolution picture

11244
03:31:19,610 --> 03:31:19,620
and just make a high resolution picture
 

11245
03:31:19,620 --> 03:31:22,429
and just make a high resolution picture
of it I did and it's it has this very

11246
03:31:22,429 --> 03:31:22,439
of it I did and it's it has this very
 

11247
03:31:22,439 --> 03:31:23,990
of it I did and it's it has this very
remarkable property that it's rule is

11248
03:31:23,990 --> 03:31:24,000
remarkable property that it's rule is
 

11249
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:26,030
remarkable property that it's rule is
very simple you started off just from

11250
03:31:26,030 --> 03:31:26,040
very simple you started off just from
 

11251
03:31:26,040 --> 03:31:28,250
very simple you started off just from
one black cell at the top and it makes

11252
03:31:28,250 --> 03:31:28,260
one black cell at the top and it makes
 

11253
03:31:28,260 --> 03:31:30,650
one black cell at the top and it makes
this kind of triangular pattern but if

11254
03:31:30,650 --> 03:31:30,660
this kind of triangular pattern but if
 

11255
03:31:30,660 --> 03:31:32,809
this kind of triangular pattern but if
you look inside this pattern it looks

11256
03:31:32,809 --> 03:31:32,819
you look inside this pattern it looks
 

11257
03:31:32,819 --> 03:31:34,969
you look inside this pattern it looks
really random there's you know you look

11258
03:31:34,969 --> 03:31:34,979
really random there's you know you look
 

11259
03:31:34,979 --> 03:31:37,550
really random there's you know you look
at the center column of cells and you

11260
03:31:37,550 --> 03:31:37,560
at the center column of cells and you
 

11261
03:31:37,560 --> 03:31:39,590
at the center column of cells and you
know I studied that in great detail and

11262
03:31:39,590 --> 03:31:39,600
know I studied that in great detail and
 

11263
03:31:39,600 --> 03:31:40,969
know I studied that in great detail and
it's so far as one can tell it's

11264
03:31:40,969 --> 03:31:40,979
it's so far as one can tell it's
 

11265
03:31:40,979 --> 03:31:43,729
it's so far as one can tell it's
completely random and it's kind of a

11266
03:31:43,729 --> 03:31:43,739
completely random and it's kind of a
 

11267
03:31:43,739 --> 03:31:46,190
completely random and it's kind of a
little bit like digits of pi once you

11268
03:31:46,190 --> 03:31:46,200
little bit like digits of pi once you
 

11269
03:31:46,200 --> 03:31:47,269
little bit like digits of pi once you
you know you know the rule for

11270
03:31:47,269 --> 03:31:47,279
you know you know the rule for
 

11271
03:31:47,279 --> 03:31:48,830
you know you know the rule for
generating the digit Supply but once

11272
03:31:48,830 --> 03:31:48,840
generating the digit Supply but once
 

11273
03:31:48,840 --> 03:31:51,229
generating the digit Supply but once
you've generated them you know 3.14159

11274
03:31:51,229 --> 03:31:51,239
you've generated them you know 3.14159
 

11275
03:31:51,239 --> 03:31:54,469
you've generated them you know 3.14159
Etc they seem completely random and in

11276
03:31:54,469 --> 03:31:54,479
Etc they seem completely random and in
 

11277
03:31:54,479 --> 03:31:56,330
Etc they seem completely random and in
fact I put up this prize back in what

11278
03:31:56,330 --> 03:31:56,340
fact I put up this prize back in what
 

11279
03:31:56,340 --> 03:31:59,030
fact I put up this prize back in what
was it 2019 or something for prove

11280
03:31:59,030 --> 03:31:59,040
was it 2019 or something for prove
 

11281
03:31:59,040 --> 03:32:01,190
was it 2019 or something for prove
anything about the sequence basically

11282
03:32:01,190 --> 03:32:01,200
anything about the sequence basically
 

11283
03:32:01,200 --> 03:32:02,929
anything about the sequence basically
has anyone been able to do anything on

11284
03:32:02,929 --> 03:32:02,939
has anyone been able to do anything on
 

11285
03:32:02,939 --> 03:32:04,849
has anyone been able to do anything on
that uh people have sent me some things

11286
03:32:04,849 --> 03:32:04,859
that uh people have sent me some things
 

11287
03:32:04,859 --> 03:32:07,910
that uh people have sent me some things
but it's you know I don't know how these

11288
03:32:07,910 --> 03:32:07,920
but it's you know I don't know how these
 

11289
03:32:07,920 --> 03:32:09,349
but it's you know I don't know how these
problems are I mean I was kind of

11290
03:32:09,349 --> 03:32:09,359
problems are I mean I was kind of
 

11291
03:32:09,359 --> 03:32:12,229
problems are I mean I was kind of
spoiled because I 2007 I put up a prize

11292
03:32:12,229 --> 03:32:12,239
spoiled because I 2007 I put up a prize
 

11293
03:32:12,239 --> 03:32:15,469
spoiled because I 2007 I put up a prize
for uh determining whether a particular

11294
03:32:15,469 --> 03:32:15,479
for uh determining whether a particular
 

11295
03:32:15,479 --> 03:32:18,110
for uh determining whether a particular
turing machine that I thought was the

11296
03:32:18,110 --> 03:32:18,120
turing machine that I thought was the
 

11297
03:32:18,120 --> 03:32:19,849
turing machine that I thought was the
simplest candidate for being Universal

11298
03:32:19,849 --> 03:32:19,859
simplest candidate for being Universal
 

11299
03:32:19,859 --> 03:32:22,010
simplest candidate for being Universal
turing machine determine whether it is

11300
03:32:22,010 --> 03:32:22,020
turing machine determine whether it is
 

11301
03:32:22,020 --> 03:32:24,410
turing machine determine whether it is
or isn't a universal turing machine and

11302
03:32:24,410 --> 03:32:24,420
or isn't a universal turing machine and
 

11303
03:32:24,420 --> 03:32:26,150
or isn't a universal turing machine and
somebody did a really good job of of

11304
03:32:26,150 --> 03:32:26,160
somebody did a really good job of of
 

11305
03:32:26,160 --> 03:32:27,710
somebody did a really good job of of
winning that prize and proving that it

11306
03:32:27,710 --> 03:32:27,720
winning that prize and proving that it
 

11307
03:32:27,720 --> 03:32:29,450
winning that prize and proving that it
was a universal turing machine in about

11308
03:32:29,450 --> 03:32:29,460
was a universal turing machine in about
 

11309
03:32:29,460 --> 03:32:31,610
was a universal turing machine in about
six months and so I you know I didn't

11310
03:32:31,610 --> 03:32:31,620
six months and so I you know I didn't
 

11311
03:32:31,620 --> 03:32:32,929
six months and so I you know I didn't
know whether that would be one of these

11312
03:32:32,929 --> 03:32:32,939
know whether that would be one of these
 

11313
03:32:32,939 --> 03:32:34,309
know whether that would be one of these
problems that was out there for hundreds

11314
03:32:34,309 --> 03:32:34,319
problems that was out there for hundreds
 

11315
03:32:34,319 --> 03:32:36,290
problems that was out there for hundreds
of years or whether in this particular

11316
03:32:36,290 --> 03:32:36,300
of years or whether in this particular
 

11317
03:32:36,300 --> 03:32:38,929
of years or whether in this particular
case young chap called Alex Smith

11318
03:32:38,929 --> 03:32:38,939
case young chap called Alex Smith
 

11319
03:32:38,939 --> 03:32:41,210
case young chap called Alex Smith
um you know nailed it in six months and

11320
03:32:41,210 --> 03:32:41,220
um you know nailed it in six months and
 

11321
03:32:41,220 --> 03:32:43,729
um you know nailed it in six months and
so with this little 30 collection I

11322
03:32:43,729 --> 03:32:43,739
so with this little 30 collection I
 

11323
03:32:43,739 --> 03:32:45,349
so with this little 30 collection I
don't really know whether these are

11324
03:32:45,349 --> 03:32:45,359
don't really know whether these are
 

11325
03:32:45,359 --> 03:32:47,030
don't really know whether these are
things that are 100 years away from

11326
03:32:47,030 --> 03:32:47,040
things that are 100 years away from
 

11327
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:48,830
things that are 100 years away from
being able to to get or whether

11328
03:32:48,830 --> 03:32:48,840
being able to to get or whether
 

11329
03:32:48,840 --> 03:32:50,090
being able to to get or whether
somebody's going to come and do

11330
03:32:50,090 --> 03:32:50,100
somebody's going to come and do
 

11331
03:32:50,100 --> 03:32:52,070
somebody's going to come and do
something very clever it's such a means

11332
03:32:52,070 --> 03:32:52,080
something very clever it's such a means
 

11333
03:32:52,080 --> 03:32:54,170
something very clever it's such a means
like for Mars Last Theorem Essentia rule

11334
03:32:54,170 --> 03:32:54,180
like for Mars Last Theorem Essentia rule
 

11335
03:32:54,180 --> 03:32:57,710
like for Mars Last Theorem Essentia rule
30 is such a simple formulation it feels

11336
03:32:57,710 --> 03:32:57,720
30 is such a simple formulation it feels
 

11337
03:32:57,720 --> 03:33:00,710
30 is such a simple formulation it feels
like anyone can look at it understand it

11338
03:33:00,710 --> 03:33:00,720
like anyone can look at it understand it
 

11339
03:33:00,720 --> 03:33:03,769
like anyone can look at it understand it
yeah and feel like it's within grasp

11340
03:33:03,769 --> 03:33:03,779
yeah and feel like it's within grasp
 

11341
03:33:03,779 --> 03:33:05,990
yeah and feel like it's within grasp
to be able to predict something to do to

11342
03:33:05,990 --> 03:33:06,000
to be able to predict something to do to
 

11343
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:08,150
to be able to predict something to do to
direct some kind of law

11344
03:33:08,150 --> 03:33:08,160
direct some kind of law
 

11345
03:33:08,160 --> 03:33:09,950
direct some kind of law
right it allows you to predict something

11346
03:33:09,950 --> 03:33:09,960
right it allows you to predict something
 

11347
03:33:09,960 --> 03:33:12,950
right it allows you to predict something
about this the middle column of rule 30

11348
03:33:12,950 --> 03:33:12,960
about this the middle column of rule 30
 

11349
03:33:12,960 --> 03:33:15,830
about this the middle column of rule 30
right but you know this is yeah you

11350
03:33:15,830 --> 03:33:15,840
right but you know this is yeah you
 

11351
03:33:15,840 --> 03:33:18,710
right but you know this is yeah you
can't yeah right this is the intuitional

11352
03:33:18,710 --> 03:33:18,720
can't yeah right this is the intuitional
 

11353
03:33:18,720 --> 03:33:21,170
can't yeah right this is the intuitional
surprise of computational irreducibility

11354
03:33:21,170 --> 03:33:21,180
surprise of computational irreducibility
 

11355
03:33:21,180 --> 03:33:22,729
surprise of computational irreducibility
and so on that even though the rules are

11356
03:33:22,729 --> 03:33:22,739
and so on that even though the rules are
 

11357
03:33:22,739 --> 03:33:24,530
and so on that even though the rules are
simple you can't tell what's going to

11358
03:33:24,530 --> 03:33:24,540
simple you can't tell what's going to
 

11359
03:33:24,540 --> 03:33:26,450
simple you can't tell what's going to
happen and you can't prove things about

11360
03:33:26,450 --> 03:33:26,460
happen and you can't prove things about
 

11361
03:33:26,460 --> 03:33:29,090
happen and you can't prove things about
it and I think so so anyway the the the

11362
03:33:29,090 --> 03:33:29,100
it and I think so so anyway the the the
 

11363
03:33:29,100 --> 03:33:32,809
it and I think so so anyway the the the
thing uh I I still started in 1984 or so

11364
03:33:32,809 --> 03:33:32,819
thing uh I I still started in 1984 or so
 

11365
03:33:32,819 --> 03:33:34,969
thing uh I I still started in 1984 or so
I started realizing there's this

11366
03:33:34,969 --> 03:33:34,979
I started realizing there's this
 

11367
03:33:34,979 --> 03:33:36,349
I started realizing there's this
phenomenon that you can have very simple

11368
03:33:36,349 --> 03:33:36,359
phenomenon that you can have very simple
 

11369
03:33:36,359 --> 03:33:38,150
phenomenon that you can have very simple
rules they produce apparently random

11370
03:33:38,150 --> 03:33:38,160
rules they produce apparently random
 

11371
03:33:38,160 --> 03:33:40,190
rules they produce apparently random
Behavior okay so that's a little bit

11372
03:33:40,190 --> 03:33:40,200
Behavior okay so that's a little bit
 

11373
03:33:40,200 --> 03:33:42,050
Behavior okay so that's a little bit
like the second orthodynamics because

11374
03:33:42,050 --> 03:33:42,060
like the second orthodynamics because
 

11375
03:33:42,060 --> 03:33:45,229
like the second orthodynamics because
it's like you have this simple initial

11376
03:33:45,229 --> 03:33:45,239
it's like you have this simple initial
 

11377
03:33:45,239 --> 03:33:47,809
it's like you have this simple initial
condition you can you know readily see

11378
03:33:47,809 --> 03:33:47,819
condition you can you know readily see
 

11379
03:33:47,819 --> 03:33:49,849
condition you can you know readily see
that it's very you know you can describe

11380
03:33:49,849 --> 03:33:49,859
that it's very you know you can describe
 

11381
03:33:49,859 --> 03:33:52,370
that it's very you know you can describe
it very easily and yet it makes this

11382
03:33:52,370 --> 03:33:52,380
it very easily and yet it makes this
 

11383
03:33:52,380 --> 03:33:56,330
it very easily and yet it makes this
thing that seems to be random now turns

11384
03:33:56,330 --> 03:33:56,340
thing that seems to be random now turns
 

11385
03:33:56,340 --> 03:33:57,410
thing that seems to be random now turns
out

11386
03:33:57,410 --> 03:33:57,420
out
 

11387
03:33:57,420 --> 03:33:59,510
out
thus some technical detail about the

11388
03:33:59,510 --> 03:33:59,520
thus some technical detail about the
 

11389
03:33:59,520 --> 03:34:01,130
thus some technical detail about the
secular thermodynamics and about the

11390
03:34:01,130 --> 03:34:01,140
secular thermodynamics and about the
 

11391
03:34:01,140 --> 03:34:03,290
secular thermodynamics and about the
idea of reversibility when you have a if

11392
03:34:03,290 --> 03:34:03,300
idea of reversibility when you have a if
 

11393
03:34:03,300 --> 03:34:07,790
idea of reversibility when you have a if
you have kind of a a a movie of two you

11394
03:34:07,790 --> 03:34:07,800
you have kind of a a a movie of two you
 

11395
03:34:07,800 --> 03:34:10,250
you have kind of a a a movie of two you
know billiard balls colliding and you

11396
03:34:10,250 --> 03:34:10,260
know billiard balls colliding and you
 

11397
03:34:10,260 --> 03:34:12,530
know billiard balls colliding and you
see them Collide and they bounce off and

11398
03:34:12,530 --> 03:34:12,540
see them Collide and they bounce off and
 

11399
03:34:12,540 --> 03:34:14,750
see them Collide and they bounce off and
you run that movie In Reverse you can't

11400
03:34:14,750 --> 03:34:14,760
you run that movie In Reverse you can't
 

11401
03:34:14,760 --> 03:34:16,370
you run that movie In Reverse you can't
tell which way was the forward direction

11402
03:34:16,370 --> 03:34:16,380
tell which way was the forward direction
 

11403
03:34:16,380 --> 03:34:17,809
tell which way was the forward direction
of time and which way was the backward

11404
03:34:17,809 --> 03:34:17,819
of time and which way was the backward
 

11405
03:34:17,819 --> 03:34:19,190
of time and which way was the backward
direction of time when you're just

11406
03:34:19,190 --> 03:34:19,200
direction of time when you're just
 

11407
03:34:19,200 --> 03:34:21,110
direction of time when you're just
looking at individual billiard Balls by

11408
03:34:21,110 --> 03:34:21,120
looking at individual billiard Balls by
 

11409
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:22,370
looking at individual billiard Balls by
the time you've got a whole collection

11410
03:34:22,370 --> 03:34:22,380
the time you've got a whole collection
 

11411
03:34:22,380 --> 03:34:24,950
the time you've got a whole collection
of them you know a million of them or

11412
03:34:24,950 --> 03:34:24,960
of them you know a million of them or
 

11413
03:34:24,960 --> 03:34:27,710
of them you know a million of them or
something then it turns out to be the

11414
03:34:27,710 --> 03:34:27,720
something then it turns out to be the
 

11415
03:34:27,720 --> 03:34:29,570
something then it turns out to be the
case and this is the the sort of the The

11416
03:34:29,570 --> 03:34:29,580
case and this is the the sort of the The
 

11417
03:34:29,580 --> 03:34:32,450
case and this is the the sort of the The
Mystery of the second law that the

11418
03:34:32,450 --> 03:34:32,460
Mystery of the second law that the
 

11419
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:34,070
Mystery of the second law that the
orderly thing you start with the orderly

11420
03:34:34,070 --> 03:34:34,080
orderly thing you start with the orderly
 

11421
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:36,229
orderly thing you start with the orderly
thing and it becomes disordered and

11422
03:34:36,229 --> 03:34:36,239
thing and it becomes disordered and
 

11423
03:34:36,239 --> 03:34:38,690
thing and it becomes disordered and
that's the forward Direction in time and

11424
03:34:38,690 --> 03:34:38,700
that's the forward Direction in time and
 

11425
03:34:38,700 --> 03:34:40,670
that's the forward Direction in time and
the other way around of it starts to

11426
03:34:40,670 --> 03:34:40,680
the other way around of it starts to
 

11427
03:34:40,680 --> 03:34:42,410
the other way around of it starts to
sorted and becomes ordered you just

11428
03:34:42,410 --> 03:34:42,420
sorted and becomes ordered you just
 

11429
03:34:42,420 --> 03:34:44,330
sorted and becomes ordered you just
don't see that in the world

11430
03:34:44,330 --> 03:34:44,340
don't see that in the world
 

11431
03:34:44,340 --> 03:34:48,110
don't see that in the world
now in principle if you you know if you

11432
03:34:48,110 --> 03:34:48,120
now in principle if you you know if you
 

11433
03:34:48,120 --> 03:34:50,510
now in principle if you you know if you
sort of traced the detailed motions of

11434
03:34:50,510 --> 03:34:50,520
sort of traced the detailed motions of
 

11435
03:34:50,520 --> 03:34:52,910
sort of traced the detailed motions of
all those molecules backwards you would

11436
03:34:52,910 --> 03:34:52,920
all those molecules backwards you would
 

11437
03:34:52,920 --> 03:34:55,790
all those molecules backwards you would
be able to it it will it will the

11438
03:34:55,790 --> 03:34:55,800
be able to it it will it will the
 

11439
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:58,790
be able to it it will it will the
reverse of time makes you know as you as

11440
03:34:58,790 --> 03:34:58,800
reverse of time makes you know as you as
 

11441
03:34:58,800 --> 03:35:00,590
reverse of time makes you know as you as
you go forwards in time order goes to

11442
03:35:00,590 --> 03:35:00,600
you go forwards in time order goes to
 

11443
03:35:00,600 --> 03:35:02,210
you go forwards in time order goes to
disorder as you go backwards in time

11444
03:35:02,210 --> 03:35:02,220
disorder as you go backwards in time
 

11445
03:35:02,220 --> 03:35:04,490
disorder as you go backwards in time
order goes to disorder perfectly so yes

11446
03:35:04,490 --> 03:35:04,500
order goes to disorder perfectly so yes
 

11447
03:35:04,500 --> 03:35:08,870
order goes to disorder perfectly so yes
right so the the mystery is why is it

11448
03:35:08,870 --> 03:35:08,880
right so the the mystery is why is it
 

11449
03:35:08,880 --> 03:35:11,269
right so the the mystery is why is it
the case that one version of the mystery

11450
03:35:11,269 --> 03:35:11,279
the case that one version of the mystery
 

11451
03:35:11,279 --> 03:35:13,910
the case that one version of the mystery
is why is it the case that you never see

11452
03:35:13,910 --> 03:35:13,920
is why is it the case that you never see
 

11453
03:35:13,920 --> 03:35:16,130
is why is it the case that you never see
something which happens to be just the

11454
03:35:16,130 --> 03:35:16,140
something which happens to be just the
 

11455
03:35:16,140 --> 03:35:18,889
something which happens to be just the
kind of disorder that you would need to

11456
03:35:18,889 --> 03:35:18,899
kind of disorder that you would need to
 

11457
03:35:18,899 --> 03:35:21,050
kind of disorder that you would need to
somehow evolve to order why does that

11458
03:35:21,050 --> 03:35:21,060
somehow evolve to order why does that
 

11459
03:35:21,060 --> 03:35:23,330
somehow evolve to order why does that
not happen why do you always just see

11460
03:35:23,330 --> 03:35:23,340
not happen why do you always just see
 

11461
03:35:23,340 --> 03:35:25,610
not happen why do you always just see
order goes to disorder not the other way

11462
03:35:25,610 --> 03:35:25,620
order goes to disorder not the other way
 

11463
03:35:25,620 --> 03:35:26,269
order goes to disorder not the other way
around

11464
03:35:26,269 --> 03:35:26,279
around
 

11465
03:35:26,279 --> 03:35:29,090
around
so the thing that I I kind of realized I

11466
03:35:29,090 --> 03:35:29,100
so the thing that I I kind of realized I
 

11467
03:35:29,100 --> 03:35:31,490
so the thing that I I kind of realized I
started realizing in the 1980s is kind

11468
03:35:31,490 --> 03:35:31,500
started realizing in the 1980s is kind
 

11469
03:35:31,500 --> 03:35:33,530
started realizing in the 1980s is kind
of like it's a bit like cryptography

11470
03:35:33,530 --> 03:35:33,540
of like it's a bit like cryptography
 

11471
03:35:33,540 --> 03:35:35,630
of like it's a bit like cryptography
it's kind of like you start off from

11472
03:35:35,630 --> 03:35:35,640
it's kind of like you start off from
 

11473
03:35:35,640 --> 03:35:38,330
it's kind of like you start off from
this this key that's pretty simple and

11474
03:35:38,330 --> 03:35:38,340
this this key that's pretty simple and
 

11475
03:35:38,340 --> 03:35:40,070
this this key that's pretty simple and
then you kind of run it and you can get

11476
03:35:40,070 --> 03:35:40,080
then you kind of run it and you can get
 

11477
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:43,090
then you kind of run it and you can get
this you know complicated random mess

11478
03:35:43,090 --> 03:35:43,100
this you know complicated random mess
 

11479
03:35:43,100 --> 03:35:47,150
this you know complicated random mess
and uh the thing that that um

11480
03:35:47,150 --> 03:35:47,160
and uh the thing that that um
 

11481
03:35:47,160 --> 03:35:49,969
and uh the thing that that um
well I sort of started realizing back

11482
03:35:49,969 --> 03:35:49,979
well I sort of started realizing back
 

11483
03:35:49,979 --> 03:35:53,809
well I sort of started realizing back
then was that the second law is kind of

11484
03:35:53,809 --> 03:35:53,819
then was that the second law is kind of
 

11485
03:35:53,819 --> 03:35:56,809
then was that the second law is kind of
a a story of computational reducibility

11486
03:35:56,809 --> 03:35:56,819
a a story of computational reducibility
 

11487
03:35:56,819 --> 03:36:00,530
a a story of computational reducibility
it's a story of you know what seems you

11488
03:36:00,530 --> 03:36:00,540
it's a story of you know what seems you
 

11489
03:36:00,540 --> 03:36:02,450
it's a story of you know what seems you
know what what we can describe easily at

11490
03:36:02,450 --> 03:36:02,460
know what what we can describe easily at
 

11491
03:36:02,460 --> 03:36:06,469
know what what we can describe easily at
the beginning we can only describe with

11492
03:36:06,469 --> 03:36:06,479
the beginning we can only describe with
 

11493
03:36:06,479 --> 03:36:08,750
the beginning we can only describe with
a lot of computational effort at the end

11494
03:36:08,750 --> 03:36:08,760
a lot of computational effort at the end
 

11495
03:36:08,760 --> 03:36:11,330
a lot of computational effort at the end
okay so now we come many many years

11496
03:36:11,330 --> 03:36:11,340
okay so now we come many many years
 

11497
03:36:11,340 --> 03:36:15,769
okay so now we come many many years
later and um uh I was trying to sort of

11498
03:36:15,769 --> 03:36:15,779
later and um uh I was trying to sort of
 

11499
03:36:15,779 --> 03:36:19,670
later and um uh I was trying to sort of
uh well having done this big project to

11500
03:36:19,670 --> 03:36:19,680
uh well having done this big project to
 

11501
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:22,309
uh well having done this big project to
understand fundamental physics I

11502
03:36:22,309 --> 03:36:22,319
understand fundamental physics I
 

11503
03:36:22,319 --> 03:36:24,950
understand fundamental physics I
realized that sort of a key aspect of

11504
03:36:24,950 --> 03:36:24,960
realized that sort of a key aspect of
 

11505
03:36:24,960 --> 03:36:27,170
realized that sort of a key aspect of
that is understanding what observers are

11506
03:36:27,170 --> 03:36:27,180
that is understanding what observers are
 

11507
03:36:27,180 --> 03:36:27,889
that is understanding what observers are
like

11508
03:36:27,889 --> 03:36:27,899
like
 

11509
03:36:27,899 --> 03:36:30,349
like
and then I realized that the second

11510
03:36:30,349 --> 03:36:30,359
and then I realized that the second
 

11511
03:36:30,359 --> 03:36:34,130
and then I realized that the second
orthodynamics is the same story as a

11512
03:36:34,130 --> 03:36:34,140
orthodynamics is the same story as a
 

11513
03:36:34,140 --> 03:36:36,110
orthodynamics is the same story as a
bunch of these other cases

11514
03:36:36,110 --> 03:36:36,120
bunch of these other cases
 

11515
03:36:36,120 --> 03:36:39,290
bunch of these other cases
um it is a story of a a computationally

11516
03:36:39,290 --> 03:36:39,300
um it is a story of a a computationally
 

11517
03:36:39,300 --> 03:36:42,349
um it is a story of a a computationally
bounded Observer trying to observe a

11518
03:36:42,349 --> 03:36:42,359
bounded Observer trying to observe a
 

11519
03:36:42,359 --> 03:36:44,870
bounded Observer trying to observe a
computationally irreducible system so

11520
03:36:44,870 --> 03:36:44,880
computationally irreducible system so
 

11521
03:36:44,880 --> 03:36:47,570
computationally irreducible system so
it's a story of you know underneath the

11522
03:36:47,570 --> 03:36:47,580
it's a story of you know underneath the
 

11523
03:36:47,580 --> 03:36:49,550
it's a story of you know underneath the
molecules are bouncing around they're

11524
03:36:49,550 --> 03:36:49,560
molecules are bouncing around they're
 

11525
03:36:49,560 --> 03:36:52,250
molecules are bouncing around they're
bouncing around in this completely uh

11526
03:36:52,250 --> 03:36:52,260
bouncing around in this completely uh
 

11527
03:36:52,260 --> 03:36:54,830
bouncing around in this completely uh
determined way determined by rules

11528
03:36:54,830 --> 03:36:54,840
determined way determined by rules
 

11529
03:36:54,840 --> 03:36:59,210
determined way determined by rules
but the point is that that we as

11530
03:36:59,210 --> 03:36:59,220
but the point is that that we as
 

11531
03:36:59,220 --> 03:37:02,030
but the point is that that we as
computationally bounded observers can't

11532
03:37:02,030 --> 03:37:02,040
computationally bounded observers can't
 

11533
03:37:02,040 --> 03:37:04,250
computationally bounded observers can't
tell that there were these sort of

11534
03:37:04,250 --> 03:37:04,260
tell that there were these sort of
 

11535
03:37:04,260 --> 03:37:06,590
tell that there were these sort of
simple underlying rules to us it just

11536
03:37:06,590 --> 03:37:06,600
simple underlying rules to us it just
 

11537
03:37:06,600 --> 03:37:08,030
simple underlying rules to us it just
looks random and when it comes to this

11538
03:37:08,030 --> 03:37:08,040
looks random and when it comes to this
 

11539
03:37:08,040 --> 03:37:09,950
looks random and when it comes to this
question about can you prepare the

11540
03:37:09,950 --> 03:37:09,960
question about can you prepare the
 

11541
03:37:09,960 --> 03:37:12,889
question about can you prepare the
initial state so that

11542
03:37:12,889 --> 03:37:12,899
initial state so that
 

11543
03:37:12,899 --> 03:37:16,010
initial state so that
um you know the disordered thing is you

11544
03:37:16,010 --> 03:37:16,020
um you know the disordered thing is you
 

11545
03:37:16,020 --> 03:37:17,929
um you know the disordered thing is you
know how exactly the right disorder to

11546
03:37:17,929 --> 03:37:17,939
know how exactly the right disorder to
 

11547
03:37:17,939 --> 03:37:20,030
know how exactly the right disorder to
make something orderly a computationally

11548
03:37:20,030 --> 03:37:20,040
make something orderly a computationally
 

11549
03:37:20,040 --> 03:37:22,490
make something orderly a computationally
bounded Observer cannot do that we'd

11550
03:37:22,490 --> 03:37:22,500
bounded Observer cannot do that we'd
 

11551
03:37:22,500 --> 03:37:24,710
bounded Observer cannot do that we'd
have to have done all of this sort of

11552
03:37:24,710 --> 03:37:24,720
have to have done all of this sort of
 

11553
03:37:24,720 --> 03:37:26,870
have to have done all of this sort of
irreducible computation to work out very

11554
03:37:26,870 --> 03:37:26,880
irreducible computation to work out very
 

11555
03:37:26,880 --> 03:37:29,210
irreducible computation to work out very
precisely what this disordered State

11556
03:37:29,210 --> 03:37:29,220
precisely what this disordered State
 

11557
03:37:29,220 --> 03:37:31,729
precisely what this disordered State
what the exact right disordered state is

11558
03:37:31,729 --> 03:37:31,739
what the exact right disordered state is
 

11559
03:37:31,739 --> 03:37:34,429
what the exact right disordered state is
so that we would get this ordered thing

11560
03:37:34,429 --> 03:37:34,439
so that we would get this ordered thing
 

11561
03:37:34,439 --> 03:37:36,229
so that we would get this ordered thing
produced from it what does it mean to be

11562
03:37:36,229 --> 03:37:36,239
produced from it what does it mean to be
 

11563
03:37:36,239 --> 03:37:39,170
produced from it what does it mean to be
computationally bounded Observer

11564
03:37:39,170 --> 03:37:39,180
computationally bounded Observer
 

11565
03:37:39,180 --> 03:37:41,630
computationally bounded Observer
so observing a computational reducible

11566
03:37:41,630 --> 03:37:41,640
so observing a computational reducible
 

11567
03:37:41,640 --> 03:37:43,969
so observing a computational reducible
system so the computationally bounded is

11568
03:37:43,969 --> 03:37:43,979
system so the computationally bounded is
 

11569
03:37:43,979 --> 03:37:45,590
system so the computationally bounded is
there something formal you can say there

11570
03:37:45,590 --> 03:37:45,600
there something formal you can say there
 

11571
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:47,809
there something formal you can say there
right so it means

11572
03:37:47,809 --> 03:37:47,819
right so it means
 

11573
03:37:47,819 --> 03:37:50,090
right so it means
okay you can you can talk about Turing

11574
03:37:50,090 --> 03:37:50,100
okay you can you can talk about Turing
 

11575
03:37:50,100 --> 03:37:50,990
okay you can you can talk about Turing
machines you can talk about

11576
03:37:50,990 --> 03:37:51,000
machines you can talk about
 

11577
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:53,809
machines you can talk about
computational uh complexity Theory and

11578
03:37:53,809 --> 03:37:53,819
computational uh complexity Theory and
 

11579
03:37:53,819 --> 03:37:56,570
computational uh complexity Theory and
uh you know uh polynomial time

11580
03:37:56,570 --> 03:37:56,580
uh you know uh polynomial time
 

11581
03:37:56,580 --> 03:37:58,490
uh you know uh polynomial time
computation and things like this there

11582
03:37:58,490 --> 03:37:58,500
computation and things like this there
 

11583
03:37:58,500 --> 03:38:00,530
computation and things like this there
are a variety of ways to make something

11584
03:38:00,530 --> 03:38:00,540
are a variety of ways to make something
 

11585
03:38:00,540 --> 03:38:01,969
are a variety of ways to make something
more precise but I think it's more

11586
03:38:01,969 --> 03:38:01,979
more precise but I think it's more
 

11587
03:38:01,979 --> 03:38:03,590
more precise but I think it's more
useful the intuitive version of it is

11588
03:38:03,590 --> 03:38:03,600
useful the intuitive version of it is
 

11589
03:38:03,600 --> 03:38:05,750
useful the intuitive version of it is
more useful yeah which is basically just

11590
03:38:05,750 --> 03:38:05,760
more useful yeah which is basically just
 

11591
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:08,570
more useful yeah which is basically just
to say that you know how much

11592
03:38:08,570 --> 03:38:08,580
to say that you know how much
 

11593
03:38:08,580 --> 03:38:10,910
to say that you know how much
computation are you going to do to try

11594
03:38:10,910 --> 03:38:10,920
computation are you going to do to try
 

11595
03:38:10,920 --> 03:38:12,889
computation are you going to do to try
and work out what's going on and the

11596
03:38:12,889 --> 03:38:12,899
and work out what's going on and the
 

11597
03:38:12,899 --> 03:38:15,530
and work out what's going on and the
answer is you're not allowed to do a lot

11598
03:38:15,530 --> 03:38:15,540
answer is you're not allowed to do a lot
 

11599
03:38:15,540 --> 03:38:17,150
answer is you're not allowed to do a lot
of we're not able to do a lot of

11600
03:38:17,150 --> 03:38:17,160
of we're not able to do a lot of
 

11601
03:38:17,160 --> 03:38:19,790
of we're not able to do a lot of
computation when we you know we've got

11602
03:38:19,790 --> 03:38:19,800
computation when we you know we've got
 

11603
03:38:19,800 --> 03:38:22,910
computation when we you know we've got
you know in this room there will be a

11604
03:38:22,910 --> 03:38:22,920
you know in this room there will be a
 

11605
03:38:22,920 --> 03:38:25,070
you know in this room there will be a
trillion trillion trillion molecules a

11606
03:38:25,070 --> 03:38:25,080
trillion trillion trillion molecules a
 

11607
03:38:25,080 --> 03:38:27,830
trillion trillion trillion molecules a
little bit less it's a big room right

11608
03:38:27,830 --> 03:38:27,840
little bit less it's a big room right
 

11609
03:38:27,840 --> 03:38:32,030
little bit less it's a big room right
and uh you know at every moment you know

11610
03:38:32,030 --> 03:38:32,040
and uh you know at every moment you know
 

11611
03:38:32,040 --> 03:38:33,710
and uh you know at every moment you know
that every microsecond or something

11612
03:38:33,710 --> 03:38:33,720
that every microsecond or something
 

11613
03:38:33,720 --> 03:38:35,710
that every microsecond or something
these molecules molecules are colliding

11614
03:38:35,710 --> 03:38:35,720
these molecules molecules are colliding
 

11615
03:38:35,720 --> 03:38:39,050
these molecules molecules are colliding
and that's a lot of computation that's

11616
03:38:39,050 --> 03:38:39,060
and that's a lot of computation that's
 

11617
03:38:39,060 --> 03:38:41,870
and that's a lot of computation that's
getting done and the question is in our

11618
03:38:41,870 --> 03:38:41,880
getting done and the question is in our
 

11619
03:38:41,880 --> 03:38:44,450
getting done and the question is in our
brains we do a lot less computation

11620
03:38:44,450 --> 03:38:44,460
brains we do a lot less computation
 

11621
03:38:44,460 --> 03:38:46,969
brains we do a lot less computation
every second than the computation done

11622
03:38:46,969 --> 03:38:46,979
every second than the computation done
 

11623
03:38:46,979 --> 03:38:49,550
every second than the computation done
by all those molecules if there is

11624
03:38:49,550 --> 03:38:49,560
by all those molecules if there is
 

11625
03:38:49,560 --> 03:38:52,490
by all those molecules if there is
computational irreducibility we can't

11626
03:38:52,490 --> 03:38:52,500
computational irreducibility we can't
 

11627
03:38:52,500 --> 03:38:54,590
computational irreducibility we can't
work out in detail what all those

11628
03:38:54,590 --> 03:38:54,600
work out in detail what all those
 

11629
03:38:54,600 --> 03:38:56,809
work out in detail what all those
molecules are going to do what we can do

11630
03:38:56,809 --> 03:38:56,819
molecules are going to do what we can do
 

11631
03:38:56,819 --> 03:38:58,490
molecules are going to do what we can do
is only a much smaller amount of

11632
03:38:58,490 --> 03:38:58,500
is only a much smaller amount of
 

11633
03:38:58,500 --> 03:39:01,550
is only a much smaller amount of
computation and so the the second law of

11634
03:39:01,550 --> 03:39:01,560
computation and so the the second law of
 

11635
03:39:01,560 --> 03:39:03,889
computation and so the the second law of
Thermodynamics is this kind of interplay

11636
03:39:03,889 --> 03:39:03,899
Thermodynamics is this kind of interplay
 

11637
03:39:03,899 --> 03:39:05,809
Thermodynamics is this kind of interplay
between the underlying computational

11638
03:39:05,809 --> 03:39:05,819
between the underlying computational
 

11639
03:39:05,819 --> 03:39:09,110
between the underlying computational
irreducibility and the fact that we as

11640
03:39:09,110 --> 03:39:09,120
irreducibility and the fact that we as
 

11641
03:39:09,120 --> 03:39:11,030
irreducibility and the fact that we as
preparers of initial States or as

11642
03:39:11,030 --> 03:39:11,040
preparers of initial States or as
 

11643
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:13,910
preparers of initial States or as
measures of what happens are you know

11644
03:39:13,910 --> 03:39:13,920
measures of what happens are you know
 

11645
03:39:13,920 --> 03:39:15,769
measures of what happens are you know
are not capable of doing that much

11646
03:39:15,769 --> 03:39:15,779
are not capable of doing that much
 

11647
03:39:15,779 --> 03:39:18,889
are not capable of doing that much
computation so to us another big

11648
03:39:18,889 --> 03:39:18,899
computation so to us another big
 

11649
03:39:18,899 --> 03:39:20,450
computation so to us another big
formulation of the second order of

formulation of the second order of
 

11651
03:39:20,460 --> 03:39:22,250

thermodynamics is this idea of the law

11652
03:39:22,250 --> 03:39:22,260
thermodynamics is this idea of the law
 

11653
03:39:22,260 --> 03:39:23,590
thermodynamics is this idea of the law

what does that show to you about the

11660
03:39:29,690 --> 03:39:29,700
what does that show to you about the
 

11661
03:39:29,700 --> 03:39:33,790
what does that show to you about the
evolution of

11662
03:39:33,790 --> 03:39:33,800

 

11663
03:39:33,800 --> 03:39:37,969

yes okay and that's very confused in the

11664
03:39:37,969 --> 03:39:37,979
yes okay and that's very confused in the
 

11665
03:39:37,979 --> 03:39:39,469
yes okay and that's very confused in the
history of thermodynamics because

11666
03:39:39,469 --> 03:39:39,479
history of thermodynamics because
 

11667
03:39:39,479 --> 03:39:41,690
history of thermodynamics because
entropy was first introduced by a guy

11668
03:39:41,690 --> 03:39:41,700
entropy was first introduced by a guy
 

11669
03:39:41,700 --> 03:39:44,750
entropy was first introduced by a guy
called Rudolf clausius and he did it in

11670
03:39:44,750 --> 03:39:44,760
called Rudolf clausius and he did it in
 

11671
03:39:44,760 --> 03:39:47,290
called Rudolf clausius and he did it in
terms of heat and temperature okay

11672
03:39:47,290 --> 03:39:47,300
terms of heat and temperature okay
 

11673
03:39:47,300 --> 03:39:49,969
terms of heat and temperature okay
subsequently it was reformulated by a

11674
03:39:49,969 --> 03:39:49,979
subsequently it was reformulated by a
 

11675
03:39:49,979 --> 03:39:52,010
subsequently it was reformulated by a
guy called Ludwig boltzmann

11676
03:39:52,010 --> 03:39:52,020
guy called Ludwig boltzmann
 

11677
03:39:52,020 --> 03:39:55,670
guy called Ludwig boltzmann
um and uh he formulated it in a much

11678
03:39:55,670 --> 03:39:55,680
um and uh he formulated it in a much
 

11679
03:39:55,680 --> 03:39:58,130
um and uh he formulated it in a much
more kind of combinatorial type way

11680
03:39:58,130 --> 03:39:58,140
more kind of combinatorial type way
 

11681
03:39:58,140 --> 03:39:59,870
more kind of combinatorial type way
but he always claimed that it was

11682
03:39:59,870 --> 03:39:59,880
but he always claimed that it was
 

11683
03:39:59,880 --> 03:40:02,929
but he always claimed that it was
equivalent to clausius's thing and then

11684
03:40:02,929 --> 03:40:02,939
equivalent to clausius's thing and then
 

11685
03:40:02,939 --> 03:40:05,090
equivalent to clausius's thing and then
in one particular simple example it is

11686
03:40:05,090 --> 03:40:05,100
in one particular simple example it is
 

11687
03:40:05,100 --> 03:40:07,429
in one particular simple example it is
but that connection between these two

11688
03:40:07,429 --> 03:40:07,439
but that connection between these two
 

11689
03:40:07,439 --> 03:40:09,349
but that connection between these two
formulations of entropy they've never

11690
03:40:09,349 --> 03:40:09,359
formulations of entropy they've never
 

11691
03:40:09,359 --> 03:40:11,929
formulations of entropy they've never
been connected I mean it's there there's

11692
03:40:11,929 --> 03:40:11,939
been connected I mean it's there there's
 

11693
03:40:11,939 --> 03:40:13,729
been connected I mean it's there there's
really so okay so the more general

11694
03:40:13,729 --> 03:40:13,739
really so okay so the more general
 

11695
03:40:13,739 --> 03:40:15,769
really so okay so the more general
definition of entropy due to boltzmann

11696
03:40:15,769 --> 03:40:15,779
definition of entropy due to boltzmann
 

11697
03:40:15,779 --> 03:40:18,349
definition of entropy due to boltzmann
is is the following thing so you say I

11698
03:40:18,349 --> 03:40:18,359
is is the following thing so you say I
 

11699
03:40:18,359 --> 03:40:20,330
is is the following thing so you say I
have a system and has many possible

for example we know it's in a box it has
a certain pressure it has a certain

11755
03:41:23,000 --> 03:41:26,750
discrete is it continuous at the moment
at that time people mostly thought that

11756
03:41:26,750 --> 03:41:26,760
at that time people mostly thought that
 

11757
03:41:26,760 --> 03:41:29,630
at that time people mostly thought that
Mata was continuous and it was all

03:41:31,260 --> 03:41:33,170
confused with this question about what
heat is and people thought heat was this

11762
03:41:33,170 --> 03:41:33,180
heat is and people thought heat was this
 

11763
03:41:33,180 --> 03:41:36,410
heat is and people thought heat was this
fluid and um it was it was a big big

03:41:36,410 --> 03:41:36,420
fluid and um it was it was a big big
 

11765
03:41:36,420 --> 03:41:39,710

model and um the uh and this but

11766
03:41:39,710 --> 03:41:39,720
model and um the uh and this but
 

11767
03:41:39,720 --> 03:41:41,809

03:41:45,710 --> 03:41:45,720
they have discrete energy levels let's
 

11773
03:41:45,720 --> 03:41:47,929
they have discrete energy levels let's
say everything is discrete then we can

11774
03:41:47,929 --> 03:41:47,939
say everything is discrete then we can
 

11775
03:41:47,939 --> 03:41:50,570
say everything is discrete then we can
do sort of combinatorial mathematics and

11776
03:41:50,570 --> 03:41:50,580
do sort of combinatorial mathematics and
 

11777
03:41:50,580 --> 03:41:52,070
do sort of combinatorial mathematics and
work out how many configurations of

11778
03:41:52,070 --> 03:41:52,080
work out how many configurations of
 

11779
03:41:52,080 --> 03:41:53,389
work out how many configurations of
these things they would be in the box

11780
03:41:53,389 --> 03:41:53,399
these things they would be in the box
 

11781
03:41:53,399 --> 03:41:55,790
these things they would be in the box
and we can say we can compute the

11782
03:41:55,790 --> 03:41:55,800
and we can say we can compute the
 

11783
03:41:55,800 --> 03:41:58,550
and we can say we can compute the
centropy quantity but he said said but

11784
03:41:58,550 --> 03:41:58,560
centropy quantity but he said said but
 

11785
03:41:58,560 --> 03:42:00,170
centropy quantity but he said said but
of course it's just a fiction that these

11786
03:42:00,170 --> 03:42:00,180
of course it's just a fiction that these
 

11787
03:42:00,180 --> 03:42:02,510
of course it's just a fiction that these
things are discreet so he said this is

11788
03:42:02,510 --> 03:42:02,520
things are discreet so he said this is
 

11789
03:42:02,520 --> 03:42:03,769
things are discreet so he said this is
an interesting piece of History by the

11790
03:42:03,769 --> 03:42:03,779
an interesting piece of History by the
 

11791
03:42:03,779 --> 03:42:06,229
an interesting piece of History by the
way that that you know that was at that

11792
03:42:06,229 --> 03:42:06,239
way that that you know that was at that
 

11793
03:42:06,239 --> 03:42:07,969

time people didn't know molecules

11794
03:42:07,969 --> 03:42:07,979
time people didn't know molecules
 

11795
03:42:07,979 --> 03:42:10,309

um and uh in fact it was um it was
 

11835
03:42:53,399 --> 03:42:55,130
um and uh in fact it was um it was
really quite interesting history I mean

11836
03:42:55,130 --> 03:42:55,140
really quite interesting history I mean
 

11837
03:42:55,140 --> 03:42:57,830
really quite interesting history I mean
boltzmann had worked out how things

11838
03:42:57,830 --> 03:42:57,840

11839
03:42:57,840 --> 03:42:59,929
boltzmann had worked out how things
could be discreet and have basically

11840

could be discreet and have basically
 

11841
03:42:59,939 --> 03:43:01,610
could be discreet and have basically
invented something like quantum theory

11842
03:43:01,610 --> 03:43:01,620
invented something like quantum theory
 

11843
03:43:01,620 --> 03:43:05,210
invented something like quantum theory
in in the 1860s and uh but he just

11844
03:43:05,210 --> 03:43:05,220
in in the 1860s and uh but he just
 

11845
03:43:05,220 --> 03:43:06,590
in in the 1860s and uh but he just
thought it wasn't really the way it

11846
03:43:06,590 --> 03:43:06,600
thought it wasn't really the way it
 

11847
03:43:06,600 --> 03:43:09,830
thought it wasn't really the way it
worked and then just a piece of physics

11848
03:43:09,830 --> 03:43:09,840
worked and then just a piece of physics
 

11849
03:43:09,840 --> 03:43:10,910
worked and then just a piece of physics
history because I think it's kind of

11850
03:43:10,910 --> 03:43:10,920
history because I think it's kind of
 

11851
03:43:10,920 --> 03:43:13,490
history because I think it's kind of
interesting in in 1900 this guy called

03:43:35,510 --> 03:43:35,520
black body radiation and there were
 

11875
03:43:35,520 --> 03:43:38,269
black body radiation and there were
these curves and you couldn't fit the

11876
03:43:38,269 --> 03:43:38,279
these curves and you couldn't fit the
 

11877
03:43:38,279 --> 03:43:40,370
these curves and you couldn't fit the
curve based on his idea for how

11878
03:43:40,370 --> 03:43:40,380
curve based on his idea for how
 

11879
03:43:40,380 --> 03:43:43,010
curve based on his idea for how
radiation interacted with Mata those

11880
03:43:43,010 --> 03:43:43,020
radiation interacted with Mata those
 

11881
03:43:43,020 --> 03:43:44,450
radiation interacted with Mata those
curves you couldn't figure out how to

11882
03:43:44,450 --> 03:43:44,460
curves you couldn't figure out how to
 

11883
03:43:44,460 --> 03:43:47,269
curves you couldn't figure out how to
fit those curves except he noticed that

11884
03:43:47,269 --> 03:43:47,279
fit those curves except he noticed that
 

11885
03:43:47,279 --> 03:43:49,670
fit those curves except he noticed that
if he just did what boltzmann had done

11886
03:43:49,670 --> 03:43:49,680
if he just did what boltzmann had done
 

11887
03:43:49,680 --> 03:43:52,309
if he just did what boltzmann had done
and assumed that electromagnetic

11888
03:43:52,309 --> 03:43:52,319
and assumed that electromagnetic
 

11889
03:43:52,319 --> 03:43:54,710
and assumed that electromagnetic
radiation was discrete he could fit the

11890
03:43:54,710 --> 03:43:54,720
radiation was discrete he could fit the
 

11891
03:43:54,720 --> 03:43:56,929
radiation was discrete he could fit the
curves he said but you know this is just

11892
03:43:56,929 --> 03:43:56,939
curves he said but you know this is just
 

11893
03:43:56,939 --> 03:43:58,610
curves he said but you know this is just
a you know it just happens to work this

11894
03:43:58,610 --> 03:43:58,620
a you know it just happens to work this
 

11895
03:43:58,620 --> 03:44:00,889
a you know it just happens to work this
way then Einstein came along and said

11896
03:44:00,889 --> 03:44:00,899
way then Einstein came along and said
 

11897
03:44:00,899 --> 03:44:03,469
way then Einstein came along and said
well by the way you know uh the

11898
03:44:03,469 --> 03:44:03,479
well by the way you know uh the
 

11899
03:44:03,479 --> 03:44:05,090
well by the way you know uh the
electromagnetic field might actually be

11900
03:44:05,090 --> 03:44:05,100
electromagnetic field might actually be
 

11901
03:44:05,100 --> 03:44:07,910
electromagnetic field might actually be
discrete it might be made of photons and

11902
03:44:07,910 --> 03:44:07,920
discrete it might be made of photons and
 

11903
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:09,769
discrete it might be made of photons and
then that explains how this all works

11904
03:44:09,769 --> 03:44:09,779
then that explains how this all works
 

11905
03:44:09,779 --> 03:44:12,469
then that explains how this all works
and that was you know in 1905 that was

11906
03:44:12,469 --> 03:44:12,479
and that was you know in 1905 that was
 

11907
03:44:12,479 --> 03:44:14,030
and that was you know in 1905 that was
that was how

11908
03:44:14,030 --> 03:44:14,040
that was how
 

11909
03:44:14,040 --> 03:44:17,210
that was how
um kind of that was how Quant that piece

11910
03:44:17,210 --> 03:44:17,220
um kind of that was how Quant that piece
 

11911
03:44:17,220 --> 03:44:19,190
um kind of that was how Quant that piece
of quantum mechanics got started kind of

11912
03:44:19,190 --> 03:44:19,200
of quantum mechanics got started kind of
 

11913
03:44:19,200 --> 03:44:20,330
of quantum mechanics got started kind of
interesting interesting piece of History

11914
03:44:20,330 --> 03:44:20,340
interesting interesting piece of History
 

11915
03:44:20,340 --> 03:44:22,070
interesting interesting piece of History
I didn't know until I was researching

11916
03:44:22,070 --> 03:44:22,080
I didn't know until I was researching
 

11917
03:44:22,080 --> 03:44:26,330
I didn't know until I was researching
this recently in 1904 and 1903 Einstein

11918
03:44:26,330 --> 03:44:26,340
this recently in 1904 and 1903 Einstein
 

11919
03:44:26,340 --> 03:44:29,269
this recently in 1904 and 1903 Einstein
wrote three different papers and uh so

11920
03:44:29,269 --> 03:44:29,279
wrote three different papers and uh so
 

11921
03:44:29,279 --> 03:44:31,910
wrote three different papers and uh so
you know just sort of a well-known

11922
03:44:31,910 --> 03:44:31,920
you know just sort of a well-known
 

11923
03:44:31,920 --> 03:44:34,550
you know just sort of a well-known
physics history in 1905 Einstein wrote

11924
03:44:34,550 --> 03:44:34,560
physics history in 1905 Einstein wrote
 

11925
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:35,990
physics history in 1905 Einstein wrote
these three papers one introduced

11926
03:44:35,990 --> 03:44:36,000
these three papers one introduced
 

11927
03:44:36,000 --> 03:44:38,389
these three papers one introduced
relativity Theory one explained Brownian

11928
03:44:38,389 --> 03:44:38,399
relativity Theory one explained Brownian
 

11929
03:44:38,399 --> 03:44:40,370
relativity Theory one explained Brownian
motion and one introduced basically

11930
03:44:40,370 --> 03:44:40,380
motion and one introduced basically
 

11931
03:44:40,380 --> 03:44:45,050
motion and one introduced basically
photons so kind of you know kind of a a

11932
03:44:45,050 --> 03:44:45,060
photons so kind of you know kind of a a
 

11933
03:44:45,060 --> 03:44:47,630
photons so kind of you know kind of a a
big deal year for physics and for

11934
03:44:47,630 --> 03:44:47,640
big deal year for physics and for
 

11935
03:44:47,640 --> 03:44:50,030
big deal year for physics and for
Einstein but in the years before that

11936
03:44:50,030 --> 03:44:50,040
Einstein but in the years before that
 

11937
03:44:50,040 --> 03:44:52,190
Einstein but in the years before that
he'd written several papers and what

11938
03:44:52,190 --> 03:44:52,200
he'd written several papers and what
 

11939
03:44:52,200 --> 03:44:53,389
he'd written several papers and what
were they about they were about the

11940
03:44:53,389 --> 03:44:53,399
were they about they were about the
 

11941
03:44:53,399 --> 03:44:55,250
were they about they were about the
second war of thermodynamics and they

11942
03:44:55,250 --> 03:44:55,260
second war of thermodynamics and they
 

11943
03:44:55,260 --> 03:44:56,450
second war of thermodynamics and they
were an attempt to prove the second

11944
03:44:56,450 --> 03:44:56,460
were an attempt to prove the second
 

11945
03:44:56,460 --> 03:44:58,309
were an attempt to prove the second
order of thermodynamics and their

11946
03:44:58,309 --> 03:44:58,319
order of thermodynamics and their
 

11947
03:44:58,319 --> 03:44:59,750
order of thermodynamics and their
nonsense

11948
03:44:59,750 --> 03:44:59,760
nonsense
 

11949
03:44:59,760 --> 03:45:02,150
nonsense
and so I I had no idea that he'd done

11950
03:45:02,150 --> 03:45:02,160
and so I I had no idea that he'd done
 

11951
03:45:02,160 --> 03:45:04,729
and so I I had no idea that he'd done
this interesting oh neither and in fact

11952
03:45:04,729 --> 03:45:04,739
this interesting oh neither and in fact
 

11953
03:45:04,739 --> 03:45:07,969
this interesting oh neither and in fact
what he did those three papers in 1905

11954
03:45:07,969 --> 03:45:07,979
what he did those three papers in 1905
 

11955
03:45:07,979 --> 03:45:09,889
what he did those three papers in 1905
well not so much the relativity paper

11956
03:45:09,889 --> 03:45:09,899
well not so much the relativity paper
 

11957
03:45:09,899 --> 03:45:11,929
well not so much the relativity paper
the one on Brownian motion the one on

11958
03:45:11,929 --> 03:45:11,939
the one on Brownian motion the one on
 

11959
03:45:11,939 --> 03:45:14,870
the one on Brownian motion the one on
photons both of these were about the

11960
03:45:14,870 --> 03:45:14,880
photons both of these were about the
 

11961
03:45:14,880 --> 03:45:17,090
photons both of these were about the
story of sort of making the world

11962
03:45:17,090 --> 03:45:17,100
story of sort of making the world
 

11963
03:45:17,100 --> 03:45:18,769
story of sort of making the world
discreet

11964
03:45:18,769 --> 03:45:18,779
discreet
 

11965
03:45:18,779 --> 03:45:20,269
discreet
um and then he got those like that idea

11966
03:45:20,269 --> 03:45:20,279
um and then he got those like that idea
 

11967
03:45:20,279 --> 03:45:22,490
um and then he got those like that idea
from boltzmann yeah um but boltzmann

11968
03:45:22,490 --> 03:45:22,500
from boltzmann yeah um but boltzmann
 

11969
03:45:22,500 --> 03:45:24,229
from boltzmann yeah um but boltzmann
didn't think you know boltzmann kind of

11970
03:45:24,229 --> 03:45:24,239
didn't think you know boltzmann kind of
 

11971
03:45:24,239 --> 03:45:26,750
didn't think you know boltzmann kind of
died believing you know he said but he

11972
03:45:26,750 --> 03:45:26,760
died believing you know he said but he
 

11973
03:45:26,760 --> 03:45:28,910
died believing you know he said but he
has a quote actually you know uh you

11974
03:45:28,910 --> 03:45:28,920
has a quote actually you know uh you
 

11975
03:45:28,920 --> 03:45:30,170
has a quote actually you know uh you
know in the end things are going to turn

11976
03:45:30,170 --> 03:45:30,180
know in the end things are going to turn
 

11977
03:45:30,180 --> 03:45:31,429
know in the end things are going to turn
out to be discreet and I'm going to

11978
03:45:31,429 --> 03:45:31,439
out to be discreet and I'm going to
 

11979
03:45:31,439 --> 03:45:33,050
out to be discreet and I'm going to
write down what I have to say about this

11980
03:45:33,050 --> 03:45:33,060
write down what I have to say about this
 

11981
03:45:33,060 --> 03:45:35,870
write down what I have to say about this
because uh uh you know eventually the

11982
03:45:35,870 --> 03:45:35,880
because uh uh you know eventually the
 

11983
03:45:35,880 --> 03:45:37,490
because uh uh you know eventually the
stuff will be rediscovered and I want to

11984
03:45:37,490 --> 03:45:37,500
stuff will be rediscovered and I want to
 

11985
03:45:37,500 --> 03:45:39,469
stuff will be rediscovered and I want to
leave you know what I can about how

11986
03:45:39,469 --> 03:45:39,479
leave you know what I can about how
 

11987
03:45:39,479 --> 03:45:40,910
leave you know what I can about how
things are going to be discreet but you

11988
03:45:40,910 --> 03:45:40,920
things are going to be discreet but you
 

11989
03:45:40,920 --> 03:45:42,050
things are going to be discreet but you
know

11990
03:45:42,050 --> 03:45:42,060
know
 

11991
03:45:42,060 --> 03:45:44,330
know
um I think he has some quotes about how

11992
03:45:44,330 --> 03:45:44,340
um I think he has some quotes about how
 

11993
03:45:44,340 --> 03:45:46,729
um I think he has some quotes about how
you know one person can't stand against

11994
03:45:46,729 --> 03:45:46,739
you know one person can't stand against
 

11995
03:45:46,739 --> 03:45:50,870
you know one person can't stand against
the tide of history in um uh in saying

11996
03:45:50,870 --> 03:45:50,880
the tide of history in um uh in saying
 

11997
03:45:50,880 --> 03:45:53,210
the tide of history in um uh in saying
that you know matter is discrete so so

11998
03:45:53,210 --> 03:45:53,220
that you know matter is discrete so so
 

11999
03:45:53,220 --> 03:45:55,790
that you know matter is discrete so so
he stopped by his guns it doesn't matter

12000
03:45:55,790 --> 03:45:55,800
he stopped by his guns it doesn't matter
 

12001
03:45:55,800 --> 03:45:58,969
he stopped by his guns it doesn't matter
is discrete yes he did and and the you

12002
03:45:58,969 --> 03:45:58,979
is discrete yes he did and and the you
 

12003
03:45:58,979 --> 03:46:02,030
is discrete yes he did and and the you
know what's interesting about this is uh

12004
03:46:02,030 --> 03:46:02,040
know what's interesting about this is uh
 

12005
03:46:02,040 --> 03:46:04,250
know what's interesting about this is uh
at the time everybody including Einstein

12006
03:46:04,250 --> 03:46:04,260
at the time everybody including Einstein
 

12007
03:46:04,260 --> 03:46:05,750
at the time everybody including Einstein
kind of assumed that space was probably

12008
03:46:05,750 --> 03:46:05,760
kind of assumed that space was probably
 

12009
03:46:05,760 --> 03:46:07,910
kind of assumed that space was probably
going to end up being discreet too but

12010
03:46:07,910 --> 03:46:07,920
going to end up being discreet too but
 

12011
03:46:07,920 --> 03:46:09,469
going to end up being discreet too but
that didn't work out technically because

12012
03:46:09,469 --> 03:46:09,479
that didn't work out technically because
 

12013
03:46:09,479 --> 03:46:10,910
that didn't work out technically because
it wasn't consistent with relativity

12014
03:46:10,910 --> 03:46:10,920
it wasn't consistent with relativity
 

12015
03:46:10,920 --> 03:46:13,550
it wasn't consistent with relativity
Theory it didn't seem to be and so then

12016
03:46:13,550 --> 03:46:13,560
Theory it didn't seem to be and so then
 

12017
03:46:13,560 --> 03:46:15,710
Theory it didn't seem to be and so then
in the history of physics even though

12018
03:46:15,710 --> 03:46:15,720
in the history of physics even though
 

12019
03:46:15,720 --> 03:46:17,450
in the history of physics even though
people had determined that Mata was

12020
03:46:17,450 --> 03:46:17,460
people had determined that Mata was
 

12021
03:46:17,460 --> 03:46:20,090
people had determined that Mata was
discrete electoral magnetic field was

12022
03:46:20,090 --> 03:46:20,100
discrete electoral magnetic field was
 

12023
03:46:20,100 --> 03:46:23,929
discrete electoral magnetic field was
discrete space was a holdout of not

12024
03:46:23,929 --> 03:46:23,939
discrete space was a holdout of not
 

12025
03:46:23,939 --> 03:46:26,870
discrete space was a holdout of not
being discreet and in fact Einstein 1916

12026
03:46:26,870 --> 03:46:26,880
being discreet and in fact Einstein 1916
 

12027
03:46:26,880 --> 03:46:28,910
being discreet and in fact Einstein 1916
has this nice letter he wrote where he

12028
03:46:28,910 --> 03:46:28,920
has this nice letter he wrote where he
 

12029
03:46:28,920 --> 03:46:30,290
has this nice letter he wrote where he
says in the end it will turn out space

12030
03:46:30,290 --> 03:46:30,300
says in the end it will turn out space
 

12031
03:46:30,300 --> 03:46:32,210
says in the end it will turn out space
is discrete but we don't have the

12032
03:46:32,210 --> 03:46:32,220
is discrete but we don't have the
 

12033
03:46:32,220 --> 03:46:34,250
is discrete but we don't have the
mathematical tools necessary to figure

12034
03:46:34,250 --> 03:46:34,260
mathematical tools necessary to figure
 

12035
03:46:34,260 --> 03:46:36,229
mathematical tools necessary to figure
out how that works yet

12036
03:46:36,229 --> 03:46:36,239
out how that works yet
 

12037
03:46:36,239 --> 03:46:38,690
out how that works yet
and so you know I think it's kind of

12038
03:46:38,690 --> 03:46:38,700
and so you know I think it's kind of
 

12039
03:46:38,700 --> 03:46:41,090
and so you know I think it's kind of
cool that 100 years later we do yes for

12040
03:46:41,090 --> 03:46:41,100
cool that 100 years later we do yes for
 

12041
03:46:41,100 --> 03:46:43,670
cool that 100 years later we do yes for
you you're pretty pretty sure that at

12042
03:46:43,670 --> 03:46:43,680
you you're pretty pretty sure that at
 

12043
03:46:43,680 --> 03:46:45,889
you you're pretty pretty sure that at
every layer of reality it's discreet

12044
03:46:45,889 --> 03:46:45,899
every layer of reality it's discreet
 

12045
03:46:45,899 --> 03:46:48,590
every layer of reality it's discreet
right and that space is discrete and

12046
03:46:48,590 --> 03:46:48,600
right and that space is discrete and
 

12047
03:46:48,600 --> 03:46:51,050
right and that space is discrete and
that uh the I mean and in fact one of

12048
03:46:51,050 --> 03:46:51,060
that uh the I mean and in fact one of
 

12049
03:46:51,060 --> 03:46:52,610
that uh the I mean and in fact one of
the things I realized recently is this

12050
03:46:52,610 --> 03:46:52,620
the things I realized recently is this
 

12051
03:46:52,620 --> 03:46:56,510
the things I realized recently is this
kind of theory of heat that um uh

12052
03:46:56,510 --> 03:46:56,520
kind of theory of heat that um uh
 

12053
03:46:56,520 --> 03:46:58,790
kind of theory of heat that um uh
that the um you know that heat is really

12054
03:46:58,790 --> 03:46:58,800
that the um you know that heat is really
 

12055
03:46:58,800 --> 03:47:00,710
that the um you know that heat is really
this continuous fluid

12056
03:47:00,710 --> 03:47:00,720
this continuous fluid
 

12057
03:47:00,720 --> 03:47:04,130
this continuous fluid
um it's it's kind of like uh the the you

12058
03:47:04,130 --> 03:47:04,140
um it's it's kind of like uh the the you
 

12059
03:47:04,140 --> 03:47:05,630
um it's it's kind of like uh the the you
know the caloric theory of heat which

12060
03:47:05,630 --> 03:47:05,640
know the caloric theory of heat which
 

12061
03:47:05,640 --> 03:47:07,070
know the caloric theory of heat which
turns out to be completely wrong because

12062
03:47:07,070 --> 03:47:07,080
turns out to be completely wrong because
 

12063
03:47:07,080 --> 03:47:08,690
turns out to be completely wrong because
actually heat is the motion of a

12064
03:47:08,690 --> 03:47:08,700
actually heat is the motion of a
 

12065
03:47:08,700 --> 03:47:10,849
actually heat is the motion of a
discrete molecules unless you know there

12066
03:47:10,849 --> 03:47:10,859
discrete molecules unless you know there
 

12067
03:47:10,859 --> 03:47:12,229
discrete molecules unless you know there
are discrete molecules it's hard to

12068
03:47:12,229 --> 03:47:12,239
are discrete molecules it's hard to
 

12069
03:47:12,239 --> 03:47:13,870
are discrete molecules it's hard to
understand what heat could possibly be

12070
03:47:13,870 --> 03:47:13,880
understand what heat could possibly be
 

12071
03:47:13,880 --> 03:47:17,389
understand what heat could possibly be
well you know I think space is is

12072
03:47:17,389 --> 03:47:17,399
well you know I think space is is
 

12073
03:47:17,399 --> 03:47:19,849
well you know I think space is is
discrete and the question is kind of

12074
03:47:19,849 --> 03:47:19,859
discrete and the question is kind of
 

12075
03:47:19,859 --> 03:47:22,070
discrete and the question is kind of
what's the analog of the mistake that

12076
03:47:22,070 --> 03:47:22,080
what's the analog of the mistake that
 

12077
03:47:22,080 --> 03:47:23,929
what's the analog of the mistake that
was made with caloric

12078
03:47:23,929 --> 03:47:23,939
was made with caloric
 

12079
03:47:23,939 --> 03:47:27,830
was made with caloric
in the case of space and so I'm my my

12080
03:47:27,830 --> 03:47:27,840
in the case of space and so I'm my my
 

12081
03:47:27,840 --> 03:47:31,670
in the case of space and so I'm my my
current guess is that dark matter is as

12082
03:47:31,670 --> 03:47:31,680
current guess is that dark matter is as
 

12083
03:47:31,680 --> 03:47:34,010
current guess is that dark matter is as
I've my little sort of aphorism of the

12084
03:47:34,010 --> 03:47:34,020
I've my little sort of aphorism of the
 

12085
03:47:34,020 --> 03:47:36,530
I've my little sort of aphorism of the
of the last few months has been you know

12086
03:47:36,530 --> 03:47:36,540
of the last few months has been you know
 

12087
03:47:36,540 --> 03:47:38,630
of the last few months has been you know
dark matter is the caloric of our time

12088
03:47:38,630 --> 03:47:38,640
dark matter is the caloric of our time
 

12089
03:47:38,640 --> 03:47:41,870
dark matter is the caloric of our time
that is it will turn out the dark matter

12090
03:47:41,870 --> 03:47:41,880
that is it will turn out the dark matter
 

12091
03:47:41,880 --> 03:47:45,050
that is it will turn out the dark matter
is a feature of space and it is not a

12092
03:47:45,050 --> 03:47:45,060
is a feature of space and it is not a
 

12093
03:47:45,060 --> 03:47:47,150
is a feature of space and it is not a
bunch of particles you know at the time

12094
03:47:47,150 --> 03:47:47,160
bunch of particles you know at the time
 

12095
03:47:47,160 --> 03:47:48,590
bunch of particles you know at the time
when when people were talking about heat

12096
03:47:48,590 --> 03:47:48,600
when when people were talking about heat
 

12097
03:47:48,600 --> 03:47:50,690
when when people were talking about heat
they knew about fluids and they said

12098
03:47:50,690 --> 03:47:50,700
they knew about fluids and they said
 

12099
03:47:50,700 --> 03:47:52,250
they knew about fluids and they said
well heat must just be another kind of

12100
03:47:52,250 --> 03:47:52,260
well heat must just be another kind of
 

12101
03:47:52,260 --> 03:47:53,389
well heat must just be another kind of
fluid because that's what they knew

12102
03:47:53,389 --> 03:47:53,399
fluid because that's what they knew
 

12103
03:47:53,399 --> 03:47:55,490
fluid because that's what they knew
about yes but now people know about

12104
03:47:55,490 --> 03:47:55,500
about yes but now people know about
 

12105
03:47:55,500 --> 03:47:57,050
about yes but now people know about
particles and so they say well what's

12106
03:47:57,050 --> 03:47:57,060
particles and so they say well what's
 

12107
03:47:57,060 --> 03:47:59,750
particles and so they say well what's
dark matter it's not it's not it just

12108
03:47:59,750 --> 03:47:59,760
dark matter it's not it's not it just
 

12109
03:47:59,760 --> 03:48:01,670
dark matter it's not it's not it just
must be particles so what could dark

12110
03:48:01,670 --> 03:48:01,680
must be particles so what could dark
 

12111
03:48:01,680 --> 03:48:04,070
must be particles so what could dark
matter be as a feature of space Oh I

12112
03:48:04,070 --> 03:48:04,080
matter be as a feature of space Oh I
 

12113
03:48:04,080 --> 03:48:05,870
matter be as a feature of space Oh I
don't know yet all right um I mean I

12114
03:48:05,870 --> 03:48:05,880
don't know yet all right um I mean I
 

12115
03:48:05,880 --> 03:48:07,790
don't know yet all right um I mean I
think the the thing I'm really one of

12116
03:48:07,790 --> 03:48:07,800
think the the thing I'm really one of
 

12117
03:48:07,800 --> 03:48:09,469
think the the thing I'm really one of
the things I'm hoping to be able to do

12118
03:48:09,469 --> 03:48:09,479
the things I'm hoping to be able to do
 

12119
03:48:09,479 --> 03:48:11,870
the things I'm hoping to be able to do
is to find the analog of brown in Motion

12120
03:48:11,870 --> 03:48:11,880
is to find the analog of brown in Motion
 

12121
03:48:11,880 --> 03:48:14,750
is to find the analog of brown in Motion
in space so in other words Brown in

12122
03:48:14,750 --> 03:48:14,760
in space so in other words Brown in
 

12123
03:48:14,760 --> 03:48:17,030
in space so in other words Brown in
motion was was seeing down to the level

12124
03:48:17,030 --> 03:48:17,040
motion was was seeing down to the level
 

12125
03:48:17,040 --> 03:48:19,190
motion was was seeing down to the level
of an effect from Individual molecules

12126
03:48:19,190 --> 03:48:19,200
of an effect from Individual molecules
 

12127
03:48:19,200 --> 03:48:21,950
of an effect from Individual molecules
and so in the case of space you know

12128
03:48:21,950 --> 03:48:21,960
and so in the case of space you know
 

12129
03:48:21,960 --> 03:48:23,450
and so in the case of space you know
most of the things the things we see

12130
03:48:23,450 --> 03:48:23,460
most of the things the things we see
 

12131
03:48:23,460 --> 03:48:25,729
most of the things the things we see
about space so far just everything seems

12132
03:48:25,729 --> 03:48:25,739
about space so far just everything seems
 

12133
03:48:25,739 --> 03:48:27,889
about space so far just everything seems
continuous Brownian motion have been

12134
03:48:27,889 --> 03:48:27,899
continuous Brownian motion have been
 

12135
03:48:27,899 --> 03:48:30,170
continuous Brownian motion have been
discovered in the 1830s and it was only

12136
03:48:30,170 --> 03:48:30,180
discovered in the 1830s and it was only
 

12137
03:48:30,180 --> 03:48:32,690
discovered in the 1830s and it was only
identified what it was what it was the

12138
03:48:32,690 --> 03:48:32,700
identified what it was what it was the
 

12139
03:48:32,700 --> 03:48:36,110
identified what it was what it was the
the result of bias uh smallochowski and

12140
03:48:36,110 --> 03:48:36,120
the result of bias uh smallochowski and
 

12141
03:48:36,120 --> 03:48:38,090
the result of bias uh smallochowski and

century and you know Dark Matter was was

12144
03:48:40,610 --> 03:48:40,620
century and you know Dark Matter was was
 

12145
03:48:40,620 --> 03:48:42,290
century and you know Dark Matter was was
discovered that phenomenon was

12146
03:48:42,290 --> 03:48:42,300
discovered that phenomenon was
 

12147
03:48:42,300 --> 03:48:44,210
discovered that phenomenon was
discovered 100 years ago

12148
03:48:44,210 --> 03:48:44,220
discovered 100 years ago
 

12149
03:48:44,220 --> 03:48:45,530
discovered 100 years ago
um you know the rotation curves of

12150
03:48:45,530 --> 03:48:45,540
um you know the rotation curves of
 

12151
03:48:45,540 --> 03:48:47,450
um you know the rotation curves of

12155
03:48:49,680 --> 03:48:52,309
matter that was discovered 100 years ago
and I think you know that I I wouldn't

12156
03:48:52,309 --> 03:48:52,319
and I think you know that I I wouldn't
 

12157
03:48:52,319 --> 03:48:54,050
and I think you know that I I wouldn't
be surprised if there isn't an effect

be surprised if there isn't an effect

be surprised if there isn't an effect
that we already know about that is kind

12160
03:48:57,290 --> 03:48:57,300
that we already know about that is kind
 

12161
03:48:57,300 --> 03:48:59,570
that we already know about that is kind
of the analog of brown in motion that

12162
03:48:59,570 --> 03:48:59,580
of the analog of brown in motion that
 

12163
03:48:59,580 --> 03:49:01,969
of the analog of brown in motion that
reveals the discreetness of space and in

03:49:01,969 --> 03:49:01,979
reveals the discreetness of space and in
 

12165
03:49:01,979 --> 03:49:03,410
reveals the discreetness of space and in
fact we're beginning to have some

12166
03:49:03,410 --> 03:49:03,420
fact we're beginning to have some
 

12167
03:49:03,420 --> 03:49:05,929
fact we're beginning to have some
guesses we have some some evidence that

12168
03:49:05,929 --> 03:49:05,939
guesses we have some some evidence that
 

12169
03:49:05,939 --> 03:49:08,030
guesses we have some some evidence that
black hole mergers work differently when

black hole mergers work differently when
there's discrete space and there may be

03:49:14,399 --> 03:49:16,790
wave signatures and things associated
with the discreetness of space but this

12178
03:49:16,790 --> 03:49:16,800
with the discreetness of space but this
 

12179
03:49:16,800 --> 03:49:18,889
with the discreetness of space but this
is kind of uh for me it's kind of it's

12180
03:49:18,889 --> 03:49:18,899
is kind of uh for me it's kind of it's
 

12181
03:49:18,899 --> 03:49:20,269
is kind of uh for me it's kind of it's
kind of interesting to see this sort of

12182
03:49:20,269 --> 03:49:20,279
kind of interesting to see this sort of
 

12183
03:49:20,279 --> 03:49:22,130
kind of interesting to see this sort of
recapitulation of the history of physics

12184
03:49:22,130 --> 03:49:22,140
recapitulation of the history of physics
 

12185
03:49:22,140 --> 03:49:25,670
recapitulation of the history of physics
where people you know vehemently say you

12186
03:49:25,670 --> 03:49:25,680
where people you know vehemently say you
 

12187
03:49:25,680 --> 03:49:27,309
where people you know vehemently say you
know matter is continuous

12188
03:49:27,309 --> 03:49:27,319
know matter is continuous
 

12189
03:49:27,319 --> 03:49:29,870
know matter is continuous
electromagnetic field is continuous and

12190
03:49:29,870 --> 03:49:29,880
electromagnetic field is continuous and
 

12191
03:49:29,880 --> 03:49:31,250
electromagnetic field is continuous and
turns out it isn't true and then they

12192
03:49:31,250 --> 03:49:31,260
turns out it isn't true and then they
 

12193
03:49:31,260 --> 03:49:33,590
turns out it isn't true and then they
say space is continuous But but so you

12194
03:49:33,590 --> 03:49:33,600
say space is continuous But but so you
 

12195
03:49:33,600 --> 03:49:35,870
say space is continuous But but so you
know entropy is the number of states of

12196
03:49:35,870 --> 03:49:35,880
know entropy is the number of states of
 

12197
03:49:35,880 --> 03:49:37,130
know entropy is the number of states of
the system consistent with some

03:49:37,130 --> 03:49:37,140
the system consistent with some
 

12199
03:49:37,140 --> 03:49:40,610
the system consistent with some
constraint yes and the the thing is that

12200
03:49:40,610 --> 03:49:40,620
constraint yes and the the thing is that
 

12201
03:49:40,620 --> 03:49:42,769
constraint yes and the the thing is that
if you have if you know in great detail

12202
03:49:42,769 --> 03:49:42,779
if you have if you know in great detail

if you have if you know in great detail
the position of every molecule in the

the entropy is is always zero because

12208
03:49:49,969 --> 03:49:49,979
the entropy is is always zero because
 

12209
03:49:49,979 --> 03:49:52,490
the entropy is is always zero because
there's only one possible State the the

12210
03:49:52,490 --> 03:49:52,500
there's only one possible State the the
 

12211
03:49:52,500 --> 03:49:54,170
there's only one possible State the the
configuration of molecules and the gas

12212
03:49:54,170 --> 03:49:54,180
configuration of molecules and the gas
 

12213
03:49:54,180 --> 03:49:56,389

03:49:56,389 --> 03:49:56,399
the molecules bounce around they have a
 

12215
03:49:56,399 --> 03:49:58,490
the molecules bounce around they have a
certain rule for bouncing around there's

12216
03:49:58,490 --> 03:49:58,500
certain rule for bouncing around there's
 

12217
03:49:58,500 --> 03:50:00,830
certain rule for bouncing around there's
just one state of the gas evolves to one

just one state of the gas evolves to one
 

12219
03:50:00,840 --> 03:50:03,110
just one state of the gas evolves to one
state of the gas and so on but it's only

12220
03:50:03,110 --> 03:50:03,120
state of the gas and so on but it's only
 

12221
03:50:03,120 --> 03:50:05,210

if you don't know in detail where all

12222
03:50:05,210 --> 03:50:05,220
if you don't know in detail where all
 

12223
03:50:05,220 --> 03:50:08,090
if you don't know in detail where all
the molecules are that you can say well

03:50:08,100 --> 03:50:10,610
the molecules are that you can say well
the entropy increases because the things

12226
03:50:10,610 --> 03:50:10,620
the entropy increases because the things
 

12227
03:50:10,620 --> 03:50:12,469
the entropy increases because the things
we do know about the molecules there are

12228
03:50:12,469 --> 03:50:12,479
we do know about the molecules there are
 

12229
03:50:12,479 --> 03:50:14,330
we do know about the molecules there are
more possible microscopic states of the

12230
03:50:14,330 --> 03:50:14,340
more possible microscopic states of the
 

12231
03:50:14,340 --> 03:50:16,190
more possible microscopic states of the

12233
03:50:16,200 --> 03:50:18,950
system consistent with what we do know
about where the molecules are and so the

12234
03:50:18,950 --> 03:50:18,960
about where the molecules are and so the
 

12235
03:50:18,960 --> 03:50:20,570
about where the molecules are and so the
question of whether

12236
03:50:20,570 --> 03:50:20,580
question of whether
 

12237
03:50:20,580 --> 03:50:24,050
question of whether
um so people this sort of paradox in a

12238
03:50:24,050 --> 03:50:24,060
um so people this sort of paradox in a
 

12239
03:50:24,060 --> 03:50:25,550
um so people this sort of paradox in a
sense of oh if we knew where all the

12240
03:50:25,550 --> 03:50:25,560
sense of oh if we knew where all the
 

12241
03:50:25,560 --> 03:50:26,690
sense of oh if we knew where all the
molecules were the entropy wouldn't

12242
03:50:26,690 --> 03:50:26,700
molecules were the entropy wouldn't

American physics Professor was sort of
 

12253
03:50:39,600 --> 03:50:41,690
American physics Professor was sort of
the first distinguished American physics

you know these molecules have a detail
 

12263
03:50:51,300 --> 03:50:53,210
you know these molecules have a detail
where they're bouncing around but we can

12264
03:50:53,210 --> 03:50:53,220
where they're bouncing around but we can
 

12265
03:50:53,220 --> 03:50:55,190
where they're bouncing around but we can
only observe a coarse grained version of

knew what a valid course screening would
 

12271
03:51:00,120 --> 03:51:02,870
knew what a valid course screening would
be so nobody knew that whether you could

03:51:02,870 --> 03:51:02,880
be so nobody knew that whether you could
 

12273
03:51:02,880 --> 03:51:04,550
be so nobody knew that whether you could
have the score screening that very

coarse grained result is with copy with
a sort of computationally bounded

12332
03:52:16,190 --> 03:52:16,200
a sort of computationally bounded
 

12333
03:52:16,200 --> 03:52:19,790
a sort of computationally bounded
observation then inevitably there are

12334
03:52:19,790 --> 03:52:19,800
observation then inevitably there are
 

12335
03:52:19,800 --> 03:52:21,950
observation then inevitably there are
many possible underlying configurations

12336
03:52:21,950 --> 03:52:21,960
many possible underlying configurations
 

12337
03:52:21,960 --> 03:52:24,110
many possible underlying configurations
that are consistent with that just to

12338
03:52:24,110 --> 03:52:24,120
that are consistent with that just to
 

12339
03:52:24,120 --> 03:52:27,530
that are consistent with that just to
clarify basically any Observer that

12340
03:52:27,530 --> 03:52:27,540
clarify basically any Observer that
 

12341
03:52:27,540 --> 03:52:29,570
clarify basically any Observer that
exists inside the universe

12342
03:52:29,570 --> 03:52:29,580

12345
03:52:31,560 --> 03:52:34,429

no any Observer like us I don't know I

12346
03:52:34,429 --> 03:52:34,439
no any Observer like us I don't know I
 

12347
03:52:34,439 --> 03:52:36,590
no any Observer like us I don't know I
can't say like us what do you mean what

12348
03:52:36,590 --> 03:52:36,600
can't say like us what do you mean what
 

12349
03:52:36,600 --> 03:52:39,050
can't say like us what do you mean what
do you mean like us well

12350
03:52:39,050 --> 03:52:39,060
do you mean like us well
 

12351
03:52:39,060 --> 03:52:41,809
do you mean like us well
humans with finite Minds you're

12352
03:52:41,809 --> 03:52:41,819
humans with finite Minds you're
 

12353
03:52:41,819 --> 03:52:45,170
humans with finite Minds you're
including the tools of science yeah yeah

12354
03:52:45,170 --> 03:52:45,180
including the tools of science yeah yeah
 

12355
03:52:45,180 --> 03:52:48,650
including the tools of science yeah yeah
I mean and and as we you know we have

12356
03:52:48,650 --> 03:52:48,660
I mean and and as we you know we have
 

12357
03:52:48,660 --> 03:52:51,229
I mean and and as we you know we have
more precise and by the way there are

12358
03:52:51,229 --> 03:52:51,239
more precise and by the way there are
 

12359
03:52:51,239 --> 03:52:53,210
more precise and by the way there are
little sort of microscopic violations of

12360
03:52:53,210 --> 03:52:53,220
little sort of microscopic violations of
 

12361
03:52:53,220 --> 03:52:54,950
little sort of microscopic violations of
the second order of thermodynamics that

12362
03:52:54,950 --> 03:52:54,960
the second order of thermodynamics that
 

12363
03:52:54,960 --> 03:52:56,809
the second order of thermodynamics that
you can start to have when you have more

12364
03:52:56,809 --> 03:52:56,819
you can start to have when you have more
 

12365
03:52:56,819 --> 03:52:58,370
you can start to have when you have more
precise measurements of where precisely

12366
03:52:58,370 --> 03:52:58,380
precise measurements of where precisely
 

12367
03:52:58,380 --> 03:53:02,450
precise measurements of where precisely
molecules are but for uh for a large

12368
03:53:02,450 --> 03:53:02,460
molecules are but for uh for a large
 

12369
03:53:02,460 --> 03:53:04,550
molecules are but for uh for a large
scale when you have enough molecules we

12370
03:53:04,550 --> 03:53:04,560
scale when you have enough molecules we
 

12371
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:07,010
scale when you have enough molecules we
don't have you know we're not tracing

12372
03:53:07,010 --> 03:53:07,020
don't have you know we're not tracing
 

12373
03:53:07,020 --> 03:53:08,510
don't have you know we're not tracing
all those molecules and we just don't

12374
03:53:08,510 --> 03:53:08,520
all those molecules and we just don't
 

12375
03:53:08,520 --> 03:53:10,490
all those molecules and we just don't
have the computational resources to do

12376
03:53:10,490 --> 03:53:10,500
have the computational resources to do
 

12377
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:13,610
have the computational resources to do
that and it wouldn't be uh you know I

12378
03:53:13,610 --> 03:53:13,620
that and it wouldn't be uh you know I
 

12379
03:53:13,620 --> 03:53:16,910
that and it wouldn't be uh you know I
think the the to imagine what an

12380
03:53:16,910 --> 03:53:16,920
think the the to imagine what an
 

12381
03:53:16,920 --> 03:53:19,250
think the the to imagine what an
observer who is not computationally

12382
03:53:19,250 --> 03:53:19,260
observer who is not computationally
 

12383
03:53:19,260 --> 03:53:20,990
observer who is not computationally
bounded would be like

12384
03:53:20,990 --> 03:53:21,000
bounded would be like
 

12385
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:23,330
bounded would be like
it's an interesting thing because okay

12386
03:53:23,330 --> 03:53:23,340
it's an interesting thing because okay
 

12387
03:53:23,340 --> 03:53:25,010
it's an interesting thing because okay
so what does computational boundedness

12388
03:53:25,010 --> 03:53:25,020
so what does computational boundedness
 

12389
03:53:25,020 --> 03:53:27,469
so what does computational boundedness
mean among other things it means we

12390
03:53:27,469 --> 03:53:27,479
mean among other things it means we
 

12391
03:53:27,479 --> 03:53:30,110
mean among other things it means we
conclude that definite things happen we

12392
03:53:30,110 --> 03:53:30,120
conclude that definite things happen we
 

12393
03:53:30,120 --> 03:53:32,330
conclude that definite things happen we
go we take all this complexity of the

12394
03:53:32,330 --> 03:53:32,340
go we take all this complexity of the
 

12395
03:53:32,340 --> 03:53:34,130
go we take all this complexity of the
world and we make a decision we're going

12396
03:53:34,130 --> 03:53:34,140
world and we make a decision we're going
 

12397
03:53:34,140 --> 03:53:37,309
world and we make a decision we're going
to turn left or turn right and that is

12398
03:53:37,309 --> 03:53:37,319
to turn left or turn right and that is
 

12399
03:53:37,319 --> 03:53:41,630
to turn left or turn right and that is
kind of reducing all this kind of uh

12400
03:53:41,630 --> 03:53:41,640
kind of reducing all this kind of uh
 

12401
03:53:41,640 --> 03:53:44,389
kind of reducing all this kind of uh
detail into we're observing it we're

12402
03:53:44,389 --> 03:53:44,399
detail into we're observing it we're
 

12403
03:53:44,399 --> 03:53:46,729
detail into we're observing it we're
we're sort of crushing it down to this

12404
03:53:46,729 --> 03:53:46,739
we're sort of crushing it down to this
 

12405
03:53:46,739 --> 03:53:49,550
we're sort of crushing it down to this
this one thing yeah and and that if we

12406
03:53:49,550 --> 03:53:49,560
this one thing yeah and and that if we
 

12407
03:53:49,560 --> 03:53:50,870
this one thing yeah and and that if we
didn't do that

12408
03:53:50,870 --> 03:53:50,880
didn't do that
 

12409
03:53:50,880 --> 03:53:53,210
didn't do that
uh we wouldn't we wouldn't have all this

12410
03:53:53,210 --> 03:53:53,220
uh we wouldn't we wouldn't have all this
 

12411
03:53:53,220 --> 03:53:55,130
uh we wouldn't we wouldn't have all this
sort of symbolic structure that we build

12412
03:53:55,130 --> 03:53:55,140
sort of symbolic structure that we build
 

12413
03:53:55,140 --> 03:53:57,769
sort of symbolic structure that we build
up that lets us think things through

12414
03:53:57,769 --> 03:53:57,779
up that lets us think things through
 

12415
03:53:57,779 --> 03:54:00,950
up that lets us think things through
with our finite Minds we'd be instead

12416
03:54:00,950 --> 03:54:00,960
with our finite Minds we'd be instead
 

12417
03:54:00,960 --> 03:54:03,170
with our finite Minds we'd be instead
you know we'd be just we'd be sort of

12418
03:54:03,170 --> 03:54:03,180
you know we'd be just we'd be sort of
 

12419
03:54:03,180 --> 03:54:06,229
you know we'd be just we'd be sort of
one with the universe yeah so content

12420
03:54:06,229 --> 03:54:06,239
one with the universe yeah so content
 

12421
03:54:06,239 --> 03:54:09,290
one with the universe yeah so content
to not simplify yes if we didn't

12422
03:54:09,290 --> 03:54:09,300
to not simplify yes if we didn't
 

12423
03:54:09,300 --> 03:54:13,309
to not simplify yes if we didn't
simplify then we wouldn't be like us we

12424
03:54:13,309 --> 03:54:13,319
simplify then we wouldn't be like us we
 

12425
03:54:13,319 --> 03:54:16,190
simplify then we wouldn't be like us we
would be like the universe like the the

12426
03:54:16,190 --> 03:54:16,200
would be like the universe like the the
 

12427
03:54:16,200 --> 03:54:18,590
would be like the universe like the the
intrinsic universe but not having

12428
03:54:18,590 --> 03:54:18,600
intrinsic universe but not having
 

12429
03:54:18,600 --> 03:54:21,050
intrinsic universe but not having
experiences like the experiences we have

12430
03:54:21,050 --> 03:54:21,060
experiences like the experiences we have
 

12431
03:54:21,060 --> 03:54:23,389
experiences like the experiences we have
where we for example conclude that

12432
03:54:23,389 --> 03:54:23,399
where we for example conclude that
 

12433
03:54:23,399 --> 03:54:26,750
where we for example conclude that
definite things happen we you know we we

12434
03:54:26,750 --> 03:54:26,760
definite things happen we you know we we
 

12435
03:54:26,760 --> 03:54:30,050
definite things happen we you know we we
sort of have this this uh uh notion of

12436
03:54:30,050 --> 03:54:30,060
sort of have this this uh uh notion of
 

12437
03:54:30,060 --> 03:54:32,330
sort of have this this uh uh notion of
being able to make make sort of

12438
03:54:32,330 --> 03:54:32,340
being able to make make sort of
 

12439
03:54:32,340 --> 03:54:34,370
being able to make make sort of
narrative statements yeah I wonder if

12440
03:54:34,370 --> 03:54:34,380
narrative statements yeah I wonder if
 

12441
03:54:34,380 --> 03:54:36,410
narrative statements yeah I wonder if
it's just like you imagined as a thought

12442
03:54:36,410 --> 03:54:36,420
it's just like you imagined as a thought
 

12443
03:54:36,420 --> 03:54:38,030
it's just like you imagined as a thought
experiment what it's like to be a

12444
03:54:38,030 --> 03:54:38,040
experiment what it's like to be a
 

12445
03:54:38,040 --> 03:54:39,950
experiment what it's like to be a
computer I wonder if it's possible to

12446
03:54:39,950 --> 03:54:39,960
computer I wonder if it's possible to
 

12447
03:54:39,960 --> 03:54:41,990
computer I wonder if it's possible to
try to begin to imagine what it's like

12448
03:54:41,990 --> 03:54:42,000
try to begin to imagine what it's like
 

12449
03:54:42,000 --> 03:54:45,189
try to begin to imagine what it's like
to be an unbounded computational

12450
03:54:45,189 --> 03:54:45,199
to be an unbounded computational
 

12451
03:54:45,199 --> 03:54:49,550
to be an unbounded computational
well okay so here's here's how that I

12452
03:54:49,550 --> 03:54:49,560
well okay so here's here's how that I
 

12453
03:54:49,560 --> 03:54:52,969
well okay so here's here's how that I
think plays out vibrations suck yeah so

12454
03:54:52,969 --> 03:54:52,979
think plays out vibrations suck yeah so
 

12455
03:54:52,979 --> 03:54:55,130
think plays out vibrations suck yeah so
I mean in this we talk about this

12456
03:54:55,130 --> 03:54:55,140
I mean in this we talk about this
 

12457
03:54:55,140 --> 03:54:56,929
I mean in this we talk about this
rouliad the space of all possible

12458
03:54:56,929 --> 03:54:56,939
rouliad the space of all possible
 

12459
03:54:56,939 --> 03:55:00,290
rouliad the space of all possible
computation yes and this idea of you

12460
03:55:00,290 --> 03:55:00,300
computation yes and this idea of you
 

12461
03:55:00,300 --> 03:55:01,729
computation yes and this idea of you
know being at a certain place in the

12462
03:55:01,729 --> 03:55:01,739
know being at a certain place in the
 

12463
03:55:01,739 --> 03:55:04,429
know being at a certain place in the
rouliad which corresponds to sort of a

12464
03:55:04,429 --> 03:55:04,439
rouliad which corresponds to sort of a
 

12465
03:55:04,439 --> 03:55:07,670
rouliad which corresponds to sort of a
certain way of of rep of a certain set

12466
03:55:07,670 --> 03:55:07,680
certain way of of rep of a certain set
 

12467
03:55:07,680 --> 03:55:09,769
certain way of of rep of a certain set
of computations that you're representing

12468
03:55:09,769 --> 03:55:09,779
of computations that you're representing
 

12469
03:55:09,779 --> 03:55:13,250
of computations that you're representing
things in terms of okay so as you expand

12470
03:55:13,250 --> 03:55:13,260
things in terms of okay so as you expand
 

12471
03:55:13,260 --> 03:55:15,110
things in terms of okay so as you expand
out in the rouliad as you kind of

12472
03:55:15,110 --> 03:55:15,120
out in the rouliad as you kind of
 

12473
03:55:15,120 --> 03:55:18,229
out in the rouliad as you kind of
Encompass more possible views of the

12474
03:55:18,229 --> 03:55:18,239
Encompass more possible views of the
 

12475
03:55:18,239 --> 03:55:20,150
Encompass more possible views of the
universe as you Encompass more possible

12476
03:55:20,150 --> 03:55:20,160
universe as you Encompass more possible
 

12477
03:55:20,160 --> 03:55:22,389
universe as you Encompass more possible
kinds of computations that you can do

12478
03:55:22,389 --> 03:55:22,399
kinds of computations that you can do
 

12479
03:55:22,399 --> 03:55:24,530
kinds of computations that you can do
eventually you might say that's a real

12480
03:55:24,530 --> 03:55:24,540
eventually you might say that's a real
 

12481
03:55:24,540 --> 03:55:26,269
eventually you might say that's a real
win you know we're colonizing the

12482
03:55:26,269 --> 03:55:26,279
win you know we're colonizing the
 

12483
03:55:26,279 --> 03:55:28,910
win you know we're colonizing the
rouliad we're we're building out more

12484
03:55:28,910 --> 03:55:28,920
rouliad we're we're building out more
 

12485
03:55:28,920 --> 03:55:30,229
rouliad we're we're building out more
paradigms about how to think about

12486
03:55:30,229 --> 03:55:30,239
paradigms about how to think about
 

12487
03:55:30,239 --> 03:55:33,050
paradigms about how to think about
things and eventually you might say we

12488
03:55:33,050 --> 03:55:33,060
things and eventually you might say we
 

12489
03:55:33,060 --> 03:55:34,849
things and eventually you might say we
we won all the way we managed to

12490
03:55:34,849 --> 03:55:34,859
we won all the way we managed to
 

12491
03:55:34,859 --> 03:55:37,250
we won all the way we managed to
colonize the whole Riyadh okay here's

12492
03:55:37,250 --> 03:55:37,260
colonize the whole Riyadh okay here's
 

12493
03:55:37,260 --> 03:55:38,870
colonize the whole Riyadh okay here's
the problem with that the problem is

12494
03:55:38,870 --> 03:55:38,880
the problem with that the problem is
 

12495
03:55:38,880 --> 03:55:41,689
the problem with that the problem is
that the notion of existence coherent

12496
03:55:41,689 --> 03:55:41,699
that the notion of existence coherent
 

12497
03:55:41,699 --> 03:55:42,849
that the notion of existence coherent
existence

12498
03:55:42,849 --> 03:55:42,859
existence
 

12499
03:55:42,859 --> 03:55:45,530
existence
requires some kind of specialization by

12500
03:55:45,530 --> 03:55:45,540
requires some kind of specialization by
 

12501
03:55:45,540 --> 03:55:47,570
requires some kind of specialization by
the time you are the whole rouliad by

12502
03:55:47,570 --> 03:55:47,580
the time you are the whole rouliad by
 

12503
03:55:47,580 --> 03:55:50,030
the time you are the whole rouliad by
the time you cover the whole rouliad in

12504
03:55:50,030 --> 03:55:50,040
the time you cover the whole rouliad in
 

12505
03:55:50,040 --> 03:55:52,790
the time you cover the whole rouliad in
no useful sense do you coherently exist

12506
03:55:52,790 --> 03:55:52,800
no useful sense do you coherently exist
 

12507
03:55:52,800 --> 03:55:56,689
no useful sense do you coherently exist
so in other words in inches the notion

12508
03:55:56,689 --> 03:55:56,699
so in other words in inches the notion
 

12509
03:55:56,699 --> 03:55:59,150
so in other words in inches the notion
of existence the notion of what we think

12510
03:55:59,150 --> 03:55:59,160
of existence the notion of what we think
 

12511
03:55:59,160 --> 03:56:02,510
of existence the notion of what we think
of as as definite existence requires

12512
03:56:02,510 --> 03:56:02,520
of as as definite existence requires
 

12513
03:56:02,520 --> 03:56:04,490
of as as definite existence requires
this kind of specialization requires

12514
03:56:04,490 --> 03:56:04,500
this kind of specialization requires
 

12515
03:56:04,500 --> 03:56:08,110
this kind of specialization requires
this kind of idea that we are we are not

12516
03:56:08,110 --> 03:56:08,120
this kind of idea that we are we are not
 

12517
03:56:08,120 --> 03:56:11,809
this kind of idea that we are we are not
all possible things we are the a

12518
03:56:11,809 --> 03:56:11,819
all possible things we are the a
 

12519
03:56:11,819 --> 03:56:14,150
all possible things we are the a
particular set of things and that's kind

12520
03:56:14,150 --> 03:56:14,160
particular set of things and that's kind
 

12521
03:56:14,160 --> 03:56:16,969
particular set of things and that's kind
of how we uh that that's kind of what

12522
03:56:16,969 --> 03:56:16,979
of how we uh that that's kind of what
 

12523
03:56:16,979 --> 03:56:19,370
of how we uh that that's kind of what
what makes us have a coherent existence

12524
03:56:19,370 --> 03:56:19,380
what makes us have a coherent existence
 

12525
03:56:19,380 --> 03:56:21,590
what makes us have a coherent existence
if we were spread throughout the rouliad

12526
03:56:21,590 --> 03:56:21,600
if we were spread throughout the rouliad
 

12527
03:56:21,600 --> 03:56:24,349
if we were spread throughout the rouliad
we would not there would be no coherence

12528
03:56:24,349 --> 03:56:24,359
we would not there would be no coherence
 

12529
03:56:24,359 --> 03:56:26,570
we would not there would be no coherence
to the way that we work we would work in

12530
03:56:26,570 --> 03:56:26,580
to the way that we work we would work in
 

12531
03:56:26,580 --> 03:56:29,389
to the way that we work we would work in
all possible ways and that wouldn't be

12532
03:56:29,389 --> 03:56:29,399
all possible ways and that wouldn't be
 

12533
03:56:29,399 --> 03:56:31,729
all possible ways and that wouldn't be
kind of a notion of identity we wouldn't

12534
03:56:31,729 --> 03:56:31,739
kind of a notion of identity we wouldn't
 

12535
03:56:31,739 --> 03:56:34,849
kind of a notion of identity we wouldn't
have this notion of kind of uh uh of of

12536
03:56:34,849 --> 03:56:34,859
have this notion of kind of uh uh of of
 

12537
03:56:34,859 --> 03:56:37,210
have this notion of kind of uh uh of of
of coherent identity

12538
03:56:37,210 --> 03:56:37,220
of coherent identity
 

12539
03:56:37,220 --> 03:56:40,309
of coherent identity
I am geographically located somewhere

12540
03:56:40,309 --> 03:56:40,319
I am geographically located somewhere
 

12541
03:56:40,319 --> 03:56:42,590
I am geographically located somewhere
exactly precisely in the rouliad

12542
03:56:42,590 --> 03:56:42,600
exactly precisely in the rouliad
 

12543
03:56:42,600 --> 03:56:47,170
exactly precisely in the rouliad
therefore I am

12544
03:56:47,170 --> 03:56:47,180

 

12545
03:56:47,180 --> 03:56:49,250

physical space you're in a certain place

physical space you're in a certain place
 

12547
03:56:49,260 --> 03:56:52,790
physical space you're in a certain place
in real space and if if you uh if you

12548
03:56:52,790 --> 03:56:52,800
in real space and if if you uh if you
 

12549
03:56:52,800 --> 03:56:56,570
in real space and if if you uh if you
are sufficiently spread out you are no

12550
03:56:56,570 --> 03:56:56,580
are sufficiently spread out you are no
 

12551
03:56:56,580 --> 03:56:59,809
are sufficiently spread out you are no
longer coherent and you no longer have I

12552
03:56:59,809 --> 03:56:59,819
longer coherent and you no longer have I
 

12553
03:56:59,819 --> 03:57:02,269
longer coherent and you no longer have I
mean in in the in our perception of what

12554
03:57:02,269 --> 03:57:02,279
mean in in the in our perception of what
 

12555
03:57:02,279 --> 03:57:04,370
mean in in the in our perception of what
it means to exist and to have experience

12556
03:57:04,370 --> 03:57:04,380
it means to exist and to have experience
 

12557
03:57:04,380 --> 03:57:07,130
it means to exist and to have experience
it doesn't happen now so therefore so to

12558
03:57:07,130 --> 03:57:07,140
it doesn't happen now so therefore so to
 

12559
03:57:07,140 --> 03:57:10,070
it doesn't happen now so therefore so to
exist means to be computationally bonded

12560
03:57:10,070 --> 03:57:10,080
exist means to be computationally bonded
 

12561
03:57:10,080 --> 03:57:12,650
exist means to be computationally bonded
I think so to exist in the way that we

12562
03:57:12,650 --> 03:57:12,660
I think so to exist in the way that we
 

12563
03:57:12,660 --> 03:57:15,410
I think so to exist in the way that we
think of ourselves as existing yes the

12564
03:57:15,410 --> 03:57:15,420
think of ourselves as existing yes the
 

12565
03:57:15,420 --> 03:57:17,630
think of ourselves as existing yes the
very active existence is like operating

12566
03:57:17,630 --> 03:57:17,640
very active existence is like operating
 

12567
03:57:17,640 --> 03:57:19,250
very active existence is like operating
in this place that's computationally

12568
03:57:19,250 --> 03:57:19,260
in this place that's computationally
 

12569
03:57:19,260 --> 03:57:21,830
in this place that's computationally
reducible so this is just giant mess of

12570
03:57:21,830 --> 03:57:21,840
reducible so this is just giant mess of
 

12571
03:57:21,840 --> 03:57:23,210
reducible so this is just giant mess of
things going on that you can't possibly

12572
03:57:23,210 --> 03:57:23,220
things going on that you can't possibly
 

12573
03:57:23,220 --> 03:57:24,290
things going on that you can't possibly
predict

12574
03:57:24,290 --> 03:57:24,300
predict
 

12575
03:57:24,300 --> 03:57:25,729
predict
but nevertheless because of your

12576
03:57:25,729 --> 03:57:25,739
but nevertheless because of your
 

12577
03:57:25,739 --> 03:57:27,889
but nevertheless because of your
limitations

12578
03:57:27,889 --> 03:57:27,899
limitations
 

12579
03:57:27,899 --> 03:57:30,290
limitations
you have an imperative of like what is

12580
03:57:30,290 --> 03:57:30,300
you have an imperative of like what is
 

12581
03:57:30,300 --> 03:57:32,750
you have an imperative of like what is
it an imperative or a skill set to

12582
03:57:32,750 --> 03:57:32,760
it an imperative or a skill set to
 

12583
03:57:32,760 --> 03:57:35,210
it an imperative or a skill set to
simplify or an ignorance a sufficient

12584
03:57:35,210 --> 03:57:35,220
simplify or an ignorance a sufficient

love okay so the thing which is not

12586
03:57:36,889 --> 03:57:36,899
love okay so the thing which is not
 

12587
03:57:36,899 --> 03:57:39,110
love okay so the thing which is not
obvious is that you are taking a slice

12588
03:57:39,110 --> 03:57:39,120
obvious is that you are taking a slice
 

12589
03:57:39,120 --> 03:57:41,269
obvious is that you are taking a slice
of all this complexity just like we have

12590
03:57:41,269 --> 03:57:41,279
of all this complexity just like we have
 

12591
03:57:41,279 --> 03:57:42,950
of all this complexity just like we have
all of these molecules bouncing around

12592
03:57:42,950 --> 03:57:42,960
all of these molecules bouncing around
 

12593
03:57:42,960 --> 03:57:45,290
all of these molecules bouncing around
in the room but all we notice is you

12594
03:57:45,290 --> 03:57:45,300
in the room but all we notice is you
 

12595
03:57:45,300 --> 03:57:47,450
in the room but all we notice is you
know the the the the kind of the flow of

12596
03:57:47,450 --> 03:57:47,460
know the the the the kind of the flow of
 

12597
03:57:47,460 --> 03:57:49,490
know the the the the kind of the flow of
the air or the pressure of the air we're

12598
03:57:49,490 --> 03:57:49,500
the air or the pressure of the air we're
 

12599
03:57:49,500 --> 03:57:51,370
the air or the pressure of the air we're
just noticing these particular things

12600
03:57:51,370 --> 03:57:51,380
just noticing these particular things
 

12601
03:57:51,380 --> 03:57:55,250
just noticing these particular things
and the the big interesting thing is

12602
03:57:55,250 --> 03:57:55,260
and the the big interesting thing is
 

12603
03:57:55,260 --> 03:57:58,429
and the the big interesting thing is
that there are rules there are laws that

12604
03:57:58,429 --> 03:57:58,439
that there are rules there are laws that
 

12605
03:57:58,439 --> 03:58:00,050
that there are rules there are laws that
govern those big things that we we

12606
03:58:00,050 --> 03:58:00,060
govern those big things that we we
 

12607
03:58:00,060 --> 03:58:01,729
govern those big things that we we
observe yeah so it's not obvious that's

12608
03:58:01,729 --> 03:58:01,739
observe yeah so it's not obvious that's
 

12609
03:58:01,739 --> 03:58:03,170
observe yeah so it's not obvious that's
amazing because it doesn't feel like

12610
03:58:03,170 --> 03:58:03,180
amazing because it doesn't feel like
 

12611
03:58:03,180 --> 03:58:05,750
amazing because it doesn't feel like
it's a slice yeah well right not a slice

12612
03:58:05,750 --> 03:58:05,760
it's a slice yeah well right not a slice
 

12613
03:58:05,760 --> 03:58:08,150
it's a slice yeah well right not a slice
well it's like uh it's like an

12614
03:58:08,150 --> 03:58:08,160
well it's like uh it's like an
 

12615
03:58:08,160 --> 03:58:11,269
well it's like uh it's like an
abstraction yes but I mean the fact that

12616
03:58:11,269 --> 03:58:11,279
abstraction yes but I mean the fact that
 

12617
03:58:11,279 --> 03:58:13,969
abstraction yes but I mean the fact that
the gas laws work that we can describe

12618
03:58:13,969 --> 03:58:13,979
the gas laws work that we can describe
 

12619
03:58:13,979 --> 03:58:15,650
the gas laws work that we can describe
pressure volume Etc et cetera et cetera

12620
03:58:15,650 --> 03:58:15,660
pressure volume Etc et cetera et cetera
 

12621
03:58:15,660 --> 03:58:18,710
pressure volume Etc et cetera et cetera
we don't have to go down to the level of

12622
03:58:18,710 --> 03:58:18,720
we don't have to go down to the level of
 

12623
03:58:18,720 --> 03:58:20,570
we don't have to go down to the level of
talking about individual molecules that

12624
03:58:20,570 --> 03:58:20,580
talking about individual molecules that
 

12625
03:58:20,580 --> 03:58:23,210
talking about individual molecules that
is a non-trivial fact and and here's the

12626
03:58:23,210 --> 03:58:23,220
is a non-trivial fact and and here's the
 

12627
03:58:23,220 --> 03:58:25,370
is a non-trivial fact and and here's the
thing that I sort of exciting thing as

12628
03:58:25,370 --> 03:58:25,380
thing that I sort of exciting thing as
 

12629
03:58:25,380 --> 03:58:28,849
thing that I sort of exciting thing as
far as I'm concerned the fact that there

12630
03:58:28,849 --> 03:58:28,859
far as I'm concerned the fact that there
 

12631
03:58:28,859 --> 03:58:31,250
far as I'm concerned the fact that there
are certain aspects of the universe so

12632
03:58:31,250 --> 03:58:31,260
are certain aspects of the universe so
 

12633
03:58:31,260 --> 03:58:33,110
are certain aspects of the universe so
you know we think space is made

12634
03:58:33,110 --> 03:58:33,120
you know we think space is made
 

12635
03:58:33,120 --> 03:58:34,790
you know we think space is made
ultimately these atoms of space and

12636
03:58:34,790 --> 03:58:34,800
ultimately these atoms of space and
 

12637
03:58:34,800 --> 03:58:37,610
ultimately these atoms of space and
these typographs and so on and we think

12638
03:58:37,610 --> 03:58:37,620
these typographs and so on and we think
 

12639
03:58:37,620 --> 03:58:41,150
these typographs and so on and we think
that uh but we nevertheless perceive the

12640
03:58:41,150 --> 03:58:41,160
that uh but we nevertheless perceive the
 

12641
03:58:41,160 --> 03:58:43,490
that uh but we nevertheless perceive the
universe at a large scale to be like

12642
03:58:43,490 --> 03:58:43,500
universe at a large scale to be like
 

12643
03:58:43,500 --> 03:58:45,650
universe at a large scale to be like
continuous space and so on

12644
03:58:45,650 --> 03:58:45,660
continuous space and so on
 

12645
03:58:45,660 --> 03:58:49,130
continuous space and so on
um we uh in quantum mechanics we think

12646
03:58:49,130 --> 03:58:49,140
um we uh in quantum mechanics we think
 

12647
03:58:49,140 --> 03:58:50,570
um we uh in quantum mechanics we think
that there are these many threads of

12648
03:58:50,570 --> 03:58:50,580
that there are these many threads of
 

12649
03:58:50,580 --> 03:58:52,849
that there are these many threads of
time these many threads of History yet

12650
03:58:52,849 --> 03:58:52,859
time these many threads of History yet
 

12651
03:58:52,859 --> 03:58:56,330
time these many threads of History yet
we kind of span so so you know in in

12652
03:58:56,330 --> 03:58:56,340
we kind of span so so you know in in
 

12653
03:58:56,340 --> 03:58:57,830
we kind of span so so you know in in
quantum mechanics in our models of

12654
03:58:57,830 --> 03:58:57,840
quantum mechanics in our models of
 

12655
03:58:57,840 --> 03:59:00,769
quantum mechanics in our models of
physics there are these time is not a

12656
03:59:00,769 --> 03:59:00,779
physics there are these time is not a
 

12657
03:59:00,779 --> 03:59:03,469
physics there are these time is not a
single thread time breaks into many

12658
03:59:03,469 --> 03:59:03,479
single thread time breaks into many
 

12659
03:59:03,479 --> 03:59:06,769
single thread time breaks into many
threads they Branch they merge and but

12660
03:59:06,769 --> 03:59:06,779
threads they Branch they merge and but
 

12661
03:59:06,779 --> 03:59:09,530
threads they Branch they merge and but
we we are part of that branching merging

12662
03:59:09,530 --> 03:59:09,540
we we are part of that branching merging
 

12663
03:59:09,540 --> 03:59:12,290
we we are part of that branching merging
Universe right and so our brains are

12664
03:59:12,290 --> 03:59:12,300
Universe right and so our brains are
 

12665
03:59:12,300 --> 03:59:14,929
Universe right and so our brains are
also branching and merging and so when

12666
03:59:14,929 --> 03:59:14,939
also branching and merging and so when
 

12667
03:59:14,939 --> 03:59:17,630
also branching and merging and so when
we perceive the universe we are

12668
03:59:17,630 --> 03:59:17,640
we perceive the universe we are
 

12669
03:59:17,640 --> 03:59:19,729
we perceive the universe we are
branching brains perceiving a branching

12670
03:59:19,729 --> 03:59:19,739
branching brains perceiving a branching
 

12671
03:59:19,739 --> 03:59:22,910
branching brains perceiving a branching
Universe yeah and so the fact that the

12672
03:59:22,910 --> 03:59:22,920
Universe yeah and so the fact that the
 

12673
03:59:22,920 --> 03:59:26,990
Universe yeah and so the fact that the
claim that we exp we believe that we are

12674
03:59:26,990 --> 03:59:27,000
claim that we exp we believe that we are
 

12675
03:59:27,000 --> 03:59:29,150
claim that we exp we believe that we are
persistent in time we have this single

12676
03:59:29,150 --> 03:59:29,160
persistent in time we have this single
 

12677
03:59:29,160 --> 03:59:31,250
persistent in time we have this single
thread of experience that's the

12678
03:59:31,250 --> 03:59:31,260
thread of experience that's the
 

12679
03:59:31,260 --> 03:59:32,990
thread of experience that's the
statement that somehow we managed to

12680
03:59:32,990 --> 03:59:33,000
statement that somehow we managed to
 

12681
03:59:33,000 --> 03:59:34,969
statement that somehow we managed to
aggregate together those separate

12682
03:59:34,969 --> 03:59:34,979
aggregate together those separate
 

12683
03:59:34,979 --> 03:59:37,429
aggregate together those separate
threads of time that are separated in in

12684
03:59:37,429 --> 03:59:37,439
threads of time that are separated in in
 

12685
03:59:37,439 --> 03:59:38,990
threads of time that are separated in in
the operation of in the fundamental

12686
03:59:38,990 --> 03:59:39,000
the operation of in the fundamental
 

12687
03:59:39,000 --> 03:59:41,389
the operation of in the fundamental
operation of the universe so just as in

12688
03:59:41,389 --> 03:59:41,399
operation of the universe so just as in
 

12689
03:59:41,399 --> 03:59:43,550
operation of the universe so just as in
space we're averaging over some big

12690
03:59:43,550 --> 03:59:43,560
space we're averaging over some big
 

12691
03:59:43,560 --> 03:59:45,110
space we're averaging over some big
region of space and we're looking at

12692
03:59:45,110 --> 03:59:45,120
region of space and we're looking at
 

12693
03:59:45,120 --> 03:59:46,969
region of space and we're looking at
many many of the aggregate effects of

12694
03:59:46,969 --> 03:59:46,979
many many of the aggregate effects of
 

12695
03:59:46,979 --> 03:59:50,090
many many of the aggregate effects of
many atoms of space so similarly in what

12696
03:59:50,090 --> 03:59:50,100
many atoms of space so similarly in what
 

12697
03:59:50,100 --> 03:59:51,769
many atoms of space so similarly in what
we call branchial space the space of

12698
03:59:51,769 --> 03:59:51,779
we call branchial space the space of
 

12699
03:59:51,779 --> 03:59:54,170
we call branchial space the space of
these these Quantum branches we are

12700
03:59:54,170 --> 03:59:54,180
these these Quantum branches we are
 

12701
03:59:54,180 --> 03:59:56,090
these these Quantum branches we are
effectively averaging over many

12702
03:59:56,090 --> 03:59:56,100
effectively averaging over many
 

12703
03:59:56,100 --> 03:59:58,309
effectively averaging over many
different branches of possible of

12704
03:59:58,309 --> 03:59:58,319
different branches of possible of
 

12705
03:59:58,319 --> 04:00:01,570
different branches of possible of
histories of the universe and so in in

12706
04:00:01,570 --> 04:00:01,580
histories of the universe and so in in
 

12707
04:00:01,580 --> 04:00:04,309
histories of the universe and so in in
thermodynamics we're averaging over many

12708
04:00:04,309 --> 04:00:04,319
thermodynamics we're averaging over many
 

12709
04:00:04,319 --> 04:00:06,530
thermodynamics we're averaging over many
configurations of you know many many

12710
04:00:06,530 --> 04:00:06,540
configurations of you know many many
 

12711
04:00:06,540 --> 04:00:09,290
configurations of you know many many
possible positions of molecules yeah so

12712
04:00:09,290 --> 04:00:09,300
possible positions of molecules yeah so
 

12713
04:00:09,300 --> 04:00:11,150
possible positions of molecules yeah so
what what we see here is so the question

12714
04:00:11,150 --> 04:00:11,160
what what we see here is so the question
 

12715
04:00:11,160 --> 04:00:13,490
what what we see here is so the question
is when you do that averaging for space

12716
04:00:13,490 --> 04:00:13,500
is when you do that averaging for space
 

12717
04:00:13,500 --> 04:00:15,710
is when you do that averaging for space
What are the aggregate laws of space

12718
04:00:15,710 --> 04:00:15,720
What are the aggregate laws of space
 

12719
04:00:15,720 --> 04:00:17,570
What are the aggregate laws of space
when you do that averaging of a

12720
04:00:17,570 --> 04:00:17,580
when you do that averaging of a
 

12721
04:00:17,580 --> 04:00:19,130
when you do that averaging of a
branchial space What are the aggregate

12722
04:00:19,130 --> 04:00:19,140
branchial space What are the aggregate
 

12723
04:00:19,140 --> 04:00:21,889
branchial space What are the aggregate
laws a branchial space when you do that

12724
04:00:21,889 --> 04:00:21,899
laws a branchial space when you do that
 

12725
04:00:21,899 --> 04:00:24,590
laws a branchial space when you do that
averaging over the molecules and so on

12726
04:00:24,590 --> 04:00:24,600
averaging over the molecules and so on
 

12727
04:00:24,600 --> 04:00:27,650
averaging over the molecules and so on
what are the aggregate laws you get and

12728
04:00:27,650 --> 04:00:27,660
what are the aggregate laws you get and
 

12729
04:00:27,660 --> 04:00:29,870
what are the aggregate laws you get and
this is this is the thing that I I think

12730
04:00:29,870 --> 04:00:29,880
this is this is the thing that I I think
 

12731
04:00:29,880 --> 04:00:34,189
this is this is the thing that I I think
is just amazingly amazingly neat that

12732
04:00:34,189 --> 04:00:34,199
is just amazingly amazingly neat that
 

12733
04:00:34,199 --> 04:00:36,229
is just amazingly amazingly neat that
there are aggregate laws at all well yes

12734
04:00:36,229 --> 04:00:36,239
there are aggregate laws at all well yes
 

12735
04:00:36,239 --> 04:00:37,490
there are aggregate laws at all well yes
but the question is what are those

12736
04:00:37,490 --> 04:00:37,500
but the question is what are those
 

12737
04:00:37,500 --> 04:00:39,889
but the question is what are those
aggregate laws so the answer is for

12738
04:00:39,889 --> 04:00:39,899
aggregate laws so the answer is for
 

12739
04:00:39,899 --> 04:00:41,809
aggregate laws so the answer is for
space the aggregate laws Einstein's

12740
04:00:41,809 --> 04:00:41,819
space the aggregate laws Einstein's
 

12741
04:00:41,819 --> 04:00:43,429
space the aggregate laws Einstein's
equations for Gravity for the structure

12742
04:00:43,429 --> 04:00:43,439
equations for Gravity for the structure
 

12743
04:00:43,439 --> 04:00:46,429
equations for Gravity for the structure
of space-time for branchial space the

12744
04:00:46,429 --> 04:00:46,439
of space-time for branchial space the
 

12745
04:00:46,439 --> 04:00:47,929
of space-time for branchial space the
aggregate laws are the laws of quantum

12746
04:00:47,929 --> 04:00:47,939
aggregate laws are the laws of quantum
 

12747
04:00:47,939 --> 04:00:51,530
aggregate laws are the laws of quantum
mechanics and for uh the case of of

12748
04:00:51,530 --> 04:00:51,540
mechanics and for uh the case of of
 

12749
04:00:51,540 --> 04:00:54,170
mechanics and for uh the case of of
molecules and things the aggregate laws

12750
04:00:54,170 --> 04:00:54,180
molecules and things the aggregate laws
 

12751
04:00:54,180 --> 04:00:55,670
molecules and things the aggregate laws
are basically the second law of

12752
04:00:55,670 --> 04:00:55,680
are basically the second law of
 

12753
04:00:55,680 --> 04:00:56,870
are basically the second law of
thermodynamics

12754
04:00:56,870 --> 04:00:56,880
thermodynamics
 

12755
04:00:56,880 --> 04:00:59,870
thermodynamics
and so the um though that's the and the

12756
04:00:59,870 --> 04:00:59,880
and so the um though that's the and the
 

12757
04:00:59,880 --> 04:01:01,070
and so the um though that's the and the
things that follow from the second world

12758
04:01:01,070 --> 04:01:01,080
things that follow from the second world
 

12759
04:01:01,080 --> 04:01:03,710
things that follow from the second world
of thermodynamics and so what that means

12760
04:01:03,710 --> 04:01:03,720
of thermodynamics and so what that means
 

12761
04:01:03,720 --> 04:01:07,130
of thermodynamics and so what that means
is that the three great theories of 20th

12762
04:01:07,130 --> 04:01:07,140
is that the three great theories of 20th
 

12763
04:01:07,140 --> 04:01:09,410
is that the three great theories of 20th
century physics which are basically

12764
04:01:09,410 --> 04:01:09,420
century physics which are basically
 

12765
04:01:09,420 --> 04:01:10,969
century physics which are basically
general relativity the theory of gravity

12766
04:01:10,969 --> 04:01:10,979
general relativity the theory of gravity
 

12767
04:01:10,979 --> 04:01:13,490
general relativity the theory of gravity
uh quantum mechanics and statistical

12768
04:01:13,490 --> 04:01:13,500
uh quantum mechanics and statistical
 

12769
04:01:13,500 --> 04:01:15,290
uh quantum mechanics and statistical
mechanics which is what kind of grows

12770
04:01:15,290 --> 04:01:15,300
mechanics which is what kind of grows
 

12771
04:01:15,300 --> 04:01:16,750
mechanics which is what kind of grows
out of the second row of thermodynamics

12772
04:01:16,750 --> 04:01:16,760
out of the second row of thermodynamics
 

12773
04:01:16,760 --> 04:01:19,370
out of the second row of thermodynamics
all three of the great theories of 20th

12774
04:01:19,370 --> 04:01:19,380
all three of the great theories of 20th
 

12775
04:01:19,380 --> 04:01:22,250
all three of the great theories of 20th
century physics are the result of this

12776
04:01:22,250 --> 04:01:22,260
century physics are the result of this
 

12777
04:01:22,260 --> 04:01:24,290
century physics are the result of this
interplay between computational

12778
04:01:24,290 --> 04:01:24,300
interplay between computational
 

12779
04:01:24,300 --> 04:01:26,450
interplay between computational
irreducibility and the computational

12780
04:01:26,450 --> 04:01:26,460
irreducibility and the computational
 

12781
04:01:26,460 --> 04:01:29,450
irreducibility and the computational
boundedness of observers and you know

12782
04:01:29,450 --> 04:01:29,460
boundedness of observers and you know
 

12783
04:01:29,460 --> 04:01:32,929
boundedness of observers and you know
for me this is really neat because it

12784
04:01:32,929 --> 04:01:32,939
for me this is really neat because it
 

12785
04:01:32,939 --> 04:01:35,450
for me this is really neat because it
means that all three of these laws are

12786
04:01:35,450 --> 04:01:35,460
means that all three of these laws are
 

12787
04:01:35,460 --> 04:01:38,750
means that all three of these laws are
derivable so we used to think that for

12788
04:01:38,750 --> 04:01:38,760
derivable so we used to think that for
 

12789
04:01:38,760 --> 04:01:40,370
derivable so we used to think that for
example Einstein's equations were just

12790
04:01:40,370 --> 04:01:40,380
example Einstein's equations were just
 

12791
04:01:40,380 --> 04:01:41,870
example Einstein's equations were just
sort of a wheel in feature of our

12792
04:01:41,870 --> 04:01:41,880
sort of a wheel in feature of our
 

12793
04:01:41,880 --> 04:01:44,330
sort of a wheel in feature of our
universe that they could be the universe

12794
04:01:44,330 --> 04:01:44,340
universe that they could be the universe
 

12795
04:01:44,340 --> 04:01:45,769
universe that they could be the universe
might be that way it might not be that

12796
04:01:45,769 --> 04:01:45,779
might be that way it might not be that
 

12797
04:01:45,779 --> 04:01:47,990
might be that way it might not be that
way quantum mechanics is just like well

12798
04:01:47,990 --> 04:01:48,000
way quantum mechanics is just like well
 

12799
04:01:48,000 --> 04:01:50,689
way quantum mechanics is just like well
it just happens to be that way and the

12800
04:01:50,689 --> 04:01:50,699
it just happens to be that way and the
 

12801
04:01:50,699 --> 04:01:52,250
it just happens to be that way and the
second law people kind of thought well

12802
04:01:52,250 --> 04:01:52,260
second law people kind of thought well
 

12803
04:01:52,260 --> 04:01:55,070
second law people kind of thought well
maybe it is derivable okay what turns

12804
04:01:55,070 --> 04:01:55,080
maybe it is derivable okay what turns
 

12805
04:01:55,080 --> 04:01:56,689
maybe it is derivable okay what turns
out to be the case is that all three of

12806
04:01:56,689 --> 04:01:56,699
out to be the case is that all three of
 

12807
04:01:56,699 --> 04:01:58,429
out to be the case is that all three of
the fundamental principles of physics

12808
04:01:58,429 --> 04:01:58,439
the fundamental principles of physics
 

12809
04:01:58,439 --> 04:02:00,830
the fundamental principles of physics
are derivable but they're not derivable

12810
04:02:00,830 --> 04:02:00,840
are derivable but they're not derivable
 

12811
04:02:00,840 --> 04:02:03,889
are derivable but they're not derivable
just from mathematics they require or

12812
04:02:03,889 --> 04:02:03,899
just from mathematics they require or
 

12813
04:02:03,899 --> 04:02:05,269
just from mathematics they require or
just from some kind of logical

12814
04:02:05,269 --> 04:02:05,279
just from some kind of logical
 

12815
04:02:05,279 --> 04:02:07,670
just from some kind of logical
computation they require one more thing

12816
04:02:07,670 --> 04:02:07,680
computation they require one more thing
 

12817
04:02:07,680 --> 04:02:11,090
computation they require one more thing
they require that the Observer that the

12818
04:02:11,090 --> 04:02:11,100
they require that the Observer that the
 

12819
04:02:11,100 --> 04:02:13,070
they require that the Observer that the
thing that is sampling the way the

12820
04:02:13,070 --> 04:02:13,080
thing that is sampling the way the
 

12821
04:02:13,080 --> 04:02:15,590
thing that is sampling the way the
universe works is an observer who has

12822
04:02:15,590 --> 04:02:15,600
universe works is an observer who has
 

12823
04:02:15,600 --> 04:02:17,570
universe works is an observer who has
these characteristics of computational

12824
04:02:17,570 --> 04:02:17,580
these characteristics of computational
 

12825
04:02:17,580 --> 04:02:19,250
these characteristics of computational
boundedness of belief and persistence

12826
04:02:19,250 --> 04:02:19,260
boundedness of belief and persistence
 

12827
04:02:19,260 --> 04:02:22,670
boundedness of belief and persistence
and time and so that that means that it

12828
04:02:22,670 --> 04:02:22,680
and time and so that that means that it
 

12829
04:02:22,680 --> 04:02:25,030
and time and so that that means that it
is the nature of the Observer

12830
04:02:25,030 --> 04:02:25,040
is the nature of the Observer
 

12831
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:27,170
is the nature of the Observer
you know the rough nature of the

12832
04:02:27,170 --> 04:02:27,180
you know the rough nature of the
 

12833
04:02:27,180 --> 04:02:28,849
you know the rough nature of the
Observer not the details of oh we got

12834
04:02:28,849 --> 04:02:28,859
Observer not the details of oh we got
 

12835
04:02:28,859 --> 04:02:31,070
Observer not the details of oh we got
two eyes and we've observed photons of

12836
04:02:31,070 --> 04:02:31,080
two eyes and we've observed photons of
 

12837
04:02:31,080 --> 04:02:33,650
two eyes and we've observed photons of
this frequency and so on uh but the the

12838
04:02:33,650 --> 04:02:33,660
this frequency and so on uh but the the
 

12839
04:02:33,660 --> 04:02:35,809
this frequency and so on uh but the the
the the the kind of the very coarse

12840
04:02:35,809 --> 04:02:35,819
the the the kind of the very coarse
 

12841
04:02:35,819 --> 04:02:37,849
the the the kind of the very coarse
features of the Observer

12842
04:02:37,849 --> 04:02:37,859
features of the Observer
 

12843
04:02:37,859 --> 04:02:40,849
features of the Observer
um then imply these very precise facts

12844
04:02:40,849 --> 04:02:40,859
um then imply these very precise facts
 

12845
04:02:40,859 --> 04:02:43,849
um then imply these very precise facts
about physics and it's it's I think it's

12846
04:02:43,849 --> 04:02:43,859
about physics and it's it's I think it's
 

12847
04:02:43,859 --> 04:02:46,790
about physics and it's it's I think it's
amazing so if we just look at the actual

12848
04:02:46,790 --> 04:02:46,800
amazing so if we just look at the actual
 

12849
04:02:46,800 --> 04:02:49,189
amazing so if we just look at the actual
experience of the Observer that we

12850
04:02:49,189 --> 04:02:49,199
experience of the Observer that we
 

12851
04:02:49,199 --> 04:02:51,889
experience of the Observer that we
experience this reality it seems real to

12852
04:02:51,889 --> 04:02:51,899
experience this reality it seems real to
 

12853
04:02:51,899 --> 04:02:52,610
experience this reality it seems real to
us

12854
04:02:52,610 --> 04:02:52,620
us
 

12855
04:02:52,620 --> 04:02:54,710
us
and you're saying because of our bonded

12856
04:02:54,710 --> 04:02:54,720
and you're saying because of our bonded
 

12857
04:02:54,720 --> 04:02:57,349
and you're saying because of our bonded
nature it's actually all an illusion

12858
04:02:57,349 --> 04:02:57,359
nature it's actually all an illusion
 

12859
04:02:57,359 --> 04:02:59,389
nature it's actually all an illusion
it's a simplification yeah it's a

12860
04:02:59,389 --> 04:02:59,399
it's a simplification yeah it's a
 

12861
04:02:59,399 --> 04:03:01,550
it's a simplification yeah it's a
simplification right what's what's you

12862
04:03:01,550 --> 04:03:01,560
simplification right what's what's you
 

12863
04:03:01,560 --> 04:03:02,870
simplification right what's what's you
don't think a simplification is an

12864
04:03:02,870 --> 04:03:02,880
don't think a simplification is an
 

12865
04:03:02,880 --> 04:03:03,830
don't think a simplification is an
illusion

12866
04:03:03,830 --> 04:03:03,840
illusion
 

12867
04:03:03,840 --> 04:03:07,429
illusion
no I mean it's it's well I don't know I

12868
04:03:07,429 --> 04:03:07,439
no I mean it's it's well I don't know I
 

12869
04:03:07,439 --> 04:03:09,349
no I mean it's it's well I don't know I
mean underneath

12870
04:03:09,349 --> 04:03:09,359
mean underneath
 

12871
04:03:09,359 --> 04:03:13,370
mean underneath
uh okay that's an interesting question

12872
04:03:13,370 --> 04:03:13,380
uh okay that's an interesting question
 

12873
04:03:13,380 --> 04:03:16,309
uh okay that's an interesting question
um what's real and that relates to the

12874
04:03:16,309 --> 04:03:16,319
um what's real and that relates to the
 

12875
04:03:16,319 --> 04:03:17,630
um what's real and that relates to the
whole question of why does the universe

12876
04:03:17,630 --> 04:03:17,640
whole question of why does the universe
 

12877
04:03:17,640 --> 04:03:20,450
whole question of why does the universe
exist and um you know what is the

12878
04:03:20,450 --> 04:03:20,460
exist and um you know what is the
 

12879
04:03:20,460 --> 04:03:23,450
exist and um you know what is the
difference between reality and a mere

12880
04:03:23,450 --> 04:03:23,460
difference between reality and a mere
 

12881
04:03:23,460 --> 04:03:26,870
difference between reality and a mere
representation of what's going on yes we

12882
04:03:26,870 --> 04:03:26,880
representation of what's going on yes we
 

12883
04:03:26,880 --> 04:03:30,110
representation of what's going on yes we
experience the representation yes but

12884
04:03:30,110 --> 04:03:30,120
experience the representation yes but
 

12885
04:03:30,120 --> 04:03:33,229
experience the representation yes but
the the question of so so one question

12886
04:03:33,229 --> 04:03:33,239
the the question of so so one question
 

12887
04:03:33,239 --> 04:03:36,650
the the question of so so one question
is uh you know why is there a thing

12888
04:03:36,650 --> 04:03:36,660
is uh you know why is there a thing
 

12889
04:03:36,660 --> 04:03:39,530
is uh you know why is there a thing
which we can experience that way

12890
04:03:39,530 --> 04:03:39,540
which we can experience that way
 

12891
04:03:39,540 --> 04:03:43,309
which we can experience that way
and the answer is because this rouliad

12892
04:03:43,309 --> 04:03:43,319
and the answer is because this rouliad
 

12893
04:03:43,319 --> 04:03:46,790
and the answer is because this rouliad
object which is this entangled limit of

12894
04:03:46,790 --> 04:03:46,800
object which is this entangled limit of
 

12895
04:03:46,800 --> 04:03:49,370
object which is this entangled limit of
all possible computations there is no

12896
04:03:49,370 --> 04:03:49,380
all possible computations there is no
 

12897
04:03:49,380 --> 04:03:52,550
all possible computations there is no
choice about it it has to exist it has

12898
04:03:52,550 --> 04:03:52,560
choice about it it has to exist it has
 

12899
04:03:52,560 --> 04:03:55,189
choice about it it has to exist it has
to there has to be such a thing it is in

12900
04:03:55,189 --> 04:03:55,199
to there has to be such a thing it is in
 

12901
04:03:55,199 --> 04:03:57,469
to there has to be such a thing it is in
in the same sense that you know two plus

12902
04:03:57,469 --> 04:03:57,479
in the same sense that you know two plus
 

12903
04:03:57,479 --> 04:03:59,689
in the same sense that you know two plus
two if you define what two is and you

12904
04:03:59,689 --> 04:03:59,699
two if you define what two is and you
 

12905
04:03:59,699 --> 04:04:01,910
two if you define what two is and you
plot pluses and so on two plus two has

12906
04:04:01,910 --> 04:04:01,920
plot pluses and so on two plus two has
 

12907
04:04:01,920 --> 04:04:04,969
plot pluses and so on two plus two has
to equal four similarly this really add

12908
04:04:04,969 --> 04:04:04,979
to equal four similarly this really add
 

12909
04:04:04,979 --> 04:04:06,650
to equal four similarly this really add
this limit of all possible computations

12910
04:04:06,650 --> 04:04:06,660
this limit of all possible computations
 

12911
04:04:06,660 --> 04:04:10,309
this limit of all possible computations
just has to be a thing you that is once

12912
04:04:10,309 --> 04:04:10,319
just has to be a thing you that is once
 

12913
04:04:10,319 --> 04:04:12,830
just has to be a thing you that is once
you have the idea of computation you

12914
04:04:12,830 --> 04:04:12,840
you have the idea of computation you
 

12915
04:04:12,840 --> 04:04:14,269
you have the idea of computation you
inevitably have the rule yeah you're

12916
04:04:14,269 --> 04:04:14,279
inevitably have the rule yeah you're
 

12917
04:04:14,279 --> 04:04:15,349
inevitably have the rule yeah you're
gonna have to have a rule yeah yeah

12918
04:04:15,349 --> 04:04:15,359
gonna have to have a rule yeah yeah
 

12919
04:04:15,359 --> 04:04:17,150
gonna have to have a rule yeah yeah
right and and what's important about it

12920
04:04:17,150 --> 04:04:17,160
right and and what's important about it
 

12921
04:04:17,160 --> 04:04:19,130
right and and what's important about it
there's just one of it it's it's it's

12922
04:04:19,130 --> 04:04:19,140
there's just one of it it's it's it's
 

12923
04:04:19,140 --> 04:04:22,729
there's just one of it it's it's it's
just this unique object and that unique

12924
04:04:22,729 --> 04:04:22,739
just this unique object and that unique
 

12925
04:04:22,739 --> 04:04:26,030
just this unique object and that unique
object necessarily exists and then the

12926
04:04:26,030 --> 04:04:26,040
object necessarily exists and then the
 

12927
04:04:26,040 --> 04:04:30,410
object necessarily exists and then the
question is what uh and then we

12928
04:04:30,410 --> 04:04:30,420
question is what uh and then we
 

12929
04:04:30,420 --> 04:04:33,530
question is what uh and then we
uh once once you know that we are sort

12930
04:04:33,530 --> 04:04:33,540
uh once once you know that we are sort
 

12931
04:04:33,540 --> 04:04:35,630
uh once once you know that we are sort
of embedded in that and taking samples

12932
04:04:35,630 --> 04:04:35,640
of embedded in that and taking samples
 

12933
04:04:35,640 --> 04:04:38,510
of embedded in that and taking samples
of it that it's sort of inevitable that

12934
04:04:38,510 --> 04:04:38,520
of it that it's sort of inevitable that
 

12935
04:04:38,520 --> 04:04:40,849
of it that it's sort of inevitable that
there is this thing that we can perceive

12936
04:04:40,849 --> 04:04:40,859
there is this thing that we can perceive
 

12937
04:04:40,859 --> 04:04:44,330
there is this thing that we can perceive
that is you know the the our perception

12938
04:04:44,330 --> 04:04:44,340
that is you know the the our perception
 

12939
04:04:44,340 --> 04:04:47,710
that is you know the the our perception
of kind of physical reality

12940
04:04:47,710 --> 04:04:47,720
of kind of physical reality
 

12941
04:04:47,720 --> 04:04:50,510
of kind of physical reality
necessarily is that way given that we

12942
04:04:50,510 --> 04:04:50,520
necessarily is that way given that we
 

12943
04:04:50,520 --> 04:04:52,370
necessarily is that way given that we
are observers with the characteristics

12944
04:04:52,370 --> 04:04:52,380
are observers with the characteristics
 

12945
04:04:52,380 --> 04:04:53,330
are observers with the characteristics
we have

12946
04:04:53,330 --> 04:04:53,340
we have
 

12947
04:04:53,340 --> 04:04:56,510
we have
so in other words the fact that the fact

12948
04:04:56,510 --> 04:04:56,520
so in other words the fact that the fact
 

12949
04:04:56,520 --> 04:04:59,510
so in other words the fact that the fact
that the Universe exists is it's

12950
04:04:59,510 --> 04:04:59,520
that the Universe exists is it's
 

12951
04:04:59,520 --> 04:05:02,269
that the Universe exists is it's
actually it's almost like it's you know

12952
04:05:02,269 --> 04:05:02,279
actually it's almost like it's you know
 

12953
04:05:02,279 --> 04:05:03,889
actually it's almost like it's you know
to think about it almost theologically

12954
04:05:03,889 --> 04:05:03,899
to think about it almost theologically
 

12955
04:05:03,899 --> 04:05:06,950
to think about it almost theologically
so to speak and I I really it's it's

12956
04:05:06,950 --> 04:05:06,960
so to speak and I I really it's it's
 

12957
04:05:06,960 --> 04:05:08,750
so to speak and I I really it's it's
funny because a lot of the questions

12958
04:05:08,750 --> 04:05:08,760
funny because a lot of the questions
 

12959
04:05:08,760 --> 04:05:10,429
funny because a lot of the questions
about the existence of the universe and

12960
04:05:10,429 --> 04:05:10,439
about the existence of the universe and
 

12961
04:05:10,439 --> 04:05:14,150
about the existence of the universe and
so on they they transcend what kind of

12962
04:05:14,150 --> 04:05:14,160
so on they they transcend what kind of
 

12963
04:05:14,160 --> 04:05:15,469
so on they they transcend what kind of
the science of the last few hundred

12964
04:05:15,469 --> 04:05:15,479
the science of the last few hundred
 

12965
04:05:15,479 --> 04:05:17,030
the science of the last few hundred
years has really been concerned with the

12966
04:05:17,030 --> 04:05:17,040
years has really been concerned with the
 

12967
04:05:17,040 --> 04:05:18,170
years has really been concerned with the
science of the last few hundred years

12968
04:05:18,170 --> 04:05:18,180
science of the last few hundred years
 

12969
04:05:18,180 --> 04:05:19,910
science of the last few hundred years
hasn't thought it could talk about

12970
04:05:19,910 --> 04:05:19,920
hasn't thought it could talk about
 

12971
04:05:19,920 --> 04:05:21,950
hasn't thought it could talk about
questions like that yeah

12972
04:05:21,950 --> 04:05:21,960
questions like that yeah
 

12973
04:05:21,960 --> 04:05:24,349
questions like that yeah
um and uh but I think it's kind of and

12974
04:05:24,349 --> 04:05:24,359
um and uh but I think it's kind of and
 

12975
04:05:24,359 --> 04:05:26,269
um and uh but I think it's kind of and
so a lot of the kind of arguments of you

12976
04:05:26,269 --> 04:05:26,279
so a lot of the kind of arguments of you
 

12977
04:05:26,279 --> 04:05:28,610
so a lot of the kind of arguments of you
know does God exist you know is it

12978
04:05:28,610 --> 04:05:28,620
know does God exist you know is it
 

12979
04:05:28,620 --> 04:05:31,309
know does God exist you know is it
obvious that I think it in some sense in

12980
04:05:31,309 --> 04:05:31,319
obvious that I think it in some sense in
 

12981
04:05:31,319 --> 04:05:33,530
obvious that I think it in some sense in
some representation it's sort of more

12982
04:05:33,530 --> 04:05:33,540
some representation it's sort of more
 

12983
04:05:33,540 --> 04:05:37,070
some representation it's sort of more
more obvious that uh that something sort

12984
04:05:37,070 --> 04:05:37,080
more obvious that uh that something sort
 

12985
04:05:37,080 --> 04:05:39,469
more obvious that uh that something sort
of bigger than us exists than that we

12986
04:05:39,469 --> 04:05:39,479
of bigger than us exists than that we
 

12987
04:05:39,479 --> 04:05:43,130
of bigger than us exists than that we
exist and we are you know our existence

12988
04:05:43,130 --> 04:05:43,140
exist and we are you know our existence
 

12989
04:05:43,140 --> 04:05:45,349
exist and we are you know our existence
and as observers the way we are is sort

12990
04:05:45,349 --> 04:05:45,359
and as observers the way we are is sort
 

12991
04:05:45,359 --> 04:05:47,750
and as observers the way we are is sort
of a contingent thing about the universe

12992
04:05:47,750 --> 04:05:47,760
of a contingent thing about the universe
 

12993
04:05:47,760 --> 04:05:49,969
of a contingent thing about the universe
and it's more inevitable that the whole

12994
04:05:49,969 --> 04:05:49,979
and it's more inevitable that the whole
 

12995
04:05:49,979 --> 04:05:52,250
and it's more inevitable that the whole
the whole universe kind of the whole set

12996
04:05:52,250 --> 04:05:52,260
the whole universe kind of the whole set
 

12997
04:05:52,260 --> 04:05:53,530
the whole universe kind of the whole set
of all possibilities

12998
04:05:53,530 --> 04:05:53,540
of all possibilities
 

12999
04:05:53,540 --> 04:05:56,630
of all possibilities
exists but but this question about you

13000
04:05:56,630 --> 04:05:56,640
exists but but this question about you
 

13001
04:05:56,640 --> 04:06:00,410
exists but but this question about you
know is is it real or is it an illusion

13002
04:06:00,410 --> 04:06:00,420
know is is it real or is it an illusion
 

13003
04:06:00,420 --> 04:06:03,490
know is is it real or is it an illusion
you know all we know is our experience

13004
04:06:03,490 --> 04:06:03,500
you know all we know is our experience
 

13005
04:06:03,500 --> 04:06:08,150
you know all we know is our experience
and so the fact that well our experience

13006
04:06:08,150 --> 04:06:08,160
and so the fact that well our experience
 

13007
04:06:08,160 --> 04:06:11,809
and so the fact that well our experience
is this absolutely microscopic piece of

13008
04:06:11,809 --> 04:06:11,819
is this absolutely microscopic piece of
 

13009
04:06:11,819 --> 04:06:15,889
is this absolutely microscopic piece of
sample of the rouliad and we're

13010
04:06:15,889 --> 04:06:15,899
sample of the rouliad and we're
 

13011
04:06:15,899 --> 04:06:17,210
sample of the rouliad and we're
um and and you know there's this this

13012
04:06:17,210 --> 04:06:17,220
um and and you know there's this this
 

13013
04:06:17,220 --> 04:06:20,269
um and and you know there's this this
point about you know we might sample

13014
04:06:20,269 --> 04:06:20,279
point about you know we might sample
 

13015
04:06:20,279 --> 04:06:21,769
point about you know we might sample
more and more of the rouliad we might

13016
04:06:21,769 --> 04:06:21,779
more and more of the rouliad we might
 

13017
04:06:21,779 --> 04:06:23,870
more and more of the rouliad we might
learn more and more about we might learn

13018
04:06:23,870 --> 04:06:23,880
learn more and more about we might learn
 

13019
04:06:23,880 --> 04:06:26,389
learn more and more about we might learn
you know like like different areas of

13020
04:06:26,389 --> 04:06:26,399
you know like like different areas of
 

13021
04:06:26,399 --> 04:06:28,130
you know like like different areas of
physics like Quantum Mechanics for

13022
04:06:28,130 --> 04:06:28,140
physics like Quantum Mechanics for
 

13023
04:06:28,140 --> 04:06:30,889
physics like Quantum Mechanics for
example the fact that it it was

13024
04:06:30,889 --> 04:06:30,899
example the fact that it it was
 

13025
04:06:30,899 --> 04:06:33,469
example the fact that it it was
discovered I think is closely related to

13026
04:06:33,469 --> 04:06:33,479
discovered I think is closely related to
 

13027
04:06:33,479 --> 04:06:35,269
discovered I think is closely related to
the fact that electronic amplifiers were

13028
04:06:35,269 --> 04:06:35,279
the fact that electronic amplifiers were
 

13029
04:06:35,279 --> 04:06:37,849
the fact that electronic amplifiers were
invented that allowed you to take a

13030
04:06:37,849 --> 04:06:37,859
invented that allowed you to take a
 

13031
04:06:37,859 --> 04:06:39,710
invented that allowed you to take a
small effect and amplify it up which

13032
04:06:39,710 --> 04:06:39,720
small effect and amplify it up which
 

13033
04:06:39,720 --> 04:06:41,330
small effect and amplify it up which
hadn't been possible before you know

13034
04:06:41,330 --> 04:06:41,340
hadn't been possible before you know
 

13035
04:06:41,340 --> 04:06:42,889
hadn't been possible before you know
microscopes have been invented that

13036
04:06:42,889 --> 04:06:42,899
microscopes have been invented that
 

13037
04:06:42,899 --> 04:06:45,349
microscopes have been invented that
magnify things and so on but they're you

13038
04:06:45,349 --> 04:06:45,359
magnify things and so on but they're you
 

13039
04:06:45,359 --> 04:06:47,090
magnify things and so on but they're you
know having a very small effect and

13040
04:06:47,090 --> 04:06:47,100
know having a very small effect and
 

13041
04:06:47,100 --> 04:06:48,650
know having a very small effect and
being able to magnify it was sort of a

13042
04:06:48,650 --> 04:06:48,660
being able to magnify it was sort of a
 

13043
04:06:48,660 --> 04:06:50,689
being able to magnify it was sort of a
new thing that allowed one to see a

13044
04:06:50,689 --> 04:06:50,699
new thing that allowed one to see a
 

13045
04:06:50,699 --> 04:06:52,969
new thing that allowed one to see a
different sort of aspect of the universe

13046
04:06:52,969 --> 04:06:52,979
different sort of aspect of the universe
 

13047
04:06:52,979 --> 04:06:54,710
different sort of aspect of the universe
and let one discover this kind of thing

13048
04:06:54,710 --> 04:06:54,720
and let one discover this kind of thing
 

13049
04:06:54,720 --> 04:06:58,130
and let one discover this kind of thing
so you know we can expect that in the

13050
04:06:58,130 --> 04:06:58,140
so you know we can expect that in the
 

13051
04:06:58,140 --> 04:06:59,809
so you know we can expect that in the
rouliad they're an infinite collection

13052
04:06:59,809 --> 04:06:59,819
rouliad they're an infinite collection
 

13053
04:06:59,819 --> 04:07:02,090
rouliad they're an infinite collection
of new things we can discover there's

13054
04:07:02,090 --> 04:07:02,100
of new things we can discover there's
 

13055
04:07:02,100 --> 04:07:03,469
of new things we can discover there's
there's in fact computational energy

13056
04:07:03,469 --> 04:07:03,479
there's in fact computational energy
 

13057
04:07:03,479 --> 04:07:05,809
there's in fact computational energy
ability kind of guarantees that there

13058
04:07:05,809 --> 04:07:05,819
ability kind of guarantees that there
 

13059
04:07:05,819 --> 04:07:07,729
ability kind of guarantees that there
will be an infinite collection of kind

13060
04:07:07,729 --> 04:07:07,739
will be an infinite collection of kind
 

13061
04:07:07,739 --> 04:07:10,309
will be an infinite collection of kind
of you know pockets of reducibility that

13062
04:07:10,309 --> 04:07:10,319
of you know pockets of reducibility that
 

13063
04:07:10,319 --> 04:07:12,710
of you know pockets of reducibility that
can be discovered

13064
04:07:12,710 --> 04:07:12,720
can be discovered
 

13065
04:07:12,720 --> 04:07:16,010
can be discovered
boy would it be fun to take a walk down

13066
04:07:16,010 --> 04:07:16,020
boy would it be fun to take a walk down
 

13067
04:07:16,020 --> 04:07:17,750
boy would it be fun to take a walk down
the woolly ad and see what kind of stuff

13068
04:07:17,750 --> 04:07:17,760
the woolly ad and see what kind of stuff
 

13069
04:07:17,760 --> 04:07:19,610
the woolly ad and see what kind of stuff
we find there you write about alien

13070
04:07:19,610 --> 04:07:19,620
we find there you write about alien
 

13071
04:07:19,620 --> 04:07:20,870
we find there you write about alien
intelligences

13072
04:07:20,870 --> 04:07:20,880
intelligences
 

13073
04:07:20,880 --> 04:07:23,870
intelligences
yes I mean just these worlds yes well

13074
04:07:23,870 --> 04:07:23,880
yes I mean just these worlds yes well
 

13075
04:07:23,880 --> 04:07:26,150
yes I mean just these worlds yes well
computation problem with these worlds is

13076
04:07:26,150 --> 04:07:26,160
computation problem with these worlds is
 

13077
04:07:26,160 --> 04:07:29,510
computation problem with these worlds is
that we can't talk to them yes and and

13078
04:07:29,510 --> 04:07:29,520
that we can't talk to them yes and and
 

13079
04:07:29,520 --> 04:07:33,050
that we can't talk to them yes and and
you know the thing is what I've kind of

13080
04:07:33,050 --> 04:07:33,060
you know the thing is what I've kind of
 

13081
04:07:33,060 --> 04:07:34,490
you know the thing is what I've kind of
spent a lot of time doing is just

13082
04:07:34,490 --> 04:07:34,500
spent a lot of time doing is just
 

13083
04:07:34,500 --> 04:07:35,990
spent a lot of time doing is just
studying computational systems seeing

13084
04:07:35,990 --> 04:07:36,000
studying computational systems seeing
 

13085
04:07:36,000 --> 04:07:38,750
studying computational systems seeing
what they do what I now call ruleology

13086
04:07:38,750 --> 04:07:38,760
what they do what I now call ruleology
 

13087
04:07:38,760 --> 04:07:41,330
what they do what I now call ruleology
kind of just the study of rules yeah and

13088
04:07:41,330 --> 04:07:41,340
kind of just the study of rules yeah and
 

13089
04:07:41,340 --> 04:07:43,490
kind of just the study of rules yeah and
what they do you know you can kind of

13090
04:07:43,490 --> 04:07:43,500
what they do you know you can kind of
 

13091
04:07:43,500 --> 04:07:45,650
what they do you know you can kind of
easily jump somewhere else in the

13092
04:07:45,650 --> 04:07:45,660
easily jump somewhere else in the
 

13093
04:07:45,660 --> 04:07:47,510
easily jump somewhere else in the
rouliad and start seeing what do these

13094
04:07:47,510 --> 04:07:47,520
rouliad and start seeing what do these
 

13095
04:07:47,520 --> 04:07:49,969
rouliad and start seeing what do these
rules do yeah and what you says they

13096
04:07:49,969 --> 04:07:49,979
rules do yeah and what you says they
 

13097
04:07:49,979 --> 04:07:52,250
rules do yeah and what you says they
they just they do what they do and

13098
04:07:52,250 --> 04:07:52,260
they just they do what they do and
 

13099
04:07:52,260 --> 04:07:54,050
they just they do what they do and
there's no human connection so to speak

13100
04:07:54,050 --> 04:07:54,060
there's no human connection so to speak
 

13101
04:07:54,060 --> 04:07:55,550
there's no human connection so to speak
because you think you know some people

13102
04:07:55,550 --> 04:07:55,560
because you think you know some people
 

13103
04:07:55,560 --> 04:07:57,790
because you think you know some people
are able to uh

13104
04:07:57,790 --> 04:07:57,800
are able to uh
 

13105
04:07:57,800 --> 04:08:00,950
are able to uh
uh communicate with animals do you think

13106
04:08:00,950 --> 04:08:00,960
uh communicate with animals do you think
 

13107
04:08:00,960 --> 04:08:04,389
uh communicate with animals do you think
you can become a Whisperer of these

13108
04:08:04,389 --> 04:08:04,399
you can become a Whisperer of these
 

13109
04:08:04,399 --> 04:08:06,830
you can become a Whisperer of these
trying that's what I've spent some part

13110
04:08:06,830 --> 04:08:06,840
trying that's what I've spent some part
 

13111
04:08:06,840 --> 04:08:09,410
trying that's what I've spent some part
of my life have you have you heard and

13112
04:08:09,410 --> 04:08:09,420
of my life have you have you heard and
 

13113
04:08:09,420 --> 04:08:11,210
of my life have you have you heard and
well are you at the risk of losing your

13114
04:08:11,210 --> 04:08:11,220
well are you at the risk of losing your
 

13115
04:08:11,220 --> 04:08:13,130
well are you at the risk of losing your
mind sort of my favorite science

13116
04:08:13,130 --> 04:08:13,140
mind sort of my favorite science
 

13117
04:08:13,140 --> 04:08:14,510
mind sort of my favorite science
discovery

13118
04:08:14,510 --> 04:08:14,520
discovery
 

13119
04:08:14,520 --> 04:08:16,729
discovery
is this fact that these very simple

13120
04:08:16,729 --> 04:08:16,739
is this fact that these very simple
 

13121
04:08:16,739 --> 04:08:18,469
is this fact that these very simple
programs can produce very complicated

13122
04:08:18,469 --> 04:08:18,479
programs can produce very complicated
 

13123
04:08:18,479 --> 04:08:22,790
programs can produce very complicated
Behavior yeah and that and that fact is

13124
04:08:22,790 --> 04:08:22,800
Behavior yeah and that and that fact is
 

13125
04:08:22,800 --> 04:08:25,790
Behavior yeah and that and that fact is
kind of in a sense a whispering of

13126
04:08:25,790 --> 04:08:25,800
kind of in a sense a whispering of
 

13127
04:08:25,800 --> 04:08:27,110
kind of in a sense a whispering of
something out in the computational

13128
04:08:27,110 --> 04:08:27,120
something out in the computational
 

13129
04:08:27,120 --> 04:08:28,729
something out in the computational
universe that we didn't really know was

13130
04:08:28,729 --> 04:08:28,739
universe that we didn't really know was
 

13131
04:08:28,739 --> 04:08:31,849
universe that we didn't really know was
there before I mean it's you know I it's

13132
04:08:31,849 --> 04:08:31,859
there before I mean it's you know I it's
 

13133
04:08:31,859 --> 04:08:35,450
there before I mean it's you know I it's
like you know back in the 1980s I was

13134
04:08:35,450 --> 04:08:35,460
like you know back in the 1980s I was
 

13135
04:08:35,460 --> 04:08:37,729
like you know back in the 1980s I was
doing a bunch of work with some very

13136
04:08:37,729 --> 04:08:37,739
doing a bunch of work with some very
 

13137
04:08:37,739 --> 04:08:39,889
doing a bunch of work with some very
very good mathematicians and they were

13138
04:08:39,889 --> 04:08:39,899
very good mathematicians and they were
 

13139
04:08:39,899 --> 04:08:41,510
very good mathematicians and they were
like trying to pick away you know can we

13140
04:08:41,510 --> 04:08:41,520
like trying to pick away you know can we
 

13141
04:08:41,520 --> 04:08:42,830
like trying to pick away you know can we
figure out what's going on in these

13142
04:08:42,830 --> 04:08:42,840
figure out what's going on in these
 

13143
04:08:42,840 --> 04:08:45,469
figure out what's going on in these
computational systems and they they

13144
04:08:45,469 --> 04:08:45,479
computational systems and they they
 

13145
04:08:45,479 --> 04:08:47,330
computational systems and they they
basically said look the math we have

13146
04:08:47,330 --> 04:08:47,340
basically said look the math we have
 

13147
04:08:47,340 --> 04:08:49,010
basically said look the math we have
just doesn't get anywhere with this

13148
04:08:49,010 --> 04:08:49,020
just doesn't get anywhere with this
 

13149
04:08:49,020 --> 04:08:51,170
just doesn't get anywhere with this
we're stuck there's nothing to say we

13150
04:08:51,170 --> 04:08:51,180
we're stuck there's nothing to say we
 

13151
04:08:51,180 --> 04:08:53,929
we're stuck there's nothing to say we
have nothing to say and you know in a

13152
04:08:53,929 --> 04:08:53,939
have nothing to say and you know in a
 

13153
04:08:53,939 --> 04:08:56,150
have nothing to say and you know in a
sense perhaps my main achievement at

13154
04:08:56,150 --> 04:08:56,160
sense perhaps my main achievement at
 

13155
04:08:56,160 --> 04:08:58,490
sense perhaps my main achievement at
that time was to realize that the very

13156
04:08:58,490 --> 04:08:58,500
that time was to realize that the very
 

13157
04:08:58,500 --> 04:09:01,429
that time was to realize that the very
fact that the the good mathematicians

13158
04:09:01,429 --> 04:09:01,439
fact that the the good mathematicians
 

13159
04:09:01,439 --> 04:09:03,950
fact that the the good mathematicians
had nothing to say was itself a very

13160
04:09:03,950 --> 04:09:03,960
had nothing to say was itself a very
 

13161
04:09:03,960 --> 04:09:06,530
had nothing to say was itself a very
interesting thing that was kind of a

13162
04:09:06,530 --> 04:09:06,540
interesting thing that was kind of a
 

13163
04:09:06,540 --> 04:09:08,510
interesting thing that was kind of a
sort of in some sense a whispering of a

13164
04:09:08,510 --> 04:09:08,520
sort of in some sense a whispering of a
 

13165
04:09:08,520 --> 04:09:10,910
sort of in some sense a whispering of a
different part of the rouliad that one

13166
04:09:10,910 --> 04:09:10,920
different part of the rouliad that one
 

13167
04:09:10,920 --> 04:09:13,010
different part of the rouliad that one
hadn't you know one wasn't was not

13168
04:09:13,010 --> 04:09:13,020
hadn't you know one wasn't was not
 

13169
04:09:13,020 --> 04:09:15,110
hadn't you know one wasn't was not
accessible from what we knew in MA and

13170
04:09:15,110 --> 04:09:15,120
accessible from what we knew in MA and
 

13171
04:09:15,120 --> 04:09:16,189
accessible from what we knew in MA and
so on

13172
04:09:16,189 --> 04:09:16,199
so on
 

13173
04:09:16,199 --> 04:09:19,189
so on
does it make you sad that you're

13174
04:09:19,189 --> 04:09:19,199
does it make you sad that you're
 

13175
04:09:19,199 --> 04:09:21,710
does it make you sad that you're
exploring some these gigantic ideas and

13176
04:09:21,710 --> 04:09:21,720
exploring some these gigantic ideas and
 

13177
04:09:21,720 --> 04:09:23,870
exploring some these gigantic ideas and
it feels like we're on the verge of

13178
04:09:23,870 --> 04:09:23,880
it feels like we're on the verge of
 

13179
04:09:23,880 --> 04:09:25,910
it feels like we're on the verge of
breaking through to some very

13180
04:09:25,910 --> 04:09:25,920
breaking through to some very
 

13181
04:09:25,920 --> 04:09:27,530
breaking through to some very
interesting discoveries

13182
04:09:27,530 --> 04:09:27,540
interesting discoveries
 

13183
04:09:27,540 --> 04:09:29,990
interesting discoveries
and yet you're just a finite being

13184
04:09:29,990 --> 04:09:30,000
and yet you're just a finite being
 

13185
04:09:30,000 --> 04:09:33,170
and yet you're just a finite being
that's going to die way too soon and

13186
04:09:33,170 --> 04:09:33,180
that's going to die way too soon and
 

13187
04:09:33,180 --> 04:09:34,969
that's going to die way too soon and
that scan of your brain or your full

13188
04:09:34,969 --> 04:09:34,979
that scan of your brain or your full
 

13189
04:09:34,979 --> 04:09:38,090
that scan of your brain or your full
body kind of shows that you're yeah it's

13190
04:09:38,090 --> 04:09:38,100
body kind of shows that you're yeah it's
 

13191
04:09:38,100 --> 04:09:39,950
body kind of shows that you're yeah it's
just a bunch of meat it's just a bunch

13192
04:09:39,950 --> 04:09:39,960
just a bunch of meat it's just a bunch
 

13193
04:09:39,960 --> 04:09:41,689
just a bunch of meat it's just a bunch
of meat

13194
04:09:41,689 --> 04:09:41,699
of meat
 

13195
04:09:41,699 --> 04:09:44,450
of meat
um yeah does that make you make you a

13196
04:09:44,450 --> 04:09:44,460
um yeah does that make you make you a
 

13197
04:09:44,460 --> 04:09:46,729
um yeah does that make you make you a
little sad kind of shy I mean I kind of

13198
04:09:46,729 --> 04:09:46,739
little sad kind of shy I mean I kind of
 

13199
04:09:46,739 --> 04:09:48,229
little sad kind of shy I mean I kind of
like to see how all this stuff works out

13200
04:09:48,229 --> 04:09:48,239
like to see how all this stuff works out
 

13201
04:09:48,239 --> 04:09:50,330
like to see how all this stuff works out
but I think the thing to realize you

13202
04:09:50,330 --> 04:09:50,340
but I think the thing to realize you
 

13203
04:09:50,340 --> 04:09:51,769
but I think the thing to realize you
know it's an interesting sort of thought

13204
04:09:51,769 --> 04:09:51,779
know it's an interesting sort of thought
 

13205
04:09:51,779 --> 04:09:54,950
know it's an interesting sort of thought
experiment you know you you say okay you

13206
04:09:54,950 --> 04:09:54,960
experiment you know you you say okay you
 

13207
04:09:54,960 --> 04:09:56,990
experiment you know you you say okay you
know let's assume we can get cryonics to

13208
04:09:56,990 --> 04:09:57,000
know let's assume we can get cryonics to
 

13209
04:09:57,000 --> 04:09:59,090
know let's assume we can get cryonics to
work and one day it will that will be

13210
04:09:59,090 --> 04:09:59,100
work and one day it will that will be
 

13211
04:09:59,100 --> 04:10:00,349
work and one day it will that will be
one of these things that's kind of like

13212
04:10:00,349 --> 04:10:00,359
one of these things that's kind of like
 

13213
04:10:00,359 --> 04:10:02,809
one of these things that's kind of like
chat gbt one day somebody will figure

13214
04:10:02,809 --> 04:10:02,819
chat gbt one day somebody will figure
 

13215
04:10:02,819 --> 04:10:06,050
chat gbt one day somebody will figure
out you know how to get water from zero

13216
04:10:06,050 --> 04:10:06,060
out you know how to get water from zero
 

13217
04:10:06,060 --> 04:10:08,269
out you know how to get water from zero
degrees Centigrade down to you know

13218
04:10:08,269 --> 04:10:08,279
degrees Centigrade down to you know
 

13219
04:10:08,279 --> 04:10:09,889
degrees Centigrade down to you know
minus 44 or something without it

13220
04:10:09,889 --> 04:10:09,899
minus 44 or something without it
 

13221
04:10:09,899 --> 04:10:12,290
minus 44 or something without it
expanding and you know cryonics will be

13222
04:10:12,290 --> 04:10:12,300
expanding and you know cryonics will be
 

13223
04:10:12,300 --> 04:10:14,570
expanding and you know cryonics will be
solved and you'll be able to like just

13224
04:10:14,570 --> 04:10:14,580
solved and you'll be able to like just
 

13225
04:10:14,580 --> 04:10:17,630
solved and you'll be able to like just
uh you know put a pause in so to speak

13226
04:10:17,630 --> 04:10:17,640
uh you know put a pause in so to speak
 

13227
04:10:17,640 --> 04:10:21,110
uh you know put a pause in so to speak
and you know uh kind of reappear 100

13228
04:10:21,110 --> 04:10:21,120
and you know uh kind of reappear 100
 

13229
04:10:21,120 --> 04:10:23,389
and you know uh kind of reappear 100
years later or something and the thing

13230
04:10:23,389 --> 04:10:23,399
years later or something and the thing
 

13231
04:10:23,399 --> 04:10:25,309
years later or something and the thing
though that I've kind of increasingly

13232
04:10:25,309 --> 04:10:25,319
though that I've kind of increasingly
 

13233
04:10:25,319 --> 04:10:28,729
though that I've kind of increasingly
realized is that in a sense this this

13234
04:10:28,729 --> 04:10:28,739
realized is that in a sense this this
 

13235
04:10:28,739 --> 04:10:31,910
realized is that in a sense this this
whole question of kind of the the um

13236
04:10:31,910 --> 04:10:31,920
whole question of kind of the the um
 

13237
04:10:31,920 --> 04:10:34,429
whole question of kind of the the um
sort of one is embedded in a certain

13238
04:10:34,429 --> 04:10:34,439
sort of one is embedded in a certain
 

13239
04:10:34,439 --> 04:10:37,490
sort of one is embedded in a certain
moment in in time and you know kind of

13240
04:10:37,490 --> 04:10:37,500
moment in in time and you know kind of
 

13241
04:10:37,500 --> 04:10:39,410
moment in in time and you know kind of
the things we care about now the things

13242
04:10:39,410 --> 04:10:39,420
the things we care about now the things
 

13243
04:10:39,420 --> 04:10:42,410
the things we care about now the things
I care about now for example had I lived

13244
04:10:42,410 --> 04:10:42,420
I care about now for example had I lived
 

13245
04:10:42,420 --> 04:10:45,769
I care about now for example had I lived
you know 500 years ago many of the

13246
04:10:45,769 --> 04:10:45,779
you know 500 years ago many of the
 

13247
04:10:45,779 --> 04:10:47,450
you know 500 years ago many of the
things I care about now it's like that's

13248
04:10:47,450 --> 04:10:47,460
things I care about now it's like that's
 

13249
04:10:47,460 --> 04:10:49,490
things I care about now it's like that's
totally bizarre I mean nobody would care

13250
04:10:49,490 --> 04:10:49,500
totally bizarre I mean nobody would care
 

13251
04:10:49,500 --> 04:10:50,750
totally bizarre I mean nobody would care
about that it's not even the thing one

13252
04:10:50,750 --> 04:10:50,760
about that it's not even the thing one
 

13253
04:10:50,760 --> 04:10:51,950
about that it's not even the thing one
thinks about

13254
04:10:51,950 --> 04:10:51,960
thinks about
 

13255
04:10:51,960 --> 04:10:55,130
thinks about
in the future the things that most

13256
04:10:55,130 --> 04:10:55,140
in the future the things that most
 

13257
04:10:55,140 --> 04:10:56,510
in the future the things that most
people will think about you know one

13258
04:10:56,510 --> 04:10:56,520
people will think about you know one
 

13259
04:10:56,520 --> 04:11:00,110
people will think about you know one
will be a strange relic of thinking

13260
04:11:00,110 --> 04:11:00,120
will be a strange relic of thinking
 

13261
04:11:00,120 --> 04:11:03,170
will be a strange relic of thinking
about you know the kind of you know it

13262
04:11:03,170 --> 04:11:03,180
about you know the kind of you know it
 

13263
04:11:03,180 --> 04:11:05,570
about you know the kind of you know it
might be or might have been a theologian

13264
04:11:05,570 --> 04:11:05,580
might be or might have been a theologian
 

13265
04:11:05,580 --> 04:11:07,130
might be or might have been a theologian
thinking about you know how many angels

13266
04:11:07,130 --> 04:11:07,140
thinking about you know how many angels
 

13267
04:11:07,140 --> 04:11:08,510
thinking about you know how many angels
fit on the head of a pin or something

13268
04:11:08,510 --> 04:11:08,520
fit on the head of a pin or something
 

13269
04:11:08,520 --> 04:11:10,670
fit on the head of a pin or something
and that might have been the you know

13270
04:11:10,670 --> 04:11:10,680
and that might have been the you know
 

13271
04:11:10,680 --> 04:11:12,769
and that might have been the you know
the big intellectual thing so I think

13272
04:11:12,769 --> 04:11:12,779
the big intellectual thing so I think
 

13273
04:11:12,779 --> 04:11:15,830
the big intellectual thing so I think
it's a it's a um uh but yeah it's a it's

13274
04:11:15,830 --> 04:11:15,840
it's a it's a um uh but yeah it's a it's
 

13275
04:11:15,840 --> 04:11:17,210
it's a it's a um uh but yeah it's a it's
a you know it's one of these things

13276
04:11:17,210 --> 04:11:17,220
a you know it's one of these things
 

13277
04:11:17,220 --> 04:11:21,469
a you know it's one of these things
where particularly you know I've had the

13278
04:11:21,469 --> 04:11:21,479
where particularly you know I've had the
 

13279
04:11:21,479 --> 04:11:23,389
where particularly you know I've had the
I don't know good or bad fortune I'm not

13280
04:11:23,389 --> 04:11:23,399
I don't know good or bad fortune I'm not
 

13281
04:11:23,399 --> 04:11:25,429
I don't know good or bad fortune I'm not
sure I think it's it's a mixed thing

13282
04:11:25,429 --> 04:11:25,439
sure I think it's it's a mixed thing
 

13283
04:11:25,439 --> 04:11:27,469
sure I think it's it's a mixed thing
that I've you know I've invented a bunch

13284
04:11:27,469 --> 04:11:27,479
that I've you know I've invented a bunch
 

13285
04:11:27,479 --> 04:11:31,189
that I've you know I've invented a bunch
of things which I kind of can I think

13286
04:11:31,189 --> 04:11:31,199
of things which I kind of can I think
 

13287
04:11:31,199 --> 04:11:33,370
of things which I kind of can I think
see well enough what's going to happen

13288
04:11:33,370 --> 04:11:33,380
see well enough what's going to happen
 

13289
04:11:33,380 --> 04:11:36,170
see well enough what's going to happen
that you know in 50 years 100 years

13290
04:11:36,170 --> 04:11:36,180
that you know in 50 years 100 years
 

13291
04:11:36,180 --> 04:11:39,050
that you know in 50 years 100 years
whatever assuming the world doesn't

13292
04:11:39,050 --> 04:11:39,060
whatever assuming the world doesn't
 

13293
04:11:39,060 --> 04:11:41,750
whatever assuming the world doesn't
exterminate itself so to speak you know

13294
04:11:41,750 --> 04:11:41,760
exterminate itself so to speak you know
 

13295
04:11:41,760 --> 04:11:45,110
exterminate itself so to speak you know
these are things that will be sort of

13296
04:11:45,110 --> 04:11:45,120
these are things that will be sort of
 

13297
04:11:45,120 --> 04:11:47,030
these are things that will be sort of
centrally important to what's going on

13298
04:11:47,030 --> 04:11:47,040
centrally important to what's going on
 

13299
04:11:47,040 --> 04:11:50,150
centrally important to what's going on
and it's kind of both it's both a good

13300
04:11:50,150 --> 04:11:50,160
and it's kind of both it's both a good
 

13301
04:11:50,160 --> 04:11:51,710
and it's kind of both it's both a good
thing and a bad thing in terms of the

13302
04:11:51,710 --> 04:11:51,720
thing and a bad thing in terms of the
 

13303
04:11:51,720 --> 04:11:53,389
thing and a bad thing in terms of the
passage of one's life I mean it's kind

13304
04:11:53,389 --> 04:11:53,399
passage of one's life I mean it's kind
 

13305
04:11:53,399 --> 04:11:55,250
passage of one's life I mean it's kind
of like if everything I'd figured out

13306
04:11:55,250 --> 04:11:55,260
of like if everything I'd figured out
 

13307
04:11:55,260 --> 04:11:57,290
of like if everything I'd figured out
was like okay I figured it out when I

13308
04:11:57,290 --> 04:11:57,300
was like okay I figured it out when I
 

13309
04:11:57,300 --> 04:11:59,689
was like okay I figured it out when I
was 25 years old and everybody says it's

13310
04:11:59,689 --> 04:11:59,699
was 25 years old and everybody says it's
 

13311
04:11:59,699 --> 04:12:02,389
was 25 years old and everybody says it's
great and we're done and it's like okay

13312
04:12:02,389 --> 04:12:02,399
great and we're done and it's like okay
 

13313
04:12:02,399 --> 04:12:04,309
great and we're done and it's like okay
but I'm gonna live another how many

13314
04:12:04,309 --> 04:12:04,319
but I'm gonna live another how many
 

13315
04:12:04,319 --> 04:12:06,229
but I'm gonna live another how many
years and that's kind of it's all

13316
04:12:06,229 --> 04:12:06,239
years and that's kind of it's all
 

13317
04:12:06,239 --> 04:12:08,570
years and that's kind of it's all
downhill from there in a sense it's it's

13318
04:12:08,570 --> 04:12:08,580
downhill from there in a sense it's it's
 

13319
04:12:08,580 --> 04:12:12,110
downhill from there in a sense it's it's
better in some sense to to be able to

13320
04:12:12,110 --> 04:12:12,120
better in some sense to to be able to
 

13321
04:12:12,120 --> 04:12:14,389
better in some sense to to be able to
you know there's there's it sort of

13322
04:12:14,389 --> 04:12:14,399
you know there's there's it sort of
 

13323
04:12:14,399 --> 04:12:16,969
you know there's there's it sort of
keeps things interesting that you know

13324
04:12:16,969 --> 04:12:16,979
keeps things interesting that you know
 

13325
04:12:16,979 --> 04:12:19,010
keeps things interesting that you know
why I can see you know a lot of these

13326
04:12:19,010 --> 04:12:19,020
why I can see you know a lot of these
 

13327
04:12:19,020 --> 04:12:20,990
why I can see you know a lot of these
things I mean it's kind of I I didn't

13328
04:12:20,990 --> 04:12:21,000
things I mean it's kind of I I didn't
 

13329
04:12:21,000 --> 04:12:23,510
things I mean it's kind of I I didn't
expect you know chat GPT I didn't expect

13330
04:12:23,510 --> 04:12:23,520
expect you know chat GPT I didn't expect
 

13331
04:12:23,520 --> 04:12:26,269
expect you know chat GPT I didn't expect
the kind of uh the sort of opening up of

13332
04:12:26,269 --> 04:12:26,279
the kind of uh the sort of opening up of
 

13333
04:12:26,279 --> 04:12:28,550
the kind of uh the sort of opening up of
this idea of computation and

13334
04:12:28,550 --> 04:12:28,560
this idea of computation and
 

13335
04:12:28,560 --> 04:12:30,530
this idea of computation and
computational language that's been made

13336
04:12:30,530 --> 04:12:30,540
computational language that's been made
 

13337
04:12:30,540 --> 04:12:32,630
computational language that's been made
possible by this I didn't expect that

13338
04:12:32,630 --> 04:12:32,640
possible by this I didn't expect that
 

13339
04:12:32,640 --> 04:12:34,610
possible by this I didn't expect that
this is this is ahead of schedule so to

13340
04:12:34,610 --> 04:12:34,620
this is this is ahead of schedule so to
 

13341
04:12:34,620 --> 04:12:35,689
this is this is ahead of schedule so to
speak

13342
04:12:35,689 --> 04:12:35,699
speak
 

13343
04:12:35,699 --> 04:12:37,849
speak
um you know even though the sort of the

13344
04:12:37,849 --> 04:12:37,859
um you know even though the sort of the
 

13345
04:12:37,859 --> 04:12:40,189
um you know even though the sort of the
the big kind of flowering of that stuff

13346
04:12:40,189 --> 04:12:40,199
the big kind of flowering of that stuff
 

13347
04:12:40,199 --> 04:12:42,170
the big kind of flowering of that stuff
I'd sort of been assuming was another 50

13348
04:12:42,170 --> 04:12:42,180
I'd sort of been assuming was another 50
 

13349
04:12:42,180 --> 04:12:44,929
I'd sort of been assuming was another 50
years away so if it turns out it's a lot

13350
04:12:44,929 --> 04:12:44,939
years away so if it turns out it's a lot
 

13351
04:12:44,939 --> 04:12:47,570
years away so if it turns out it's a lot
less time that's pretty cool because you

13352
04:12:47,570 --> 04:12:47,580
less time that's pretty cool because you
 

13353
04:12:47,580 --> 04:12:49,429
less time that's pretty cool because you
know I'll hopefully get to see it so to

13354
04:12:49,429 --> 04:12:49,439
know I'll hopefully get to see it so to
 

13355
04:12:49,439 --> 04:12:52,670
know I'll hopefully get to see it so to
speak rather than

13356
04:12:52,670 --> 04:12:52,680
speak rather than
 

13357
04:12:52,680 --> 04:12:55,729
speak rather than
well I I think I speak for a very very

13358
04:12:55,729 --> 04:12:55,739
well I I think I speak for a very very
 

13359
04:12:55,739 --> 04:12:58,729
well I I think I speak for a very very
large number of people in saying that I

13360
04:12:58,729 --> 04:12:58,739
large number of people in saying that I
 

13361
04:12:58,739 --> 04:13:01,309
large number of people in saying that I
hope you stick around for a long time to

13362
04:13:01,309 --> 04:13:01,319
hope you stick around for a long time to
 

13363
04:13:01,319 --> 04:13:03,530
hope you stick around for a long time to
come you've had so many interesting

13364
04:13:03,530 --> 04:13:03,540
come you've had so many interesting
 

13365
04:13:03,540 --> 04:13:05,689
come you've had so many interesting
ideas you've created so many interesting

13366
04:13:05,689 --> 04:13:05,699
ideas you've created so many interesting
 

13367
04:13:05,699 --> 04:13:08,330
ideas you've created so many interesting
systems over the years and I can't see

13368
04:13:08,330 --> 04:13:08,340
systems over the years and I can't see
 

13369
04:13:08,340 --> 04:13:11,150
systems over the years and I can't see
now that GPT and language models broke

13370
04:13:11,150 --> 04:13:11,160
now that GPT and language models broke
 

13371
04:13:11,160 --> 04:13:13,189
now that GPT and language models broke
up in the world even more I can't wait

13372
04:13:13,189 --> 04:13:13,199
up in the world even more I can't wait
 

13373
04:13:13,199 --> 04:13:16,130
up in the world even more I can't wait
to see uh you at the Forefront of this

13374
04:13:16,130 --> 04:13:16,140
to see uh you at the Forefront of this
 

13375
04:13:16,140 --> 04:13:18,530
to see uh you at the Forefront of this
development what you what you do

13376
04:13:18,530 --> 04:13:18,540
development what you what you do
 

13377
04:13:18,540 --> 04:13:20,809
development what you what you do
and uh yeah I've been a fan of yours

13378
04:13:20,809 --> 04:13:20,819
and uh yeah I've been a fan of yours
 

13379
04:13:20,819 --> 04:13:22,610
and uh yeah I've been a fan of yours
like I've told you many many times since

13380
04:13:22,610 --> 04:13:22,620
like I've told you many many times since
 

13381
04:13:22,620 --> 04:13:24,769
like I've told you many many times since
the very beginning I'm deeply grateful

13382
04:13:24,769 --> 04:13:24,779
the very beginning I'm deeply grateful
 

13383
04:13:24,779 --> 04:13:26,150
the very beginning I'm deeply grateful
that you wrote a new kind of science

13384
04:13:26,150 --> 04:13:26,160
that you wrote a new kind of science
 

13385
04:13:26,160 --> 04:13:28,370
that you wrote a new kind of science
that you explored this mystery of

13386
04:13:28,370 --> 04:13:28,380
that you explored this mystery of
 

13387
04:13:28,380 --> 04:13:31,910
that you explored this mystery of
cellular automata and inspired this one

13388
04:13:31,910 --> 04:13:31,920
cellular automata and inspired this one
 

13389
04:13:31,920 --> 04:13:34,729
cellular automata and inspired this one
little kid in me uh to to pursue

13390
04:13:34,729 --> 04:13:34,739
little kid in me uh to to pursue
 

13391
