didn't

100
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
didn't
 

101
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,990
didn't
agree with that i i always felt oh look

102
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
agree with that i i always felt oh look

from dust
to dust you know ashes to ashes and

110
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
to dust you know ashes to ashes and
 

111
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,590
to dust you know ashes to ashes and
somehow i emerged from that

112
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
somehow i emerged from that
 

113
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,630
somehow i emerged from that
um

114
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
um
 

115
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,150
um
so that's really interesting so there

116
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
so that's really interesting so there
 

117
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,630
so that's really interesting so there
was a sense with cognitive

was a sense with cognitive
 

119
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,750
was a sense with cognitive
psychology that

120
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
psychology that
 

121
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,990

in understanding the sort of neuronal

122
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
in understanding the sort of neuronal
 

123
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,830
in understanding the sort of neuronal
structure of things you're not going to

124
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
structure of things you're not going to
 

125
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,910
structure of things you're not going to
be able to understand the mind

126
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
be able to understand the mind
 

127
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,309
be able to understand the mind
and then your senses if we study these

128
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
and then your senses if we study these
 

129
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,790
and then your senses if we study these
neural networks we might be able to get

130
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
neural networks we might be able to get
 

131
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,550
neural networks we might be able to get
at least very close to understanding the

132
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
at least very close to understanding the
 

133
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,110
at least very close to understanding the
fundamentals of the human mind yeah

134
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
fundamentals of the human mind yeah
 

135
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,589
fundamentals of the human mind yeah
i used to think um where i used to talk

136
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
i used to think um where i used to talk
 

137
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,830
i used to think um where i used to talk
about the idea of awakening from the

138
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
about the idea of awakening from the
 

139
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,470
about the idea of awakening from the
cartesian dream

140
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
cartesian dream
 

141
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,430
cartesian dream
so descartes

142
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440

 

143
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,790

you know thought about these things

144
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
you know thought about these things
 

145
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,750
you know thought about these things
right

146
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
right
 

147
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,869
right
he

148
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
he
 

149
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,710
he
he was walking in the gardens of

150
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
he was walking in the gardens of
 

151
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,110
he was walking in the gardens of
versailles one day and he stepped on a

152
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
versailles one day and he stepped on a
 

153
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,710
versailles one day and he stepped on a
stone

154
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
stone
 

155
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,990
stone
and a statue moved

156
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
and a statue moved
 

157
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,670
and a statue moved
and he walked a little further stepped

158
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
and he walked a little further stepped
 

159
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,430
and he walked a little further stepped
on another stone and another statue

160
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
on another stone and another statue
 

161
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,910
on another stone and another statue
moved and he like

162
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
moved and he like
 

163
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,670
moved and he like
why did the statue move when i stepped

164
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
why did the statue move when i stepped
 

165
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,430
why did the statue move when i stepped
on the stone and he went and talked to

166
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
on the stone and he went and talked to
 

167
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,149
on the stone and he went and talked to
the gardeners and he found out that they

168
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
the gardeners and he found out that they
 

169
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,710
the gardeners and he found out that they
had a hydraulic system

170
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
had a hydraulic system
 

171
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,630
had a hydraulic system
that allowed

172
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
that allowed
 

173
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,630
that allowed
the physical contact with the stone to

174
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
the physical contact with the stone to
 

175
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,070
the physical contact with the stone to
cause water to flow in various

176
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
cause water to flow in various
 

177
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,910
cause water to flow in various
directions which caused water to flow

178
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
directions which caused water to flow
 

179
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,869
directions which caused water to flow
under the statue and move the statue

180
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
under the statue and move the statue
 

181
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,030
under the statue and move the statue
and he

182
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
and he
 

183
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,869
and he
used this as

184
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
used this as
 

185
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,830
used this as
the beginnings of a theory about how

186
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
the beginnings of a theory about how
 

187
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,670
the beginnings of a theory about how
animals

188
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
animals
 

189
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,070
animals
act

190
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080

 

191
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,270

and

192
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
and
 

193
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,670
and
he had this notion that

194
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
he had this notion that
 

195
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,830
he had this notion that
these little fibers that people had

196
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
these little fibers that people had
 

197
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,589
these little fibers that people had
identified that weren't carrying the

198
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
identified that weren't carrying the
 

199
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,190
identified that weren't carrying the
blood

200
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
blood
 

201
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,110
blood
you know were these little hydraulic

202
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
you know were these little hydraulic
 

203
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,190
you know were these little hydraulic
tubes that if you touch something there

204
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
tubes that if you touch something there
 

205
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,630
tubes that if you touch something there
would be pressure and it would send a

206
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
would be pressure and it would send a
 

207
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,789
would be pressure and it would send a
signal of pressure to the

208
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
signal of pressure to the
 

209
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,630
signal of pressure to the
other parts of the system and that would

210
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
other parts of the system and that would
 

211
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,110
other parts of the system and that would
cause action

212
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
cause action
 

213
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,070
cause action
so he had a mechanistic theory of

214
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
so he had a mechanistic theory of
 

215
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,149
so he had a mechanistic theory of
animal behavior

216
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
animal behavior
 

217
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,630
animal behavior
and he thought that the human

218
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
and he thought that the human
 

219
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,830
and he thought that the human
had this animal

220
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
had this animal
 

221
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,830
had this animal
body but that some

222
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
body but that some
 

223
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,550
body but that some
divine something else had to have come

224
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
divine something else had to have come
 

225
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,789
divine something else had to have come
down and been placed in him

226
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
down and been placed in him
 

227
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,070
down and been placed in him
to give him the ability to think

228
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
to give him the ability to think
 

229
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,229
to give him the ability to think
right so

230
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
right so
 

231
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,110
right so
the physical world includes the body in

232
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
the physical world includes the body in
 

233
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,949
the physical world includes the body in
action but it doesn't include thought

234
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
action but it doesn't include thought
 

235
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,590
action but it doesn't include thought
according to descartes right

236
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
according to descartes right
 

237
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,310
according to descartes right
and so the study of physiology at that

238
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
and so the study of physiology at that
 

239
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,950
and so the study of physiology at that
time was the study of sensory systems

240
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
time was the study of sensory systems
 

241
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,189
time was the study of sensory systems
and motor systems and

242
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
and motor systems and
 

243
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,710
and motor systems and
things that you could

244
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
things that you could
 

245
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,030
things that you could
directly measure when you stimulated

246
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
directly measure when you stimulated
 

247
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,510
directly measure when you stimulated
neurons and stuff like that

248
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
neurons and stuff like that
 

249
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,270
neurons and stuff like that
and um

250
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
and um
 

251
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,870
and um
the study of cognition was something

252
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
the study of cognition was something
 

253
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,670
the study of cognition was something
that

254
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
that
 

255
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,670
that
you know was tied in with abstract

256
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
you know was tied in with abstract
 

257
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,110
you know was tied in with abstract
computer algorithms and things like that

258
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
computer algorithms and things like that
 

259
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,030
computer algorithms and things like that
but when i was an undergraduate i

260
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
but when i was an undergraduate i
 

261
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,629
but when i was an undergraduate i
learned about the physiological

262
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
learned about the physiological
 

263
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,830
learned about the physiological
mechanisms uh and so when i'm studying

264
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
mechanisms uh and so when i'm studying
 

265
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,150
mechanisms uh and so when i'm studying
cognitive psychology as a first year phd

266
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
cognitive psychology as a first year phd
 

267
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,670
cognitive psychology as a first year phd
student i'm saying

268
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
student i'm saying
 

269
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,189
student i'm saying
wait a minute the whole thing is

270
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
wait a minute the whole thing is
 

271
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,749
wait a minute the whole thing is
biological

272
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
biological
 

273
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,590
biological
you had that intuition right away that

274
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
you had that intuition right away that
 

275
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,790
you had that intuition right away that
was seemed obvious to you yeah yeah

276
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
was seemed obvious to you yeah yeah
 

277
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,870
was seemed obvious to you yeah yeah
it isn't that magical though that from

278
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
it isn't that magical though that from
 

279
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,749
it isn't that magical though that from
just

280
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
just
 

281
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,310
just
the little bit of biology can emerge the

282
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
the little bit of biology can emerge the
 

283
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,710
the little bit of biology can emerge the
full beauty of the human experience is

284
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
full beauty of the human experience is
 

285
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,670
full beauty of the human experience is
that

286
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
that
 

287
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,510
that
why is that so obvious to you well i

288
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
why is that so obvious to you well i
 

289
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,029
why is that so obvious to you well i
it's obvious

290
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
it's obvious
 

291
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,150
it's obvious
and not obvious at the same time um and

292
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
and not obvious at the same time um and
 

293
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,310
and not obvious at the same time um and
i think about darwin in this context too

294
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
i think about darwin in this context too
 

295
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,430
i think about darwin in this context too
because

296
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
because
 

297
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,430
because
darwin

298
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
darwin
 

299
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,670
darwin
knew very early on that none of the

300
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
knew very early on that none of the
 

301
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,110
knew very early on that none of the
ideas that anybody had ever offered

302
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
ideas that anybody had ever offered
 

303
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,749
ideas that anybody had ever offered
gave him a sense of understanding how

304
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
gave him a sense of understanding how
 

305
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,350
gave him a sense of understanding how
evolution

306
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
evolution
 

307
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,310
evolution
could have worked

308
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320

 

309
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,670

but he wanted to figure out how it could

310
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
but he wanted to figure out how it could
 

311
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,390
but he wanted to figure out how it could
have worked that was his goal

312
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
have worked that was his goal
 

313
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,230
have worked that was his goal
and

314
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
and
 

315
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,110
and
he

316
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
he
 

317
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,950
he
spent a lot of time

318
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
spent a lot of time
 

319
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,150
spent a lot of time
working on this idea and coming you know

320
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
working on this idea and coming you know
 

321
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,150
working on this idea and coming you know
reading about things that gave him hints

322
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
reading about things that gave him hints
 

323
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,510
reading about things that gave him hints
and thinking they were interesting but

324
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
and thinking they were interesting but
 

325
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,350
and thinking they were interesting but
not knowing why and

326
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
not knowing why and
 

327
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,710
not knowing why and
drawing more and more pictures of

328
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
drawing more and more pictures of
 

329
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,150
drawing more and more pictures of
different birds that differ slightly

330
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
different birds that differ slightly
 

331
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,309
different birds that differ slightly
from each other and so on you know and

332
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
from each other and so on you know and
 

333
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,189
from each other and so on you know and
and then then he figured it out

334
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
and then then he figured it out
 

335
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,790
and then then he figured it out
but after he figured it out he had

336
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
but after he figured it out he had
 

337
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,790
but after he figured it out he had
nightmares about it

338
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
nightmares about it
 

339
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,790
nightmares about it
he would dream about the complexity of

340
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
he would dream about the complexity of
 

341
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,990
he would dream about the complexity of
the eye

342
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
the eye
 

343
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,550
the eye
and the arguments that people had given

344
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
and the arguments that people had given
 

345
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,990
and the arguments that people had given
about how ridiculous it was to imagine

346
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
about how ridiculous it was to imagine
 

347
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,950
about how ridiculous it was to imagine
that

348
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
that
 

349
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,590
that
that could have ever emerged from some

350
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
that could have ever emerged from some
 

351
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,110
that could have ever emerged from some
sort of you know

352
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,120
sort of you know
 

353
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,270
sort of you know
unguided process right that it hadn't

354
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
unguided process right that it hadn't
 

355
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,309
unguided process right that it hadn't
been the product of design

356
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
been the product of design
 

357
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,350
been the product of design
and and uh so he he didn't publish for a

358
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
and and uh so he he didn't publish for a
 

359
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,590
and and uh so he he didn't publish for a
long time in part because he was

360
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
long time in part because he was
 

361
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,909
long time in part because he was
scared of his own ideas he didn't think

362
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
scared of his own ideas he didn't think
 

363
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,230
scared of his own ideas he didn't think
they could probably possibly be true

364
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
they could probably possibly be true
 

365
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,189
they could probably possibly be true
yeah

366
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
yeah
 

367
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,870
yeah
um

368
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
um
 

369
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,469
um
but then you know by the time

370
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
but then you know by the time
 

371
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,309
but then you know by the time
the 20th century rolls around we all

372
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
the 20th century rolls around we all
 

373
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,350
the 20th century rolls around we all
uh

374
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
uh
 

375
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,629
uh
you know we understand that evolut or

376
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
you know we understand that evolut or
 

377
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,430
you know we understand that evolut or
many people understand or believe

378
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
many people understand or believe
 

379
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,990
many people understand or believe
that evolution uh produced you know the

380
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
that evolution uh produced you know the
 

381
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,510
that evolution uh produced you know the
entire uh range of uh animals that there

382
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
entire uh range of uh animals that there
 

383
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,950
entire uh range of uh animals that there
are

384
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
are
 

385
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,830
are
uh and uh you know descartes idea starts

386
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
uh and uh you know descartes idea starts
 

387
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,909
uh and uh you know descartes idea starts
to seem a little wonky after a while

388
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
to seem a little wonky after a while
 

389
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,909
to seem a little wonky after a while
right like well wait a minute

390
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
right like well wait a minute
 

391
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,110
right like well wait a minute
um

392
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
um
 

393
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,070
um
there's

394
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
there's
 

395
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,390
there's
the apes and the chimpanzees and the

396
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
the apes and the chimpanzees and the
 

397
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,870
the apes and the chimpanzees and the
bonobos and you know like they're pretty

398
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
bonobos and you know like they're pretty
 

399
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,390
bonobos and you know like they're pretty
smart in some ways you know so what

400
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
smart in some ways you know so what
 

401
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,469
smart in some ways you know so what
oh you know somebody comes oh there's a

402
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
oh you know somebody comes oh there's a
 

403
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,990
oh you know somebody comes oh there's a
certain part of the brain that's still

404
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
certain part of the brain that's still
 

405
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,749
certain part of the brain that's still
different they don't you know there's no

406
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
different they don't you know there's no
 

407
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,909
different they don't you know there's no
hippocampus in the

408
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
hippocampus in the
 

409
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,510
hippocampus in the
monkey brain it's only in the human

410
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
monkey brain it's only in the human
 

411
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,629
monkey brain it's only in the human
brain

412
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
brain
 

413
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,029
brain
uh huxley had to do a surgery in front

414
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
uh huxley had to do a surgery in front
 

415
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,950
uh huxley had to do a surgery in front
of many many people in the late 19th

416
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
of many many people in the late 19th
 

417
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,710
of many many people in the late 19th
century to show to them there's actually

418
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
century to show to them there's actually
 

419
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,390
century to show to them there's actually
a hippocampus

420
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
a hippocampus
 

421
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,909
a hippocampus
in the chimpanzees brain you know

422
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
in the chimpanzees brain you know
 

423
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,909
in the chimpanzees brain you know
so so their continuity of the species is

424
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
so so their continuity of the species is
 

425
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,029
so so their continuity of the species is
another

426
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
another
 

427
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,110
another
element uh that you know contributes

428
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
element uh that you know contributes
 

429
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,790
element uh that you know contributes
to um

430
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
to um
 

431
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,589
to um
this sort of you know

432
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
this sort of you know
 

433
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,670
this sort of you know
idea that we are

434
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
idea that we are
 

435
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,189
idea that we are
ourselves uh a total product of nature

436
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
ourselves uh a total product of nature
 

437
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,430
ourselves uh a total product of nature
um and uh

438
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
um and uh
 

439
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,430
um and uh
that to me is the is the magic in the

440
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
that to me is the is the magic in the
 

441
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,869
that to me is the is the magic in the
mystery how

442
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
mystery how
 

443
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,350
mystery how
how nature could actually um

444
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360

 

445
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,469

you know give rise to

446
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
you know give rise to
 

447
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,430
you know give rise to
uh

448
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
uh
 

449
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,629
uh
organisms that have the capabilities

450
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
organisms that have the capabilities
 

451
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,909
organisms that have the capabilities
that we have

452
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
that we have
 

453
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,909
that we have
so it's interesting because even the

454
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
so it's interesting because even the
 

455
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,029
so it's interesting because even the
idea of evolution is hard for me to keep

456
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
idea of evolution is hard for me to keep
 

457
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,670
idea of evolution is hard for me to keep
all together in my mind so because we

458
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
all together in my mind so because we
 

459
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,990
all together in my mind so because we
think of a human time scale

460
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
think of a human time scale
 

461
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,709
think of a human time scale
it's hard to imagine that like like the

462
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
it's hard to imagine that like like the
 

463
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,310
it's hard to imagine that like like the
the development of the human eye would

464
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
the development of the human eye would
 

465
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,990
the development of the human eye would
give me nightmares too

466
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
give me nightmares too
 

467
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,829
give me nightmares too
because you have to think across many

468
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
because you have to think across many
 

469
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,750
because you have to think across many
many many generations

470
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
many many generations
 

471
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,670
many many generations
and it's very tempting to think about

472
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
and it's very tempting to think about
 

473
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,550
and it's very tempting to think about
kind of

474
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
kind of
 

475
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,630
kind of
a growth of a complicated object and

476
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
a growth of a complicated object and
 

477
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,870
a growth of a complicated object and
it's like how is it possible for that

478
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
it's like how is it possible for that
 

479
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,389
it's like how is it possible for that
such

480
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
such
 

481
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,949
such
such a thing to be built because also

482
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
such a thing to be built because also
 

483
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,550
such a thing to be built because also
me from a robotics engineering

484
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
me from a robotics engineering
 

485
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,150
me from a robotics engineering
perspective it's very hard to build

486
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
perspective it's very hard to build
 

487
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,230
perspective it's very hard to build
these systems how can

488
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
these systems how can
 

489
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,870
these systems how can
through an undirected process can a

490
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
through an undirected process can a
 

491
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,150
through an undirected process can a
complex thing be designed it seems not

492
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
complex thing be designed it seems not
 

493
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,269
complex thing be designed it seems not
it seems wrong yeah so that's absolutely

494
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
it seems wrong yeah so that's absolutely
 

495
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,110
it seems wrong yeah so that's absolutely
right and i you know

496
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
right and i you know
 

497
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,710
right and i you know
a slightly different career path that

498
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
a slightly different career path that
 

499
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,230
a slightly different career path that
would have been equally interesting to

500
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
would have been equally interesting to
 

501
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,350
would have been equally interesting to
me would have

502
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
me would have
 

503
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,190
me would have
would have been um to actually study the

504
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
would have been um to actually study the
 

505
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,590
would have been um to actually study the
process of

506
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:16,600
process of
 

507
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,070
process of
embryological development

508
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
embryological development
 

509
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,070
embryological development
flowing on into brain development and

510
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080

exquisite sort of laying down of
 

517
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,750
exquisite sort of laying down of

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
pathways and so on that occurs in the
 

519
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,070
pathways and so on that occurs in the
brain and uh i know the slightest bit

520
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
brain and uh i know the slightest bit
 

521
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,710
brain and uh i know the slightest bit
about that it's not my field but

522
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
about that it's not my field but
 

523
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,829
about that it's not my field but
um

524
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
um
 

525
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,790
um
there are

526
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800

 

527
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,030

you know fascinating

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,310
you know fascinating
aspects to this process that

aspects to this process that
 

531
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,269
aspects to this process that
eventually result in the

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
eventually result in the
 

533
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,630
eventually result in the
you know the complexity of of uh

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
you know the complexity of of uh
 

535
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,150
you know the complexity of of uh
various brains

536
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
various brains
 

537
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,310
various brains
at least you know one thing um we're

538
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
at least you know one thing um we're
 

539
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,670
at least you know one thing um we're

um
 

541
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,509
um
in in the field i think people have felt

542
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
in in the field i think people have felt
 

543
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,949
in in the field i think people have felt
for a long time

544
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
for a long time
 

545
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:03,590
for a long time
it

546
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
it
 

547
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,829
it

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,790
has been second nature for a lot longer
i was having i had this conversation

556
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
i was having i had this conversation
 

557
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,790
i was having i had this conversation
um with somebody who's a vision

558
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
um with somebody who's a vision
 

559
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,389
um with somebody who's a vision
scientist and you're saying oh we we

560
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
scientist and you're saying oh we we
 

561
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,829
scientist and you're saying oh we we
don't have any problem with this you

562
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
don't have any problem with this you
 

563
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,509
don't have any problem with this you
know the monkey's visual system and the

564
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
know the monkey's visual system and the
 

565
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,630
know the monkey's visual system and the
human visual system extremely similar

566
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
human visual system extremely similar
 

567
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,150
human visual system extremely similar
um

568
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
um
 

569
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,230
um
up to certain levels of course they they

570
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
up to certain levels of course they they
 

571
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,910
up to certain levels of course they they
diverge after a while but um the first

572
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
diverge after a while but um the first
 

573
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,870
diverge after a while but um the first
the the visual pathway from the eye to

574
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
the the visual pathway from the eye to
 

575
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,509
the the visual pathway from the eye to
the brain and the first few

576
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
the brain and the first few
 

577
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,110
the brain and the first few
um

578
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
um
 

579
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,389
um
layers of

580
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
layers of
 

581
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,829
layers of
cortex um or cortical areas i guess one

582
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
cortex um or cortical areas i guess one
 

583
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,949
cortex um or cortical areas i guess one
would say

584
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
would say
 

585
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,110
would say
uh are are extremely similar

586
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120

 

587
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,670

yeah so on the cognition side is where

588
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
yeah so on the cognition side is where
 

589
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,069
yeah so on the cognition side is where
the leap seems to happen with humans

590
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
the leap seems to happen with humans
 

591
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,550
the leap seems to happen with humans
that it does seem we're kind of special

592
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
that it does seem we're kind of special
 

593
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,310
that it does seem we're kind of special
and that's a really interesting question

594
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
and that's a really interesting question
 

595
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,949
and that's a really interesting question
when thinking about alien life or if

596
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
when thinking about alien life or if
 

597
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,310
when thinking about alien life or if
there's other intelligent alien

598
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
there's other intelligent alien
 

599
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,710
there's other intelligent alien
civilizations out there is how special

600
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
civilizations out there is how special
 

601
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,190
civilizations out there is how special
is this leap so one special thing seems

602
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
is this leap so one special thing seems
 

603
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,590
is this leap so one special thing seems
to be the origin of life itself however

604
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
to be the origin of life itself however
 

605
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,829
to be the origin of life itself however
you define that there's a gray area and

606
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
you define that there's a gray area and
 

607
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,069
you define that there's a gray area and
the other leap this is very biased

608
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
the other leap this is very biased
 

609
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,870
the other leap this is very biased
perspective of a human is the

610
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
perspective of a human is the
 

611
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,670
perspective of a human is the

the
origin of intelligence

614
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
origin of intelligence
 

615
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,990
origin of intelligence
and again from an engineer perspective

616
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
and again from an engineer perspective
 

617
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,870
and again from an engineer perspective
it's a

618
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
it's a
 

619
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,870
it's a
difficult question to ask an important

620
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
difficult question to ask an important
 

621
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,150
difficult question to ask an important
one

622
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
one
 

623
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,069
one
is how difficult does that leap how

624
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
is how difficult does that leap how
 

625
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,990
is how difficult does that leap how
special were humans

626
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
special were humans
 

627
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,389
special were humans
did uh did uh a monolith come down did

628
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
did uh did uh a monolith come down did
 

629
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,470
did uh did uh a monolith come down did
aliens bring down a monolith and some

630
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
aliens bring down a monolith and some
 

631
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,430
aliens bring down a monolith and some
apes had to touch a monolith but

632
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
apes had to touch a monolith but
 

633
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,829
apes had to touch a monolith but
to get it it's a lot like dark descartes

634
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
to get it it's a lot like dark descartes
 

635
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,630
to get it it's a lot like dark descartes
uh you know idea right exactly i it's

636
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
uh you know idea right exactly i it's
 

637
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,230
uh you know idea right exactly i it's
but it just seems

638
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
but it just seems
 

639
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,630
but it just seems
that it seems one heck of a leap yeah to

640
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
that it seems one heck of a leap yeah to
 

641
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,710
that it seems one heck of a leap yeah to
get to this level of intelligence yeah

642
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
get to this level of intelligence yeah
 

643
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,910
get to this level of intelligence yeah
and you know so chomsky um

644
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
and you know so chomsky um
 

645
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,949
and you know so chomsky um
uh argued um

646
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
uh argued um
 

647
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,110
uh argued um
that you know some

648
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
that you know some
 

649
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,949
that you know some
uh

650
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
uh
 

651
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,949
uh

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
you know just happened that some
 

657
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,990
you know just happened that some

um

682
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
um
 

683
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,150
um
i'm

684
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
i'm
 

685
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,230
i'm
i think there's a lot of truth to the

686
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
i think there's a lot of truth to the
 

687
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,910
i think there's a lot of truth to the
value and importance of language

688
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
value and importance of language
 

689
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,470
value and importance of language
but i think it comes along with

690
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
but i think it comes along with
 

691
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,110
but i think it comes along with
um the evolution of a lot of other

692
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
um the evolution of a lot of other
 

693
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,710
um the evolution of a lot of other
related things related to sociality

694
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
related things related to sociality
 

695
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,069
related things related to sociality
and mutual engagement with others

696
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
and mutual engagement with others
 

697
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,550
and mutual engagement with others
and um

698
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
and um
 

699
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,629

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,230
mechanisms for
organizing an understanding of the world

707
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,190

which language then plugs into right so

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
which language then plugs into right so
 

709
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,470
which language then plugs into right so
it's uh

710
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
it's uh
 

711
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,230
it's uh
language is a tool

712
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
language is a tool
 

713
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,750
language is a tool
that allows you to do this kind of

714
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
that allows you to do this kind of
 

715
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,509
that allows you to do this kind of
collective intelligence and whatever is

716
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
collective intelligence and whatever is
 

717
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,949
collective intelligence and whatever is
at the core of

718
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
at the core of
 

719
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,550
at the core of
the thing that allows for this

720
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
the thing that allows for this
 

721
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,310
the thing that allows for this
collective intelligence is the main

722
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
collective intelligence is the main
 

723
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,110
collective intelligence is the main
thing

724
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
thing
 

725
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,030
thing
and it's interesting to think about that

726
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
and it's interesting to think about that
 

727
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,110
and it's interesting to think about that
one fluke

728
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
one fluke
 

729
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,069
one fluke
one mutation could lead to the like the

730
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
one mutation could lead to the like the
 

731
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,069
one mutation could lead to the like the
the first crack open opening of the door

732
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
the first crack open opening of the door
 

733
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,389
the first crack open opening of the door
to human intelligence like all it takes

734
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
to human intelligence like all it takes
 

735
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,470
to human intelligence like all it takes
is one like evolution just kind of opens

736
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
is one like evolution just kind of opens
 

737
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,269
is one like evolution just kind of opens
the door a little bit and then it time

738
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
the door a little bit and then it time
 

739
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,750
the door a little bit and then it time
and selection takes care of the rest

740
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
and selection takes care of the rest
 

741
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,590
and selection takes care of the rest
you know there's so many fascinating

742
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
you know there's so many fascinating
 

743
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,790
you know there's so many fascinating
aspects to these kinds of things so

744
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
aspects to these kinds of things so
 

745
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,670
aspects to these kinds of things so
we think of evolution as continuous

746
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
we think of evolution as continuous
 

747
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,030
we think of evolution as continuous
right we think oh yes okay over

748
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
right we think oh yes okay over
 

749
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,269
right we think oh yes okay over
500 million years there could have been

750
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
500 million years there could have been
 

751
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,629
500 million years there could have been
this

752
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
this
 

753
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,509
this
you know relatively continuous

754
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
you know relatively continuous
 

755
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,990
you know relatively continuous
uh changes and

756
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
uh changes and
 

757
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,069
uh changes and
um

758
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
um
 

759
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,710
um
but that's not what

760
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
but that's not what

fossil record they found
you know

768
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
you know
 

769
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,710
you know
hundreds of years of

hundreds of millions of years of stasis
 

773
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,629
hundreds of millions of years of stasis
and then you know suddenly a change

774
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
and then you know suddenly a change
 

775
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,509
and then you know suddenly a change
occurs well suddenly on that scale is a

the concept of punctuated equilibrium

784
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
the concept of punctuated equilibrium
 

785
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,110
the concept of punctuated equilibrium
was a very important concept in

786
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
was a very important concept in
 

787
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,350
was a very important concept in
evolutionary biology

788
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
evolutionary biology
 

789
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,430
evolutionary biology
uh and

790
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
uh and
 

791
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,750
uh and
that

793
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,269

also feels

00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
also feels
 

795
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,990
also feels
somehow right about

796
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
somehow right about
 

797
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,030
somehow right about
you know

798
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
you know
 

799
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,910
you know
the stages of our mental abilities we

800
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
the stages of our mental abilities we
 

801
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,670
the stages of our mental abilities we
we seem to have a certain kind of

802
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
we seem to have a certain kind of
 

803
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,150
we seem to have a certain kind of
mindset at a certain age and then

804
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
mindset at a certain age and then
 

805
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,829
mindset at a certain age and then
at another

806
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
at another
 

807
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,590
at another
another age we like look at that

808
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
another age we like look at that
 

809
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,430
another age we like look at that
four-year-old and say oh my god how

810
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
four-year-old and say oh my god how
 

811
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,110
four-year-old and say oh my god how
could they have thought that way

812
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
could they have thought that way
 

813
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,110
could they have thought that way
so piaget was known for this kind of

814
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
so piaget was known for this kind of
 

815
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,509
so piaget was known for this kind of
stage theory of child development right

816
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
stage theory of child development right
 

817
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,990
stage theory of child development right
and you look at it closely and suddenly

818
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
and you look at it closely and suddenly
 

819
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,150
and you look at it closely and suddenly
those stages are so discreet and the

820
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
those stages are so discreet and the
 

821
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,069
those stages are so discreet and the
transitions but the difference between

822
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
transitions but the difference between
 

823
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,750
transitions but the difference between
the four-year-old and the seven-year-old

824
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
the four-year-old and the seven-year-old
 

825
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,069
the four-year-old and the seven-year-old
is profound and

826
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
is profound and
 

827
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,509
is profound and
that's another thing that's always

828
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
that's another thing that's always
 

829
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,310
that's another thing that's always
interested me is how we

830
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
interested me is how we
 

831
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,550
interested me is how we
something happens over the course of

832
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
something happens over the course of
 

833
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,550
something happens over the course of
several years of experience where at

834
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
several years of experience where at
 

835
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,430
several years of experience where at
some point we reach the point where

836
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
some point we reach the point where
 

837
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,030
some point we reach the point where
something like an insight or a

838
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
something like an insight or a
 

839
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,590
something like an insight or a
transition or a new stage of development

840
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
transition or a new stage of development
 

841
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,790
transition or a new stage of development
occurs and uh

842
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
occurs and uh
 

843
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,230
occurs and uh
you know these kinds of things can be

844
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
you know these kinds of things can be
 

845
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,590
you know these kinds of things can be
understood

846
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
understood
 

847
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,189
understood
um

848
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
um
 

849
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,749
um
in complex systems uh research and so um

850
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
in complex systems uh research and so um
 

851
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,069
in complex systems uh research and so um
evolutionary biology developmental

855
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,670

cognitive development are all things

856
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
cognitive development are all things
 

857
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,189
cognitive development are all things
that have been approached in this kind

858
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
that have been approached in this kind
 

859
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,030
that have been approached in this kind
of way yeah

860
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
of way yeah
 

861
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,550
of way yeah
just like you said i find both

862
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
just like you said i find both
 

863
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,910
just like you said i find both
fascinating

864
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
fascinating
 

865
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,030
fascinating
those early years of human life but also

866
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
those early years of human life but also
 

867
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,870
those early years of human life but also
the early like

868
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
the early like
 

869
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,910
the early like
minutes days of from the embryonic

870
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
minutes days of from the embryonic
 

871
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,030
minutes days of from the embryonic
development

872
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
development
 

873
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,790
development
to like how from embryos you get like

874
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
to like how from embryos you get like
 

875
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,269
to like how from embryos you get like
the brain that development

876
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
the brain that development
 

877
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,790
the brain that development
again from the engineering perspective

878
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
again from the engineering perspective
 

879
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,470
again from the engineering perspective
is fascinating so it's not so the early

880
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
is fascinating so it's not so the early
 

881
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,710
is fascinating so it's not so the early
when you deploy the brain to the human

882
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
when you deploy the brain to the human
 

883
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,790
when you deploy the brain to the human
world and it gets to explore that world

884
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
world and it gets to explore that world
 

885
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,790
world and it gets to explore that world
and learn that's fascinating but just

886
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
and learn that's fascinating but just
 

887
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,430
and learn that's fascinating but just
like the assembly of the mechanism that

888
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
like the assembly of the mechanism that
 

889
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,829
like the assembly of the mechanism that
is capable of learning that's like

890
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
is capable of learning that's like
 

891
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,509
is capable of learning that's like
amazing the stuff they're doing with

892
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
amazing the stuff they're doing with
 

893
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,509
amazing the stuff they're doing with
like brain organoids

894
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
like brain organoids
 

895
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,870
like brain organoids
where you can

896
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
where you can
 

897
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,509
where you can
build many brains and study that

898
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
build many brains and study that
 

899
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,550
build many brains and study that
um

900
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
um
 

901
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,710
um
self-assembly of a mechanism from like

00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
self-assembly of a mechanism from like
 

903
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,069

the heck
 

907
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,910
the heck
you have literally like biological

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
you have literally like biological
 

909
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,189
you have literally like biological

programs
 

911
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,990
programs
that just generate a system

912
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
that just generate a system
 

913
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,069
that just generate a system
this mushy thing

914
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
this mushy thing
 

915
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,430
this mushy thing
that's able to be robust and learn in a

916
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
that's able to be robust and learn in a
 

917
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,510
that's able to be robust and learn in a
very unpredictable world

918
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
very unpredictable world
 

919
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,390
very unpredictable world
and learn seemingly arbitrary things or

920
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
and learn seemingly arbitrary things or
 

921
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,669
and learn seemingly arbitrary things or
like

922
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
like
 

923
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,549
like
a very large number of things that

924
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
a very large number of things that
 

925
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,029
a very large number of things that
enable survival yeah

926
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
enable survival yeah
 

927
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,829
enable survival yeah
ultimately

928
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
ultimately
 

929
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,069
ultimately
um that is a very important part of the

930
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
um that is a very important part of the
 

931
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,230
um that is a very important part of the
whole process of you know understanding

932
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
whole process of you know understanding
 

933
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,069
whole process of you know understanding
this sort of

934
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
this sort of
 

935
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,949
this sort of
emergence of mind from brain kind of

936
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
emergence of mind from brain kind of
 

937
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,470
emergence of mind from brain kind of
kind of thing and the whole thing seems

938
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
kind of thing and the whole thing seems
 

939
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,110
kind of thing and the whole thing seems
to be pretty continuous so let me uh let

940
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
to be pretty continuous so let me uh let
 

941
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,270
to be pretty continuous so let me uh let
me step back to neural networks for for

942
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
me step back to neural networks for for
 

943
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,630
me step back to neural networks for for

minute you wrote parallel distributed
 

947
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,789
minute you wrote parallel distributed

so these are just some figures at the
 

965
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,590
so these are just some figures at the
time that were thinking about these big

ideas
 

969
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,029
ideas
what are some memorable moments of

00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
what are some memorable moments of
 

971
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,669
what are some memorable moments of
discovery and beautiful ideas from those

972

i'm going to start
 

977
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,430
i'm going to start
sort of with my own

978
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
sort of with my own
 

979
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,669
sort of with my own
process in the

980
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
process in the
 

981
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,029
process in the
mid 70s

982
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
mid 70s
 

983
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,909
mid 70s
and then into the late 70s

984
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
and then into the late 70s
 

985
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,510
and then into the late 70s
when

986
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
when
 

987
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,510
when
i met jeff hinson and

988
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
i met jeff hinson and
 

989
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,590
i met jeff hinson and
he came to san diego

990
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
he came to san diego
 

991
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,270
he came to san diego
and we were all together

992
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280

 

993
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,270

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,029
in
my time in graduate school as i've

my time in graduate school as i've
 

997
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,029
my time in graduate school as i've
already described to you i had this sort

998
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
already described to you i had this sort
 

999
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,630
already described to you i had this sort
of feeling of

1000
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
of feeling of
 

1001
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,789
of feeling of
okay i'm really interested in human

1002
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
okay i'm really interested in human
 

1003
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,950
okay i'm really interested in human
cognition but

1004
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
cognition but
 

1005
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,510
cognition but
this disembodied sort of way of thinking

1006
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
this disembodied sort of way of thinking
 

1007
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,470
this disembodied sort of way of thinking
about it that i'm getting from the

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
about it that i'm getting from the
 

1009
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,430
about it that i'm getting from the
current

working fully for me
 

1015
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,909
working fully for me
and

1016
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
and
 

1017
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,549

i think about the mind
in terms of a neural network it will

1146
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
in terms of a neural network it will
 

1147
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,510
in terms of a neural network it will
help me answer the questions about the

1148

and uh
the word parallel is really interesting

1292
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
the word parallel is really interesting
 

1293
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,149
the word parallel is really interesting
so it's it's almost like synonymous from

1294
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
so it's it's almost like synonymous from
 

1295
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,390
so it's it's almost like synonymous from
a computational perspective what how you

1296
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
a computational perspective what how you
 

1297
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,070
a computational perspective what how you
thought at the time about

1298
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
thought at the time about
 

1299
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,990
thought at the time about
neural networks that is parallel

1300
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
neural networks that is parallel
 

1301
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,269
neural networks that is parallel
computation

1302
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
computation
 

1303
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,029
computation
is that would that be fair to say well

1304
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
is that would that be fair to say well
 

1305
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,830
is that would that be fair to say well
yeah the the parallel the word parallel

1306
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
yeah the the parallel the word parallel
 

1307
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,190
yeah the the parallel the word parallel
in this

1308
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
in this
 

1309
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,510
in this
you know comes from the idea that each

1310
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:27,520
you know comes from the idea that each
 

1311
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,070
you know comes from the idea that each
neuron is

1312
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
neuron is
 

1313
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,430
neuron is
an independent computational unit right

1314
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
an independent computational unit right
 

1315
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,669
an independent computational unit right
it it gathers data from other neurons it

1316
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
it it gathers data from other neurons it
 

1317
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,510
it it gathers data from other neurons it
integrates it in a certain way and then

1318
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
integrates it in a certain way and then
 

1319
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,549
integrates it in a certain way and then
it produces a result and it's a very

1320
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
it produces a result and it's a very
 

1321
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,510
it produces a result and it's a very
simple little computational unit but it

1322
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
simple little computational unit but it
 

1323
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,350
simple little computational unit but it
it's autonomous in the sense that

1324
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
it's autonomous in the sense that
 

1325
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,350
it's autonomous in the sense that
you know it does its thing right it's

1326
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
you know it does its thing right it's
 

1327
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,510
you know it does its thing right it's
it's in a biological medium where it's

1328
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
it's in a biological medium where it's
 

1329
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,630
it's in a biological medium where it's
getting nutrients and various uh

1330
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
getting nutrients and various uh
 

1331
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,830
getting nutrients and various uh
chemicals from that medium

1332
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
chemicals from that medium
 

1333
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,230
chemicals from that medium
um but it's uh you know you can think of

1334
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
um but it's uh you know you can think of
 

1335
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,789
um but it's uh you know you can think of
it as almost like a little

1336
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
it as almost like a little
 

1337
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,830
it as almost like a little
little computer in and of itself

1338
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:07,840
little computer in and of itself
 

1339
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,230
little computer in and of itself
so the idea is that each you know our

1340
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
so the idea is that each you know our
 

1341
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,590
so the idea is that each you know our
brains have oh look you know a hundred

1342
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
brains have oh look you know a hundred
 

1343
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,630
brains have oh look you know a hundred
or

1344
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
or
 

1345
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,909
or
hundreds

1346
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
hundreds
 

1347
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,149
hundreds
almost a billion of these

1348
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
almost a billion of these
 

1349
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,470
almost a billion of these
little neurons right

1350
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
little neurons right
 

1351
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,510
little neurons right
um

1352
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
um
 

1353
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,990
um
and they're all capable of doing their

1354
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
and they're all capable of doing their
 

1355
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,710
and they're all capable of doing their
work at the same time so it's like

1356
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
work at the same time so it's like
 

1357
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,110
work at the same time so it's like
instead of just a single central

1358
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
instead of just a single central
 

1359
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,750
instead of just a single central
processor that's engaged in you know

1360
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
processor that's engaged in you know
 

1361
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,630
processor that's engaged in you know
chug chug one step after another

1362
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640

 

1363
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,549

we have

1364
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
we have
 

1365
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,549
we have
a billion of these little computational

1366
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
a billion of these little computational
 

1367
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,870
a billion of these little computational
units working at the same time so at the

1368
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
units working at the same time so at the
 

1369
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,870
units working at the same time so at the
time that's i don't know maybe you can

1370
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
time that's i don't know maybe you can
 

1371
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,269
time that's i don't know maybe you can
comment it seems to me

1372
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
comment it seems to me
 

1373
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,430
comment it seems to me
even still to me uh quite a

1374
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
even still to me uh quite a
 

1375
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,190
even still to me uh quite a
revolutionary way to think about

1376
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
revolutionary way to think about
 

1377
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,870
revolutionary way to think about
computation

1378
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
computation
 

1379
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,310

00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
relative to
 

1381
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,070
relative to
the development of theoretical computer

1382
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
the development of theoretical computer
 

1383
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,230
the development of theoretical computer
science alongside of that where it's

1384
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
science alongside of that where it's
 

1385
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,230
science alongside of that where it's
very much like sequential computer

1386
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
very much like sequential computer
 

1387
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,149
very much like sequential computer
you're analyzing algorithms that are

1388
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:02,159
you're analyzing algorithms that are
 

1389
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,990
you're analyzing algorithms that are
running on a single computer that's

1390
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
running on a single computer that's
 

1391
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,430
running on a single computer that's
right you're saying

1392
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
right you're saying
 

1393
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,669
right you're saying
wait a minute what what

1394
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
wait a minute what what
 

1395
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,070
wait a minute what what
why don't we take a really dumb very

1396
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
why don't we take a really dumb very
 

1397
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,310
why don't we take a really dumb very
simple computer and just have a lot of

1398
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
simple computer and just have a lot of
 

1399
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,549
simple computer and just have a lot of
them interconnected together and they're

1400
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
them interconnected together and they're
 

1401
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,390
them interconnected together and they're
all operating in their own little world

1402
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
all operating in their own little world
 

1403
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,750
all operating in their own little world
and they're communicating with each

1404
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
and they're communicating with each
 

1405
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,149
and they're communicating with each
other and thinking of computation in

1406
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
other and thinking of computation in
 

1407
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,310
other and thinking of computation in
that way and from that kind of

00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
that way and from that kind of

00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440
on trying to understand how things like

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,950
on trying to understand how things like
certain characteristics of the human

mind can emerge
 

1417
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,590
mind can emerge
right that's quite a revolutionary way

1418
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600
right that's quite a revolutionary way
 

1419
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,909
right that's quite a revolutionary way
of thinking i would say

1420
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:35,919
of thinking i would say
 

1421
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,909
of thinking i would say
well yes i agree with you and um

1422
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
well yes i agree with you and um
 

1423
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,990
well yes i agree with you and um
there's still this sort of sense

1424
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,000
there's still this sort of sense
 

1425
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,590
there's still this sort of sense
of

1426
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600

 

1427
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,470

not sort of knowing how we

1428
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,480
not sort of knowing how we
 

1429
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,310
not sort of knowing how we
kind of get all the way there um i think

1430
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
kind of get all the way there um i think
 

1431
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,269
kind of get all the way there um i think
and this very much remains

1432
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
and this very much remains
 

1433
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,789
and this very much remains
at the core of the questions that

1434
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:58,799
at the core of the questions that
 

1435
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,310
at the core of the questions that
everybody's asking about the

1436
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
everybody's asking about the
 

1437
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,990
everybody's asking about the
capabilities of deep learning and all

1438
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
capabilities of deep learning and all
 

1439
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,669
capabilities of deep learning and all
these kinds of things but if i could

1440
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
these kinds of things but if i could
 

1441
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,430
these kinds of things but if i could
just play this out a little bit

1442
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440

 

1443
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,230

a a convolutional neural network or a

1444
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
a a convolutional neural network or a
 

1445
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,230
a a convolutional neural network or a
cnn which

1446
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
cnn which
 

1447
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,350
cnn which
you know many people may have heard of

1448
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,360
you know many people may have heard of
 

1449
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,510
you know many people may have heard of
is

1450
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
is
 

1451
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,510
is
a set of

1452
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
a set of
 

1453
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,190
a set of
you could think of it biologically as

1454
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
you could think of it biologically as
 

1455
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,870
you could think of it biologically as
a set of

1456
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:24,880
a set of
 

1457
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,909
a set of
collections of neurons each one had

1458
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:27,919
collections of neurons each one had
 

1459
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,310
collections of neurons each one had
each collection has

1460
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
each collection has
 

1461
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,430
each collection has
maybe

1462
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
maybe
 

1463
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,630
maybe
10 000 neurons in it but there's many

1464
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,640
10 000 neurons in it but there's many
 

1465
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,110
10 000 neurons in it but there's many
layers right some of these things are

1466
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
layers right some of these things are
 

1467
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,909
layers right some of these things are
hundreds or even a thousand layers deep

1468
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
hundreds or even a thousand layers deep
 

1469
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,950
hundreds or even a thousand layers deep
but

1470
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
but
 

1471
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,190
but
others are closer to the biological

1472
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
others are closer to the biological
 

1473
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,110
others are closer to the biological
brain and maybe they're like 20 layers

1474
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
brain and maybe they're like 20 layers
 

1475
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,870
brain and maybe they're like 20 layers
deep or something like that

1476
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
deep or something like that
 

1477
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,389
deep or something like that
so we have

1478
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
so we have
 

1479
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,590
so we have
within each layer we have

1480
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
within each layer we have
 

1481
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,430
within each layer we have
thousands of neurons or tens of

1482
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
thousands of neurons or tens of
 

1483
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,350
thousands of neurons or tens of
thousands maybe well in the brain we

1484
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
thousands maybe well in the brain we
 

1485
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,510
thousands maybe well in the brain we
probably have

1486
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
probably have
 

1487
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,909
probably have
millions in each layer so but we're

1488
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
millions in each layer so but we're
 

1489
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,230
millions in each layer so but we're
getting sort of similar in a certain way

1490
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
getting sort of similar in a certain way
 

1491
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,590
getting sort of similar in a certain way
right

1492
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
right
 

1493
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,909
right
um

1494
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919

 

1495
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,909

and then we think okay at the bottom

1496
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
and then we think okay at the bottom
 

1497
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,110
and then we think okay at the bottom
level

1498
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
level
 

1499
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,950
level
there's an array of things that are like

1500
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:10,960
there's an array of things that are like
 

1501
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,190
there's an array of things that are like
the photoreceptors in there in the eye

1502
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,200
the photoreceptors in there in the eye
 

1503
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,590
the photoreceptors in there in the eye
they respond to the amount of light of a

1504
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
they respond to the amount of light of a
 

1505
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,830
they respond to the amount of light of a
certain wavelength at a certain location

1506
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
certain wavelength at a certain location
 

1507
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,190
certain wavelength at a certain location
on the

1508
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
on the
 

1509
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,029
on the
on the pixel array

1510
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
on the pixel array
 

1511
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,470
on the pixel array
so that's like the biological eye

1512
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
so that's like the biological eye
 

1513
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,549
so that's like the biological eye
and then there's several further stages

1514
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
and then there's several further stages
 

1515
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,789
and then there's several further stages
going up layers of these neuron-like

1516
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
going up layers of these neuron-like
 

1517
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,389
going up layers of these neuron-like
units

1518
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
units
 

1519
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,350
units
and

1520
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
and
 

1521
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,789
and
you go from that raw

1522
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
you go from that raw
 

1523
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,750
you go from that raw
input array of pixels to

1524
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:37,760
input array of pixels to
 

1525
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,990
input array of pixels to
a classification

1526
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,000
a classification
 

1527
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,990
a classification
you've actually built a system that

1528
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
you've actually built a system that
 

1529
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,470
you've actually built a system that
could do the same kind of thing that you

1530
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
could do the same kind of thing that you
 

1531
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,070
could do the same kind of thing that you
and i do when we open our eyes and we

1532
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,080
and i do when we open our eyes and we
 

1533
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,830
and i do when we open our eyes and we
look around and we see there's a cup

1534
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
look around and we see there's a cup
 

1535
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,510
look around and we see there's a cup
there's a cell phone

1536
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,520
there's a cell phone
 

1537
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,070
there's a cell phone
there's a water bottle

1538
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,080
there's a water bottle
 

1539
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,990
there's a water bottle
and these systems are doing that now

1540
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
and these systems are doing that now
 

1541
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,870
and these systems are doing that now
right

1542
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:54,880
right
 

1543
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,990
right
so

1544
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
so
 

1545
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,590
so
they are

1546
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
they are
 

1547
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,549
they are
in in terms of the parallel idea that we

1548
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
in in terms of the parallel idea that we
 

1549
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,149
in in terms of the parallel idea that we
were talking about before

1550
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:02,159
were talking about before
 

1551
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,710
were talking about before
they are doing this massively parallel

1552
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
they are doing this massively parallel
 

1553
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,510
they are doing this massively parallel
computation in the sense that

1554
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,520
computation in the sense that
 

1555
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,190
computation in the sense that
each of the neurons in each of those

1556
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
each of the neurons in each of those
 

1557
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,789
each of the neurons in each of those
layers is

1558
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
layers is
 

1559
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,590
layers is
thought of as computing its little bit

1560
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
thought of as computing its little bit
 

1561
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,510
thought of as computing its little bit
of

1562
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
of
 

1563
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,669
of
something about the input uh

1564
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
something about the input uh
 

1565
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,590
something about the input uh
simultaneously with all the other ones

1566
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
simultaneously with all the other ones
 

1567
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,830
simultaneously with all the other ones
in the same layer

1568
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:21,840
in the same layer
 

1569
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,669
in the same layer
we get to the point of abstracting that

1570
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
we get to the point of abstracting that
 

1571
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,310
we get to the point of abstracting that
away and thinking oh it's just one whole

1572
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
away and thinking oh it's just one whole
 

1573
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,029
away and thinking oh it's just one whole
vector that's being computed one one

1574
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039
vector that's being computed one one
 

1575
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,190
vector that's being computed one one
activation pattern is computed in a

1576
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
activation pattern is computed in a
 

1577
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,789
activation pattern is computed in a
single step and that

1578
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799
single step and that
 

1579
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,310
single step and that
that that abstraction is useful

1580
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
that that abstraction is useful
 

1581
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,110
that that abstraction is useful
but it's still that parallel

1582
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
but it's still that parallel
 

1583
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,510
but it's still that parallel
and distributed processing right each

1584
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,520
and distributed processing right each
 

1585
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,190
and distributed processing right each
one of these guys is just contributing a

1586
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
one of these guys is just contributing a
 

1587
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,350
one of these guys is just contributing a
tiny bit to that whole thing and that's

1588
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
tiny bit to that whole thing and that's
 

1589
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,110
tiny bit to that whole thing and that's
the excitement that you felt that from

1590
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
the excitement that you felt that from
 

1591
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,710
the excitement that you felt that from
these simple

1592
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
these simple
 

1593
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,510
these simple
things you can emerge when you add these

1594
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:51,520
things you can emerge when you add these
 

1595
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,230
things you can emerge when you add these
level of abstractions on it yeah you can

1596
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,240
level of abstractions on it yeah you can
 

1597
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,830
level of abstractions on it yeah you can
start getting all the beautiful things

1598
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:55,840
start getting all the beautiful things
 

1599
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,070
start getting all the beautiful things
that we think about as cognition right

1600
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
that we think about as cognition right
 

1601
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,029
that we think about as cognition right
and so okay so you have this conference

1602
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
and so okay so you have this conference
 

1603
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,470
and so okay so you have this conference
i forgot the name already but it's

1604
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
i forgot the name already but it's
 

1605
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,990
i forgot the name already but it's
parallel and something associative

1606
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
parallel and something associative
 

1607
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,830
parallel and something associative
memory and so on

1608
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
memory and so on
 

1609
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,830
memory and so on
very exciting technical and exciting

1610
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
very exciting technical and exciting
 

1611
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,950
very exciting technical and exciting
title and you started talking about dave

1612
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:10,960
title and you started talking about dave
 

1613
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,669
title and you started talking about dave
romohart so who is this person

1614
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
romohart so who is this person
 

1615
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,950
romohart so who is this person
that was so

1616
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
that was so
 

1617
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,110
that was so
you've spoken very highly of him yeah

1618
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,120
you've spoken very highly of him yeah
 

1619
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,149
you've spoken very highly of him yeah
can you tell me about him his ideas his

1620
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:20,159
can you tell me about him his ideas his
 

1621
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,590
can you tell me about him his ideas his
mind

1622
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
mind
 

1623
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,510
mind
who he was as a human being as a

1624
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:23,520
who he was as a human being as a
 

1625
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,950
who he was as a human being as a
scientist

1626
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
scientist
 

1627
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,669
scientist
so

1628
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
so
 

1629
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,029
so
dave came from a little tiny town in

1630
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,039
dave came from a little tiny town in
 

1631
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,669
dave came from a little tiny town in
western south dakota

1632
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
western south dakota
 

1633
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,029
western south dakota
and

1634
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:33,039
and
 

1635
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,230
and
his

1636
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
his
 

1637
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,470
his
mother was the librarian and his father

1638
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
mother was the librarian and his father
 

1639
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,510
mother was the librarian and his father
was the editor of the newspaper

1640
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:39,520
was the editor of the newspaper
 

1641
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,110
was the editor of the newspaper
um

1642
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
um
 

1643
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,350
um
and uh i know one of his brothers pretty

1644
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360
and uh i know one of his brothers pretty
 

1645
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,990
and uh i know one of his brothers pretty
well um

1646
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,000
well um
 

1647
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,430
well um
they grew up

1648
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
they grew up
 

1649
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,870
they grew up
there were four brothers uh and uh

1650
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:50,880
there were four brothers uh and uh
 

1651
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,230
there were four brothers uh and uh
they grew up

1652
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
they grew up
 

1653
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,269
they grew up
together

1654
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
together
 

1655
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,510
together
uh and their father encouraged them to

1656
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
uh and their father encouraged them to
 

1657
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,310
uh and their father encouraged them to
compete with each other a lot

1658
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
compete with each other a lot
 

1659
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,549
compete with each other a lot
they competed in sports and they

1660
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:00,559
they competed in sports and they
 

1661
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,470
they competed in sports and they
competed in mind games you know um

1662
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
competed in mind games you know um
 

1663
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,389
competed in mind games you know um
i don't know things like sudoku and

1664
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:06,399
i don't know things like sudoku and
 

1665
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,710
i don't know things like sudoku and
chess and various things like that

1666

dave um
 

1671
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,830
dave um
was

1672
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
was
 

1673
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,070
was
a standout undergraduate he went

1674
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
a standout undergraduate he went
 

1675
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,389
a standout undergraduate he went
as at a younger age than most people do

1676
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
as at a younger age than most people do
 

1677
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,590
as at a younger age than most people do
to college

1678
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600
to college
 

1679
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,190
to college
at the university of south dakota and

1680
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,200
at the university of south dakota and
 

1681
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,470
at the university of south dakota and
majored in mathematics and i don't know

1682
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
majored in mathematics and i don't know
 

1683
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,110
majored in mathematics and i don't know
how he got interested in

1684
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,120
how he got interested in
 

1685
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,830
how he got interested in
psychology but he

1686
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:31,840
psychology but he
 

1687
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,909
psychology but he
applied to the mathematical psychology

1688
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
applied to the mathematical psychology
 

1689
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,070
applied to the mathematical psychology
program at stanford and was accepted as

1690
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,080
program at stanford and was accepted as
 

1691
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,029
program at stanford and was accepted as
a phd student to study mathematical

1692
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
a phd student to study mathematical
 

1693
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,110
a phd student to study mathematical
psychology at stanford so mathematical

1694
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
psychology at stanford so mathematical
 

1695
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,430
psychology at stanford so mathematical
psychology

1696
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
psychology
 

1697
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,029
psychology
is the

1698
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:45,039
is the
 

1699
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,950
is the
use of mathematics to model

1700
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
use of mathematics to model
 

1701
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,750
use of mathematics to model
mental processes right so something that

1702
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,760
mental processes right so something that
 

1703
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,950
mental processes right so something that
i think these days might be called

1704
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
i think these days might be called
 

1705
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,830
i think these days might be called
cognitive modeling that whole space yeah

1706
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:55,840
cognitive modeling that whole space yeah
 

1707
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,430
cognitive modeling that whole space yeah
it's mathematical in the sense that

1708
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
it's mathematical in the sense that
 

1709
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,630
it's mathematical in the sense that
um

1710
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:00,640
um
 

1711
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,310
um
you say

1712
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320
you say
 

1713
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,830
you say
if

1714
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:03,840
if
 

1715
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,909
if
this is true and that is true then i can

1716
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
this is true and that is true then i can
 

1717
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,230
this is true and that is true then i can
derive that this should follow okay and

1718
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
derive that this should follow okay and
 

1719
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,149
derive that this should follow okay and
so you say these are my stipulations

1720
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
so you say these are my stipulations
 

1721
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,310
so you say these are my stipulations
about the fundamental principles and

1722
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,320
about the fundamental principles and
 

1723
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,190
about the fundamental principles and
this is my prediction about behavior and

1724
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
this is my prediction about behavior and
 

1725
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,029
this is my prediction about behavior and
it's all done with equations it's not

1726
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
it's all done with equations it's not
 

1727
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,509
it's all done with equations it's not
done with a computer simulation

1728
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
done with a computer simulation
 

1729
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,230
done with a computer simulation
right so the you you solve the equation

1730
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,240
right so the you you solve the equation
 

1731
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,029
right so the you you solve the equation
and that tells you what the

1732
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,039
and that tells you what the
 

1733
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,870
and that tells you what the
probability that the subject will be

1734
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
probability that the subject will be
 

1735
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,549
probability that the subject will be
correct on the seventh trial of the

1736
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
correct on the seventh trial of the
 

1737
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,149
correct on the seventh trial of the
experiment is or something like that

1738
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:30,159
experiment is or something like that
 

1739
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,710
experiment is or something like that
right so it's a it's a it's a

1740
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
right so it's a it's a it's a
 

1741
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,830
right so it's a it's a it's a
it's a

1742
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
it's a
 

1743
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,830
it's a
use of mathematics to descriptively

1744
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:35,840
use of mathematics to descriptively
 

1745
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,909
use of mathematics to descriptively
characterize uh aspects of of behavior

1746
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
characterize uh aspects of of behavior
 

1747
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,870
characterize uh aspects of of behavior
and uh stanford at that time was the

1748
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:42,880
and uh stanford at that time was the
 

1749
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,389
and uh stanford at that time was the
place where

1750
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:44,399
place where
 

1751
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,830
place where
uh there were several really really

1752
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:47,840
uh there were several really really
 

1753
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,310
uh there were several really really
strong mathematical thinkers who were

1754
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,320
strong mathematical thinkers who were
 

1755
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,070
strong mathematical thinkers who were
also connected with three or four others

1756
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,080
also connected with three or four others
 

1757
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,509
also connected with three or four others
around the country

1758
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:53,519
around the country
 

1759
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,230
around the country
who um you know brought a lot of really

1760
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,240
who um you know brought a lot of really
 

1761
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,110
who um you know brought a lot of really
exciting ideas uh onto the table

1762
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,120
exciting ideas uh onto the table
 

1763
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,710
exciting ideas uh onto the table
and it was a very very prestigious part

1764
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
and it was a very very prestigious part
 

1765
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,870
and it was a very very prestigious part
of the field of psychology at that time

1766
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
of the field of psychology at that time
 

1767
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,509
of the field of psychology at that time
so remember heart comes into this

1768
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:07,519
so remember heart comes into this
 

1769
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,310
so remember heart comes into this
um

1770
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
um
 

1771
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,549
um
he was a very strong student within that

1772
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:10,559
he was a very strong student within that
 

1773
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,789
he was a very strong student within that
program

00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
i got there
 

1799
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,269
i got there
in 74 seven years later

1800
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
in 74 seven years later
 

1801
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,950
in 74 seven years later
and

1802
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
and
 

1803
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,590
and
reunhard at that time

1804

reunhard at that time
 

1805
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,190
reunhard at that time
was

1806
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
was
 

1807
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,190
was
still doing mathematical modeling

1808
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
still doing mathematical modeling
 

1809
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,710
still doing mathematical modeling
um

1810
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:48,720
um
 

1811
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,830
um
but he had gotten interested

1812
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:50,840
but he had gotten interested
 

1813
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,149
but he had gotten interested
in cognition he'd gotten interested in

1814
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,159
in cognition he'd gotten interested in
 

1815
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,789
in cognition he'd gotten interested in
understanding

1816
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:58,799
understanding
 

1817
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,269
understanding
and you know understanding i think

1818
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
and you know understanding i think
 

1819
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,750
and you know understanding i think
remains

1820
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
remains
 

1821
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,750
remains
you know what does it mean to understand

1822
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
you know what does it mean to understand
 

1823
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,830
you know what does it mean to understand
anyway you know

1824
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
anyway you know
 

1825
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,829
anyway you know
uh it's it's an interesting sort of

1826
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:09,839
uh it's it's an interesting sort of
 

1827
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,990
uh it's it's an interesting sort of
curious you know like how would we know

1828
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
curious you know like how would we know
 

1829
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,349
curious you know like how would we know
if we really understood something but

1830
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:15,359
if we really understood something but
 

1831
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,790
if we really understood something but
but he was

1832
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
but he was
 

1833
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,869
but he was
interested in building machines that

1834
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
interested in building machines that
 

1835
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,869
interested in building machines that
would you know hear a couple of

1836
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
would you know hear a couple of
 

1837
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,710
would you know hear a couple of
sentences and have an insight about what

1838
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
sentences and have an insight about what
 

1839
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,270
sentences and have an insight about what
was going on so for example one of his

1840
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
was going on so for example one of his
 

1841
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,790
was going on so for example one of his
favorite things at that time was

1842
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:30,800

 

1843
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,869

marky was sitting on the front step when

1844
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,879
marky was sitting on the front step when
 

1845
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,430
marky was sitting on the front step when
she heard the familiar jingle

1846
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,440

ran into the house
what is margie doing

1854
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
what is margie doing
 

1855
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,190
what is margie doing
why

1856
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,200

 

1857
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,750

well there's a couple of ideas you could

1858
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:49,760
well there's a couple of ideas you could
 

1859
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,869
well there's a couple of ideas you could
have but

1860
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
have but
 

1861
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,190
have but
the most natural one is that

1862
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
the most natural one is that
 

1863
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,430
the most natural one is that
the good humor man brings ice cream she

1864
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
the good humor man brings ice cream she
 

1865
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,349
the good humor man brings ice cream she
likes ice cream she's

1866
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
likes ice cream she's
 

1867
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,750
likes ice cream she's
she knows she needs money to buy ice

1868
00:34:59,750 --> 00:34:59,760
she knows she needs money to buy ice
 

1869
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,349
she knows she needs money to buy ice
cream so she's gonna run into the house

1870
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
cream so she's gonna run into the house
 

1871
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,870
cream so she's gonna run into the house
and get her money so she can buy herself

1872
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:02,880
and get her money so she can buy herself
 

1873
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,710
and get her money so she can buy herself
an ice cream it's a huge amount of

1874
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
an ice cream it's a huge amount of
 

1875
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,390
an ice cream it's a huge amount of
inference that has to happen to get

1876
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
inference that has to happen to get
 

1877
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,430
inference that has to happen to get
those things to link up with each other

1878
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,440
those things to link up with each other
 

1879
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,430
those things to link up with each other
and and he was interested in how the

1880
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
and and he was interested in how the
 

1881
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,030
and and he was interested in how the
hell that could happen

1882
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
hell that could happen
 

1883
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,550
hell that could happen
and he was trying to build um

1884
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:16,560
and he was trying to build um
 

1885
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,710
and he was trying to build um
you know good old-fashioned ai style

1886
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:20,720
you know good old-fashioned ai style
 

1887
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,950
you know good old-fashioned ai style
models of

1888
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
models of
 

1889
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,310
models of
representation of language and

1890
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
representation of language and
 

1891
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,349
representation of language and
and content of

1892
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359
and content of
 

1893
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,950
and content of
you know things like

1894
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
you know things like
 

1895
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,230
you know things like
has money

1896
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,240
has money
 

1897
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,230
has money
so like a lot or like formal logic and

1898
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
so like a lot or like formal logic and
 

1899
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,069
so like a lot or like formal logic and
like knowledge bases like that kind of

1900
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,079
like knowledge bases like that kind of
 

1901
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,990
like knowledge bases like that kind of
stuff yeah so he was integrating that

1902
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,000
stuff yeah so he was integrating that
 

1903
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,470
stuff yeah so he was integrating that
with his thinking about cognition yes

1904
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
with his thinking about cognition yes
 

1905
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,870
with his thinking about cognition yes
the mechanisms cognition

1906
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
the mechanisms cognition
 

1907
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,270
the mechanisms cognition
how can they like mechanistically be

1908
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,280
how can they like mechanistically be
 

1909
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,510
how can they like mechanistically be
applied to build these knowledge like to

1910
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
applied to build these knowledge like to
 

1911
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,310
applied to build these knowledge like to
actually build something that looks like

1912
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
actually build something that looks like
 

1913
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,069
actually build something that looks like
a web of knowledge and thereby from

1914
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
a web of knowledge and thereby from
 

1915
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,510
a web of knowledge and thereby from
from there emerges something like

1916
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,520
from there emerges something like
 

1917
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,670
from there emerges something like
understanding whatever the heck that is

1918
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:57,680
understanding whatever the heck that is
 

1919
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,470
understanding whatever the heck that is
yeah

1920
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:58,480
yeah
 

1921
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,069
yeah
he was grappling

1922
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:00,079
he was grappling
 

1923
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,670
he was grappling
this was something that they grappled

1924
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:01,680
this was something that they grappled
 

1925
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,589
this was something that they grappled
with at the end of that book that i was

1926
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:03,599
with at the end of that book that i was
 

1927
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,310
with at the end of that book that i was
describing explorations and cognition

1928
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
describing explorations and cognition
 

1929
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,190
describing explorations and cognition
but he was realizing that the paradigm

1930
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200
but he was realizing that the paradigm
 

1931
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,310
but he was realizing that the paradigm
of

1932
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
of
 

1933
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,550
of
good old-fashioned ai wasn't giving him

1934
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
good old-fashioned ai wasn't giving him
 

1935
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,470
good old-fashioned ai wasn't giving him
the answers to these questions

1936
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
the answers to these questions
 

1937
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,670
the answers to these questions
yeah

1938
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
yeah
 

1939
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,349
yeah
and by the way that's called good

1940
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:17,359
and by the way that's called good
 

1941
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,550
and by the way that's called good
old-fashioned ai now it was called that

1942
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:20,560
old-fashioned ai now it was called that
 

1943
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,550
old-fashioned ai now it was called that
well it was it was beginning to be

1944
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
well it was it was beginning to be
 

1945
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,870
well it was it was beginning to be
called that because it was from the 60s

1946
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
called that because it was from the 60s
 

1947
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,390
called that because it was from the 60s
yeah by by the late 70s it was kind of

1948
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,400
yeah by by the late 70s it was kind of
 

1949
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,829
yeah by by the late 70s it was kind of
old-fashioned and it hadn't really

1950
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:29,839
old-fashioned and it hadn't really
 

1951
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,589
old-fashioned and it hadn't really
panned out you know and

1952
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:31,599
panned out you know and
 

1953
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,430
panned out you know and
people were beginning to recognize that

1954
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
people were beginning to recognize that
 

1955
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,310
people were beginning to recognize that
but

1956
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:34,320
but
 

1957
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,230
but
and and remember heart was you know like

1958
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,240
and and remember heart was you know like
 

1959
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,910
and and remember heart was you know like
yeah it was part of the recognition that

1960
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
yeah it was part of the recognition that
 

1961
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,510
yeah it was part of the recognition that
this wasn't all working

1962
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:39,520
this wasn't all working
 

1963
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,550
this wasn't all working
anyway so he

1964
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,560
anyway so he
 

1965
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,670
anyway so he
started thinking in terms of

1966
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
started thinking in terms of
 

1967
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,910
started thinking in terms of
uh

1968
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
uh
 

1969
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,630
uh
the idea that we needed systems that

1970
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,640
the idea that we needed systems that
 

1971
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,829
the idea that we needed systems that
allowed us to integrate multiple

1972
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:52,839
allowed us to integrate multiple
 

1973
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,190
allowed us to integrate multiple
simultaneous constraints

1974
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,200
simultaneous constraints
 

1975
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,349
simultaneous constraints
in a way that would be mutually

1976
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
in a way that would be mutually
 

1977
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,990
in a way that would be mutually
influencing each other

1978
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
influencing each other
 

1979
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,470
influencing each other
so

1980
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480

 

1981
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,790

he wrote a paper that

1982
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:04,800
he wrote a paper that
 

1983
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,670
he wrote a paper that
just

1984
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
just
 

1985
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,790
just
really

1986
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:06,800
really
 

1987
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,030
really
first time i read it i said oh well you

1988
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
first time i read it i said oh well you
 

1989
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,470
first time i read it i said oh well you
know yeah

1990
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,480
know yeah
 

1991
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,109
know yeah
but is this important but after a while

1992
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
but is this important but after a while
 

1993
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,109
but is this important but after a while
it just got under my skin

1994
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
it just got under my skin
 

1995
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,670
it just got under my skin
and it was called an interactive model

1996
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:17,680
and it was called an interactive model
 

1997
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,790
and it was called an interactive model
of reading and in this paper he laid out

1998
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
of reading and in this paper he laid out
 

1999
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,790
of reading and in this paper he laid out
the idea that

2000
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
the idea that
 

2001
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,270
the idea that
every aspect

2002
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
every aspect
 

2003
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,750
every aspect
of

2004
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760

 

2005
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,670

our

2006
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:29,680
our
 

2007
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,750
our
interpretation of

2008
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:33,760

 

2009
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,310

what what's coming off the page when we

2010
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:36,320
what what's coming off the page when we
 

2011
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,069
what what's coming off the page when we
read

at every level of analysis you can think

2014
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
at every level of analysis you can think
 

2015
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,670
at every level of analysis you can think
of

2016
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680

of analysis
 

2021
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,069

so

2022
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,079
so
 

2023
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,310
so
what are the actual

2024
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,320
what are the actual
 

2025
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,310
what are the actual
pixels

2026
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,320
pixels
 

2027
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,430
pixels
making up each letter and

2028
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,440
making up each letter and
 

2029
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,870
making up each letter and
what do those pixels signify about which

2030
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
what do those pixels signify about which
 

2031
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,950
what do those pixels signify about which
letters they are and what do those

2032

letters they are and what do those
 

2033
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,349
letters they are and what do those
letters tell us about

2034
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
letters tell us about
 

2035
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,430
letters tell us about
what words are there

2036
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,440
what words are there
 

2037
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,710
what words are there
and what do those words tell us about

2038
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:08,720
and what do those words tell us about
 

2039
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,589
and what do those words tell us about
what ideas the author is trying to

2040
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:11,599
what ideas the author is trying to
 

2041
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,349

2043
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,710

so he had this model where you know we

00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,720
so he had this model where you know we
 

2045

00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
have these
 

2047
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,550
have these
little tiny

2055
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,190

other ones that represent the line

2056
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,200
other ones that represent the line
 

2057
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,710

and
 

2065
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,150
and
um at that time his idea was there's

2066
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
um at that time his idea was there's
 

2067
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,950
um at that time his idea was there's
this set of experts

this set of experts
 

2069
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,630
this set of experts
there's an expert about how to

there's an expert about how to
 

2071
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,390
there's an expert about how to
construct a line out of pixels and

2072
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,400
construct a line out of pixels and
 

2073
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,550
construct a line out of pixels and

another expert about how
which sets of lines go together to make

2076
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
which sets of lines go together to make
 

2077
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,990
which sets of lines go together to make
which letters and another one about

2078
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,000
which letters and another one about
 

2079
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,829
which letters and another one about

which letters go together to make mitch
 

2081
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,990
which letters go together to make mitch
words and another one about what the

2082
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
words and another one about what the
 

2083
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,910
words and another one about what the
meanings of the words are and another

one about
 

2087
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,109
one about
how the meanings fit together and you

2088
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
how the meanings fit together and you
 

2089
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,550
how the meanings fit together and you
know things like that and all these

2090
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:04,560
know things like that and all these
 

2091
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,230
know things like that and all these
experts are looking at this data and

2092
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
experts are looking at this data and
 

2093
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,950
experts are looking at this data and
they're

2094
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:06,960
they're
 

2095
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,630
they're
they're um

2096
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,640
they're um
 

2097
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,829
they're um
updating

2098
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:09,839
updating
 

2099
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,670
updating
hypotheses at

2100
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:11,680
hypotheses at
 

2101
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,829
hypotheses at
at other levels so the word expert can

2102
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:13,839
at other levels so the word expert can
 

2103
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,150
at other levels so the word expert can
tell the letter expert oh i think there

2104
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
tell the letter expert oh i think there
 

2105
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,470
tell the letter expert oh i think there
should be a t there because i think

2106
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
should be a t there because i think
 

2107
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,030
should be a t there because i think
there should be a word the here and the

2108
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,040
there should be a word the here and the
 

2109
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,109
there should be a word the here and the
bottom up sort of feature to letter

2110
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119
bottom up sort of feature to letter
 

2111
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,550
bottom up sort of feature to letter
expert could say i think there should be

2112
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
expert could say i think there should be
 

2113
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,190
expert could say i think there should be
a t there too and if they agree

2114
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,200
a t there too and if they agree
 

2115
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,430
a t there too and if they agree
then you see a t right and so there's a

2116
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
then you see a t right and so there's a
 

2117
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,390
then you see a t right and so there's a
top-down bottom-up interactive process

2118
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
top-down bottom-up interactive process
 

2119
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,829
top-down bottom-up interactive process
but it's going on at all layers

2120
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:33,839
but it's going on at all layers
 

2121
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,829
but it's going on at all layers
simultaneously so everything can filter

2122
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:35,839
simultaneously so everything can filter
 

2123
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,510
simultaneously so everything can filter
all the way down from the top as well as

2124
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,520
all the way down from the top as well as
 

2125
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,430
all the way down from the top as well as
all the way up from the bottom and it's

2126
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,440
all the way up from the bottom and it's
 

2127
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,710
all the way up from the bottom and it's
a completely interactive bi-directional

2128
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
a completely interactive bi-directional
 

2129
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,670
a completely interactive bi-directional
parallel distributed process that is

2130
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
parallel distributed process that is
 

2131
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,910
parallel distributed process that is
somehow because of the abstractions is

2132
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
somehow because of the abstractions is
 

2133
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,310
somehow because of the abstractions is
hierarchical so like yeah so there's

2134
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,320
hierarchical so like yeah so there's
 

2135
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,630
hierarchical so like yeah so there's
different layers of responsibilities

2136
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:52,640
different layers of responsibilities
 

2137
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,550
different layers of responsibilities
different levels of responsibilities

2138
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560
different levels of responsibilities
 

2139
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,910
different levels of responsibilities
first of all it's fascinating to think

2140
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:55,920
first of all it's fascinating to think
 

2141
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,310
first of all it's fascinating to think
about it in this kind of mechanistic way

2142
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:58,320
about it in this kind of mechanistic way
 

2143
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,790
about it in this kind of mechanistic way
so not thinking purely

2144
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:00,800
so not thinking purely
 

2145
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,109
so not thinking purely
from the structure of a neural network

2146
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:03,119
from the structure of a neural network
 

2147
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,950
from the structure of a neural network
or something like a neural network but

2148
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
or something like a neural network but
 

2149
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,630
or something like a neural network but
thinking about these little little guys

2150
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
thinking about these little little guys
 

2151
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,630
thinking about these little little guys
that work on letters and then

2152
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:08,640
that work on letters and then
 

2153
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,390
that work on letters and then
the letters come words and words become

2154
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400
the letters come words and words become
 

2155
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,510
the letters come words and words become
sentences

2156
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
sentences
 

2157
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,829
sentences
and uh that's a very interesting

2158
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:13,839
and uh that's a very interesting
 

2159
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,550
and uh that's a very interesting
hypothesis that from that

2160
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:16,560
hypothesis that from that
 

2161
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,470
hypothesis that from that
kind of hierarchical structure can

2162
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
kind of hierarchical structure can
 

2163
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,829
kind of hierarchical structure can
emerge

2164
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:19,839
emerge
 

2165
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,790
emerge
uh understanding yeah so but the thing

2166
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
uh understanding yeah so but the thing
 

2167
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,030
uh understanding yeah so but the thing
is though i want to just sort of

2168
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
is though i want to just sort of
 

2169
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,390
is though i want to just sort of
relate this to the earlier part of the

2170
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
relate this to the earlier part of the
 

2171
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,510
relate this to the earlier part of the
conversation

2172
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,520
conversation
 

2173
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,870
conversation
um

2174
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:28,880
um
 

2175
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,870
um
when rommelhart was first thinking about

2176
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,880
when rommelhart was first thinking about
 

2177
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,550
when rommelhart was first thinking about
it there were these experts on the side

2178
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,560
it there were these experts on the side
 

2179
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,230
it there were these experts on the side
one for the features and one for the

one for the features and one for the
 

2181
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,069
one for the features and one for the
letters and one for how the letters make

2182
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,079
letters and one for how the letters make
 

2183
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,750

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,309
units that are just connected to each
other with connection weights so the

00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:50,319
other with connection weights so the
 

2251
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,950
other with connection weights so the
unit for the word time has a connection

2252
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
unit for the word time has a connection
 

2253
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,190
unit for the word time has a connection
to the unit for the letter t in the

and
because these connections are

2262
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
because these connections are
 

2263
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,670
because these connections are
bi-directional

2264
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680

if you have prior knowledge that it
 

2267
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,430
if you have prior knowledge that it
might be the word time that starts to

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,349
might be the word time that starts to
prime the feature to the letters and the

00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,359
prime the feature to the letters and the
 

2271
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,670
prime the feature to the letters and the
features and if you don't then it's it

2272
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,680
features and if you don't then it's it
 

2273
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,589
features and if you don't then it's it
has to start bottom up but the

2274
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:15,599
has to start bottom up but the
 

2275
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,829
has to start bottom up but the
directionality just depends on where the

2276
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
directionality just depends on where the
 

2277
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,990
directionality just depends on where the
information comes in first and

2278
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,000
information comes in first and
 

2279
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,230
information comes in first and
and if you have context together with

00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,240
and if you have context together with
 

2281
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,550
and if you have context together with
features at the same time they can

perception and that
 

2287
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,349

um that was the

2288
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:31,359
um that was the
 

2289
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,270
um that was the
um

2290
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
um
 

2291
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,750
um
the piece of work that we did together

2292
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:35,760
the piece of work that we did together
 

2293
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,670
the piece of work that we did together
that uh

that uh
 

2295
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,109
that uh
sort of got us both completely convinced

2296
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
sort of got us both completely convinced
 

2297
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,589
sort of got us both completely convinced
that you know this neural network way of

00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:43,599
that you know this neural network way of
 

2299
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,390
that you know this neural network way of
thinking

2300
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,400
thinking
 

2301
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,630
thinking
was going to be able to

2302
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:46,640
was going to be able to
 

2303
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,630
was going to be able to
actually address the questions that we

2304
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
actually address the questions that we
 

2305
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,790
actually address the questions that we
were interested in as cognitive cycle so

2306
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:50,800
were interested in as cognitive cycle so
 

2307
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,710
were interested in as cognitive cycle so
the algorithmic side the optimization

2308
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
the algorithmic side the optimization
 

2309
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,550
the algorithmic side the optimization
side those are all details like when you

2310
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:54,560
side those are all details like when you
 

2311
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,829
side those are all details like when you
first start

2312
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:55,839
first start
 

2313
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,829
first start
the idea that you can get far with this

2314
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:57,839
the idea that you can get far with this
 

2315
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,150
the idea that you can get far with this
kind of way of thinking that in itself

2316
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,160
kind of way of thinking that in itself
 

2317
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,470
kind of way of thinking that in itself
is a profound idea so do you like the

2318
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
is a profound idea so do you like the
 

2319
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,870
is a profound idea so do you like the
term uh connectionism

2320
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:04,880
term uh connectionism
 

2321
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,589
term uh connectionism
to describe this kind of set of ideas

2322
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
to describe this kind of set of ideas
 

2323
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,990
to describe this kind of set of ideas
i think it's useful

2324
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
i think it's useful
 

2325
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,670
i think it's useful
it highlights

2326
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
it highlights
 

2327
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,710
it highlights
the

2328
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:12,720
the
 

2329
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,270
the
notion that the knowledge

2330
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:15,280
notion that the knowledge
 

2331
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,550
notion that the knowledge
that the system exploits is

2332
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:18,560
that the system exploits is
 

2333
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,030
that the system exploits is
in the connections between the units

2334
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,040
in the connections between the units
 

2335
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,589
in the connections between the units
right there isn't a separate

2336
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:23,599
right there isn't a separate
 

2337
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,670
right there isn't a separate
dictionary

2338
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:25,680
dictionary
 

2339
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,910
dictionary
the connections between the units

2340
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
the connections between the units
 

2341
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,710
the connections between the units
so

2342
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
so
 

2343
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,870
so
i already sort of

2344
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
i already sort of
 

2345
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,150
i already sort of
laid that on the table with the

2346
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
laid that on the table with the
 

2347
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,190
laid that on the table with the
connections from the letter units to the

2348
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,200
connections from the letter units to the
 

2349
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,190
connections from the letter units to the
unit for the word time right the unit

2350
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,200
unit for the word time right the unit
 

2351
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,190
unit for the word time right the unit
for the word time isn't a unit for the

2352
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
for the word time isn't a unit for the
 

2353
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,069
for the word time isn't a unit for the
word time for any other reason then it's

2354
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
word time for any other reason then it's
 

2355
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,069
word time for any other reason then it's
got the connections to the letters that

2356
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
got the connections to the letters that
 

2357
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,910
got the connections to the letters that
make up the word time

2358
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920
make up the word time
 

2359
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,589
make up the word time
those are the units on the input that

2360
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:47,599
those are the units on the input that
 

2361
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,309
those are the units on the input that
excite it when it's excited that

2362
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
excite it when it's excited that
 

2363
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,670
excite it when it's excited that
it in a sense represents in the system

2364
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:53,680
it in a sense represents in the system
 

2365
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,670
it in a sense represents in the system
that

2366
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
that
 

2367
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,750
that
there's support for the hypothesis that

2368
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,760
there's support for the hypothesis that
 

2369
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,390
there's support for the hypothesis that
the word time is present in the input

2370
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
the word time is present in the input
 

2371
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,829
the word time is present in the input
um

2372
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:01,839
um
 

2373
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,870
um
but it's not

2374
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:04,880

 

2375
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,470

there there's the word time isn't

2376
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
there there's the word time isn't
 

2377
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,390
there there's the word time isn't
written anywhere inside the bottle it's

2378
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:08,400
written anywhere inside the bottle it's
 

2379
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,470
written anywhere inside the bottle it's
only written there in the picture we

2380
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:10,480
only written there in the picture we
 

2381
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,630
only written there in the picture we
drew of the model to say that's the unit

2382
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:12,640
drew of the model to say that's the unit
 

2383
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,750
drew of the model to say that's the unit
for the word time right yeah and um if

2384
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:15,760
for the word time right yeah and um if
 

2385
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,710
for the word time right yeah and um if
if if somebody wants to tell me well

2386
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:18,720
if if somebody wants to tell me well
 

2387
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,950
if if somebody wants to tell me well
what are the how do you spell that word

2388
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:20,960
what are the how do you spell that word
 

2389
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,109
what are the how do you spell that word
you have to use the connections from

2390
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
you have to use the connections from
 

2391
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,109
you have to use the connections from
that out to

2392
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:25,119
that out to
 

2393
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,670
that out to
to then get those letters for example

2394
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:27,680
to then get those letters for example
 

2395
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,349
to then get those letters for example
that's such a

2396
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
that's such a
 

2397
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,589
that's such a
that's a counter-intuitive idea

2398
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:31,599
that's a counter-intuitive idea
 

2399
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,309
that's a counter-intuitive idea
we humans want to think in this logic

2400
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
we humans want to think in this logic
 

2401
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,069
we humans want to think in this logic
way

2402
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:36,079
way
 

2403
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,750
way
this this idea of connectionism

2404
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,760
this this idea of connectionism
 

2405
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,069
this this idea of connectionism
it doesn't it's weird it's weird that

2406
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
it doesn't it's weird it's weird that
 

2407
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,390
it doesn't it's weird it's weird that
this is how it all works yeah but let's

2408
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
this is how it all works yeah but let's
 

2409
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,109
this is how it all works yeah but let's
go back to that cnn right that cnn with

2410
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:47,119
go back to that cnn right that cnn with
 

2411
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,550
go back to that cnn right that cnn with
all those layers of neuron like

2412
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:48,560
all those layers of neuron like
 

2413
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,910
all those layers of neuron like
processing units that we were talking

2414
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:49,920
processing units that we were talking
 

2415
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,349
processing units that we were talking
about before

2416
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:51,359
about before
 

2417
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,870
about before
it's going to come out and say this is a

2418
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:52,880
it's going to come out and say this is a
 

2419
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,190
it's going to come out and say this is a
cat that's a dog

2420
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,200
cat that's a dog
 

2421
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,750
cat that's a dog
but it has no idea why it said that it's

2422
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,760
but it has no idea why it said that it's
 

2423
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,670
but it has no idea why it said that it's
just got all these connections between

2424
00:44:59,670 --> 00:44:59,680
just got all these connections between
 

2425
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,870
just got all these connections between
all these

2426
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:00,880
all these
 

2427
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,349
all these
layers of neurons like from the

2428
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
layers of neurons like from the
 

2429
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,069
layers of neurons like from the
very first layer to the you know the

2430
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:06,079
very first layer to the you know the
 

2431
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,990
very first layer to the you know the
like whatever these layers are they just

2432
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,000
like whatever these layers are they just
 

2433
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,309
like whatever these layers are they just
get numbered after a while because they

2434
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
get numbered after a while because they
 

2435
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,750
get numbered after a while because they
you know they they

2436
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:11,760
you know they they
 

2437
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,349
you know they they
somehow further in you go the more

2438
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:15,359
somehow further in you go the more
 

2439
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,190
somehow further in you go the more
the more abstract the features are but

2440
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,200
the more abstract the features are but
 

2441
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,670
the more abstract the features are but
it's a graded and continuous sort of

2442
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:19,680
it's a graded and continuous sort of
 

2443
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,309
it's a graded and continuous sort of
process of abstraction anyway and

2444
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:22,319
process of abstraction anyway and
 

2445
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,030
process of abstraction anyway and
you know it goes from very local very

2446
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,040
you know it goes from very local very
 

2447
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,589
you know it goes from very local very
very specific to much more sort of

2448
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:27,599
very specific to much more sort of
 

2449
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,710
very specific to much more sort of
global

2450
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
global
 

2451
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,150
global
but it's still

2452
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160
but it's still
 

2453
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,990
but it's still
you know another sort of pattern of

2454
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
you know another sort of pattern of
 

2455
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,829
you know another sort of pattern of
activation over an array of units and

2456
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
activation over an array of units and
 

2457
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,309
activation over an array of units and
then at the output side it says it's cat

2458
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:36,319
then at the output side it says it's cat
 

2459
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,190
then at the output side it says it's cat
or it's a dot and when when we when i

2460
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,200
or it's a dot and when when we when i
 

2461
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,309
or it's a dot and when when we when i
open my eyes and say oh that's lex

2462
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,319
open my eyes and say oh that's lex
 

2463
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,270
open my eyes and say oh that's lex
or

2464
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
or
 

2465
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,470
or
um

2466
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:44,480
um
 

2467
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,349
um
oh

2468
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:45,359
oh
 

2469
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,750
oh
you know there's my own dog and i

2470
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
you know there's my own dog and i
 

2471
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,309
you know there's my own dog and i
recognize my dog

2472
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:50,319
recognize my dog
 

2473
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,150
recognize my dog
which is a member of the same species as

2474
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:52,160
which is a member of the same species as
 

2475
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,910
which is a member of the same species as
many other dogs but

2476
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:53,920
many other dogs but
 

2477
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,150
many other dogs but
i know this one because of some slightly

2478
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
i know this one because of some slightly
 

2479
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,910
i know this one because of some slightly
unique characteristics i don't know how

2480
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:57,920
unique characteristics i don't know how
 

2481
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,390
unique characteristics i don't know how
to describe you know what it is that

2482
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
to describe you know what it is that
 

2483
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,470
to describe you know what it is that
makes me know that i'm looking at lex or

2484
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
makes me know that i'm looking at lex or
 

2485
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,870
makes me know that i'm looking at lex or
at my particular dog right yeah or even

2486
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880
at my particular dog right yeah or even
 

2487
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,550
at my particular dog right yeah or even
that i'm looking at a particular brand

2488
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:06,560
that i'm looking at a particular brand
 

2489
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,790
that i'm looking at a particular brand
of car like i could say a few words

2490
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,800
of car like i could say a few words
 

2491
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,589
of car like i could say a few words
about it but if i wrote you a paragraph

2492
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:11,599
about it but if i wrote you a paragraph
 

2493
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,510
about it but if i wrote you a paragraph
about the car you you would have trouble

2494
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,520
about the car you you would have trouble
 

2495
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,430
about the car you you would have trouble
figuring out which car is he talking

2496
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
figuring out which car is he talking
 

2497
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,829
figuring out which car is he talking
about right so the idea that we have

2498
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
about right so the idea that we have
 

2499
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,550
about right so the idea that we have
propositional knowledge of what

2500
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
propositional knowledge of what
 

2501
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,430
propositional knowledge of what
it is that allows us to recognize that

2502
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440
it is that allows us to recognize that
 

2503
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,670
it is that allows us to recognize that
this is an actual instance of this

2504
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
this is an actual instance of this
 

2505
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,309
this is an actual instance of this
particular natural kind is um has always

2506
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:30,319
particular natural kind is um has always

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,870
particular natural kind is um has always
been you know something that

2508
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
been you know something that
 

2509
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,109
been you know something that
uh

2510
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:35,119
uh
 

2511
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,190
uh
it never worked right you couldn't ever

2512
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,200
it never worked right you couldn't ever
 

2513
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,270
it never worked right you couldn't ever
write down a set of propositions for you

2514
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280

2516
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
know visual recognition
 

2517
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,270
know visual recognition
and and and so

2518
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,280
and and and so
 

2519
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,430
and and and so
in that space it sort of always seemed

2520
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:45,440
in that space it sort of always seemed
 

2521
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,990
in that space it sort of always seemed
very natural that something more

2522
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
very natural that something more
 

2523
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,309
very natural that something more
implicit um

2524
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
implicit um
 

2525
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,829
implicit um
you know

2526
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:51,839
you know
 

2527
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,430
you know
you don't have access to what the

2528
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:53,440
you don't have access to what the
 

2529
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,430
you don't have access to what the

2530
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:55,440
details of the computation were in
 

2531
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,309
details of the computation were in
between you just get the result so

2532
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:58,319
between you just get the result so
 

2533
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,069
between you just get the result so
that's the other part of connectionism

2534
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:00,079
that's the other part of connectionism
 

2535
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,349
that's the other part of connectionism
you cannot

2536
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:01,359
you cannot
 

2537
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,190
you cannot
you don't read the contents of the

yeah it's it's and for us that like

2546
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
yeah it's it's and for us that like
 

2547
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,390
yeah it's it's and for us that like
final layer or

2548
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,400
final layer or
 

2549
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,390
final layer or
some particular layer is very important

2550
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
some particular layer is very important
 

2551
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,430
some particular layer is very important
the one that tells us that it's our dog

2552
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
the one that tells us that it's our dog
 

2553
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,950
the one that tells us that it's our dog
or like it's a cat or a dog but

2554
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:22,960
or like it's a cat or a dog but
 

2555
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,790
or like it's a cat or a dog but
you know each layer is probably equally

2556
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
you know each layer is probably equally
 

2557
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,230
you know each layer is probably equally
as important in the grand scheme of

2558
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:26,240
as important in the grand scheme of
 

2559
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,190
as important in the grand scheme of
things

2560
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:27,200
things
 

2561
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,230
things
like

2562
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
like
 

2563
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,069
like
there's no reason why the cat versus dog

2564
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079
there's no reason why the cat versus dog
 

2565
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,309
there's no reason why the cat versus dog
is more important than the lower level

2566
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
is more important than the lower level
 

2567
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,069
is more important than the lower level
activations it doesn't really matter i

activations it doesn't really matter i
 

2569
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,230

mean all of it is just this beautiful

2570
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
mean all of it is just this beautiful
 

2571
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,910
mean all of it is just this beautiful
stacking on top of each other and we

2572
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920
stacking on top of each other and we
 

2573
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,910
stacking on top of each other and we
humans live in this particular layers

2574
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:39,920
humans live in this particular layers
 

2575
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,470
humans live in this particular layers
for us for us it's useful to

2576
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480
for us for us it's useful to
 

2577
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,710
for us for us it's useful to

that it's all continuous but then you
 

2585
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,270
that it's all continuous but then you
then ask

then ask
 

2587
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,630
then ask
you know the history of artificial

i would say that's still part of the the

i would say that's still part of the the
 

2605
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,910
i would say that's still part of the the
dream of symbolic ai and

2606
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:11,920
dream of symbolic ai and

leonard who created psych
 

2613
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,510
leonard who created psych
and that's that's a project that lasted

2614
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:21,520
and that's that's a project that lasted
 

2615
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,109
and that's that's a project that lasted
for many decades

2616
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:23,119
for many decades
 

2617
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,230
for many decades
and still carries a sort of dream in it

2618
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
and still carries a sort of dream in it
 

2619
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:26,950
and still carries a sort of dream in it
right

2620
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
right
 

2621
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,710
right
um

2622
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:28,720
um
 

2623
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,549
um
but we still don't know the answer right

2624
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
but we still don't know the answer right
 

2625
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,190
but we still don't know the answer right
it seems like connectionism is really

2626
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,200
it seems like connectionism is really
 

2627
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,710
it seems like connectionism is really
powerful

2628
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:34,720
powerful
 

2629
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,710
powerful
but it also seems like there's this

2630
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
but it also seems like there's this
 

2631
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,630
but it also seems like there's this
building of knowledge

2632
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
building of knowledge
 

2633
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,069
building of knowledge
and so how do we

2634
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
and so how do we
 

2635
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,069
and so how do we
how do you square those two like do you

2636
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
how do you square those two like do you
 

2637
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,309
how do you square those two like do you
think the connections can contain the

2638
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:44,319
think the connections can contain the
 

2639
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,790
think the connections can contain the
depth of human knowledge and the depth

2640
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:46,800
depth of human knowledge and the depth
 

2641
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,430
depth of human knowledge and the depth
of what uh dave romohart was thinking

2642
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
of what uh dave romohart was thinking
 

2643
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,870
of what uh dave romohart was thinking
about of understanding

2644
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:52,880
about of understanding
 

2645
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,150
about of understanding
well uh that remains the 64 question and

2646
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:56,160
well uh that remains the 64 question and
 

2647
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,910
well uh that remains the 64 question and
um

2648
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
um
 

2649
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,670
um
with inflation that number yeah

2650
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
with inflation that number yeah
 

2651
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,750
with inflation that number yeah
maybe it's the 64 billion dollar

2652
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:03,760
maybe it's the 64 billion dollar
 

2653
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,870
maybe it's the 64 billion dollar
question now

2654
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:04,880
question now
 

2655
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,470
question now
uh

2656
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
uh
 

2657
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,710
uh
uh

2658
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,720
uh
 

2659
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,230
uh
you know i think that

2660
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:10,240
you know i think that
 

2661
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,589
you know i think that
um

2662
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599

 

2663
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,829

from

2664
00:49:14,829 --> 00:49:14,839
from
 

2665
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:19,510
from
the emergence side which you know

2666
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
the emergence side which you know
 

2667
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,470
the emergence side which you know
uh

2668
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:20,480
uh
 

2669
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,589
uh
i placed myself on um

2670
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:23,599
i placed myself on um
 

2671
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,990
i placed myself on um
so i i used to sometimes tell people i

2672
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,000
so i i used to sometimes tell people i
 

2673
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,510
so i i used to sometimes tell people i
was a radical eliminative connectionist

2674
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:29,520
was a radical eliminative connectionist
 

2675
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,790
was a radical eliminative connectionist
because

2676
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:30,800
because
 

2677
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,950
because
i didn't want them to

2678
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:32,960
i didn't want them to
 

2679
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,230
i didn't want them to
think

2680
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:34,240
think
 

2681
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,870
think
that i wanted to build like anything

2682
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:36,880
that i wanted to build like anything
 

2683
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,430
that i wanted to build like anything
into the machine

2684
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,440
into the machine
 

2685
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,030
into the machine
but um i

2686
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
but um i
 

2687
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,390
but um i
don't like the word eliminative

2688
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
don't like the word eliminative
 

2689
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,750
don't like the word eliminative
uh anymore because it makes it seem like

2690
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:49,760

 

2691
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,990

it's wrong to think that there is this

2692
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,000
it's wrong to think that there is this
 

2693
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,470
it's wrong to think that there is this
emergent level of

2694
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
emergent level of
 

2695
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,829
emergent level of
understanding and

2696
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:56,839
understanding and
 

2697
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,710
understanding and
um

2698
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,720
um
 

2699
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,190
um
i disagree with that so i think you know

2700
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
i disagree with that so i think you know
 

2701
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,270
i disagree with that so i think you know
i would call myself in a radical

2702
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:03,280
i would call myself in a radical
 

2703
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,430
i would call myself in a radical
emergentist

2704
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:05,440
emergentist
 

2705
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,390
emergentist
uh connectionist rather than eliminative

2706
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:08,400
uh connectionist rather than eliminative
 

2707
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,430
uh connectionist rather than eliminative
connectionist right because i want to

2708
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
connectionist right because i want to
 

2709
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,390
connectionist right because i want to
acknowledge

2710
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:12,400
acknowledge
 

2711
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,990
acknowledge
that

2712
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:14,000
that
 

2713
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,790
that
that these higher level kinds of

2714
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
that these higher level kinds of
 

2715
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,230
that these higher level kinds of
aspects of our cognition are

2716
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,240
aspects of our cognition are
 

2717
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,150
aspects of our cognition are
are real but they're not

2718
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,160
are real but they're not
 

2719
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,549
are real but they're not
they're they don't

2720
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:26,559

 

2721
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,309

they don't exist as

2722
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
they don't exist as
 

2723
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,589
they don't exist as
such and so there was an example that uh

2724
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
such and so there was an example that uh
 

2725
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,230
such and so there was an example that uh
doug hofstetter used to use that i

2726
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
doug hofstetter used to use that i
 

2727
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,549
doug hofstetter used to use that i
thought was helpful in this respect

2728
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
thought was helpful in this respect
 

2729
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,190
thought was helpful in this respect
just the idea that

2730
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:39,200
just the idea that
 

2731
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,870
just the idea that
we could think about sand dunes

2732
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:42,880
we could think about sand dunes
 

2733
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,549
we could think about sand dunes
as entities

2734
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:46,559

 

2735
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,790

and talk about like how many there are

2736
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:48,800
and talk about like how many there are
 

2737
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,470
and talk about like how many there are
even

2738
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:50,480
even
 

2739
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,270
even
um

2740
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
um
 

2741
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,630
um
but we also

2742
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:52,640
but we also
 

2743
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,589
but we also
know that a sand dune is a very fluid

2744
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:55,599
know that a sand dune is a very fluid
 

2745
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,309
know that a sand dune is a very fluid
thing it's it's it's a it's a

2746
00:50:58,309 --> 00:50:58,319
thing it's it's it's a it's a
 

2747
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,790
thing it's it's it's a it's a
it's a pile of sand that is capable of

2748
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:00,800
it's a pile of sand that is capable of
 

2749
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,589
it's a pile of sand that is capable of
moving around under the wind and the and

2750
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:03,599
moving around under the wind and the and
 

2751
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,510
moving around under the wind and the and
and um

2752
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,520
and um
 

2753
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,589
and um
you know

2754
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:07,599
you know
 

2755
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,589
you know
reforming itself in somewhat different

2756
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
reforming itself in somewhat different
 

2757
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,349
reforming itself in somewhat different
ways and and if we think about our

2758
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
ways and and if we think about our
 

2759
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,349
ways and and if we think about our
thoughts it's like sand dunes as being

2760
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
thoughts it's like sand dunes as being
 

2761
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,390
thoughts it's like sand dunes as being
things that

2762
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
things that
 

2763
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,950
things that
you know emerge from

2764
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
you know emerge from
 

2765
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,990
you know emerge from
uh

2766
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,000
uh
 

2767
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,630
uh
just the the way all the lower level

2768
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
just the the way all the lower level
 

2769
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,510
just the the way all the lower level
elements sort of work together and and

2770
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:23,520
elements sort of work together and and
 

2771
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,870
elements sort of work together and and
are constrained by external forces

2772
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:26,880
are constrained by external forces
 

2773
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,109
are constrained by external forces
then we can we can say yes they exist as

2774
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:29,119
then we can we can say yes they exist as
 

2775
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,910
then we can we can say yes they exist as
such but they they also

2776
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
such but they they also
 

2777
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,670
such but they they also
you know

2778
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:33,680
you know
 

2779
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,349
you know
we shouldn't treat them as completely

2780
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:35,359
we shouldn't treat them as completely
 

2781
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,950
we shouldn't treat them as completely
monolithic

2782
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:36,960
monolithic
 

2783
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,870
monolithic
entities that we

2784
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:38,880
entities that we
 

2785
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,549
entities that we
we can understand without understanding

2786
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:42,559
we can understand without understanding
 

2787
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,549
we can understand without understanding
sort of all of the stuff that

2788
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:44,559
sort of all of the stuff that
 

2789
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,710
sort of all of the stuff that
allows them to change in the ways that

2790
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:46,720
allows them to change in the ways that
 

2791
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,390
allows them to change in the ways that
they do and that's where i think the

2792
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
they do and that's where i think the
 

2793
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,870
they do and that's where i think the
connectionist feeds into the

2794
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:50,880
connectionist feeds into the
 

2795
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,430
connectionist feeds into the
into the cognitive it's like okay so if

2796
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,440
into the cognitive it's like okay so if
 

2797
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,390
into the cognitive it's like okay so if
the under if the substrate is parallel

2798
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
the under if the substrate is parallel
 

2799
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,190
the under if the substrate is parallel
distributed connectionist

2800
00:51:59,190 --> 00:51:59,200
distributed connectionist
 

2801
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,150
distributed connectionist
um then it doesn't mean that the

2802
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
um then it doesn't mean that the
 

2803
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,030
um then it doesn't mean that the
contents of thought isn't you know like

2804
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
contents of thought isn't you know like
 

2805
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,309
contents of thought isn't you know like
abstract and symbolic and um

2806
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:08,319
abstract and symbolic and um
 

2807
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,829
abstract and symbolic and um
but it's more fluid maybe then uh

2808
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
but it's more fluid maybe then uh
 

2809
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,910
but it's more fluid maybe then uh
is easier to capture with a set of

2810
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
is easier to capture with a set of
 

2811
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,230
is easier to capture with a set of
logical expressions yeah that's a heck

2812
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:16,240
logical expressions yeah that's a heck
 

2813
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,470
logical expressions yeah that's a heck
of a sort of thing to put

2814
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,480
of a sort of thing to put
 

2815
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,670
of a sort of thing to put
at the top of

2816
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:19,680
at the top of
 

2817
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,829
at the top of
a resume radical emergingist

2818
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:21,839
a resume radical emergingist
 

2819
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,349
a resume radical emergingist
connectionist

2820
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:23,359
connectionist
 

2821
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,109
connectionist
so i there is

2822
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:25,119
so i there is
 

2823
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,790
so i there is
just like you said a beautiful dance

2824
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:26,800
just like you said a beautiful dance
 

2825
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,950
just like you said a beautiful dance
between that between the machinery of

2826
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:28,960
between that between the machinery of
 

2827
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,309
between that between the machinery of
intelligence

2828
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:30,319
intelligence
 

2829
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,470
intelligence
like the neural network side of it and

2830
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,480
like the neural network side of it and
 

2831
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,150
like the neural network side of it and
the stuff that emerges

2832

i don't know
i don't know what that is

2840
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:43,839
i don't know what that is
 

2841
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,870
i don't know what that is
that it seems like maybe all

2842
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:46,880
that it seems like maybe all
 

2843
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,549
that it seems like maybe all

00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:52,720
what i what i think about
 

2847
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,670

00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,630
this is made most distinctly
rich to me when i look at cellular

they're from very very simple things

2854
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:03,599
they're from very very simple things

00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,870
they're from very very simple things
very rich complex things emerge that

2856
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:06,880
very rich complex things emerge that
 

2857
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,710
very rich complex things emerge that
start looking very quickly like

00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:12,559
that you forget that the forget how the
 

2863
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,150
that you forget that the forget how the
actual thing operates they start looking

2864
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:14,160
actual thing operates they start looking
 

2865
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,589

like they're moving around they're

2866
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
like they're moving around they're
 

2867

it you forget very quickly and it seems

2874
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:22,400
it you forget very quickly and it seems
 

2875
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,069
it you forget very quickly and it seems
like maybe it's something about the

2876
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:24,079
like maybe it's something about the
 

2877
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,470
like maybe it's something about the
human mind that wants to operate in some

2878
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
human mind that wants to operate in some

layer of the emergent

2880
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,480
layer of the emergent
 

2881
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,549
layer of the emergent
and forget about the the mechanism of

2882
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
and forget about the the mechanism of
 

2883
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,109
and forget about the the mechanism of
how that emerges happens so i it just

2884
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:33,119
how that emerges happens so i it just
 

2885
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,430
how that emerges happens so i it just
like you are in your radicalness

2886
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:35,440
like you are in your radicalness
 

2887
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,950
like you are in your radicalness
i'm uh

2888
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:36,960
i'm uh
 

2889
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,829
i'm uh
also it seems like unfair to

2890
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:39,839
also it seems like unfair to
 

2891
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,950
also it seems like unfair to
eliminate the magic of that emergent

2892
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
eliminate the magic of that emergent
 

2893
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,589
eliminate the magic of that emergent
like eliminate the

2894
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:45,599
like eliminate the
 

2895
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,230
like eliminate the
the fact that that the emergence is real

2896
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
the fact that that the emergence is real
 

2897
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,710
the fact that that the emergence is real
yeah no i agree i'm not

2898
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:50,720
yeah no i agree i'm not
 

2899
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,790
yeah no i agree i'm not
that's why i got rid of eliminative

2900
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
that's why i got rid of eliminative
 

2901
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,270
that's why i got rid of eliminative
right yeah yeah because it seemed like

2902
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:55,280
right yeah yeah because it seemed like
 

2903
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,990
right yeah yeah because it seemed like
that was trying to say that you know

2904
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
that was trying to say that you know
 

2905
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,750
that was trying to say that you know
it's all

2906
00:53:59,750 --> 00:53:59,760
it's all
 

2907
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,670
it's all
completely like

2908
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,680
completely like
 

2909
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,230
completely like
an illusion of some kindness well it it

2910
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,240
an illusion of some kindness well it it
 

2911
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,990
an illusion of some kindness well it it
you know who knows whether there isn't

2912
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
you know who knows whether there isn't
 

2913
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,109
you know who knows whether there isn't
there aren't some illusory

2914
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:07,119
there aren't some illusory
 

2915
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,870
there aren't some illusory
characteristics there

2916
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:08,880
characteristics there
 

2917
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,790
characteristics there
um and and

2918
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
um and and
 

2919
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,230
um and and
i i think that uh philosophically um

2920
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
i i think that uh philosophically um
 

2921
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,309
i i think that uh philosophically um
many people have have confronted that

2922
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
many people have have confronted that
 

2923
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,549
many people have have confronted that
possibility over time but

2924
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:18,559
possibility over time but
 

2925
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,829
possibility over time but
but uh

2926
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:19,839
but uh
 

2927
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,430
but uh
it it's still

2928
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:21,440
it it's still
 

2929
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,950
it it's still
important to

2930
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960
important to
 

2931
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,510
important to
um you know accept it as magic right so

2932
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:27,520
um you know accept it as magic right so
 

2933
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,510
um you know accept it as magic right so
you know i think of fellini in this

2934
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:29,520
you know i think of fellini in this
 

2935
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,430
you know i think of fellini in this
context i think of

2936
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,440
context i think of
 

2937
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,910
context i think of
um others who have

2938
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:33,920
um others who have
 

2939
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,069
um others who have
appreciated uh the role of magic uh of

2940
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
appreciated uh the role of magic uh of
 

2941
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,390
appreciated uh the role of magic uh of
actual trickery in creating illusions

2942
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:40,400
actual trickery in creating illusions
 

2943
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,349
actual trickery in creating illusions
that

2944
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:41,359
that
 

2945
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,109
that
that move

2946
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:43,119
that move
 

2947
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,190
that move
that move us

2948
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
that move us
 

2949
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,270
that move us
you know had plato was odd to this too

2950
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
you know had plato was odd to this too
 

2951
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,470
you know had plato was odd to this too
it's like somehow or other these shadows

2952
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:50,480
it's like somehow or other these shadows
 

2953
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,470
it's like somehow or other these shadows
you know

2954
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
you know
 

2955
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,549
you know
give rise to something

2956
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
give rise to something
 

2957
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,870
give rise to something
much deeper than that and and that's

2958
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:56,880
much deeper than that and and that's
 

2959
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,390
much deeper than that and and that's
that's

2960
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:58,400
that's
 

2961
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,390
that's
so you know we won't try to figure out

2962
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
so you know we won't try to figure out
 

2963
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,549
so you know we won't try to figure out
what it is we'll just accept it as given

2964
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:02,559
what it is we'll just accept it as given
 

2965
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,309
what it is we'll just accept it as given
that that that occurs and um

2966
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:06,319
that that that occurs and um
 

2967
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,589
that that that occurs and um
you know but he was still on to the

2968
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:07,599
you know but he was still on to the
 

2969
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,950
you know but he was still on to the
magic of it yeah yeah we won't try to

2970
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
magic of it yeah yeah we won't try to
 

2971
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,950
magic of it yeah yeah we won't try to
really really really deeply understand

2972
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:12,960
really really really deeply understand
 

2973
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,270
really really really deeply understand
how it works we just enjoy the fact that

2974
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,280
how it works we just enjoy the fact that
 

2975
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,549
how it works we just enjoy the fact that
it's kind of fun

2976
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
it's kind of fun
 

2977
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,910
it's kind of fun
okay but you uh worked closely with dave

2978
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:19,920
okay but you uh worked closely with dave
 

2979
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,829
okay but you uh worked closely with dave
around my heart

2980
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
around my heart

00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:55,760
you know like relevant
 

3007
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,069
you know like relevant
uh tragedies um

3008
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,079
uh tragedies um
 

3009
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,510
uh tragedies um
relevant to our conversation he

3010
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520

 

3011
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,190

started to

3012
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
started to
 

3013
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,750
started to
undergo a progressive

undergo a progressive
neurological condition

3016
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:10,960
neurological condition
 

3017
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,950
neurological condition
that

3018
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
that
 

3019
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,589
that
isn't fully understood that is to say

3020
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:15,599
isn't fully understood that is to say
 

3021
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,589
isn't fully understood that is to say
his particular

3022
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
his particular
 

3023
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:22,710
his particular
course isn't fully understood um

3024
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:22,720

 

3025
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,309

because

3026
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
because
 

3027
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,990
because
certain you know brain scans weren't

3028
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
certain you know brain scans weren't
 

3029
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,069
certain you know brain scans weren't
done in certain stages

3030
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
done in certain stages
 

3031
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,710
done in certain stages
and no autopsy was done or anything like

3032
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
and no autopsy was done or anything like
 

3033
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,589
and no autopsy was done or anything like
that

3034
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:31,599
that
 

3035
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,230
that
the wishes of the family um

3036
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
the wishes of the family um
 

3037
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,390
the wishes of the family um
so we don't know as much about the

3038
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,400
so we don't know as much about the
 

3039
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,510
so we don't know as much about the
underlying pathology as we might but

3040
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:39,520
underlying pathology as we might but
 

3041
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,789
underlying pathology as we might but
um

3042
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:42,799

 

3043
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:47,109

i had begun to get interested in this

3044
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:47,119
i had begun to get interested in this
 

3045
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,349
i had begun to get interested in this
neurological condition that might have

3046
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:49,359
neurological condition that might have
 

3047
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,270
neurological condition that might have
been the very one that he was succumbing

3048
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
been the very one that he was succumbing
 

3049
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,390
been the very one that he was succumbing
to

3050
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
to
 

3051
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,510
to
as my own efforts to uh understand

3052
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:55,520
as my own efforts to uh understand
 

3053
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,430
as my own efforts to uh understand
another aspect of this mystery that

3054
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:57,440
another aspect of this mystery that
 

3055
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,910
another aspect of this mystery that
we've been discussing

3056
00:56:59,910 --> 00:56:59,920
we've been discussing
 

3057
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,829
we've been discussing
while he was beginning to get

3058
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:01,839
while he was beginning to get
 

3059
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,309
while he was beginning to get
progressively more and more affected

3060
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:04,319
progressively more and more affected
 

3061
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,270
progressively more and more affected
so

3062
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:05,280
so
 

3063
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,030
so
i'm going to talk about the disorder and

3064
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,040
i'm going to talk about the disorder and
 

3065
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,470
i'm going to talk about the disorder and
not about remember heart for a second

3066
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
not about remember heart for a second
 

3067
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,030
not about remember heart for a second
okay sure the disorder is something my

3068
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,040
okay sure the disorder is something my
 

3069
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,950
okay sure the disorder is something my
colleagues and collaborators have chosen

3070
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
colleagues and collaborators have chosen
 

3071
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,789
colleagues and collaborators have chosen
to call

3072
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:14,799
to call
 

3073
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,109
to call
semantic dementia

3074
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:17,119
semantic dementia
 

3075
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,309
semantic dementia
so

3076
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:18,319
so
 

3077
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,589
so
it's a specific form of

3078
00:57:21,589 --> 00:57:21,599
it's a specific form of
 

3079
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,270
it's a specific form of
loss of mind

3080
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
loss of mind
 

3081
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,349
loss of mind
related to meaning

3082
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:25,359
related to meaning
 

3083
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,510
related to meaning
semantic dementia

3084
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520
semantic dementia
 

3085
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,230
semantic dementia
and it's progressive

3086
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
and it's progressive
 

3087
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,549
and it's progressive
in the sense that the patient

3088
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559

 

3089
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,430

loses the ability

3090
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:37,440
loses the ability
 

3091
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,270
loses the ability
to

3092
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:39,280
to
 

3093
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,390
to
appreciate the meaning of the

3094
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:42,400
appreciate the meaning of the
 

3095
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,670
appreciate the meaning of the

call them all horses you know so
there was this one patient who

3162
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,200
there was this one patient who
 

3163
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,349
there was this one patient who
went through this progression where uh

3164
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:01,359
went through this progression where uh
 

3165
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,950
went through this progression where uh
at a certain point

3166

00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:04,799
any four-legged animal he would call it
 

3169
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,990
any four-legged animal he would call it
either a horse or a dog or a cat

3170
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:08,000
either a horse or a dog or a cat
 

3171
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,910
either a horse or a dog or a cat
and if it was big he would tend to call

3172
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:09,920
and if it was big he would tend to call
 

3173
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,670
and if it was big he would tend to call
it a horse if it was small he'd tend to

3174
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
it a horse if it was small he'd tend to
 

3175
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,829
it a horse if it was small he'd tend to
call it a cat middle-sized onesie called

00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:13,839
call it a cat middle-sized onesie called
 

3177
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,549
call it a cat middle-sized onesie called
dogs

3178
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559

00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,470

this is just a part of the syndrome

so

3198
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:36,160
so
 

3199
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,630
so
you give the patient a picture of

3200
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
you give the patient a picture of
 

3201
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,710
you give the patient a picture of
pyramids and they have a choice which

3202
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:40,720
pyramids and they have a choice which
 

3203
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,870
pyramids and they have a choice which
goes with the pyramids

3204
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880
goes with the pyramids
 

3205
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,470
goes with the pyramids
palm trees or pine trees

3206
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:46,480
palm trees or pine trees
 

3207
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,430
palm trees or pine trees
and

3208
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
and
 

3209
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,190
and
you know she showed that this wasn't

3210
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,200
you know she showed that this wasn't
 

3211
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,150
you know she showed that this wasn't
just a matter of language because

3212
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160
just a matter of language because
 

3213
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,750
just a matter of language because
the patient's

3214
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,760
the patient's
 

3215
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,990
the patient's
loss of this ability shows up whether

3216
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000
loss of this ability shows up whether
 

3217
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,390
loss of this ability shows up whether
you present the material with words or

3218
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:58,400
you present the material with words or
 

3219
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,069
you present the material with words or
with pictures the pictures

3220
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:02,079
with pictures the pictures
 

3221
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,670
with pictures the pictures
they can't put the pictures together

3222
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:03,680
they can't put the pictures together
 

3223
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,270
they can't put the pictures together
with each other properly anymore they

3224
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:05,280
with each other properly anymore they
 

3225
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,190
with each other properly anymore they
can't relate the pictures to the words

3226
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:07,200
can't relate the pictures to the words
 

3227
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,789
can't relate the pictures to the words
either they can't do word picture

3228
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:08,799
either they can't do word picture
 

3229
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,430
either they can't do word picture
matching but they've lost the conceptual

3230
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
matching but they've lost the conceptual
 

3231
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,430
matching but they've lost the conceptual
grounding

3232
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
grounding
 

3233
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,630
grounding
from either modality of input and

3234
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
from either modality of input and
 

3235
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,710
from either modality of input and
um so it's that's why it's called

3236
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
um so it's that's why it's called
 

3237
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,589
um so it's that's why it's called
semantic dementia the very semantics is

3238
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:21,599
semantic dementia the very semantics is
 

3239
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,030
semantic dementia the very semantics is
disintegrating

3240
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
disintegrating
 

3241
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,069
disintegrating
and and we we understand this in terms

3242
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:26,079
and and we we understand this in terms
 

3243
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,829
and and we we understand this in terms
of our

3244
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:27,839
of our
 

3245
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,470
of our
idea that distributed representation a

3246
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:30,480
idea that distributed representation a
 

3247
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,309
idea that distributed representation a
pattern of activation represents the

3248
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:32,319
pattern of activation represents the
 

3249
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,789
pattern of activation represents the
concepts really similar ones as you

3250
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:34,799
concepts really similar ones as you
 

3251
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,870
concepts really similar ones as you
degrade them they start being

3252
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:36,880
degrade them they start being
 

3253
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,109
degrade them they start being
you lose the differences and

3254
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
you lose the differences and
 

3255
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,270
you lose the differences and
and then um so the difference between

3256
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,280
and then um so the difference between
 

3257
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,870
and then um so the difference between
the dog and the goat sort of is no

3258
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:42,880
the dog and the goat sort of is no
 

3259
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,109
the dog and the goat sort of is no
longer part of the pattern anymore and

3260
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
longer part of the pattern anymore and
 

3261
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,069
longer part of the pattern anymore and
since dog is really familiar that's the

3262
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:48,079
since dog is really familiar that's the
 

3263
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,470
since dog is really familiar that's the
thing that remains and and we understand

3264
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:50,480
thing that remains and and we understand
 

3265
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,069
thing that remains and and we understand
that in the way the models work and

3266
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:52,079
that in the way the models work and
 

3267
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,270
that in the way the models work and
learn but

3268
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,280
learn but
 

3269
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,230
learn but
but remember heart underwent this this

3270
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:56,240
but remember heart underwent this this
 

3271
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,789
but remember heart underwent this this
condition so on the one hand it's a

3272
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
condition so on the one hand it's a
 

3273
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,630
condition so on the one hand it's a
fascinating aspect of parallel

3274
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,640
fascinating aspect of parallel
 

3275
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,789
fascinating aspect of parallel
distributed processing to me

3276
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:02,799
distributed processing to me
 

3277
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:06,470
distributed processing to me
uh and it reveals this uh this sort of

3278
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:06,480
uh and it reveals this uh this sort of
 

3279
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,109
uh and it reveals this uh this sort of
texture of distributed representation

3280
01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:09,119
texture of distributed representation
 

3281
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:11,510
texture of distributed representation
in a very nice way i've always felt but

3282
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:11,520
in a very nice way i've always felt but
 

3283
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,109
in a very nice way i've always felt but
at the same time it was extremely

3284
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:13,119
at the same time it was extremely
 

3285
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,190
at the same time it was extremely
poignant because

3286
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,200
poignant because
 

3287
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,030
poignant because
this is exactly the condition that romal

3288
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:17,040
this is exactly the condition that romal
 

3289
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,109
this is exactly the condition that romal
heart was undergoing and there was a

3290
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:19,119
heart was undergoing and there was a
 

3291
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,230
heart was undergoing and there was a

3319
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,029

hard for any of us to really appreciate

3320
01:01:59,029 --> 01:01:59,039
hard for any of us to really appreciate
 

3321
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,510
hard for any of us to really appreciate
that he was sort of in some sense

3322
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:01,520
that he was sort of in some sense
 

3323
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,789
that he was sort of in some sense
not

3324
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
not
 

3325
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,870
not
fully there anymore do you know if he

3326
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:04,880
fully there anymore do you know if he
 

3327
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,589
fully there anymore do you know if he
was able to introspect

3328
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:07,599
was able to introspect
 

3329
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,589
was able to introspect
this um

3330
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
this um
 

3331
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,789
this um
the solution of this you know the the

3332
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:12,799
the solution of this you know the the
 

3333
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,789
the solution of this you know the the
understanding mind

3334
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:14,799
understanding mind
 

3335
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,349
understanding mind
was he i mean this is one of the big

3336
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:17,359
was he i mean this is one of the big
 

3337
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,990
was he i mean this is one of the big
scientists that thinks about this yeah

3338
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
scientists that thinks about this yeah
 

3339
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,750
scientists that thinks about this yeah
was he able to look at himself and

3340
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:21,760
was he able to look at himself and
 

3341
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,549
was he able to look at himself and
understand the fading mind

3342
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:24,559
understand the fading mind
 

3343
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:25,510
understand the fading mind
you know

3344
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
you know
 

3345
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,190
you know
um we can we can contrast um

3346
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,200
um we can we can contrast um
 

3347
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,589
um we can we can contrast um
hawking and normal heart in this way and

3348
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:31,599
hawking and normal heart in this way and
 

3349
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,069
hawking and normal heart in this way and
i i like to do that to honor rummelhart

3350
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:34,079
i i like to do that to honor rummelhart
 

3351
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,750
i i like to do that to honor rummelhart
because i think rummelhart is sort of

3352
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:35,760
because i think rummelhart is sort of
 

3353
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,430
because i think rummelhart is sort of
like the hawking of

3354
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,440
like the hawking of
 

3355
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,190
like the hawking of
you know cognitive science to me in some

3356
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,200
you know cognitive science to me in some
 

3357
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,029
you know cognitive science to me in some
ways um

3358
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:41,039
ways um
 

3359
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,549
ways um
but both of them

3360
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:42,559
but both of them
 

3361
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,029
but both of them
suffered from a degenerative

3362
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:45,039
suffered from a degenerative
 

3363
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,069
suffered from a degenerative
condition

3364
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
condition
 

3365
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,150
condition
and in hawking's case it affected the

3366
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,160
and in hawking's case it affected the
 

3367
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,990
and in hawking's case it affected the
motor system

3368
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,000
motor system
 

3369
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,390
motor system
in in romelhart's case it's it's

3370
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:52,400
in in romelhart's case it's it's
 

3371
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,710
in in romelhart's case it's it's
affecting the semantics

3372
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:54,720
affecting the semantics
 

3373
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,150
affecting the semantics
uh and

3374
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,160
uh and
 

3375
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,670
uh and
um

3376
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:57,680
um
 

3377
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,789
um
not

3378
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799
not
 

3379
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:02,150
not
not just the pure uh object semantics

3380
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,160
not just the pure uh object semantics
 

3381
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,430
not just the pure uh object semantics
but maybe the self semantics as well and

3382
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:05,440
but maybe the self semantics as well and
 

3383
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,990
but maybe the self semantics as well and
we don't understand that

3384
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:08,000
we don't understand that
 

3385
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,190
we don't understand that
broadly but but but it's

3386
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:11,200
broadly but but but it's
 

3387
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,470
broadly but but but it's
so i would say uh he didn't and this was

3388
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:14,480
so i would say uh he didn't and this was
 

3389
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,870
so i would say uh he didn't and this was
part of what from the outside was a

3390
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:16,880
part of what from the outside was a
 

3391
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,630
part of what from the outside was a
profound tragedy

3392
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:18,640
profound tragedy
 

3393
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,510
profound tragedy
but

3394
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:19,520
but
 

3395
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,910
but
but on the other hand at some level he

3396
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:21,920
but on the other hand at some level he
 

3397
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,789
but on the other hand at some level he
sort of did because

3398
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:24,799
sort of did because
 

3399
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,190
sort of did because
you know there was a period of time when

3400
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,200
you know there was a period of time when
 

3401
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,670
you know there was a period of time when
it finally was realized that he had

3402
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:29,680
it finally was realized that he had
 

3403
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,829
it finally was realized that he had
really become

3404
01:03:31,829 --> 01:03:31,839
really become
 

3405
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,910
really become
profoundly impaired this was clearly a

3406
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:33,920
profoundly impaired this was clearly a
 

3407
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,069
profoundly impaired this was clearly a
biological condition and he wasn't you

3408
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
biological condition and he wasn't you
 

3409
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,109
biological condition and he wasn't you
know it wasn't just like he was

3410
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:37,119
know it wasn't just like he was
 

3411
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,870
know it wasn't just like he was
distracted that day or something like

3412
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
distracted that day or something like
 

3413
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,069
distracted that day or something like
that

3414
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
that
 

3415
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,230
that
so he retired

3416
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
so he retired
 

3417
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,230
so he retired
uh you know from his professorship at

3418
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:44,240
uh you know from his professorship at
 

3419
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,029
uh you know from his professorship at
stanford and he became

3420
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:47,039
stanford and he became
 

3421
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,910
stanford and he became
um he he

3422
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
um he he
 

3423
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,349
um he he
uh lived with his brother for a couple

3424
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:51,359
uh lived with his brother for a couple
 

3425
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,990
uh lived with his brother for a couple
years and then he moved into a

3426
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
years and then he moved into a
 

3427
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,349
years and then he moved into a
a facility for people with um

3428
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
a facility for people with um
 

3429
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,510
a facility for people with um
cognitive impairments

3430
01:03:59,510 --> 01:03:59,520
cognitive impairments
 

3431
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,950
cognitive impairments
um

3432
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:00,960
um
 

3433
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,670
um
a

3434
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,680
a
 

3435
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,029
a
one that

3436
01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:03,039
one that
 

3437
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,029
one that
you know many elderly people end up in

3438
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:05,039
you know many elderly people end up in
 

3439
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,190
you know many elderly people end up in
when they have cognitive impairments and

3440
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:09,200

 

3441
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,309

i

3442
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,319
i
 

3443
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,470
i
would spend time with him during that

3444
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
would spend time with him during that
 

3445
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,029
would spend time with him during that
period this was like in the late 90s

3446
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:15,039
period this was like in the late 90s
 

3447
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,029
period this was like in the late 90s
around 2000 even

3448
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
around 2000 even
 

3449
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,150
around 2000 even
and

3450
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:18,160
and
 

3451
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,109
and
you know i would we would go

3452
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:21,119
you know i would we would go
 

3453
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,230
you know i would we would go
bowling

3454
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,240
bowling
 

3455
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,270
bowling
and he could still bowl

3456
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:25,280
and he could still bowl
 

3457
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,990
and he could still bowl
uh and um

3458
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,000
uh and um
 

3459
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,870
uh and um
i after bowling i took him to lunch and

3460
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:30,880
i after bowling i took him to lunch and
 

3461
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,630
i after bowling i took him to lunch and
i i said

3462
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:32,640
i i said
 

3463
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,549
i i said
where would you like to go you want to

you know so
 

3473
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,230
you know so
he still had a certain amount of spatial

3474
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:44,240
he still had a certain amount of spatial
 

3475
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,990
he still had a certain amount of spatial
cognition and he could get me to the

3476
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,000
cognition and he could get me to the
 

3477
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,670
cognition and he could get me to the
restaurant

3478
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:47,680
restaurant
 

3479
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,309
restaurant

um
he couldn't

3486
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:55,760
he couldn't
 

3487
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,950
he couldn't
come up with any of the words but he

3488
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:56,960
come up with any of the words but he
 

3489
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,789
come up with any of the words but he
knew where on the menu the thing was

3490
01:04:58,789 --> 01:04:58,799
knew where on the menu the thing was
 

3491
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,549
knew where on the menu the thing was
that he wanted so

3492
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:00,559
that he wanted so
 

3493
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,910
that he wanted so
so fascinating it's it you know and

so fascinating it's it you know and
 

3495
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,670
so fascinating it's it you know and
he couldn't say what it was but he knew

3496
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
he couldn't say what it was but he knew
 

3497

he couldn't say what it was but he knew
that that's what he wanted to eat and

3498
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
that that's what he wanted to eat and
 

3499
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,789
that that's what he wanted to eat and
and so there was you know that

3500
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
and so there was you know that
 

3501
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:14,069
and so there was you know that
it's it's it's like it isn't monolithic

3502
01:05:14,069 --> 01:05:14,079
it's it's it's like it isn't monolithic
 

3503
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,109
it's it's it's like it isn't monolithic
at all this the our cognition is

3504
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:17,119
at all this the our cognition is
 

3505
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,029
at all this the our cognition is
is

3506
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:19,039
is
 

3507
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:20,950
is
you know first of all graded in certain

3508
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:20,960
you know first of all graded in certain
 

3509
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,950
you know first of all graded in certain
kinds of ways but also

3510
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:22,960
kinds of ways but also
 

3511
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,510
kinds of ways but also
multipartite there's many elements to it

3512
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:25,520
multipartite there's many elements to it
 

3513
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,029
multipartite there's many elements to it
and things

3514
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:27,039
and things
 

3515
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,990
and things
uh

3516
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
uh
 

3517
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,150
uh
certain sort of

3518
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
certain sort of
 

3519
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,230
certain sort of
partial competencies still exist in the

3520
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:32,240
partial competencies still exist in the
 

3521
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,510
partial competencies still exist in the
absence of

3522
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:33,520
absence of
 

3523
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,029
absence of
of other aspects of these competencies

3524
01:05:37,029 --> 01:05:37,039
of other aspects of these competencies
 

3525
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,270
of other aspects of these competencies
so this is what always fascinated me

3526
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:39,280
so this is what always fascinated me
 

3527
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,390
so this is what always fascinated me
about

3528
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,400
about
 

3529
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,589
about
what

3530
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:41,599
what
 

3531
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:42,789
what
uh

3532
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:42,799
uh
 

3533
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,829
uh
used to be called cognitive

3534
01:05:44,829 --> 01:05:44,839
used to be called cognitive
 

3535
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:46,710
used to be called cognitive
neuropsychology

3536
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:46,720
neuropsychology
 

3537
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,829
neuropsychology
you know the effects of brain damage on

3538
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:48,839
you know the effects of brain damage on
 

3539
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:52,150
you know the effects of brain damage on
cognition but in particular this gradual

3540
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,160
cognition but in particular this gradual
 

3541
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,710
cognition but in particular this gradual
disintegration part you know i'm a big

3542
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:54,720
disintegration part you know i'm a big
 

3543
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,829
disintegration part you know i'm a big
believer that the loss of a

3544
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
believer that the loss of a
 

3545
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,230
believer that the loss of a
human being that you value is as

3546
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,240
human being that you value is as
 

3547
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,990
human being that you value is as
powerful as you know first falling in

3548
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
powerful as you know first falling in
 

3549
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,390
powerful as you know first falling in
love with that human being i think

3550
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
love with that human being i think
 

3551
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,230
love with that human being i think
it's all a celebration of the human

3552
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,240
it's all a celebration of the human
 

3553
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,950
it's all a celebration of the human
being so the disintegration itself too

3554
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:08,960
being so the disintegration itself too
 

3555
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,710
being so the disintegration itself too
is a celebration yeah

3556
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:10,720
is a celebration yeah
 

3557
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,270
is a celebration yeah
yeah yeah and

3558
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:13,280
yeah yeah and
 

3559
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,309
yeah yeah and
but just to say something more about

3560
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:16,319
but just to say something more about
 

3561
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,549
but just to say something more about
the scientists and and the back

3562
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:18,559
the scientists and and the back
 

3563
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,470
the scientists and and the back
propagation idea that you mentioned um

3564
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:22,480
propagation idea that you mentioned um
 

3565
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,829
propagation idea that you mentioned um
so

3566
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:23,839
so
 

3567
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:30,870
so
in in 1982

3568
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:30,880

 

3569
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,589

hinton had been there as a postdoc and

3570
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
hinton had been there as a postdoc and
 

3571
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,270
hinton had been there as a postdoc and
organized that conference he'd actually

3572
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:35,280
organized that conference he'd actually
 

3573
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,710
organized that conference he'd actually
gone away and gotten an assistant

3574
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
gone away and gotten an assistant
 

3575
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,109
gone away and gotten an assistant
professorship and then

3576
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:39,119
professorship and then
 

3577
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,029
professorship and then
um there was this opportunity to bring

3578
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
um there was this opportunity to bring
 

3579
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,390
um there was this opportunity to bring
him back so jeff hinton was back

3580
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
him back so jeff hinton was back
 

3581
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,309
him back so jeff hinton was back
on a sabbatical san diego in san diego

3582
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:48,319
on a sabbatical san diego in san diego
 

3583
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,870
on a sabbatical san diego in san diego
and uh remember heart and i had decided

3584
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:50,880
and uh remember heart and i had decided
 

3585
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,710
and uh remember heart and i had decided
we wanted to do this

3586
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:52,720
we wanted to do this
 

3587
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,150
we wanted to do this
you know we thought it was really

3588
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:54,160
you know we thought it was really
 

3589
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,150
you know we thought it was really
exciting and

3590
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
exciting and
 

3591
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,470
exciting and
um our the papers on the interactive

3592
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:58,480
um our the papers on the interactive
 

3593
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,230
um our the papers on the interactive
activation model that i was telling you

3594
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:00,240
activation model that i was telling you
 

3595
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,230
activation model that i was telling you
about had just been published and we

3596
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:02,240
about had just been published and we
 

3597
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,549
about had just been published and we
both sort of saw a huge potential for

3598
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:04,559
both sort of saw a huge potential for
 

3599
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,829
both sort of saw a huge potential for
this work and

3600
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:05,839
this work and
 

3601
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,069
this work and
and and jeff was there and so the three

3602
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:08,079
and and jeff was there and so the three
 

3603
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,270
and and jeff was there and so the three
of us

3604
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
of us
 

3605
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,870
of us
uh

3606

uh
 

3607
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,870
uh
started a research group which we called

3608
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:12,880
started a research group which we called
 

3609
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,950
started a research group which we called
the pdp research group

3610
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:14,960
the pdp research group
 

3611
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,910
the pdp research group
and

3612
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:15,920

talk to us about
learning

3646
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:56,720
learning
 

3647
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,510
learning
and

3648
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:57,520
and
 

3649
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:02,630
and
how we should think about

3650
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640

 

3651
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,910

how you know learning occurs in

3652
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:05,920
how you know learning occurs in
 

3653
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,309
how you know learning occurs in
a neural network and he said

3654
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:08,319
a neural network and he said
 

3655
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,950
a neural network and he said
the problem

3656
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:10,960
the problem
 

3657
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,309
the problem
with the way you guys have been

3658
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:12,319
with the way you guys have been
 

3659
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,069
with the way you guys have been
approaching this is that you've been

3660
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:14,079
approaching this is that you've been
 

3661
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,669
approaching this is that you've been
looking for inspiration from biology

3662
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:17,679
looking for inspiration from biology
 

3663
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,910
looking for inspiration from biology

and
 

3817
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,550
and
so he first called the algorithm the

3818
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:02,560
so he first called the algorithm the
 

3819
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,550
so he first called the algorithm the
generalized delta rule because it's just

idea
 

3825
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,950
idea
and interestingly enough

3826
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:10,960
and interestingly enough
 

3827
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,189
and interestingly enough
hinton was thinking that this wasn't

01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,350
hinton was thinking that this wasn't

going to work very well
 

3831
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,709
going to work very well
so hinton had his own alternative

3832
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:18,719
so hinton had his own alternative
 

3833
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,110
so hinton had his own alternative
algorithm at the time

3834
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
algorithm at the time
 

3835
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,229
algorithm at the time
based on

3836
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
based on
 

3837
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,310
based on
the concept of the balsa machine that he

3838
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:24,320
the concept of the balsa machine that he
 

3839
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,229
the concept of the balsa machine that he
was pursuing so the paper on the balsa

3840
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
was pursuing so the paper on the balsa
 

3841
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,390
was pursuing so the paper on the balsa
machine came out in learning in bolster

3842
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:28,400
machine came out in learning in bolster
 

3843
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,830
machine came out in learning in bolster
machines came out in 1985

3844
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:31,840
machines came out in 1985
 

3845
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,830
machines came out in 1985
but it turned out that

3846
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:33,840
but it turned out that
 

3847
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,950
but it turned out that
backprop

3848
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:34,960
backprop
 

3849
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,790
backprop
worked better than the bolster machine

3850
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:36,800
worked better than the bolster machine
 

3851
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,510
worked better than the bolster machine
learning algorithm so this generalized

3852
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
learning algorithm so this generalized
 

3853
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,229
learning algorithm so this generalized
delta algorithm ended up being called

3854
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:42,239
delta algorithm ended up being called
 

3855
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,870
delta algorithm ended up being called
back propagation as you say back prop

3856
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:44,880
back propagation as you say back prop
 

3857
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,070
back propagation as you say back prop
yeah

3858
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
yeah
 

3859
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,430
yeah
and

3860
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
and
 

3861
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,390
and
the

3862
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:48,400
the
 

3863
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,870
the
you know probably that name is opaque to

3864
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
you know probably that name is opaque to
 

3865
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,550
you know probably that name is opaque to
maybe what what does that mean

3866
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:54,560
maybe what what does that mean
 

3867
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,870
maybe what what does that mean
what it what it meant was that in order

3868
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
what it what it meant was that in order
 

3869
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,189
what it what it meant was that in order
to figure out what the changes you

3870
01:11:59,189 --> 01:11:59,199
to figure out what the changes you
 

3871
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,030
to figure out what the changes you
needed to make to the

3872
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:01,040
needed to make to the
 

3873
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,030
needed to make to the
connections from the input to the hidden

3874
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,040
connections from the input to the hidden
 

3875
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,149
connections from the input to the hidden
layer

3876
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:04,159
layer
 

3877
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,830
layer
you had to

3878
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840
you had to
 

3879
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,430
you had to
back propagate the error signals

3880
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:09,440
back propagate the error signals
 

3881
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,510
back propagate the error signals
from the output layer through the

3882
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
from the output layer through the
 

3883
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,790
from the output layer through the
connections

3884
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:12,800
connections
 

3885
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,070
connections
from the hidden layer to the output

3886
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,080
from the hidden layer to the output
 

3887
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,910
from the hidden layer to the output
to get the signals

3888
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
to get the signals
 

3889
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,669
to get the signals
that would be the error signals for the

3890
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
that would be the error signals for the
 

3891
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,030
that would be the error signals for the
hidden layer

3892
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
hidden layer
 

3893
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,110
hidden layer
and that's how rimmel hard formulated it

3894
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
and that's how rimmel hard formulated it
 

3895
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,709
and that's how rimmel hard formulated it
was like well we know what the air

3896
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
was like well we know what the air
 

3897
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,390
was like well we know what the air
signals are at the output layer let's

3898
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:26,400
signals are at the output layer let's
 

3899
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,630
signals are at the output layer let's
see if we can get a signal at the hidden

3900
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:28,640
see if we can get a signal at the hidden
 

3901
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,550
see if we can get a signal at the hidden
layer that tells each hidden unit what

3902
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:30,560
layer that tells each hidden unit what
 

3903
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,350
layer that tells each hidden unit what
its error signal is essentially so it's

3904
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,360
its error signal is essentially so it's
 

3905
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,990
its error signal is essentially so it's
back propagating through the connections

3906
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:38,000
back propagating through the connections
 

3907
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,990
back propagating through the connections
from the hidden to the output to get the

3908
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:40,000
from the hidden to the output to get the
 

3909
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,910
from the hidden to the output to get the
signals to tell the hidden units how to

3910
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:41,920
signals to tell the hidden units how to
 

3911
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,910
signals to tell the hidden units how to
change their weights from the input and

3912
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:43,920
change their weights from the input and
 

3913
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,750
change their weights from the input and
that's why it's called back problems

3914
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:47,760

 

3915
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,110

yeah but

3916
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,120
yeah but
 

3917
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,470
yeah but
so it came from hinton having

3918
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:52,480
so it came from hinton having
 

3919
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,030
so it came from hinton having
introduced the concept of you know

3920
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:55,040
introduced the concept of you know
 

3921
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,430
introduced the concept of you know
define your objective function figure

3922
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,440
define your objective function figure
 

3923
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,630
define your objective function figure
out how to

3924
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:58,640
out how to
 

3925
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,350
out how to
take the derivative so that you can um

3926
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,360
take the derivative so that you can um
 

3927
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,430
take the derivative so that you can um
adjust the connections so that they make

3928
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
adjust the connections so that they make
 

3929
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,270
adjust the connections so that they make
progress towards your goal so stop

3930
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,280
progress towards your goal so stop
 

3931
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,590
progress towards your goal so stop
thinking about biology for a second and

3932
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:07,600
thinking about biology for a second and
 

3933
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,590
thinking about biology for a second and
let's start to think about optimization

3934
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:09,600
let's start to think about optimization
 

3935
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,870
let's start to think about optimization
and computation yeah a little bit more

3936
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:12,880
and computation yeah a little bit more
 

3937
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,590
and computation yeah a little bit more
so

3938
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:13,600
so
 

3939
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,630
so
what about

3940
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:14,640
what about
 

3941
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,990
what about
jeff hinton

3942
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:16,000
jeff hinton
 

3943
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,510
jeff hinton
what

3944
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:17,520
what
 

3945
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,110
what
you've gotten a chance to work with him

3946
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:19,120
you've gotten a chance to work with him
 

3947
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,510
you've gotten a chance to work with him
in that little

3948
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:21,520
in that little
 

3949
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,149
in that little
the set of people involved there is

3950
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:24,159
the set of people involved there is
 

3951
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:25,990
the set of people involved there is
quite incredible the small set of people

3952
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:26,000
quite incredible the small set of people
 

3953
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,950
quite incredible the small set of people
under the

3954
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:26,960
under the
 

3955
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,030
under the
pdp flag

3956
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
pdp flag
 

3957
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,350
pdp flag
it's just given the amount of impact

3958
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:31,360
it's just given the amount of impact
 

3959
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,189
it's just given the amount of impact
those ideas have had over the years it's

3960
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:33,199
those ideas have had over the years it's
 

3961
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,590
those ideas have had over the years it's
kind of incredible to think about but

3962
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
kind of incredible to think about but
 

3963
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,470
kind of incredible to think about but
you know

3964
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:36,480
you know
 

3965
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,030
you know
just like you said uh like yourself

3966
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:39,040
just like you said uh like yourself
 

3967
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,510
just like you said uh like yourself
jeffrey hinton is seen as one of the

3968
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
jeffrey hinton is seen as one of the
 

3969
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,910
jeffrey hinton is seen as one of the
not just like a seminal figure in ai but

3970
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:43,920
not just like a seminal figure in ai but
 

3971
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,709
not just like a seminal figure in ai but
just a brilliant person just a like the

3972
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:46,719
just a brilliant person just a like the
 

3973
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,030
just a brilliant person just a like the
horsepower of the mind is pretty high up

3974
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
horsepower of the mind is pretty high up
 

3975
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,430
horsepower of the mind is pretty high up
there for him because he's

3976
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,440
there for him because he's
 

3977
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,590
there for him because he's
just a great thinker so what kind of

3978
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:53,600
just a great thinker so what kind of
 

3979
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,110
just a great thinker so what kind of
ideas have you

3980
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120

 

3981
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,189

learned from him have you influenced

3982
01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,199
learned from him have you influenced
 

3983
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,270
learned from him have you influenced
each other on have you debated over what

3984
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
each other on have you debated over what
 

3985
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,950
each other on have you debated over what
stands out to you

3986
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:02,960
stands out to you
 

3987
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,229
stands out to you
in in in the full space of ideas here at

3988
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:06,239
in in in the full space of ideas here at
 

3989
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,990
in in in the full space of ideas here at
the intersection of computation and

3990
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:08,000
the intersection of computation and
 

3991
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,070
the intersection of computation and
cognition

3992
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
cognition
 

3993
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,030
cognition
well

3994
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:11,040
well
 

3995
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,550
well
so um

3996
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
so um
 

3997
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,950
so um
jeff has said many things to me that had

3998
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:14,960
jeff has said many things to me that had
 

3999
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,310
jeff has said many things to me that had
a profound impact on my thinking

4000
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
a profound impact on my thinking
 

4001
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,709
a profound impact on my thinking
um and he's written several articles

4002
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:20,719
um and he's written several articles
 

4003
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,110
um and he's written several articles
which um

4004
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,120
which um
 

4005
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,830
which um
uh were way ahead of their time

4006
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:25,840
uh were way ahead of their time
 

4007
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,669
uh were way ahead of their time
um

4008
01:14:27,669 --> 01:14:27,679
um
 

4009
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:32,070
um
he uh

4010
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,080

 

4011
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,110

he had two papers in 1981 just to give

4012
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
he had two papers in 1981 just to give
 

4013
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,990
he had two papers in 1981 just to give
one example

4014
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:38,000

 

4015
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,430

uh one of which was essentially the idea

4016
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:41,440
uh one of which was essentially the idea
 

4017
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,430
uh one of which was essentially the idea
of transformers

4018
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
of transformers
 

4019
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,149
of transformers
and another of which

4020
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:46,159
and another of which
 

4021
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:47,910
and another of which
was a

4022
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:47,920
was a
 

4023
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,990
was a
early paper on semantic cognition which

4024
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:52,000
early paper on semantic cognition which
 

4025
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,830
early paper on semantic cognition which
inspired

4026
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:54,840

 

4027
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,550

uh him and rummelhart and me

4028
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,560
uh him and rummelhart and me
 

4029
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,750
uh him and rummelhart and me
uh

4030
01:14:59,750 --> 01:14:59,760
uh
 

4031
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,030
uh
throughout

4032
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:01,040
throughout
 

4033
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,910
throughout
the 80s and uh

4034
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:03,920
the 80s and uh
 

4035
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,830
the 80s and uh
um

4036
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:05,840
um
 

4037
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,590
um
you know still uh i think sort of

4038
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:09,600
you know still uh i think sort of
 

4039
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,709
you know still uh i think sort of
grounds my own thinking about

4040
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:12,719
grounds my own thinking about
 

4041
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,750
grounds my own thinking about
um the semantic aspects of of cognition

4042
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
um the semantic aspects of of cognition
 

4043
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,110
um the semantic aspects of of cognition
he also

4044
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,120

 

4045
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,270

in a in a small paper that was never

4046
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:23,280
in a in a small paper that was never
 

4047
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,910
in a in a small paper that was never
published that he wrote in 1977 you know

4048
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:25,920
published that he wrote in 1977 you know
 

4049
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,910
published that he wrote in 1977 you know
before he actually arrived at ucsd or

4050
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:27,920
before he actually arrived at ucsd or
 

4051
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,510
before he actually arrived at ucsd or
maybe a couple of years even before that

4052
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:29,520
maybe a couple of years even before that
 

4053
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,550
maybe a couple of years even before that
i don't know

4054
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:30,560
i don't know
 

4055
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,149
i don't know
uh when he was a phd student he he um

4056
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,159
uh when he was a phd student he he um
 

4057
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:38,229
uh when he was a phd student he he um
described how a neural network could do

4058
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:38,239
described how a neural network could do
 

4059
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,870
described how a neural network could do
recursive computation

4060
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
recursive computation
 

4061
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,310
recursive computation
and um

4062
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:44,320

 

4063
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,390

it was a very clever idea that he's

4064
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:46,400
it was a very clever idea that he's
 

4065
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,750
it was a very clever idea that he's
continued to explore over time which was

4066
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
continued to explore over time which was
 

4067
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,790
continued to explore over time which was
sort of the idea that um

4068
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:54,800

 

4069
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,709

when you when you call a subroutine you

4070
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:56,719
when you when you call a subroutine you
 

4071
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,470
when you when you call a subroutine you
need to save the state that you had

4072
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:00,480
need to save the state that you had
 

4073
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,310
need to save the state that you had
when you called it so you can get back

4074
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,320
when you called it so you can get back
 

4075
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,669
when you called it so you can get back
to where you were when you're finished

4076
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
to where you were when you're finished
 

4077
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,110
to where you were when you're finished
with the subroutine and and the idea was

4078
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:07,120
with the subroutine and and the idea was
 

4079
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,750
with the subroutine and and the idea was
that you would save the state

4080
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:09,760
that you would save the state
 

4081
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,229
that you would save the state
of the calling routine by making fast

4082
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:12,239
of the calling routine by making fast
 

4083
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,709
of the calling routine by making fast
changes to connection weights

4084
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:14,719
changes to connection weights
 

4085
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,830
changes to connection weights
and then

4086
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:15,840
and then
 

4087
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,470
and then
when you

4088
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:18,480

 

4089
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,550

finished with the subroutine call those

4090
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,560
finished with the subroutine call those
 

4091
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,229
finished with the subroutine call those
fast changes and the connection weights

4092
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
fast changes and the connection weights
 

4093
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,990
fast changes and the connection weights
would allow you to go back to where you

4094
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,000
would allow you to go back to where you
 

4095
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,350
would allow you to go back to where you
had been before

4096
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:25,360
had been before
 

4097
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,669
had been before
and reinstate the previous context so

4098
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679
and reinstate the previous context so
 

4099
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:30,149
and reinstate the previous context so
that you could continue on with the

4100
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
that you could continue on with the
 

4101
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,270
that you could continue on with the
the

4102
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
the
 

4103
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,990
the
top level of the computation

4104
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:34,000
top level of the computation
 

4105
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,470
top level of the computation
anyway that was part of the idea and um

4106
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:36,480
anyway that was part of the idea and um
 

4107
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,390
anyway that was part of the idea and um
i always thought okay that's really you

4108
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
i always thought okay that's really you
 

4109
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,070
i always thought okay that's really you
know he just

4110
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
know he just
 

4111
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,630
know he just
he had extremely creative ideas that

4112
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:42,640
he had extremely creative ideas that
 

4113
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,189
he had extremely creative ideas that
were uh quite a lot ahead of his time

4114
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:45,199
were uh quite a lot ahead of his time
 

4115
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:45,990
were uh quite a lot ahead of his time
and

4116
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:46,000
and
 

4117
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,870
and
many of them in the 1970s and early

4118
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:48,880
many of them in the 1970s and early
 

4119
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,790
many of them in the 1970s and early
early 1980s

4120
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:52,800

 

4121
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,870

so

4122
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
so
 

4123
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,830
so
another thing about jeff hinton's way of

4124
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:57,840
another thing about jeff hinton's way of
 

4125
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,510
another thing about jeff hinton's way of
thinking which

4126
01:16:59,510 --> 01:16:59,520
thinking which
 

4127
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,790
thinking which
has profoundly influenced my

4128
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:04,800

4132
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:07,920
cognition
 

4133
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,950
cognition
is

4134
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:10,960

 

4135
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,830

that he doesn't write too many equations

4136
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:13,840
that he doesn't write too many equations
 

4137
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,550
that he doesn't write too many equations
and people tell stories like oh in

4138
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
and people tell stories like oh in
 

4139
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,310
and people tell stories like oh in
in the hints and lab meetings you don't

4140
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
in the hints and lab meetings you don't
 

4141
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,070
in the hints and lab meetings you don't
get up at the board and write equations

4142
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
get up at the board and write equations
 

4143
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,990
get up at the board and write equations
like you do in everybody else's machine

4144
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,000
like you do in everybody else's machine

learning lab
 

4147
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,430
learning lab
what you do is you draw a picture

4148
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:27,440

 

4149
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,430

and and you know he he explains

01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,440
and and you know he he explains
 

4151
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,390
and and you know he he explains
aspects of the way deep learning works

4152
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,400
aspects of the way deep learning works

4165
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,350
the
what's happening as this gradient

4166
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:47,360
what's happening as this gradient
 

4167
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,350
what's happening as this gradient
descent process you're coming down the

4168
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:49,360
descent process you're coming down the
 

4169
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,270
descent process you're coming down the
wall of a ravine if you take too big a

4170
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:51,280
wall of a ravine if you take too big a
 

4171
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,709
wall of a ravine if you take too big a
jump you're going to jump to the other

4172
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:52,719
jump you're going to jump to the other
 

4173
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:53,910
jump you're going to jump to the other
side

4174
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:53,920
side
 

4175
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,310
side
and um so that's why we have to turn

4176
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:56,320
and um so that's why we have to turn
 

4177
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,669
and um so that's why we have to turn
down the learning rate for example um

4178
01:17:59,669 --> 01:17:59,679
down the learning rate for example um
 

4179
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,110
down the learning rate for example um
and

4180
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,120
and
 

4181
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,550
and
it it

4182
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:02,560
it it
 

4183
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,630
it it
speaks to me of the

4184
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:05,640
speaks to me of the
 

4185
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,669
speaks to me of the
fundamentally intuitive character of

4186
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:09,679
fundamentally intuitive character of
 

4187
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,030
fundamentally intuitive character of
uh deep insight

4188
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
uh deep insight
 

4189
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,669
uh deep insight
together with

4190
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
together with
 

4191
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:19,270
together with
a commitment to really understanding

4192
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
a commitment to really understanding

in a way that's
 

4197
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,149
in a way that's
absolutely ultimately explicit and clear

is uh somehow
 

4399
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,629
is uh somehow
i mean i certainly think of humans this

4400
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:16,639
i mean i certainly think of humans this
 

4401
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,110
i mean i certainly think of humans this
way that humans are one particular

that there's something bigger going on
 

4407
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,950
that there's something bigger going on
and you're trying to you're hoping to

4408
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:24,960
and you're trying to you're hoping to
 

4409
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,229
and you're trying to you're hoping to
figure that out

4410
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:26,239
figure that out
 

4411
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,910
figure that out
the mechanisms of intelligence the

4412
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:27,920
the mechanisms of intelligence the
 

4413
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,830
the mechanisms of intelligence the
mechanisms of cognition are much bigger

4414
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:29,840
mechanisms of cognition are much bigger
 

4415
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,229
mechanisms of cognition are much bigger
than just humans yeah

4416
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:32,239
than just humans yeah
 

4417
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,350
than just humans yeah
so i think of um i've i started using

4418
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:35,360
so i think of um i've i started using
 

4419
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,830
so i think of um i've i started using

the excitement of deep learning actually

01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,270
the excitement of deep learning actually
lies is in the idea that

and you know that there is um
 

4609
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,629
and you know that there is um
uh

4610
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639
uh
 

4611
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:37,830
uh
an angle

4612
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
an angle
 

4613
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,310
an angle
in the first one that has the same

4614
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:40,320
in the first one that has the same
 

4615
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,870
in the first one that has the same

measure as an angle in the second one
 

4617
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,790
measure as an angle in the second one
and you know that the lengths of the

4618
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
and you know that the lengths of the
 

4619
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,390
and you know that the lengths of the
sides

4620
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:46,400
sides
 

4621
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,629
sides
adjacent to that angle in each of the

4622
01:26:48,629 --> 01:26:48,639
adjacent to that angle in each of the
 

4623
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:51,990
adjacent to that angle in each of the
two triangles

4624
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:52,000

 

4625
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,229

the corresponding sides adjacent to that

01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
the corresponding sides adjacent to that
 

4627
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:55,510
the corresponding sides adjacent to that
angle are

4628
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:55,520
angle are
 

4629
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,070
angle are
also have the same measure then you can

4630
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,080
also have the same measure then you can
 

4631
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,790
also have the same measure then you can
then conclude that the triangles

4632
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
then conclude that the triangles
 

4633
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,310
then conclude that the triangles
are

4634
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:02,320
are
 

4635
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,709
are
congruent that is to say they have all

4636
01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:04,719
congruent that is to say they have all
 

4637
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,790
congruent that is to say they have all
of their properties in common

4638
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:06,800
of their properties in common
 

4639
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,030
of their properties in common
and and that

4640
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,040
and and that
 

4641
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,350
and and that
is something about

4666
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
and um
 

4667
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,350
and um
uh

4668
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,360

 

4669
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,870

you know

4670
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:42,880
you know
 

4671
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,070
you know
all of the ability to um

4672
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
all of the ability to um
 

4673
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,830
all of the ability to um
get a tiny

4674
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:47,840
get a tiny
 

4675
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,669
get a tiny
speck of matter launched from

4676
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
speck of matter launched from
 

4677
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,390
speck of matter launched from
uh the planet earth to intersect with

4678
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:54,400
uh the planet earth to intersect with
 

4679
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:58,470
uh the planet earth to intersect with
some tiny tiny little body way out in

4680
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:58,480
some tiny tiny little body way out in
 

4681
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,030
some tiny tiny little body way out in
way beyond pluto somewhere

4682
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:01,040
way beyond pluto somewhere
 

4683
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,149
way beyond pluto somewhere
at exactly a predicted time and date is

4684
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:04,159
at exactly a predicted time and date is
 

4685
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:07,430
at exactly a predicted time and date is
is something that depends on these ideas

4686
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:07,440
is something that depends on these ideas
 

4687
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,870
is something that depends on these ideas
right so

4688
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:08,880
right so
 

4689
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,870
right so
but and it's actually uh

4690
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:12,880
but and it's actually uh
 

4691
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,669
but and it's actually uh
happening in the real physical world

4692
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:15,679
happening in the real physical world
 

4693
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,510
happening in the real physical world
that these

4694
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:17,520
that these
 

4695
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,550
that these
ideas

4696
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:18,560
ideas
 

4697
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,110
ideas
make contact with it uh in those kinds

4698
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
make contact with it uh in those kinds
 

4699
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,709
make contact with it uh in those kinds
of instances

4700
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
of instances
 

4701
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,149
of instances
um

4702
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:24,159
um
 

4703
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,229
um
and um

4704
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:26,239
and um
 

4705
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:27,669
and um
so

4706
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:27,679
so
 

4707
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,390
so
but you know there are these idealized

4708
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:30,400
but you know there are these idealized
 

4709
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,390
but you know there are these idealized
objects these triangles or these

4710
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:32,400
objects these triangles or these
 

4711
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,470
objects these triangles or these
distances or these points whatever they

4712
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
distances or these points whatever they
 

4713
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,669
distances or these points whatever they
are

4714
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:35,679
are
 

4715
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:37,350
are
that um

4716
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:37,360
that um
 

4717
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:41,110
that um
uh allow for this um set of tools to be

4718
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:41,120
uh allow for this um set of tools to be
 

4719
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,229
uh allow for this um set of tools to be
created that then

4720
01:28:44,229 --> 01:28:44,239

 

4721
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:47,030

gives human beings the uh it's this

4722
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:47,040
gives human beings the uh it's this
 

4723
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,030
gives human beings the uh it's this
incredible leverage that they didn't

4724
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:49,040
incredible leverage that they didn't
 

4725
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,750
incredible leverage that they didn't
have without these concepts

4726
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:51,760
have without these concepts
 

4727
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,270
have without these concepts
and uh i think this is actually already

4728
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:55,280
and uh i think this is actually already
 

4729
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,189
and uh i think this is actually already
true

4730
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:57,199
true
 

4731
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,470
true
when we think about

4732
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:00,480

 

4733
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,510

just

4734
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,520
just
 

4735
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,550
just
you know

4736
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:02,560
you know
 

4737
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,510
you know
the

4738
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:03,520
the
 

4739
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,229
the
natural numbers

4740
01:29:06,229 --> 01:29:06,239
natural numbers
 

4741
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:08,709
natural numbers
um i always like to include zero so i'm

4742
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:08,719
um i always like to include zero so i'm
 

4743
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:09,910
um i always like to include zero so i'm
going to say

4744
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:09,920
going to say
 

4745
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,430
going to say
the non-negative integers but

4746
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:13,440
the non-negative integers but
 

4747
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,270
the non-negative integers but
that's that's the place where some

4748
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,280
that's that's the place where some
 

4749
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,830
that's that's the place where some
people prefer not to include zero but uh

4750
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:17,840
people prefer not to include zero but uh
 

4751
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,149
people prefer not to include zero but uh
yeah we like zero here natural numbers

4752
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
yeah we like zero here natural numbers
 

4753
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:22,229
yeah we like zero here natural numbers
zero one two three four five six seven

4754
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:22,239
zero one two three four five six seven
 

4755
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:25,510
zero one two three four five six seven
and so on yeah and and you know because

4756
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:25,520
and so on yeah and and you know because
 

4757
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,709
and so on yeah and and you know because
they give you the ability to

4758
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719
they give you the ability to
 

4759
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:29,910
they give you the ability to
um

4760
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:29,920
um
 

4761
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,030
um
be

4769
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,629

like how many sheep you have like you

4770
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:38,639
like how many sheep you have like you
 

4771
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,070
like how many sheep you have like you
know i sent you out this morning there

4772
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,080
know i sent you out this morning there
 

4773
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,709
know i sent you out this morning there
were 23 sheep you came back with only

4774
01:29:42,709 --> 01:29:42,719
were 23 sheep you came back with only
 

4775
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,030
were 23 sheep you came back with only
22. what happened yeah right

4776
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:45,040
22. what happened yeah right
 

4777
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,709
22. what happened yeah right
the fundamental problem of physics how

the fundamental problem of physics how
 

4779
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,030
the fundamental problem of physics how
many sheep you have yeah

4780
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:49,040
many sheep you have yeah
 

4781
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,270
many sheep you have yeah
it's a fundamental problem of life of

4782
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:51,280
it's a fundamental problem of life of
 

4783
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,830
it's a fundamental problem of life of
human uh society that you damn well

4784
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,840
human uh society that you damn well
 

4785
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,270
human uh society that you damn well
better bring back the same number of

01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
better bring back the same number of
 

4787
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,270
better bring back the same number of

4796
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:08,400
uh records and so on to have systems
 

4797
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,790

the power of human thought
in such a way as to allow all this kind

4836
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:55,600
in such a way as to allow all this kind
 

4837
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,750
in such a way as to allow all this kind
of thing to happen

4838
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:57,760
of thing to happen
 

4839
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,070
of thing to happen
and and so that's

4840
01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:00,080
and and so that's
 

4841
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,390
and and so that's
what mathematics to me is the

4842
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:02,400
what mathematics to me is the
 

4843
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,790
what mathematics to me is the
development of systems for thinking

4844
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:04,800
development of systems for thinking
 

4845
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,629
development of systems for thinking
about

4846
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:06,639
about
 

4847
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,990
about
uh the properties and relations among uh

4848
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:10,000
uh the properties and relations among uh
 

4849
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,669
uh the properties and relations among uh
sets of

4850
01:31:11,669 --> 01:31:11,679
sets of
 

4851
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:14,830
sets of
idealized objects and

4852
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:14,840
idealized objects and
 

4853
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:18,550
idealized objects and
um uh

4854
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:18,560

 

4855
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,270

you know the the mathematical notation

4856
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:21,280
you know the the mathematical notation
 

4857
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,709
you know the the mathematical notation
system that

4858
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:22,719
system that
 

4859
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:23,990
system that
we

4860
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:24,000
we
 

4861
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,270
we
unfortunately focus way too much on

4862
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:27,280
unfortunately focus way too much on
 

4863
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,030
unfortunately focus way too much on
is um

4864
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:29,040
is um
 

4865
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,790
is um
just our way of

4866
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:31,800
just our way of
 

4867
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,350
just our way of
expressing

4868
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:33,360
expressing
 

4869
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,950
expressing
uh propositions about these properties

4870
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:36,960
uh propositions about these properties
 

4871
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,629
uh propositions about these properties
right it's just just like we're talking

4872
01:31:38,629 --> 01:31:38,639
right it's just just like we're talking
 

4873
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,390
right it's just just like we're talking
with chomsky and language

4874
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:40,400
with chomsky and language
 

4875
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,149
with chomsky and language
it's the thing we've invented for the

4876
01:31:42,149 --> 01:31:42,159
it's the thing we've invented for the
 

4877
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,629
it's the thing we've invented for the
communication of those ideas they're not

4878
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:44,639
communication of those ideas they're not
 

4879
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:45,990
communication of those ideas they're not
necessarily

4880
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:46,000
necessarily
 

4881
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,550
necessarily
the deep representation of those ideas

4882
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:48,560
the deep representation of those ideas
 

4883
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,790
the deep representation of those ideas
yeah so what um

4884
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:50,800
yeah so what um
 

4885
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,350
yeah so what um
what's uh what's a good way to model

4886
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:53,360
what's uh what's a good way to model
 

4887
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,629
what's uh what's a good way to model
such powerful mathematical

4888
01:31:56,629 --> 01:31:56,639
such powerful mathematical
 

4889
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:58,550
such powerful mathematical
reasoning would you say what what are

4890
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:58,560
reasoning would you say what what are
 

4891
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,030
reasoning would you say what what are
some ideas you have for capturing this

4892
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,040
some ideas you have for capturing this
 

4893
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,310
some ideas you have for capturing this
in a model

4894
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:02,320
in a model
 

4895
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,790
in a model
the insights that human mathematicians

4896
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:04,800
the insights that human mathematicians
 

4897
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,790
the insights that human mathematicians
have had is

4898
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:06,800
have had is
 

4899
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:11,510
have had is
a combination of the kind of the

4900
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:11,520

 

4901
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,990

intuitive

4902
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:14,000
intuitive
 

4903
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,270
intuitive
kind of

4904
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:15,280
kind of
 

4905
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,070
kind of
connectionist like knowledge that makes

4906
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:18,080
connectionist like knowledge that makes
 

4907
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,990
connectionist like knowledge that makes
it so that

4908
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:20,000
it so that
 

4909
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,790
it so that
something

4910
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:22,800

 

4911
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,149

is just

4912
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:24,159
is just
 

4913
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:27,990
is just
like obviously true

4914
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:28,000

 

4915
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,669

so that you don't have to think about

4916
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:29,679
so that you don't have to think about
 

4917
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,310
so that you don't have to think about
why it's true

4918
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:32,320
why it's true
 

4919
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,110
why it's true
that then makes it possible

4920
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:35,120
that then makes it possible
 

4921
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,390
that then makes it possible
to then

4922
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:36,400
to then
 

4923
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,870
to then
take the next step

4924
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:38,880
take the next step
 

4925
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,430
take the next step
and ponder and reason and figure out

4926
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:41,440
and ponder and reason and figure out
 

4927
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,669
and ponder and reason and figure out
something that you previously didn't

4928
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
something that you previously didn't
 

4929
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,390
something that you previously didn't
have that intuition about

4930
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:46,400
have that intuition about
 

4931
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,030
have that intuition about
it then ultimately becomes

4932
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,040
it then ultimately becomes
 

4933
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,830
it then ultimately becomes
a part of the intuition that

4934
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:51,840
a part of the intuition that
 

4935
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,590
a part of the intuition that
the next generation of

4936
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:55,600
the next generation of
 

4937
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,830
the next generation of
mathematical thinkers have to ground

4938
01:32:57,830 --> 01:32:57,840
mathematical thinkers have to ground
 

4939
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,070
mathematical thinkers have to ground
their own thinking on so that they can

4940
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:00,080
their own thinking on so that they can
 

4941
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,950
their own thinking on so that they can
extend the ideas even further

4942
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:02,960
extend the ideas even further
 

4943
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,189
extend the ideas even further
i came across this quotation

summer
 

4957
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:26,390
summer
and what it said on the bench was

4958
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:26,400

 

4959
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,189

it is by

01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:29,199

 

4961
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:31,830

logic that we prove but by intuition

4962
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
logic that we prove but by intuition
 

4963
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,790
logic that we prove but by intuition
that we discover and so what what for me

4964
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:34,800
that we discover and so what what for me
 

4965
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,270
that we discover and so what what for me
the the essence of the of the project

4966
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,280
the the essence of the of the project
 

4967
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,350
the the essence of the of the project
is to understand how to bring the

4968
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
is to understand how to bring the
 

4969
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,070
is to understand how to bring the

4980
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:53,679
uh
 

4981
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:55,990
uh
you know from

01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
you know from
 

4983
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,950
you know from

archimedes is another example right so

5006
01:34:22,709 --> 01:34:22,719
archimedes is another example right so
 

5007
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,669
archimedes is another example right so
suddenly a flash of insight occurs

5008
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
suddenly a flash of insight occurs
 

5009
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,750
suddenly a flash of insight occurs
it's it's like

5010
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:27,760
it's it's like
 

5011
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,750
it's it's like
the

5012
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760
the
 

5013
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,149
the
constellation of all of these

5014
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:32,159
constellation of all of these
 

5015
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,550
constellation of all of these
simultaneous constraints that somehow or

5016
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:34,560
simultaneous constraints that somehow or
 

5017
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,990
simultaneous constraints that somehow or
other causes the mind to settle into a

5018
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,000
other causes the mind to settle into a
 

5019
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,189
other causes the mind to settle into a
novel state that it never did before and

5020
01:34:41,189 --> 01:34:41,199
novel state that it never did before and
 

5021
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,910
novel state that it never did before and
and give rise to a new idea

5022
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:43,920
and give rise to a new idea
 

5023
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,910
and give rise to a new idea
um that

5024
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:47,920

 

5025
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,070

you know then

5026
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,080
you know then
 

5027
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,070
you know then
you can say okay well now how can i

5028
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:52,080
you can say okay well now how can i
 

5029
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,790
you can say okay well now how can i
prove this you know how do i write down

5030
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:54,800
prove this you know how do i write down
 

5031
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,109
prove this you know how do i write down
the steps of that theorem

5032
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:57,119
the steps of that theorem
 

5033
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:59,430
the steps of that theorem
that that'll allow me to make it

5034
01:34:59,430 --> 01:34:59,440
that that'll allow me to make it
 

5035
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,310
that that'll allow me to make it
rigorous and certain

5036
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
rigorous and certain
 

5037
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,910
rigorous and certain
and so

5038
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
and so
 

5039
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,189
and so
i feel like the

5040
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:07,199

 

5041
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,030

the kinds of things that we're beginning

5042
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,040
the kinds of things that we're beginning
 

5043
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,629
the kinds of things that we're beginning
to see

5044
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:10,639
to see
 

5045
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:12,070
to see
um

5046
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:12,080
um
 

5047
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,189
um
deep learning systems do of their own

5048
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:15,199
deep learning systems do of their own
 

5049
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,750
deep learning systems do of their own

5050
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760

 

5051
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,870

kind of gives me

5052
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:20,880
kind of gives me
 

5053
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,229
kind of gives me
this feeling of

5054
01:35:22,229 --> 01:35:22,239
this feeling of
 

5055
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:25,669
this feeling of

encouragement that
 

5061
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,430
encouragement that
ultimately

5062
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,440
ultimately
 

5063
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,830
ultimately
it'll all

5069
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,109

many people now have have

5070
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:43,119
many people now have have
 

5071
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:45,030
many people now have have
become really interested in thinking

5072
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:45,040
become really interested in thinking
 

5073
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,229
become really interested in thinking
about

01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,950
can be given a prompt and they can then
sort of generate some

5089
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:09,270

um and

5090
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:09,280

 

5091
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,189

there's there's kind of like a sense

there's there's kind of like a sense
 

5093
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:13,350
there's there's kind of like a sense
that they've somehow synthesized

that they've somehow synthesized
 

5095
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,550
that they've somehow synthesized
something

5096
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:14,560
something
 

5097
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,109
something
like novel out of the

5098
01:36:17,109 --> 01:36:17,119
like novel out of the
 

5099
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:20,310
like novel out of the

01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:22,159
of the billions and billions of
 

5103
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:24,149
of the billions and billions of
experiences that went into the training

data
 

5107
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,669
data
that that gives rise to something like

5108
01:36:27,669 --> 01:36:27,679
that that gives rise to something like
 

5109
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:29,830
that that gives rise to something like
this sort of intuitive sense of what

5110
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:29,840
this sort of intuitive sense of what
 

5111
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,510
this sort of intuitive sense of what
would be a

5112
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:31,520
would be a
 

5113
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,590
would be a
a fun and interesting little story to

5114
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:33,600
a fun and interesting little story to
 

5115
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,590
a fun and interesting little story to
tell or something like that it just sort

01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:56,390
its own thoughts
and and to me that that sort of

5134
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
and and to me that that sort of
 

5135
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,470
and and to me that that sort of
represents the potential of capturing

5136
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:58,480
represents the potential of capturing
 

5137

this the intuitive side of this
 

5139
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,430
this the intuitive side of this
yeah and there's other examples i don't

01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:03,440
yeah and there's other examples i don't
 

5141

if you study chess the kind of solutions
 

5149
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,189
if you study chess the kind of solutions
that has come up in terms of chess it is

5150
01:37:15,189 --> 01:37:15,199
that has come up in terms of chess it is
 

5151
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:15,910
that has come up in terms of chess it is
it

5152
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:15,920
it
 

5153
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,550
it
there's novel ideas there it feels very

5154
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:18,560
there's novel ideas there it feels very
 

5155
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,709
there's novel ideas there it feels very
uh like there's brilliant moments of

5156
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
uh like there's brilliant moments of
 

5157
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:23,270
uh like there's brilliant moments of
insight and the

5158
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:23,280
insight and the
 

5159
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:26,470
insight and the
mechanism they use

5160
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:26,480
mechanism they use
 

5161
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,470
mechanism they use
if you think of search as

5162
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:28,480
if you think of search as
 

5163
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,109
if you think of search as
as maybe more towards good old-fashioned

5164
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:31,119
as maybe more towards good old-fashioned
 

5165
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,030
as maybe more towards good old-fashioned
ai and and then there's the connection

5166
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:33,040
ai and and then there's the connection
 

5167
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,350
ai and and then there's the connection
is the neural network that has the

5168
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:35,360
is the neural network that has the
 

5169
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,790
is the neural network that has the
intuition of

5170
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:36,800
intuition of
 

5171
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,030
intuition of
looking at a board looking at a set of

looking at a board looking at a set of
 

5173
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,510
looking at a board looking at a set of
patterns and saying how good is this set

01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,070
patterns and saying how good is this set
of positions and the next few positions

5176
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:44,080
of positions and the next few positions
 

5177
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,310
of positions and the next few positions
how good are those and that's it no

5178
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
how good are those and that's it no
 

5179
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,950
how good are those and that's it no
that's just an intuition uh yeah great

5180
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
that's just an intuition uh yeah great
 

5181
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,430
that's just an intuition uh yeah great

01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:27,840
yes and i think that
 

5217
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:33,350
yes and i think that
you know i think demas asabus is um

you know he's spoken about those things
 

5221
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,990
you know he's spoken about those things
he uh i heard him

5222
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:38,000
he uh i heard him

um
 

5241
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:02,229

5243
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:04,950

what i like to really emphasize

5244
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:04,960
what i like to really emphasize
 

5245
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,550
what i like to really emphasize
here is

5246
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:08,560

 

5247
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,390

one part of what i like to emphasize

5248
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:10,400
one part of what i like to emphasize
 

5249
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,629
one part of what i like to emphasize
about mathematical cognition at least is

5250
01:39:12,629 --> 01:39:12,639
about mathematical cognition at least is
 

5251
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:13,990
about mathematical cognition at least is
that

5252
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:14,000
that

01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,149
a little more than 3 000 years ago began
to develop

5264
01:39:28,149 --> 01:39:28,159
to develop
 

5265
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:30,950
to develop
these formal systems

5266
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:30,960
these formal systems
 

5267
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,470
these formal systems
and

5268
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:32,480
and
 

5269
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,350
and
gradually

5270
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:35,360

 

5271
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,950

the

01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,950
the
whole idea about

01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:41,600
thinking formally
 

5277
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,790
thinking formally
got constructed um

5278
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:44,800
got constructed um
 

5279
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,790
got constructed um
and you know it's preceded euclid

thinking in that way that you know we

5346
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:09,840
thinking in that way that you know we
 

5347
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,830
thinking in that way that you know we
now begin to think of our understanding

5348
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:11,840
now begin to think of our understanding
 

5349
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,910
now begin to think of our understanding
of language as being right so

5350
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:13,920
of language as being right so
 

5351
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,070
of language as being right so
we immerse ourselves in

5352
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:16,080
we immerse ourselves in
 

5353
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,870
we immerse ourselves in
in a particular language

5354
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:18,880
in a particular language
 

5355
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,030
in a particular language
in a particular world of objects and

5356
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:21,040
in a particular world of objects and
 

5357
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,109
in a particular world of objects and
their relationships and we learn to talk

5358
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:23,119
their relationships and we learn to talk
 

5359
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,629
their relationships and we learn to talk
about that

5360
01:41:24,629 --> 01:41:24,639
about that
 

5361
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:27,189
about that
and we develop intuitive understanding

5362
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:27,199
and we develop intuitive understanding
 

5363
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,109
and we develop intuitive understanding
of the real world

5364
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:29,119
of the real world
 

5365
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:32,470
of the real world
in in a similar way we can think that

5366
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,480
in in a similar way we can think that
 

5367
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,149
in in a similar way we can think that
what

that's been invented by humans would you
say it's more fundamental than like

bring chomps get back into the

5422
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:35,920
bring chomps get back into the
 

5423
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,870
bring chomps get back into the
conversation

5424
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:38,880

 

5425
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,870

first of all is it unfair to draw a line

5426
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:40,880
first of all is it unfair to draw a line
 

5427
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,350
first of all is it unfair to draw a line
between mathematical

5428
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:43,360
between mathematical
 

5429
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,430
between mathematical
cognition and

5430
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:45,440
cognition and
 

5431
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,030
cognition and

5432
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:47,040

5433
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,350
language
linguistic cognition i think that's a

5434
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:49,360
linguistic cognition i think that's a
 

5435
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,910
linguistic cognition i think that's a
very interesting question

5436
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:51,920
very interesting question
 

5437
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,990
very interesting question
and i think um it's one of the ones that

5438
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:54,000
and i think um it's one of the ones that
 

5439
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,590
and i think um it's one of the ones that
i'm actually very interested in right

5440
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:55,600
i'm actually very interested in right
 

5441
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,950
i'm actually very interested in right
now

5442
01:42:58,950 --> 01:42:58,960

 

5443
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,149

but i i think the answer is

5444
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:02,159
but i i think the answer is
 

5445
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,390
but i i think the answer is
in important ways

5446
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:04,400
in important ways
 

5447
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,750
in important ways
it is important to draw that line

5448
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:07,760
it is important to draw that line
 

5449
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,270
it is important to draw that line
but then to come back and look at it

5450
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:09,280
but then to come back and look at it
 

5451
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,950
but then to come back and look at it
again and see

5452
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:10,960
again and see
 

5453
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,550
again and see
some of the subtleties and interesting

5454
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:12,560
some of the subtleties and interesting
 

5455
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:18,390
some of the subtleties and interesting
aspects of the difference

5456
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:18,400

 

5457
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,350

so

5458
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:21,360

 

5459
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,950

if we think

5460
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:22,960
if we think
 

5461
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:29,189
if we think
about chomsky himself

5462
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:29,199

 

5463
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:31,750

he

5464
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:31,760

 

5465
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,109

was born into an academic family his

5466
01:43:35,109 --> 01:43:35,119
was born into an academic family his
 

5467
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,270
was born into an academic family his
father was a professor of rabbinical

01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:37,280
father was a professor of rabbinical
 

5469
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:41,109
father was a professor of rabbinical
studies at a small rabbinical college in

01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:44,550
studies at a small rabbinical college in
philadelphia

5472
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560

 

5473
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,590

and

5474
01:43:45,590 --> 01:43:45,600
and
 

5475
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,990
and
he was deeply enculturated in

5476
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:50,000
he was deeply enculturated in
 

5477
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,709
he was deeply enculturated in
uh

5478
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:52,719
uh
 

5479
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:56,629
uh
you know a culture of thought and reason

5480
01:43:56,629 --> 01:43:56,639
you know a culture of thought and reason
 

5481
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,229
you know a culture of thought and reason
and

5482
01:43:58,229 --> 01:43:58,239
and
 

5483
01:43:58,239 --> 01:43:59,270
and
brought

5484
01:43:59,270 --> 01:43:59,280
brought
 

5485
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,790
brought
to the

5486
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:00,800
to the
 

5487
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,709
to the
effort to understand natural language

5488
01:44:04,709 --> 01:44:04,719
effort to understand natural language
 

5489
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:05,669
effort to understand natural language
this

5490
01:44:05,669 --> 01:44:05,679
this
 

5491
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:07,750
this
profound engagement with these formal

5492
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:07,760
profound engagement with these formal
 

5493
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,270
profound engagement with these formal
systems

5494
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:09,280
systems
 

5495
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,629
systems
and um

5496
01:44:10,629 --> 01:44:10,639
and um
 

5497
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:12,950
and um
you know

5498
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:12,960
you know
 

5499
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,550
you know
i think that

5500
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:16,560

 

5501
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,790

there was tremendous power in that and

5502
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:18,800
there was tremendous power in that and
 

5503
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,870
there was tremendous power in that and
that chomsky had some amazing insights

5504
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:22,880
that chomsky had some amazing insights
 

5505
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,189
that chomsky had some amazing insights
into the structure of natural language

5506
01:44:27,189 --> 01:44:27,199

 

5507
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:27,990

but

5508
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:28,000
but
 

5509
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,430
but
that

5510
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:29,440
that
 

5511
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,310
that
i'm going to use the word but there

5512
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:32,320
i'm going to use the word but there
 

5513
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,270
i'm going to use the word but there
the actual intuitive knowledge of these

5514
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:35,280
the actual intuitive knowledge of these
 

5515
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,790
the actual intuitive knowledge of these
things only goes so far and does not go

5516
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:38,800
things only goes so far and does not go
 

5517
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,910
things only goes so far and does not go
as far as it does in people like chomsky

5518
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:41,920
as far as it does in people like chomsky
 

5519
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,270
as far as it does in people like chomsky
himself

5520
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,280
himself
 

5521
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,109
himself
and this was something that was

5522
01:44:45,109 --> 01:44:45,119
and this was something that was
 

5523
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:48,149
and this was something that was
discovered in the phd dissertation of

5524
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:48,159
discovered in the phd dissertation of
 

5525
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:50,229
discovered in the phd dissertation of
lila gleitman who was actually trained

5526
01:44:50,229 --> 01:44:50,239
lila gleitman who was actually trained
 

5527
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:52,149
lila gleitman who was actually trained
in the same linguistics department with

5528
01:44:52,149 --> 01:44:52,159
in the same linguistics department with
 

5529
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:53,990
in the same linguistics department with
chomsky

5530
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
chomsky
 

5531
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,669
chomsky
so what lila discovered

5532
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:57,679
so what lila discovered
 

5533
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:59,510
so what lila discovered
was that

5534
01:44:59,510 --> 01:44:59,520
was that
 

5535
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,669
was that
the intuitions that linguists had

5536
01:45:03,669 --> 01:45:03,679
the intuitions that linguists had
 

5537
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:05,189
the intuitions that linguists had
about

5538
01:45:05,189 --> 01:45:05,199
about
 

5539
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:09,270
about
even the meaning of a phrase

5540
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:09,280

 

5541
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,669

not just about its grammar but about

5542
01:45:11,669 --> 01:45:11,679
not just about its grammar but about
 

5543
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:14,070
not just about its grammar but about
what they thought a phrase

5544
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:14,080
what they thought a phrase
 

5545
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,590
what they thought a phrase
must mean

5546
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:15,600
must mean
 

5547
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,709

were very different from the intuitions

5548
01:45:18,709 --> 01:45:18,719
were very different from the intuitions
 

5549
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:19,669

this when i myself was a phd student at

5562
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:32,480
this when i myself was a phd student at
 

5563
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:35,030
this when i myself was a phd student at

i never knew how to put it together with

all of my other thinking about these
 

5571
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:40,229
all of my other thinking about these
things so

human mind without that immersion that's
 

5619
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:45,669
human mind without that immersion that's
fascinating so the different fields and

5620
01:46:45,669 --> 01:46:45,679
fascinating so the different fields and
 

5621
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:47,990
fascinating so the different fields and
approaches with which you start to study

5622
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,000
approaches with which you start to study
 

5623
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,070
approaches with which you start to study
the mind actually take you

5624
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,080
the mind actually take you
 

5625
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,709
the mind actually take you
away from the natural operation of the

01:46:52,709 --> 01:46:52,719
away from the natural operation of the
 

5627
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:54,709
away from the natural operation of the
mind so it makes it very difficult for

5628
01:46:54,709 --> 01:46:54,719
mind so it makes it very difficult for
 

5629
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,870

uh that is what i believe

so and that's limiting

it's something to be aware of
 

5681
01:47:58,159 --> 01:47:59,990
it's something to be aware of
does that limit you from uh

01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,000
does that limit you from uh

linguistics so i mean what what is that

5690
01:48:09,669 --> 01:48:09,679
linguistics so i mean what what is that
 

5691
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:12,709
linguistics so i mean what what is that
line then what um

5692
01:48:12,709 --> 01:48:12,719
line then what um
 

5693
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,870
line then what um
so is chomsky unable to sneak up to the

5694
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:14,880
so is chomsky unable to sneak up to the
 

5695
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,790
so is chomsky unable to sneak up to the
full picture of cognition are you when

5696
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:16,800
full picture of cognition are you when
 

5697
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,950
full picture of cognition are you when
you're focusing on mathematical

5698
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:18,960
you're focusing on mathematical
 

5699
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,870
you're focusing on mathematical
uh thinking are you also unable to do so

5700
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:22,880
uh thinking are you also unable to do so
 

5701
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,550
uh thinking are you also unable to do so
i think you're you're right i think

5702
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:24,560
i think you're you're right i think
 

5703
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:26,950
i think you're you're right i think
that's a great way of characterizing it

5704
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:26,960
that's a great way of characterizing it
 

5705
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,470
that's a great way of characterizing it
and um

5706
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:30,480

 

5707
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,590

i also think that

5708
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:33,600
i also think that
 

5709
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,590
i also think that
um it's related to

5710
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:35,600
um it's related to
 

5711
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,510
um it's related to
um the concept of beginner's mind uh

5712
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:39,520
um the concept of beginner's mind uh
 

5713
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,990
um the concept of beginner's mind uh
and um

5714
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:42,000
and um
 

5715
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,109
and um
another concept called the expert blind

5716
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:45,119
another concept called the expert blind
 

5717
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,990
another concept called the expert blind
spot so

5718
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,000
spot so
 

5719
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,070
spot so
the expert blind spot is much more

5720
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:50,080
the expert blind spot is much more
 

5721
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,790
the expert blind spot is much more
prosaic seeming than than this

5722
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:52,800
prosaic seeming than than this
 

5723
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,109
prosaic seeming than than this

it's something that plagues

01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:57,760
it's something that plagues
 

5727
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,430
it's something that plagues
experts

5728
01:48:59,430 --> 01:48:59,440

5729
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,510

01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:01,520
when they try to communicate their
 

5731
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,310
when they try to communicate their
understanding to non-experts and that is

5732
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:04,320
understanding to non-experts and that is
 

5733
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,870

have those systems so so this is just an
 

5829
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,750
have those systems so so this is just an
example to me

geometry and those kinds of relations so
 

5841
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,669
geometry and those kinds of relations so
become so second nature that you don't

what are the limitations of your mind
are how is your mind less powerful than

6018
01:54:44,709 --> 01:54:44,719

 

6019
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:46,950

aren't necessarily
 

6021
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:50,310
aren't necessarily
um

6022
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:50,320

 

6023
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,390

actually

6024
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:52,400
actually

01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,470
actually
part of the causal process that caused

01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:54,480
part of the causal process that caused
 

6027
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,790
part of the causal process that caused
that behavior to occur

6028
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:56,800
that behavior to occur
 

6029
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,669
that behavior to occur
or even

6030
01:54:59,669 --> 01:54:59,679
or even
 

6031
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:02,149
or even
valid observations of the set of

6032
01:55:02,149 --> 01:55:02,159
valid observations of the set of
 

6033
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:04,470
valid observations of the set of
constraints that led to the outcome

6034
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:04,480
constraints that led to the outcome
 

6035
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,109
constraints that led to the outcome
but they are post-hoc rationalizations

6036
01:55:07,109 --> 01:55:07,119
but they are post-hoc rationalizations
 

6037
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:09,990
but they are post-hoc rationalizations
that we can give based on

6038
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:10,000
that we can give based on
 

6039
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,709
that we can give based on
information at our disposal about what

6040
01:55:12,709 --> 01:55:12,719
information at our disposal about what
 

6041
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:14,950
information at our disposal about what
might have contributed to

6042
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:14,960
might have contributed to
 

6043
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,270
might have contributed to
the result that we came to

6044
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,280
the result that we came to
 

6045
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:18,950
the result that we came to
when asked

6046
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:18,960
when asked
 

6047
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,390
when asked
and um so this this is an idea that

6048
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:22,400
and um so this this is an idea that
 

6049
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,149
and um so this this is an idea that
was introduced in a

6050
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:24,159
was introduced in a
 

6051
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:26,310
was introduced in a
very important paper

6052
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:26,320
very important paper
 

6053
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:29,189
very important paper
by nisbet and wilson about

6054
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:29,199
by nisbet and wilson about
 

6055
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:31,910
by nisbet and wilson about
you know the limits on our ability to to

6056
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:31,920
you know the limits on our ability to to
 

6057
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,910
you know the limits on our ability to to
uh be aware of

6058
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:33,920
uh be aware of
 

6059
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,430
uh be aware of
the factors

6060
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:35,440
the factors
 

6061
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,750
the factors
that cause us to make the choices that

6062
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:37,760
that cause us to make the choices that
 

6063
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,189
that cause us to make the choices that
we make

6064
01:55:39,189 --> 01:55:39,199
we make
 

6065
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:42,470
we make
um and um

6066
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:42,480
um and um
 

6067
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:43,910
um and um
you know

you know
 

6069
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:45,109
you know
i think it's

6073
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,390

it's something that we really ought to

6074
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:50,400
it's something that we really ought to
 

6075
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,390
it's something that we really ought to
be much more

6076
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:52,400
be much more
 

6077
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:53,189
be much more

kappa and i went to the phi beta kappa

6352
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:54,320
kappa and i went to the phi beta kappa
 

6353
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,229
kappa and i went to the phi beta kappa
in the ceremony and this guy came up now

6354
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
in the ceremony and this guy came up now
 

6355
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:58,870
in the ceremony and this guy came up now
he said oh are you magnar summa

6356
02:00:58,870 --> 02:00:58,880
he said oh are you magnar summa
 

6357
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,430
he said oh are you magnar summa
i wasn't even getting honors based on my

6358
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:01,440
i wasn't even getting honors based on my
 

6359
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,149
i wasn't even getting honors based on my
grades they just happened to have

grades they just happened to have
 

6361
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:07,109
grades they just happened to have
thought i was interested enough in ideas

6362
02:01:07,109 --> 02:01:07,119
thought i was interested enough in ideas
 

6363
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:09,430
thought i was interested enough in ideas
to belong to phi beta kappa so

6364
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:09,440
to belong to phi beta kappa so
 

6365
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,270
to belong to phi beta kappa so
i mean would it be fair to say you kind

6366
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:11,280
i mean would it be fair to say you kind
 

6367
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:14,790
i mean would it be fair to say you kind
of stumbled around a little bit

6368
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:14,800
of stumbled around a little bit
 

6369
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,470
of stumbled around a little bit
through accidents of

6370
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:16,480
through accidents of
 

6371
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,350
through accidents of
too early morning of classes in physics

6372
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:19,360
too early morning of classes in physics
 

6373
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,430
too early morning of classes in physics
and so on until you discovered intrinsic

6374
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:21,440
and so on until you discovered intrinsic
 

6375
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:23,990
and so on until you discovered intrinsic
motivation as you mentioned and then

6376
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:24,000
motivation as you mentioned and then
 

6377
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,750
motivation as you mentioned and then
that's it it hooked you and then you

6378

that's it it hooked you and then you
 

6379
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:28,229
that's it it hooked you and then you
celebrate the fact that this happens to

6380
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:28,239
celebrate the fact that this happens to
 

6381
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:29,750
celebrate the fact that this happens to
you human beings

yeah like and what is it that made
 

6385
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:35,669
yeah like and what is it that made
what i did intrinsically motivating to

02:01:35,669 --> 02:01:35,679
what i did intrinsically motivating to
 

6387
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:37,189

me

6388
02:01:37,189 --> 02:01:37,199
me
 

6389
02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:39,189
me
well that's interesting and i don't know

6423
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:24,149
you were told to do in lab class but in
psychology we were already like even

02:02:24,149 --> 02:02:24,159
psychology we were already like even
 

6425
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:25,830
psychology we were already like even
when i was taking psych one it turned

6426
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:25,840
when i was taking psych one it turned
 

6427
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:28,470
when i was taking psych one it turned
out we had our own rat and we got to

6428
02:02:28,470 --> 02:02:28,480
out we had our own rat and we got to
 

6429
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,189
out we had our own rat and we got to
after two set experiments we got to okay

6430
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:31,199
after two set experiments we got to okay
 

6431
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:33,270
after two set experiments we got to okay
do something you think of you know with

6432
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:33,280
do something you think of you know with
 

6433
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,510
do something you think of you know with
your rat you know so

6434
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:35,520
your rat you know so
 

6435
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,470
your rat you know so
it's the opportunity to do it myself

6436
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:38,480
it's the opportunity to do it myself
 

6437
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:41,589
it's the opportunity to do it myself
yeah and and to to bring together a

6438
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
yeah and and to to bring together a
 

6439
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,310
yeah and and to to bring together a
certain set of things that that engaged

6440
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:44,320
certain set of things that that engaged
 

6441
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,470
certain set of things that that engaged
me intrinsically

6442
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:46,480
me intrinsically
 

6443
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,390
me intrinsically
and and i think it it has something to

6444
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:48,400
and and i think it it has something to
 

6445

you know profoundly
 

6451
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:55,589
you know profoundly
um

6452
02:02:55,589 --> 02:02:55,599
um
 

6453
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:56,870
um
amazing

6454
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:56,880
amazing
 

6455
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:59,189
amazing
musical geniuses right they get immersed

6456
02:02:59,189 --> 02:02:59,199
musical geniuses right they get immersed
 

6457
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:01,589
musical geniuses right they get immersed
in it at an early enough point

6458
02:03:01,589 --> 02:03:01,599
in it at an early enough point
 

6459
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,709
in it at an early enough point
and it just sort of gets into the fabric

6460
02:03:04,709 --> 02:03:04,719
and it just sort of gets into the fabric
 

6461
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:07,030
and it just sort of gets into the fabric
so my my little brother had intrinsic

6462
02:03:07,030 --> 02:03:07,040
so my my little brother had intrinsic
 

6463
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:10,070
so my my little brother had intrinsic
motivation for music as we witnessed

6464
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:10,080
motivation for music as we witnessed
 

6465
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:11,750
motivation for music as we witnessed
when he discovered

6466
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:11,760
when he discovered
 

6467
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:12,870
when he discovered
how

6468
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:12,880
how
 

6469
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:15,990
how
to put records on the phonograph when he

6470
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:16,000
to put records on the phonograph when he
 

6471
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,030
to put records on the phonograph when he
was like 13 months old and recognize

6472
02:03:19,030 --> 02:03:19,040
was like 13 months old and recognize
 

6473
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,030
was like 13 months old and recognize
which one he wanted to play not because

6474
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:21,040
which one he wanted to play not because
 

6475
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,709
which one he wanted to play not because
he could read the labels because he

6476
02:03:22,709 --> 02:03:22,719
he could read the labels because he
 

6477
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:24,790
he could read the labels because he
could sort of see which ones had which

6478
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:24,800
could sort of see which ones had which
 

6479
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,950
could sort of see which ones had which
scratches which were the different you

6480
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:26,960
scratches which were the different you
 

6481
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,030
scratches which were the different you
know oh that's rapidly espanol and

6482
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,040
know oh that's rapidly espanol and
 

6483
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:31,669
know oh that's rapidly espanol and
that's oh wow you know and and and he

6484
02:03:31,669 --> 02:03:31,679
that's oh wow you know and and and he
 

6485
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:33,109
that's oh wow you know and and and he
enjoyed that that connected with him

6486
02:03:33,109 --> 02:03:33,119
enjoyed that that connected with him
 

6487
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:35,109
enjoyed that that connected with him
somehow yeah and and there was something

6488

something
 

6591
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,910
something
maybe this is where the more

6592
02:05:25,910 --> 02:05:25,920
maybe this is where the more
 

6593
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:26,790
maybe this is where the more
uh

6594
02:05:26,790 --> 02:05:26,800
uh
 

6595
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:28,229
uh
sort of the genetic part comes in

6596
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:28,239
sort of the genetic part comes in
 

6597
02:05:28,239 --> 02:05:29,990
sort of the genetic part comes in
sometimes i think uh

6598
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:30,000
sometimes i think uh
 

6599
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,470
sometimes i think uh
you know something in him resonated to

6600
02:05:32,470 --> 02:05:32,480
you know something in him resonated to
 

6601
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:35,750
you know something in him resonated to
the music so that that the synergy of

6602
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:35,760
the music so that that the synergy of
 

6603

the music so that that the synergy of
the combination of that was so powerful

6604
02:05:38,390 --> 02:05:38,400
the combination of that was so powerful
 

6605
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,229
the combination of that was so powerful
so so that's what i really consider to

so so that's what i really consider to
 

6607
02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:42,310
so so that's what i really consider to
be the mozart effect it's sort of the

6608
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:42,320
be the mozart effect it's sort of the
 

6609
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,870
be the mozart effect it's sort of the
the synergy of something

6610
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:44,880
the synergy of something
 

6611
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:47,830
the synergy of something
with with experience that that then

6612
02:05:47,830 --> 02:05:47,840
with with experience that that then
 

6613
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:49,910
with with experience that that then
results in the unique flowering of a

in
you know water conservation well before

6650
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:24,400
you know water conservation well before
 

6651
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:25,669
you know water conservation well before
it was a

6652
02:06:25,669 --> 02:06:25,679
it was a
 

6653
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:27,510

and you can be excited about it
 

6679
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:52,390
and you can be excited about it
so people can be excited about fitting

6680
02:06:52,390 --> 02:06:52,400
so people can be excited about fitting
 

6681

people on bicycles as well as excited
about making neural networks achieve

6684
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:56,320
about making neural networks achieve
 

6685
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,470
about making neural networks achieve
insights into human cognition right yeah

people around me and also been excited
 

6701
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:16,149
people around me and also been excited
about robots

6702
02:07:16,149 --> 02:07:16,159
about robots
 

6703
02:07:16,159 --> 02:07:18,550
about robots
and there's something in me that thinks

6704
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:18,560
and there's something in me that thinks
 

6705

i really would love to explore how those
 

6707
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,870
i really would love to explore how those
two things combine it doesn't make any

6708

two things combine it doesn't make any
 

6709

two things combine it doesn't make any
sense a lot of it is also timing just to

6710
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:25,760
sense a lot of it is also timing just to
 

6711
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:27,350
sense a lot of it is also timing just to
think of your own career in your own

pieces

6716
02:07:30,550 --> 02:07:30,560
pieces
 

6717
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,030
pieces
places that happen to involve some of

6718
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:33,040
places that happen to involve some of
 

6719
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:35,430
places that happen to involve some of
the greatest thinkers of our time and so

6720
02:07:35,430 --> 02:07:35,440
the greatest thinkers of our time and so
 

6721
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,270
the greatest thinkers of our time and so
it just worked out that like you guys

6722
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:37,280
it just worked out that like you guys
 

6723
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,910
it just worked out that like you guys
developed those ideas and there may be a

6724
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:39,920
developed those ideas and there may be a
 

6725
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,750
developed those ideas and there may be a
lot of other people similar to you and

6726
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:41,760
lot of other people similar to you and
 

6727
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:44,229
lot of other people similar to you and
they were brilliant and they never found

6728
02:07:44,229 --> 02:07:44,239
they were brilliant and they never found
 

6729
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:46,229
they were brilliant and they never found
that right connection and place to where

6730
02:07:46,229 --> 02:07:46,239
that right connection and place to where
 

6731
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:48,790
that right connection and place to where
they their ideas could flourish so it's

6732
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:48,800
they their ideas could flourish so it's
 

6733
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,390
they their ideas could flourish so it's
timing its place

6734
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:50,400
timing its place
 

6735
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:51,589
timing its place
it's people

6736
02:07:51,589 --> 02:07:51,599
it's people
 

6737
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:53,910
it's people
and uh ultimately the whole ride you

and uh ultimately the whole ride you
 

6739
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:56,470
and uh ultimately the whole ride you
know it's uh undirected

6740

can ask you about something you
 

6743
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,350
can ask you about something you
mentioned in terms of psychiatry when

02:07:59,350 --> 02:07:59,360
mentioned in terms of psychiatry when
 

6745
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:00,629
mentioned in terms of psychiatry when
you were younger

6746

you were younger
 

6747
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:03,750
you were younger
because i had a similar experience

psychiatry ideas
and that was a dream for me early on in

6762
02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:15,199
and that was a dream for me early on in
 

6763
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:16,629
and that was a dream for me early on in
high school to

6764
02:08:16,629 --> 02:08:16,639
high school to
 

6765
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:18,709
high school to
uh like i hope to understand the human

6766
02:08:18,709 --> 02:08:18,719
uh like i hope to understand the human
 

6767
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:20,790
uh like i hope to understand the human
mind by

6768
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:20,800
mind by
 

6769
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,069
mind by
i somehow psychiatry felt like

6770
02:08:24,069 --> 02:08:24,079
i somehow psychiatry felt like
 

6771
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:27,030
i somehow psychiatry felt like
the right discipline for that

6772
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
the right discipline for that
 

6773
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,589
the right discipline for that
does that make you sad that psychiatry

6774
02:08:29,589 --> 02:08:29,599
does that make you sad that psychiatry
 

6775
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:31,350
does that make you sad that psychiatry
is not

6776
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:31,360
is not
 

6777
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:34,470
is not

6778
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:34,480
the the mechanism by which you want to
 

6779
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:36,229
the the mechanism by which you want to
are able to explore the human mind so

6780
02:08:36,229 --> 02:08:36,239
are able to explore the human mind so
 

6781
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:38,870
are able to explore the human mind so
for me i was a little bit disillusioned

6782
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:38,880
for me i was a little bit disillusioned
 

6783
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:39,910
for me i was a little bit disillusioned
because

6784
02:08:39,910 --> 02:08:39,920
because
 

6785
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:42,629
because
of how much

6786
02:08:42,629 --> 02:08:42,639
of how much

02:08:42,639 --> 02:08:45,430
of how much
prescription medication and biochemistry

6788
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:45,440
prescription medication and biochemistry
 

6789
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,790
prescription medication and biochemistry
is involved in the discipline of

6790
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:46,800
is involved in the discipline of
 

6791
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:49,189
is involved in the discipline of
psychiatry as opposed to the dream of

6792
02:08:49,189 --> 02:08:49,199
psychiatry as opposed to the dream of
 

6793
02:08:49,199 --> 02:08:51,350
psychiatry as opposed to the dream of
the the freud like

6794
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:51,360
the the freud like
 

6795
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:54,629
the the freud like
use the mechanisms of language to

6796
02:08:54,629 --> 02:08:54,639
use the mechanisms of language to
 

6797
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:56,950
use the mechanisms of language to
explore the human mind so that was a

6798
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:56,960
explore the human mind so that was a
 

6799
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:58,709
explore the human mind so that was a
little disappointing

6800
02:08:58,709 --> 02:08:58,719
little disappointing
 

6801
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:00,550
little disappointing
and and that's why i kind of went to

6802
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:00,560
and and that's why i kind of went to
 

6803
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:02,229
and and that's why i kind of went to
computer science and thinking like maybe

6804
02:09:02,229 --> 02:09:02,239
computer science and thinking like maybe
 

6805
02:09:02,239 --> 02:09:04,390
computer science and thinking like maybe
you can explore the human mind by trying

6806
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:04,400
you can explore the human mind by trying
 

6807
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,310
you can explore the human mind by trying
to build the thing

6808
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:06,320
to build the thing
 

6809
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:10,390
to build the thing
yes i wasn't exposed to the um

02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:18,400
that point because um i didn't
 

6817
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:20,229

i dropped out of that whole

i dropped out of that whole
 

6819
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:22,390
i dropped out of that whole
idea the physical pre-med that i never

idea the physical pre-med that i never
 

6821
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:24,470
idea the physical pre-med that i never
even found out about that until much

6822
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:24,480
even found out about that until much
 

6823
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,510
even found out about that until much
later

um at that time the man who came in
as the new director i had been on this

6848

as the new director i had been on this
 

6849
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:58,830
as the new director i had been on this
board for a year when he came in

6850
02:09:58,830 --> 02:09:58,840
board for a year when he came in
 

6851
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:02,790
board for a year when he came in
um okay

6852
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:02,800
um okay
 

6853
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,030

cancer and that's what we're going to do
 

6861
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:13,910
cancer and that's what we're going to do
with schizophrenia we're going to find

6862
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:13,920
with schizophrenia we're going to find
 

6863
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:15,589
with schizophrenia we're going to find
the medications

6864
02:10:15,589 --> 02:10:15,599
the medications
 

6865
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:17,990
the medications
that are going to cure this disease

6866
02:10:17,990 --> 02:10:18,000
that are going to cure this disease
 

6867
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,109
that are going to cure this disease
and we're not going to listen to

6868
02:10:19,109 --> 02:10:19,119
and we're not going to listen to

you know
 

6873
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:27,189
you know
good old behavioral psychology is not

6874
02:10:27,189 --> 02:10:27,199
good old behavioral psychology is not
 

6875
02:10:27,199 --> 02:10:29,589
good old behavioral psychology is not
something we're going to support any

6876
02:10:29,589 --> 02:10:29,599
something we're going to support any
 

6877
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:32,069
something we're going to support any
further and um

6878
02:10:32,069 --> 02:10:32,079
further and um
 

6879
02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:33,910
further and um
you know he

6880
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:33,920
you know he
 

6881
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:37,589
you know he
he uh

6882
02:10:37,589 --> 02:10:37,599

 

6883
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:40,229

completely alienated me from the

6884
02:10:40,229 --> 02:10:40,239
completely alienated me from the
 

6885
02:10:40,239 --> 02:10:42,550
completely alienated me from the
institute and from all of its prior

6886
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:42,560
institute and from all of its prior
 

6887
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,390
institute and from all of its prior
policies which had been much more

6888
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:44,400
policies which had been much more
 

6889
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:47,750
policies which had been much more
holistic i think really at some level

6890
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:47,760
holistic i think really at some level
 

6891
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,390
holistic i think really at some level
and and basically and the the other

6892
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:50,400
and and basically and the the other
 

6893
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:51,990
and and basically and the the other
people on the board were like

6894
02:10:51,990 --> 02:10:52,000
people on the board were like
 

6895
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,470
people on the board were like
psychiatrists right

6896
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:54,480
psychiatrists right
 

6897
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:55,270
psychiatrists right
uh

6898
02:10:55,270 --> 02:10:55,280
uh
 

6899
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:57,430
uh
very biological psychiatrist it didn't

6900
02:10:57,430 --> 02:10:57,440
very biological psychiatrist it didn't
 

6901
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:00,149
very biological psychiatrist it didn't
pan out right that that that

6902
02:11:00,149 --> 02:11:00,159
pan out right that that that
 

6903
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:03,430
pan out right that that that
nothing has changed in in our ability to

6904
02:11:03,430 --> 02:11:03,440
nothing has changed in in our ability to
 

6905
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,229
nothing has changed in in our ability to
uh

6906
02:11:04,229 --> 02:11:04,239
uh
 

6907
02:11:04,239 --> 02:11:07,030
uh
to help people with mental illness uh

6908
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:07,040
to help people with mental illness uh
 

6909
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,470
to help people with mental illness uh
and um

6910
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:08,480
and um
 

6911
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:11,189
and um
so 20 years later that that that

6912
02:11:11,189 --> 02:11:11,199
so 20 years later that that that
 

6913
02:11:11,199 --> 02:11:13,589
so 20 years later that that that
particular path uh was a dead end as far

6914
02:11:13,589 --> 02:11:13,599
particular path uh was a dead end as far
 

6915
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:15,030
particular path uh was a dead end as far
as i can tell

6916
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:15,040
as i can tell
 

6917
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:16,950
as i can tell
well there's some aspect to

6918
02:11:16,950 --> 02:11:16,960
well there's some aspect to
 

6919
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:18,870
well there's some aspect to
and sorry to romanticize

6920
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:18,880
and sorry to romanticize
 

6921
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,709
and sorry to romanticize
the whole philosophical conversation

6922
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,719
the whole philosophical conversation
 

6923
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:23,270
the whole philosophical conversation
about the human mind but to me

6924
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:23,280
about the human mind but to me
 

6925
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:25,510
about the human mind but to me
psychiatrists for time

6926
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:25,520
psychiatrists for time
 

6927
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:27,830
psychiatrists for time
held the flag of

6928
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:27,840
held the flag of
 

6929
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:29,910
held the flag of
we're the deep thinkers

6930
02:11:29,910 --> 02:11:29,920
we're the deep thinkers
 

6931
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:31,669
we're the deep thinkers
in the same way that physicists are the

6932
02:11:31,669 --> 02:11:31,679
in the same way that physicists are the
 

6933
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:33,270
in the same way that physicists are the
deep thinkers about the nature of

6934
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:33,280
deep thinkers about the nature of
 

6935
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:35,510
deep thinkers about the nature of
reality psychiatrists are the deep

6936
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:35,520
reality psychiatrists are the deep
 

6937
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,109
reality psychiatrists are the deep
thinkers about the nature of the human

6938
02:11:37,109 --> 02:11:37,119
thinkers about the nature of the human
 

6939
02:11:37,119 --> 02:11:39,189
thinkers about the nature of the human
mind and i think that flag has been

6940
02:11:39,189 --> 02:11:39,199
mind and i think that flag has been
 

6941
02:11:39,199 --> 02:11:41,750
mind and i think that flag has been
taken from them and carried by people

6942
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:41,760
taken from them and carried by people
 

6943
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:42,950
taken from them and carried by people
like you

6944
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:42,960
like you
 

6945
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,950
like you
it's like it's more in the cognitive

6946
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:44,960
it's like it's more in the cognitive
 

6947
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,069
it's like it's more in the cognitive
psychology

6948
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:46,079
psychology
 

6949
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:48,149
psychology
especially when you have a foot in the

6950
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:48,159
especially when you have a foot in the
 

6951
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:50,149
especially when you have a foot in the
computational view of the world because

6952
02:11:50,149 --> 02:11:50,159
computational view of the world because
 

6953
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:52,310
computational view of the world because
you can both build it you can like

6954
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:52,320
you can both build it you can like
 

6955
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,310
you can both build it you can like
intuit about the functioning of the mind

6956
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,320
intuit about the functioning of the mind
 

6957
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,229
intuit about the functioning of the mind
by building little models

6958
02:11:56,229 --> 02:11:56,239
by building little models
 

6959
02:11:56,239 --> 02:11:57,910
by building little models
and be able to say mathematical things

6960
02:11:57,910 --> 02:11:57,920
and be able to say mathematical things
 

6961
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:59,189
and be able to say mathematical things
and then deploying those models

6962

and then deploying those models
 

6963
02:11:59,199 --> 02:12:01,750
and then deploying those models
especially in computers to say does this

especially in computers to say does this
 

6965
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,030
especially in computers to say does this

they do a little like

6968
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:04,840
they do a little like
 

6969
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:07,189
they do a little like
experiments and then some combination of

6970
02:12:07,189 --> 02:12:07,199
experiments and then some combination of
 

6971
02:12:07,199 --> 02:12:09,109
experiments and then some combination of
neuroscience where you're starting to

uh
 

6983
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:18,870
uh
the brain is actually functioning and

6984
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:18,880
the brain is actually functioning and
 

6985
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,510
the brain is actually functioning and
there using intuition you can start

6986
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:21,520
there using intuition you can start

02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:27,360
a cognitive psychologist can become the
 

6993
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:29,430
a cognitive psychologist can become the
philosopher and psychiatrists become

6994

philosopher and psychiatrists become
 

6995
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:31,350
philosopher and psychiatrists become
much more like doctors they're like very

6996
02:12:31,350 --> 02:12:31,360
much more like doctors they're like very
 

6997
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,669
much more like doctors they're like very
medical they help people with medication

6998
02:12:33,669 --> 02:12:33,679
medical they help people with medication
 

6999
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:35,990
medical they help people with medication
by biochemistry and so on but they are

7000
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,000
by biochemistry and so on but they are
 

7001
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,589
by biochemistry and so on but they are
no longer the

no longer the
 

7003
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:39,510
no longer the

thread i i found more of it in
 

7035
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:19,189

sociology and literature than i did in
 

7037
02:13:19,199 --> 02:13:22,470

that got resolved when i went to

02:14:18,870 --> 02:14:18,880
that got resolved when i went to
 

7089
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,629
that got resolved when i went to
graduate school and i discovered

graduate school and i discovered
 

7091
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:23,270
graduate school and i discovered
cognitive psychology and and so for me

02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:43,189
so you mentioned the human condition
speaking which

7174
02:15:43,189 --> 02:15:43,199
speaking which
 

7175
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:45,109
speaking which
you happen to be a human being who is

7176
02:15:45,109 --> 02:15:45,119
you happen to be a human being who is
 

7177
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:47,030
you happen to be a human being who is
unfortunately

7178
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:47,040
unfortunately
 

7179
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,430
unfortunately
not immortal

7180
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:49,440
not immortal
 

7181
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,750
not immortal
that seems to be a fundamental part of

7182
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:51,760
that seems to be a fundamental part of
 

7183
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:54,629
that seems to be a fundamental part of
the human condition that this riot ends

7184
02:15:54,629 --> 02:15:54,639
the human condition that this riot ends
 

7185
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:57,430
the human condition that this riot ends
do you think about

7186
02:15:57,430 --> 02:15:57,440
do you think about
 

7187
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,430
do you think about
the fact that you're going to die one

7188
02:15:59,430 --> 02:15:59,440
the fact that you're going to die one
 

7189
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:04,390
the fact that you're going to die one
day are you afraid of death

02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:01,270
you know my own uh future potential
um if if i were to undergo a uh

7240
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,280
um if if i were to undergo a uh
 

7241
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:04,709
um if if i were to undergo a uh
begin to suffer from dementia uh

7242
02:17:04,709 --> 02:17:04,719
begin to suffer from dementia uh
 

7243
02:17:04,719 --> 02:17:06,790
begin to suffer from dementia uh
alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia

7244
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:06,800
alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia
 

7245
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,549
alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia
or some other condition

7246
02:17:08,549 --> 02:17:08,559
or some other condition
 

7247
02:17:08,559 --> 02:17:09,669
or some other condition
you know

7248
02:17:09,669 --> 02:17:09,679
you know
 

7249
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:11,910
you know
i would sort of gradually lose the

7250
02:17:11,910 --> 02:17:11,920
i would sort of gradually lose the
 

7251
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:15,110
i would sort of gradually lose the
thread of that ability and

7252
02:17:15,110 --> 02:17:15,120
thread of that ability and
 

7253
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,030
thread of that ability and
so so

7254
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:17,040
so so
 

7255
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:19,830
so so
one can live on for several

7256
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:19,840
one can live on for several
 

7257
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,709
one can live on for several
for a decade after you know

7258
02:17:22,709 --> 02:17:22,719
for a decade after you know
 

7259
02:17:22,719 --> 02:17:25,990
for a decade after you know
sort of having to retire because one no

7260
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:26,000
sort of having to retire because one no
 

7261
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:26,830
sort of having to retire because one no
longer

7262
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:26,840
longer
 

7263
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:28,549
longer
has uh

7264
02:17:28,549 --> 02:17:28,559
has uh
 

7265
02:17:28,559 --> 02:17:32,070
has uh
these kinds of um abilities to engage

7266
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:32,080
these kinds of um abilities to engage
 

7267
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:34,230
these kinds of um abilities to engage
and uh i think that's the thing that i

7268
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:34,240
and uh i think that's the thing that i
 

7269
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:35,429
and uh i think that's the thing that i
feared the most

7270
02:17:35,429 --> 02:17:35,439
feared the most
 

7271
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:39,429
feared the most
the losing of that like that that um

7272
02:17:39,429 --> 02:17:39,439
the losing of that like that that um
 

7273
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:40,870
the losing of that like that that um
the the breaking of the way the

7274
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:40,880
the the breaking of the way the
 

7275
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:42,950
the the breaking of the way the
flourishing of the mind where you could

7276
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
flourishing of the mind where you could
 

7277
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,629
flourishing of the mind where you could
have these ideas and they're swimming

7278
02:17:44,629 --> 02:17:44,639
have these ideas and they're swimming
 

7279
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:46,629
have these ideas and they're swimming
around you're able to play with them

7280
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:46,639
around you're able to play with them
 

7281
02:17:46,639 --> 02:17:49,190
around you're able to play with them
yeah and and and and collaborate with

7282
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:49,200
yeah and and and and collaborate with

02:17:56,549 --> 02:17:56,559
um really helping to push these ideas
 

7289
02:17:56,559 --> 02:17:58,309
um really helping to push these ideas
forward so

7290
02:17:58,309 --> 02:17:58,319
forward so
 

7291
02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:01,270
forward so
yeah what about the edge of the cliff

7292
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:01,280
yeah what about the edge of the cliff
 

7293
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:04,549
yeah what about the edge of the cliff
the end i mean the the mystery of it the

7294
02:18:04,549 --> 02:18:04,559
the end i mean the the mystery of it the
 

7295
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:05,910
the end i mean the the mystery of it the
i mean

7296
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:05,920
i mean
 

7297
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:07,429
i mean
the migrated

7298
02:18:07,429 --> 02:18:07,439
the migrated
 

7299
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:10,549
the migrated
sort of conception of mind and

7300
02:18:10,549 --> 02:18:10,559
sort of conception of mind and
 

7301
02:18:10,559 --> 02:18:12,629
sort of conception of mind and
you know sort of continuous sort of way

7302
02:18:12,629 --> 02:18:12,639
you know sort of continuous sort of way
 

7303
02:18:12,639 --> 02:18:14,469
you know sort of continuous sort of way
of thinking about most things makes it

7304
02:18:14,469 --> 02:18:14,479
of thinking about most things makes it
 

7305
02:18:14,479 --> 02:18:15,830
of thinking about most things makes it
so that

7306
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:15,840
so that
 

7307
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:20,230
so that
uh to to me the the the um

7308
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:20,240
uh to to me the the the um
 

7309
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:22,230
uh to to me the the the um
the discreteness of that transition is

7310
02:18:22,230 --> 02:18:22,240
the discreteness of that transition is
 

7311
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:24,230
the discreteness of that transition is
less

7312
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:24,240
less
 

7313
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:26,309
less
less less apparent than it seems to be

7314
02:18:26,309 --> 02:18:26,319
less less apparent than it seems to be
 

7315
02:18:26,319 --> 02:18:28,549
less less apparent than it seems to be
to most people i see

7316
02:18:28,549 --> 02:18:28,559
to most people i see
 

7317
02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:31,509
to most people i see
i see yeah um

7318
02:18:31,509 --> 02:18:31,519
i see yeah um
 

7319
02:18:31,519 --> 02:18:33,190
i see yeah um
yeah i wonder so i don't know if you

7320
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:33,200
yeah i wonder so i don't know if you
 

7321
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:35,750
yeah i wonder so i don't know if you
know the work of ernest becker and so on

7322
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:35,760
know the work of ernest becker and so on
 

7323
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:38,629
know the work of ernest becker and so on
i wonder what what role mortality

7324
02:18:38,629 --> 02:18:38,639
i wonder what what role mortality
 

7325
02:18:38,639 --> 02:18:41,990
i wonder what what role mortality
and our ability to be cognizant of it

7326
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:42,000
and our ability to be cognizant of it
 

7327
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,230
and our ability to be cognizant of it
and anticipate it and perhaps be afraid

7328
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:44,240
and anticipate it and perhaps be afraid
 

7329
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:48,469
and anticipate it and perhaps be afraid
of it what role that plays in in our

7330
02:18:48,469 --> 02:18:48,479
of it what role that plays in in our
 

7331
02:18:48,479 --> 02:18:50,070
of it what role that plays in in our
reasoning of the world

7332
02:18:50,070 --> 02:18:50,080
reasoning of the world
 

7333
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:52,709
reasoning of the world
i think that it it can be motivating to

7334
02:18:52,709 --> 02:18:52,719
i think that it it can be motivating to
 

7335
02:18:52,719 --> 02:18:54,309
i think that it it can be motivating to
people to think they have a limited

7336
02:18:54,309 --> 02:18:54,319
people to think they have a limited
 

7337
02:18:54,319 --> 02:18:56,309
people to think they have a limited
period left um

7338
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:56,319
period left um
 

7339
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:58,950
period left um
i think in in my own case you know it

7340
02:18:58,950 --> 02:18:58,960
i think in in my own case you know it
 

7341
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:01,030
i think in in my own case you know it
it's like seven or eight years ago now

7342
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:01,040
it's like seven or eight years ago now
 

7343
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:02,709
it's like seven or eight years ago now
that i was

7344
02:19:02,709 --> 02:19:02,719
that i was
 

7345
02:19:02,719 --> 02:19:06,309
that i was
i was sitting around doing experiments

7346
02:19:06,309 --> 02:19:06,319
i was sitting around doing experiments
 

7347
02:19:06,319 --> 02:19:07,429
i was sitting around doing experiments
on

7348
02:19:07,429 --> 02:19:07,439
on
 

7349
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:11,669
on
decision making that were

7350
02:19:11,669 --> 02:19:11,679

 

7351
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:13,509

satisfying in a certain way because i

7352
02:19:13,509 --> 02:19:13,519
satisfying in a certain way because i
 

7353
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:15,190
satisfying in a certain way because i
could really

7354
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:15,200
could really
 

7355
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:17,750
could really
get closure on what

7356
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:17,760
get closure on what
 

7357
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:20,309
get closure on what
whether the model fit the data perfectly

7358
02:19:20,309 --> 02:19:20,319
whether the model fit the data perfectly
 

7359
02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:21,509
whether the model fit the data perfectly
or not

7360
02:19:21,509 --> 02:19:21,519
or not
 

7361
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:24,549
or not
and i could see how one could test you

7362
02:19:24,549 --> 02:19:24,559
and i could see how one could test you
 

7363
02:19:24,559 --> 02:19:26,950
and i could see how one could test you
know the predictions in monkeys as well

7364
02:19:26,950 --> 02:19:26,960
know the predictions in monkeys as well
 

7365
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:29,030
know the predictions in monkeys as well
as humans and really see what the

7366
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:29,040
as humans and really see what the
 

7367
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:30,709
as humans and really see what the
neurons were doing

7368
02:19:30,709 --> 02:19:30,719
neurons were doing
 

7369
02:19:30,719 --> 02:19:32,150
neurons were doing
but i just

7370
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:32,160
but i just
 

7371
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,230
but i just
realized hey wait a minute you know i

7372
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:34,240
realized hey wait a minute you know i
 

7373

i don't feel like i'm getting towards
the answers to the really interesting

7382
02:19:42,790 --> 02:19:42,800
the answers to the really interesting
 

7383
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:44,709
the answers to the really interesting
questions while i'm doing this

7384
02:19:44,709 --> 02:19:44,719
questions while i'm doing this
 

7385
02:19:44,719 --> 02:19:47,030
questions while i'm doing this
this particular level of work and that's

7386
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:47,040
this particular level of work and that's
 

7387
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:49,750
this particular level of work and that's
when i said to myself

7388
02:19:49,750 --> 02:19:49,760
when i said to myself
 

7389
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:53,030
when i said to myself
okay um let's pick something

7390
02:19:53,030 --> 02:19:53,040
okay um let's pick something
 

7391
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,110
okay um let's pick something
that's hard

7392
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:55,120
that's hard
 

7393
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:56,790
that's hard
you know so that's when i started

7394
02:19:56,790 --> 02:19:56,800
you know so that's when i started
 

7395
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,950
you know so that's when i started
working on mathematical cognition

7396
02:19:58,950 --> 02:19:58,960
working on mathematical cognition
 

7397
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:00,469
working on mathematical cognition
and um

7398
02:20:00,469 --> 02:20:00,479
and um
 

7399
02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:03,510
and um
i i think it was more in terms of well i

7400
02:20:03,510 --> 02:20:03,520
i i think it was more in terms of well i
 

7401
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:06,150
i i think it was more in terms of well i
got 15 more years possibly of useful

7402
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:06,160
got 15 more years possibly of useful
 

7403
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:08,070
got 15 more years possibly of useful
life left let's imagine that it's only

7404
02:20:08,070 --> 02:20:08,080
life left let's imagine that it's only
 

7405
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:09,990
life left let's imagine that it's only
10.

7406
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:10,000
10.
 

7407
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,590
10.
i'm actually getting close to the end of

7408
02:20:11,590 --> 02:20:11,600
i'm actually getting close to the end of
 

7409
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:13,910
i'm actually getting close to the end of
that now maybe three or four more years

7410
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:13,920
that now maybe three or four more years
 

7411
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:16,230
that now maybe three or four more years
um but i'm beginning to feel like well i

7412
02:20:16,230 --> 02:20:16,240
um but i'm beginning to feel like well i
 

7413
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:18,389
um but i'm beginning to feel like well i
probably have another five after that so

7414
02:20:18,389 --> 02:20:18,399
probably have another five after that so
 

7415
02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:20,389
probably have another five after that so
okay i'll give myself another another

7416
02:20:20,389 --> 02:20:20,399
okay i'll give myself another another
 

7417
02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:21,510
okay i'll give myself another another
six or eight

7418
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:21,520
six or eight
 

7419
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:23,510
six or eight
um but a deadline is a little bit like

so uh yeah i gotta keep um thinking
 

7427
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:31,990
so uh yeah i gotta keep um thinking
about the questions that i think are the

7428
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:32,000
about the questions that i think are the
 

7429
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,030
about the questions that i think are the
interesting and important ones for sure

7430
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,040
interesting and important ones for sure

a couple things
 

7455
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:08,150
a couple things
that i was

7456
02:21:08,150 --> 02:21:08,160
that i was
 

7457
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:12,389
that i was
you know

7458
02:21:12,389 --> 02:21:12,399

 

7459
02:21:12,399 --> 02:21:15,110

able to see

02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:15,120
able to see
 

7461
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:16,630
able to see
um

7462
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:16,640
um
 

7463
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:20,870
um
one path

7464
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:20,880

 

7465
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,870

that was more exciting to me than the

7466
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:22,880
that was more exciting to me than the
 

7467
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:25,830
that was more exciting to me than the
one that seemed already to be there for

7468
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:25,840
one that seemed already to be there for
 

7469
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,469
one that seemed already to be there for
a cognitive psychologist you know but

7470
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:28,479
a cognitive psychologist you know but
 

7471
02:21:28,479 --> 02:21:30,710

had the right context prior to that but
that i had gone ahead and

that i had gone ahead and
 

7479
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:40,230
that i had gone ahead and
followed that lead you know and then i

7480
02:21:40,230 --> 02:21:40,240
followed that lead you know and then i
 

7481
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:42,790
followed that lead you know and then i
forget the exact wording but i

heard hinton talk about
 

7519
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:27,910
heard hinton talk about
gradient descent and

7520
02:22:27,910 --> 02:22:27,920
gradient descent and
 

7521
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:29,990
gradient descent and
having the objective function to guide

7522
02:22:29,990 --> 02:22:30,000
having the objective function to guide
 

7523
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,389
having the objective function to guide
the learning process and

7524
02:22:32,389 --> 02:22:32,399
the learning process and
 

7525
02:22:32,399 --> 02:22:33,910
the learning process and
um

7526
02:22:33,910 --> 02:22:33,920
um
 

7527
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:36,389
um
it it happened a lot in that period and

7528
02:22:36,389 --> 02:22:36,399
it it happened a lot in that period and
 

7529
02:22:36,399 --> 02:22:39,110
it it happened a lot in that period and
i i sort of seek that kind of thing in

7530
02:22:39,110 --> 02:22:39,120
i i sort of seek that kind of thing in
 

7531
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,150
i i sort of seek that kind of thing in

uh collaborations with my students right

7534
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:42,800
uh collaborations with my students right
 

7535
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:43,830
uh collaborations with my students right
so

7536
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:43,840
so
 

7537
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:45,030

you know the idea that this is a person

7540
02:22:48,469 --> 02:22:48,479
you know the idea that this is a person
 

7541
02:22:48,479 --> 02:22:49,510
you know the idea that this is a person
who

7542
02:22:49,510 --> 02:22:49,520
who
 

7543
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:51,750
who
contributed to science by finding

7544
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:51,760

is something that

7552
02:22:58,230 --> 02:22:58,240
is something that
 

7553
02:22:58,240 --> 02:22:59,429
is something that
i certainly hope is part of the

7554
02:22:59,429 --> 02:22:59,439
i certainly hope is part of the
 

7555
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:02,309
i certainly hope is part of the
paragraph and uh like you said taking a

7556
02:23:02,309 --> 02:23:02,319
paragraph and uh like you said taking a
 

7557
02:23:02,319 --> 02:23:03,190
paragraph and uh like you said taking a
step

7558
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:03,200
step
 

7559
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,630
step
maybe in directions that are not

7560
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:06,640
maybe in directions that are not
 

7561
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:09,349
maybe in directions that are not
not obvious so it's the the old robert

7562
02:23:09,349 --> 02:23:09,359
not obvious so it's the the old robert
 

7563
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:11,510
not obvious so it's the the old robert
frost road less taken

7564
02:23:11,510 --> 02:23:11,520
frost road less taken
 

7565
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:14,150
frost road less taken
so maybe because you said like this

7566
02:23:14,150 --> 02:23:14,160
so maybe because you said like this
 

7567
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,790
so maybe because you said like this

that step you take is a little bit
 

7571
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,150
that step you take is a little bit
uh off the beaten path

7572

take that part out of the paper

7642

take that part out of the paper
 

7643
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:35,510
take that part out of the paper
and so i did i took that part out of the

7644

7647
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:41,750

but you know i almost found myself

7648
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:41,760
but you know i almost found myself
 

7649
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:46,070
but you know i almost found myself
labeled as a non-theorist right by this

7650
02:24:46,070 --> 02:24:46,080
labeled as a non-theorist right by this
 

7651
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:49,270
labeled as a non-theorist right by this
uh and um i could have like succumbed to

7652
02:24:49,270 --> 02:24:49,280
uh and um i could have like succumbed to
 

7653
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,030
uh and um i could have like succumbed to
that and said okay well i guess my job

7654
02:24:51,030 --> 02:24:51,040
that and said okay well i guess my job
 

7655
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:53,030
that and said okay well i guess my job
is to just go on and do experiments

7656
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:53,040
is to just go on and do experiments
 

7657
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:54,070
is to just go on and do experiments
right

7658
02:24:54,070 --> 02:24:54,080
right
 

7659
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:55,270
right
but

7660
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:55,280
but
 

7661
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:57,429
but
but uh

7662
02:24:57,429 --> 02:24:57,439
but uh
 

7663

so when i when i got to my assistant

7666
02:25:02,469 --> 02:25:02,479
so when i when i got to my assistant
 

7667
02:25:02,479 --> 02:25:04,469
so when i when i got to my assistant
professorship um

7668
02:25:04,469 --> 02:25:04,479
professorship um
 

7669
02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:06,469
professorship um
although i continued to do experiments

7670
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:06,479
although i continued to do experiments
 

7671
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:08,309
although i continued to do experiments
because i knew i had to get some papers

7672
02:25:08,309 --> 02:25:08,319
because i knew i had to get some papers
 

7673
02:25:08,319 --> 02:25:09,110
because i knew i had to get some papers
out

7674
02:25:09,110 --> 02:25:09,120
out
 

7675
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:11,830
out

submitted my first article to
 

7679
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:15,270
submitted my first article to
psychological review which was the

7680
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:15,280
psychological review which was the
 

7681
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:17,270
psychological review which was the
theoretical journal where i took that

7682
02:25:17,270 --> 02:25:17,280
theoretical journal where i took that
 

7683
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:19,990
theoretical journal where i took that
section and elaborated it and wrote it

7684
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:20,000
section and elaborated it and wrote it
 

7685
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,830
section and elaborated it and wrote it
up and submitted it to them and they

7686
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:21,840
up and submitted it to them and they
 

7687
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:24,950
up and submitted it to them and they
didn't accept that either but they said

7688
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:24,960
didn't accept that either but they said
 

7689
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,790
didn't accept that either but they said
oh this is interesting you should keep

7690
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:26,800
oh this is interesting you should keep
 

7691
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:28,710
oh this is interesting you should keep
thinking about it this time and then

7692
02:25:28,710 --> 02:25:28,720
thinking about it this time and then
 

7693
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:30,790
thinking about it this time and then
that was what got me going

7694
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:30,800
that was what got me going
 

7695
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:33,349
that was what got me going
to think okay you know

7696
02:25:33,349 --> 02:25:33,359
to think okay you know
 

7697
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:36,150
to think okay you know
so it's not a superhuman thing to

7698
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:36,160
so it's not a superhuman thing to
 

7699
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,309
so it's not a superhuman thing to
contribute to the development of theory

7700
02:25:38,309 --> 02:25:38,319
contribute to the development of theory
 

7701
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:41,429
contribute to the development of theory
you know you don't have to be

7702
02:25:41,429 --> 02:25:41,439
you know you don't have to be
 

7703
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:44,950
you know you don't have to be
you can do it as a mere mortal

the broader i think lessons don't
 

7709
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:53,670

i mean that yeah exactly and then you
 

7717
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:01,510
i mean that yeah exactly and then you
especially as you become successful

7718
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:01,520
especially as you become successful
 

7719
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:04,150
especially as you become successful
you'll label labels get assigned to you

7720
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:04,160
you'll label labels get assigned to you
 

7721
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:05,830
you'll label labels get assigned to you
for that you're successful for that

7722
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:05,840
for that you're successful for that
 

7723
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,550
for that you're successful for that
connectionist cognitive scientist and

7724
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:08,560
connectionist cognitive scientist and
 

7725
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,550
connectionist cognitive scientist and
not a neuroscientist and then you can

7726
02:26:10,550 --> 02:26:10,560
not a neuroscientist and then you can
 

7727
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:13,349
not a neuroscientist and then you can
you can completely that's just that's

7728
02:26:13,349 --> 02:26:13,359
you can completely that's just that's

new person that can completely
revolutionize and totally new areas so

7734
02:26:20,389 --> 02:26:20,399
revolutionize and totally new areas so
 

7735
02:26:20,399 --> 02:26:22,469
revolutionize and totally new areas so
don't let those labels

7736
02:26:22,469 --> 02:26:22,479
don't let those labels
 

7737
02:26:22,479 --> 02:26:25,429
don't let those labels
um hold you back well let me ask the big

when you look at into
 

7745
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,750
when you look at into
you said it started with colombia trying

7746
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:31,760
you said it started with colombia trying
 

7747
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:33,349
you said it started with colombia trying
to observe these humans and they're

7748
02:26:33,349 --> 02:26:33,359
to observe these humans and they're
 

7749
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:35,670
to observe these humans and they're
doing weird stuff and you want to know

7750
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:35,680
doing weird stuff and you want to know
 

7751
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:37,510
doing weird stuff and you want to know
why are they doing this though so let's

7752

why are they doing this though so let's
 

7753
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:39,510
why are they doing this though so let's
zoom out even bigger

7754
02:26:39,510 --> 02:26:39,520
zoom out even bigger
 

7755
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:40,950
zoom out even bigger

doing what we're doing what do you think
 

7765
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:50,870
doing what we're doing what do you think
is the meaning of it all the big why

7766
02:26:50,870 --> 02:26:50,880
is the meaning of it all the big why
 

7767
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:53,110
is the meaning of it all the big why
question we seem to be very busy doing a

7768
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:53,120
question we seem to be very busy doing a
 

7769
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:54,309
question we seem to be very busy doing a
bunch of stuff

7770
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:54,319
bunch of stuff
 

7771
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:56,630
bunch of stuff
and we seem to be kind of directed

7772
02:26:56,630 --> 02:26:56,640
and we seem to be kind of directed
 

7773
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:59,429
and we seem to be kind of directed
towards somewhere

7774
02:26:59,429 --> 02:26:59,439
towards somewhere
 

7775
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:03,270
towards somewhere
but why

7776
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:03,280

 

7777
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:05,190

well um

well um
 

7779
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:08,550
well um
i myself think that we make meaning for

7780
02:27:08,550 --> 02:27:08,560
i myself think that we make meaning for
 

7781
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:12,309
i myself think that we make meaning for
ourselves and that um

7782
02:27:12,309 --> 02:27:12,319
ourselves and that um
 

7783
02:27:12,319 --> 02:27:14,550
ourselves and that um
we find inspiration in the meaning that

7784
02:27:14,550 --> 02:27:14,560
we find inspiration in the meaning that
 

7785
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:17,590
we find inspiration in the meaning that
other people have made in the past uh

7786
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:17,600
other people have made in the past uh
 

7787

yeah and so and so from that like little

7904
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:37,680
yeah and so and so from that like little
 

7905
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:41,270
yeah and so and so from that like little
pocket there's some kind of uh peculiar

7906
02:29:41,270 --> 02:29:41,280
pocket there's some kind of uh peculiar
 

7907
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:43,429
pocket there's some kind of uh peculiar
little emergent process

7908
02:29:43,429 --> 02:29:43,439
little emergent process
 

7909
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:46,070
little emergent process
that then uh which is basically each one

7910
02:29:46,070 --> 02:29:46,080
that then uh which is basically each one
 

7911
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:47,030
that then uh which is basically each one
of us

7912
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:47,040
of us
 

7913
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:49,590
of us
each one of us humans is a kind of

each one of us humans is a kind of
you know you think cells and they come

7916
02:29:51,030 --> 02:29:51,040
you know you think cells and they come
 

7917
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:54,070
you know you think cells and they come
together and it's an emergent process

7918
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:54,080
together and it's an emergent process
 

7919
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,030
together and it's an emergent process
that then

7920
02:29:55,030 --> 02:29:55,040
that then
 

7921
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:58,550
that then
tells fancy stories about itself

7922
02:29:58,550 --> 02:29:58,560
tells fancy stories about itself
 

7923
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:00,710
tells fancy stories about itself
and then gets

7924
02:30:00,710 --> 02:30:00,720
and then gets
 

7925
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:02,469
and then gets
just like you said just enjoys the

7926
02:30:02,469 --> 02:30:02,479
just like you said just enjoys the
 

7927
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:03,990
just like you said just enjoys the
beauty of the stories we tell about

7928
02:30:03,990 --> 02:30:04,000
beauty of the stories we tell about
 

7929
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,870
beauty of the stories we tell about
ourselves it's an emergent process

02:30:06,870 --> 02:30:06,880
ourselves it's an emergent process
 

7931
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:08,870
ourselves it's an emergent process
that lives for time

7932
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:08,880
that lives for time
 

7933
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:11,110
that lives for time
uh is defined by its local pocket and

7934
02:30:11,110 --> 02:30:11,120
uh is defined by its local pocket and

uh in time and space
 

7939
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,910
uh in time and space
and then tells pretty stories and we

7940
02:30:15,910 --> 02:30:15,920
and then tells pretty stories and we
 

7941
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:17,270
and then tells pretty stories and we
write those stories down and then we

7942
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:17,280
write those stories down and then we
 

7943
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,590
write those stories down and then we
celebrate how nice the stories are and

7944
02:30:19,590 --> 02:30:19,600
celebrate how nice the stories are and
 

7945
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:21,349
celebrate how nice the stories are and
then it continues because we build

7946
02:30:21,349 --> 02:30:21,359
then it continues because we build
 

7947
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:23,190
then it continues because we build
stories on top of each other

7948
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:23,200
stories on top of each other
 

7949
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:23,990
stories on top of each other
and

7950
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:24,000
and
 

7951
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,630
and
eventually we'll colonize hopefully

7952
02:30:26,630 --> 02:30:26,640
eventually we'll colonize hopefully
 

7953
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:28,070
eventually we'll colonize hopefully
