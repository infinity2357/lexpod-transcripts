why for example having a child is

114
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,060
why for example having a child is
 

115
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,250
why for example having a child is
considered very meaningful because

116
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,260
considered very meaningful because
 

117

you're connecting to something that's
 

119
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,030

independent of you
now the question that comes up from me

124
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
now the question that comes up from me
 

125
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,030
now the question that comes up from me
well there's two questions one is why is

126
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
well there's two questions one is why is
 

127
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,550
well there's two questions one is why is
that at risk right now and then secondly

128
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,560
that at risk right now and then secondly
 

129
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,930
that at risk right now and then secondly
and

130
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:38,940
and
 

131
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,430
and
I think you have to answer the second

132
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,440
I think you have to answer the second
 

133
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,589
I think you have to answer the second
question first which is well yeah but

134
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,599
question first which is well yeah but
 

135
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,570
question first which is well yeah but
why is meaning so important why is this

136
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:44,580
why is meaning so important why is this
 

137
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,190
why is meaning so important why is this
sense of connectedness so important to

138
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
sense of connectedness so important to
 

139
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,830
sense of connectedness so important to
human beings why when it is lacking do

140
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
human beings why when it is lacking do
 

141
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,050
human beings why when it is lacking do
they typically fall into depression

142

00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:56,340
self-destructive behavior and so the
 

147
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,070
self-destructive behavior and so the
first answer I give you is well it's

148
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
first answer I give you is well it's
 

149

that sense of connectedness and people
often express it metaphorically they

152
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
often express it metaphorically they
 

153
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,229
often express it metaphorically they
want to be connected to something larger

154
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:03,239
want to be connected to something larger
 

155
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,330
want to be connected to something larger
than themselves they want to matter they

156
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,340
than themselves they want to matter they
 

157
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,250
than themselves they want to matter they
don't mean it literally I mean if I

158
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,260
don't mean it literally I mean if I
 

159
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,570

fulfilling right so what they're trying
 

165
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,630
fulfilling right so what they're trying
to convey they're using this metaphor to

it
 

237
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,890
it
one is that there are perennial problems

you still man that case and then can you

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,650
you still man that case and then can you
argue against it so what aspects I find

given the extensive use of the word

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,460
problematic I like that you use that
 

347
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,029
problematic I like that you use that
word to describe one's own mortality

348
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:56,039
word to describe one's own mortality
 

349
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,370
word to describe one's own mortality
it's problematic because people sort of

it's problematic because people sort of

aspect of the human condition is that we

358
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,020
aspect of the human condition is that we

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,010
aspect of the human condition is that we
die and it ends I think I'm not just

trying to get you to consider that your
 

365
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,730
trying to get you to consider that your
mortality is not an event in the future

366

mortality is not an event in the future
 

367
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,370
mortality is not an event in the future
it's a state you're in right now

that's what I'm trying to get that's
 

371
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,150
that's what I'm trying to get that's
what I'm trying to shift

what I'm trying to shift
 

373
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,809
what I'm trying to shift
um so your mortality is just a we talk

374
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:26,819
um so your mortality is just a we talk
 

375
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,670
um so your mortality is just a we talk
about something that causes mortality

376
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:28,680
about something that causes mortality
 

377
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,930
about something that causes mortality
fatal

yes but what we what we actually mean is

yes but what we what we actually mean is
 

381
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,490
yes but what we what we actually mean is
it's full of fate and I don't mean in

it's full of fate and I don't mean in
 

383

it's full of fate and I don't mean in
you know in the sense of things are

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,830
you know in the sense of things are
pre-written what I mean is this sense of

pre-written what I mean is this sense of
 

387
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,309
pre-written what I mean is this sense of
the universe doesn't care about your

the universe doesn't care about your
 

389

personal narrative you can just have met
 

391
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,469
personal narrative you can just have met
the person that is going to be the love

392
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
the person that is going to be the love
 

393
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,050
the person that is going to be the love
of your life it's the culmination of

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,060
of your life it's the culmination of
 

395
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,409
of your life it's the culmination of
your whole project for happiness and you

396
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:54,419
your whole project for happiness and you
 

397
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,089
your whole project for happiness and you
step into the street and a truck hits

398
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:56,099
step into the street and a truck hits
 

399
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,010
step into the street and a truck hits
you and you die

400
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,020
you and you die
 

401
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,770
you and you die
that's mortality mortality isn't just

402
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:00,780
that's mortality mortality isn't just
 

403
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,129
that's mortality mortality isn't just
some far-flung event it's that every

404
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:04,139
some far-flung event it's that every
 

405
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,270
some far-flung event it's that every
moment

406
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
moment
 

407
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,589
moment
we are subject to fate in that way so

408
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
we are subject to fate in that way so
 

409
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,409
we are subject to fate in that way so
you can think of lots of little deaths

410
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:12,419
you can think of lots of little deaths
 

411
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,290
you can think of lots of little deaths
you experience whenever

412
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,300
you experience whenever
 

413
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,450
you experience whenever
all the projects and the plans you make

414
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,460
all the projects and the plans you make
 

415
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,730
all the projects and the plans you make
come up against the fact that the

416
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:19,740
come up against the fact that the
 

417
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,189
come up against the fact that the
Universe can just roll over them

418
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:22,199
Universe can just roll over them
 

419
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,570
Universe can just roll over them
the death

420
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:23,580
the death
 

421
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,450
the death
is the indifference of nature of the

422
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:26,460
is the indifference of nature of the
 

423
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,150
is the indifference of nature of the
universe to your to your existence and

424
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,160
universe to your to your existence and
 

425
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,189
universe to your to your existence and
so in that sense it is always here with

426
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
so in that sense it is always here with
 

427
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,250
so in that sense it is always here with
us yeah but you're vulnerable in so many

428
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,260
us yeah but you're vulnerable in so many
 

429
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,230
us yeah but you're vulnerable in so many
ways other than just the ending of your

430
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
ways other than just the ending of your
 

431
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,269
ways other than just the ending of your
biological life

432
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:38,279
biological life
 

433
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,490
biological life
um because it's interesting if you rate

434
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:40,500
um because it's interesting if you rate
 

435
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,769
um because it's interesting if you rate
what people fear most death is not

436
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:42,779
what people fear most death is not
 

437
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,810
what people fear most death is not
number one they often put public

438
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:44,820
number one they often put public
 

439
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,230
number one they often put public
speaking as number one yeah because the

440
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
speaking as number one yeah because the
 

441
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,009
speaking as number one yeah because the
death of status or reputation can also

442

death of status or reputation can also
 

443
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,170
death of status or reputation can also
be a profound loss for for human beings

444
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,180
be a profound loss for for human beings
 

445
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,329
be a profound loss for for human beings
and drive them into despair

446
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:56,339
and drive them into despair
 

447
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,430
and drive them into despair
so as the terror management folks would

448
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440
so as the terror management folks would
 

449
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,790
so as the terror management folks would

say as Ernest Becker would say that you

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,310
say as Ernest Becker would say that you
know a self-report on a survey is not an

know a self-report on a survey is not an
 

453
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,930
know a self-report on a survey is not an
accurate way to capture what is actually

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:05,940
accurate way to capture what is actually

being sure that we could be terrified of
 

459
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,610
being sure that we could be terrified of
death and we've from childhood since we

460
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:13,620
death and we've from childhood since we
 

461
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,949
death and we've from childhood since we
realized

462
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
realized
 

463
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,870
realized
the the absurdity of the fact that the

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:17,880
the the absurdity of the fact that the
 

465
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,110
the the absurdity of the fact that the
right ends we've learned to really

illusions that um that allow us to

470
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
illusions that um that allow us to
 

471
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,850
illusions that um that allow us to
escape momentarily or for prolonged

escape momentarily or for prolonged

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,430
escape momentarily or for prolonged
periods of time the the realization that

474
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
periods of time the the realization that
 

475
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,490
periods of time the the realization that
we die okay so first I took it seriously

476
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,500
we die okay so first I took it seriously
 

477
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,710
we die okay so first I took it seriously
but now I want to say why there's some

478
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
but now I want to say why there's some
 

479
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,050
but now I want to say why there's some
empirical work that makes me want to

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,060
empirical work that makes me want to
 

481
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,550
empirical work that makes me want to
reconsider it so Terror management

482
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
reconsider it so Terror management
 

483
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,430
reconsider it so Terror management
theory is you do things like you give

484
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
theory is you do things like you give
 

485
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,250
theory is you do things like you give
people a list of words to read and you

486
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,260
people a list of words to read and you
 

487
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,990
people a list of words to read and you
and in those words in that in those

488
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
and in those words in that in those
 

489
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,430
and in those words in that in those

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
um
 

813
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,769
um
any idea that the mind is some kind of

814
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:39,779
any idea that the mind is some kind of
 

815
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,410
any idea that the mind is some kind of
ultimately immaterial substance also has

816
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:42,420
ultimately immaterial substance also has
 

817
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,930
ultimately immaterial substance also has
for me just

818
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:44,940
for me just
 

819
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,569
for me just
devastating problems those are the two

820
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:47,579
devastating problems those are the two
 

821
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,550
devastating problems those are the two
kinds of framework that people usually

822
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:49,560
kinds of framework that people usually
 

823
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,930
kinds of framework that people usually
propose

824
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:50,940
propose
 

825
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,449
propose
in order to support some kind of idea of

826
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:53,459
in order to support some kind of idea of
 

827
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,910
in order to support some kind of idea of
immortality I find both very problematic

828
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
immortality I find both very problematic
 

829
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,749
immortality I find both very problematic
the fact that we participate in

830
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
the fact that we participate in
 

831
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,610
the fact that we participate in
distributed cognition that most of our

832
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:01,620
distributed cognition that most of our
 

833
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,990
distributed cognition that most of our
problem solving is not done as

834
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,000
problem solving is not done as
 

835
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,610
problem solving is not done as
individuals but in groups this is

836
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:04,620
individuals but in groups this is
 

837
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,829
individuals but in groups this is
something I work on I've published on

838
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:06,839
something I work on I've published on
 

839
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,890
something I work on I've published on
that I think that's important

840
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:08,900
that I think that's important
 

841
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,949
that I think that's important
but most of the people who do work on

842
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
but most of the people who do work on
 

843
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,289
but most of the people who do work on
systems of distributed cognition think

844
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:15,299
systems of distributed cognition think
 

845
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,429
systems of distributed cognition think
that while there's such a thing as

846
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:16,439
that while there's such a thing as
 

847
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,169
that while there's such a thing as
collective intelligence

848
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:18,179
collective intelligence
 

849
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,970
collective intelligence
there's no good evidence that there's

850
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:19,980
there's no good evidence that there's
 

851
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,949
there's no good evidence that there's
Collective Consciousness in fact it's

852
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:21,959
Collective Consciousness in fact it's
 

853
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,470
Collective Consciousness in fact it's
often called Zombie Agency for that

854
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
often called Zombie Agency for that
 

855
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,850
often called Zombie Agency for that
reason

856
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:25,860
reason
 

857
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,490
reason
um and so while I think it's very clear

858
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:28,500
um and so while I think it's very clear
 

859
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,310
um and so while I think it's very clear
that no one person runs an airline

860
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,320
that no one person runs an airline
 

861
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,810
that no one person runs an airline
and there's a collective intelligence

862
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:32,820
and there's a collective intelligence
 

863
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,549
and there's a collective intelligence
that solves that problem I do not think

864
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
that solves that problem I do not think
 

865
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,830
that solves that problem I do not think
that collective intelligence supports

866
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:36,840
that collective intelligence supports
 

867
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,570
that collective intelligence supports
any kind of consciousness

868
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:38,580
any kind of consciousness
 

869
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,150
any kind of consciousness
and so therefore I don't think the fact

870
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,160
and so therefore I don't think the fact
 

871
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,730
and so therefore I don't think the fact
that I participate which I regularly and

872
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:43,740
that I participate which I regularly and
 

873
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,370
that I participate which I regularly and
reliably do in distributed cognition

874
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:45,380
reliably do in distributed cognition
 

875
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,810
reliably do in distributed cognition
gives me any reason to believe that that

876
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:47,820
gives me any reason to believe that that
 

877
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,390
gives me any reason to believe that that
participation grounds some kind of

878
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
participation grounds some kind of
 

879
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,070
participation grounds some kind of
consciousness

880
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
consciousness
 

881
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,350
consciousness
okay there's so many things to mention

882
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:54,360
okay there's so many things to mention
 

883
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,110
okay there's so many things to mention
there first of all distributed cognition

884
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,120
there first of all distributed cognition
 

885
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,789
there first of all distributed cognition
maybe that's a synonym for collective

886
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
maybe that's a synonym for collective
 

887
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,070
maybe that's a synonym for collective
intelligence so that means a bunch of

888
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,080
intelligence so that means a bunch of
 

889
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,930
intelligence so that means a bunch of
humans

890
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:02,940
humans
 

891
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,570
humans
individually are able to think have

892
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:05,580
individually are able to think have
 

893
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,850
individually are able to think have
cognitive machines

894
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:07,860
cognitive machines
 

895
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,490
cognitive machines
and uh are somehow able to interact the

896
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:10,500
and uh are somehow able to interact the
 

897
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,210
and uh are somehow able to interact the
process of dialogue as you talk about to

898
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,220
process of dialogue as you talk about to
 

899
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,630
process of dialogue as you talk about to
um morph different ideas together like

900
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:17,640
um morph different ideas together like
 

901
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,029
um morph different ideas together like
this ideal landscape together

902
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:20,039
this ideal landscape together
 

903
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,549
this ideal landscape together
is so interesting to think about okay

904
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
is so interesting to think about okay
 

905
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,330
is so interesting to think about okay
well you do have these fascinating

906
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:26,340
well you do have these fascinating
 

907
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,090
well you do have these fascinating
distributed cognition systems

908
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,100
distributed cognition systems
 

909
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,210
distributed cognition systems
but Consciousness does not

910
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:32,220
but Consciousness does not
 

911
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,130
but Consciousness does not
propagate in the same way as

912
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,140
propagate in the same way as
 

913
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,789
propagate in the same way as
intelligence yeah but

914
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:37,799
intelligence yeah but
 

915
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,350
intelligence yeah but
isn't there a case if we just look at

916
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
isn't there a case if we just look at
 

917
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,930
isn't there a case if we just look at
intelligence if we look at us humans as

918
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:41,940
intelligence if we look at us humans as
 

919
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,970
intelligence if we look at us humans as
a collection of smaller organisms yes

920
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:43,980
a collection of smaller organisms yes
 

921
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,270
a collection of smaller organisms yes
which we are and and so there's like a

922
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
which we are and and so there's like a
 

923
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,010
which we are and and so there's like a
hierarchy

924
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:49,020
hierarchy
 

925
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,730
hierarchy
um of organisms tiny ones work together

926
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:52,740
um of organisms tiny ones work together
 

927
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,230
um of organisms tiny ones work together
to form

928
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
to form
 

929
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,870
to form
tiny Villages that you can then start to

930
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
tiny Villages that you can then start to
 

931
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,789
tiny Villages that you can then start to
see as individual organisms that are

932
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
see as individual organisms that are
 

933
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,450
see as individual organisms that are
then also forming bigger Villages and

934
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:02,460
then also forming bigger Villages and
 

935
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,370
then also forming bigger Villages and
interacting different ways and function

936
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,380
interacting different ways and function
 

937
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,230
interacting different ways and function
becomes more and more complex and

938
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
becomes more and more complex and
 

939
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,570
becomes more and more complex and
eventually we get to us humans to where

940
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:08,580
eventually we get to us humans to where
 

941
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,830
eventually we get to us humans to where
we start to think well we're an

942
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
we start to think well we're an
 

943
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,930
we start to think well we're an
individual but really we're not there's

944
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:11,940
individual but really we're not there's
 

945
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,370
individual but really we're not there's
billions of organisms inside us are both

946
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:15,380
billions of organisms inside us are both
 

947
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,010
billions of organisms inside us are both
domestic and foreign

948
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,020
domestic and foreign
 

949
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,130
domestic and foreign
so uh isn't that building up

950
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,140
so uh isn't that building up
 

951
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,430
so uh isn't that building up
consciousnesses like turtles all the way

952
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
consciousnesses like turtles all the way
 

953
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,250
consciousnesses like turtles all the way
up to us our Consciousness why does it

954
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:28,260
up to us our Consciousness why does it
 

955
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,409
up to us our Consciousness why does it
have to stop us humans are we the only

956
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:30,419
have to stop us humans are we the only
 

957
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,409
have to stop us humans are we the only
like is this the face transition when it

958
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:33,419
like is this the face transition when it
 

959
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,390
like is this the face transition when it
becomes a zombie-like giant hierarchical

960
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
becomes a zombie-like giant hierarchical
 

961
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,710
becomes a zombie-like giant hierarchical
village that first like ah there's like

962
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
village that first like ah there's like
 

963
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,810
village that first like ah there's like
a singing Angels and it's Consciousness

964
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:44,820
a singing Angels and it's Consciousness
 

965
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,330
a singing Angels and it's Consciousness
is born in just us humans

966
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:47,340
is born in just us humans
 

967
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,730
is born in just us humans
do bacteria have Consciousness uh not

968
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:49,740
do bacteria have Consciousness uh not
 

969
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,409
do bacteria have Consciousness uh not
bacteria but maybe you could say

970
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:51,419
bacteria but maybe you could say
 

971
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,690
bacteria but maybe you could say
bacteria does but like the interesting

972
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:53,700
bacteria does but like the interesting
 

973
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,970
bacteria does but like the interesting
complicated organisms that are within us

974
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:55,980
complicated organisms that are within us
 

975
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,450
complicated organisms that are within us
have Consciousness I think it's proper

976
00:19:59,450 --> 00:19:59,460

uh kind of sense making ability but I do
 

985
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,310
uh kind of sense making ability but I do
not think that we can attribute

986
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,320
not think that we can attribute
 

987
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,230
not think that we can attribute
Consciousness at least what we mean by

988
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,240
Consciousness at least what we mean by

um and I think there's no reason in

agree with me on that point I think it's
 

1017

do not yet exist and therefore it is
 

1041
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,669
do not yet exist and therefore it is
implausible that Consciousness exists at

00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:22,679
implausible that Consciousness exists at
 

1043
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,950
implausible that Consciousness exists at
the level of collective intelligence so

1044
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
the level of collective intelligence so
 

1045
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,510
the level of collective intelligence so
you talk about Consciousness quite a bit

1046
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:26,520
you talk about Consciousness quite a bit
 

1047
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,210
you talk about Consciousness quite a bit
so let's step back and try to sneak up

1048
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,220
so let's step back and try to sneak up
 

1049
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,270
so let's step back and try to sneak up
to a definition

to a definition

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,270
to a definition
what is consciousness for me there are

1052
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
what is consciousness for me there are
 

1053
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,510
what is consciousness for me there are
two aspects to answering that question

1054
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:38,520
two aspects to answering that question
 

1055
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,430
two aspects to answering that question
one is what's the nature of

1056
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:40,440
one is what's the nature of
 

1057
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,630
one is what's the nature of
Consciousness how does something like

1058
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:41,640
Consciousness how does something like
 

1059
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,909
Consciousness how does something like
consciousness easiest in an otherwise

1060
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
consciousness easiest in an otherwise
 

1061
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,669
consciousness easiest in an otherwise
apparently non-conscious universe and

1062
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:46,679
apparently non-conscious universe and
 

1063
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:47,990
apparently non-conscious universe and
then there's a function question which

1064
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
then there's a function question which
 

1065
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,730
then there's a function question which
is equally important which is what does

1066
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:49,740
is equally important which is what does
 

1067
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,430
is equally important which is what does
Consciousness do

1068
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
Consciousness do
 

1069
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,130
Consciousness do
the first one is obviously you know

1070
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,140
the first one is obviously you know
 

1071
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,690
the first one is obviously you know
problematic for most people like yeah

1072
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:56,700
problematic for most people like yeah
 

1073
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,909
problematic for most people like yeah
Consciousness seems to be so different

1074
00:21:58,909 --> 00:21:58,919
Consciousness seems to be so different
 

1075
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,830
Consciousness seems to be so different
from the rest of the non-conscious

1076
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:00,840
from the rest of the non-conscious
 

1077
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,930
from the rest of the non-conscious
universe but I put it to you that the

1078
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:02,940
universe but I put it to you that the
 

1079
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,930
universe but I put it to you that the
function question is also very hard

1080
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:04,940
function question is also very hard
 

1081
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,690
function question is also very hard
because you are clearly capable

1082
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:08,700
because you are clearly capable
 

1083
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,169
because you are clearly capable
a very sophisticated

1084
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:11,179

Consciousness you are turning the noises

1088
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,220
Consciousness you are turning the noises
 

1089
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,570
Consciousness you are turning the noises
coming out of my face hole into ideas in

1090
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:20,580
coming out of my face hole into ideas in
 

1091
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,070
coming out of my face hole into ideas in
your mind and you have no conscious

1092
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
your mind and you have no conscious
 

1093
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,169
your mind and you have no conscious
awareness of how that process is

1094
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:24,179
awareness of how that process is
 

1095
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,690

1097
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,810

so why do we have Consciousness at all

1098
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:29,820
so why do we have Consciousness at all
 

1099
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,570
so why do we have Consciousness at all
now here's the thing there's an extra

1100
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:32,580
now here's the thing there's an extra
 

1101
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,490
now here's the thing there's an extra
question you need to ask should we

1102
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:34,500
question you need to ask should we
 

1103
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,930
question you need to ask should we
answer attempt to answer those questions

1104
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:35,940
answer attempt to answer those questions
 

1105
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,570
answer attempt to answer those questions
separately or should we attempt to

1106
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:38,580
separately or should we attempt to
 

1107
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,090
separately or should we attempt to
answer them in an integrated fashion

1108
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,100
answer them in an integrated fashion
 

1109
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,490
answer them in an integrated fashion
I make the case that you actually have

1110
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:43,500
I make the case that you actually have
 

1111
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,310
I make the case that you actually have
to answer them in an integrated fashion

1112
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
to answer them in an integrated fashion
 

1113
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,529
to answer them in an integrated fashion
what Consciousness does

1114
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:48,539
what Consciousness does
 

1115
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,330
what Consciousness does
and what it is

1116
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:50,340
and what it is
 

1117
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,070
and what it is
we should be able to give it a unified

1118
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
we should be able to give it a unified
 

1119
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,070
we should be able to give it a unified
answer to both of those can you

1120
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,080
answer to both of those can you
 

1121
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,370
answer to both of those can you
try to elucidate the difference between

1122
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:58,380
try to elucidate the difference between
 

1123
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,730
try to elucidate the difference between
what Consciousness is and what it does

1124
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:01,740
what Consciousness is and what it does
 

1125
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,510
what Consciousness is and what it does
both of which are Mysteries as you say

1126
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
both of which are Mysteries as you say
 

1127
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,149
both of which are Mysteries as you say
State versus action

1128
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
State versus action
 

1129
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,830
State versus action
can you try to explain the difference

1130
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840
can you try to explain the difference
 

1131
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,529
can you try to explain the difference
that's interesting that that's useful

1132
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:12,539
that's interesting that that's useful
 

1133
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,390
that's interesting that that's useful
that's important to understand so that's

1134
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
that's important to understand so that's
 

1135
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,529
that's important to understand so that's
putting me in a bit of a difficult

1136
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:15,539
putting me in a bit of a difficult
 

1137
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,930
putting me in a bit of a difficult

1138
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:17,940
position because I actually argue that
 

1139
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,970
position because I actually argue that
trying to answer them separately is

1140
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:19,980
trying to answer them separately is
 

1141
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,909
trying to answer them separately is
ultimately incoherent

1142
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
ultimately incoherent
 

1143
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,190
ultimately incoherent
but what I can point to are many

1144
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
but what I can point to are many
 

1145
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,070
but what I can point to are many
published articles in which only one of

1146
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
published articles in which only one of
 

1147
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,169
published articles in which only one of
these problems is addressed and the

1148
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:30,179
these problems is addressed and the
 

1149
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,909
these problems is addressed and the
other is left unaddressed so people will

1150
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
other is left unaddressed so people will
 

1151
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,730
other is left unaddressed so people will
try and explain what qualia are how they

1152
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:34,740
try and explain what qualia are how they
 

1153
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,950
try and explain what qualia are how they
potentially emerge without saying what

1154
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
potentially emerge without saying what
 

1155
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,590
potentially emerge without saying what
do they do what problems do they helped

1156
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
do they do what problems do they helped
 

1157
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,450
do they do what problems do they helped
to solve how do they make the organism

1158
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:41,460
to solve how do they make the organism
 

1159
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,490
to solve how do they make the organism
more adaptive and then you'll have other

1160
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:43,500
more adaptive and then you'll have other
 

1161
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,289
more adaptive and then you'll have other
people who say oh no this is what the

1162
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:45,299
people who say oh no this is what the
 

1163
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,330
people who say oh no this is what the
function of Consciousness is but I don't

1164
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:47,340
function of Consciousness is but I don't
 

1165
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,430
function of Consciousness is but I don't
know I can't tell you I can't solve the

1166
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
know I can't tell you I can't solve the
 

1167
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,649
know I can't tell you I can't solve the
hard problem I don't know how qualia

1168
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:51,659
hard problem I don't know how qualia
 

1169
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,830
hard problem I don't know how qualia
exists so what I'm saying is many people

1170
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:54,840
exists so what I'm saying is many people
 

1171
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,350
exists so what I'm saying is many people
treat these problems separately although

1172
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
treat these problems separately although
 

1173
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,690
treat these problems separately although
I think that's ultimately an incoherent

1174
00:23:59,690 --> 00:23:59,700
I think that's ultimately an incoherent
 

1175
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,909
I think that's ultimately an incoherent
way to approach the problem

1176
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
way to approach the problem
 

1177
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,610
way to approach the problem
so the hard problem is focusing on the

1178
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:04,620
so the hard problem is focusing on the
 

1179
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,970
so the hard problem is focusing on the
what it is yes so the qualia that the it

1180
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:07,980
what it is yes so the qualia that the it
 

1181
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,010
what it is yes so the qualia that the it
feels like something to experience a

1182
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,020
feels like something to experience a
 

1183
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,870
feels like something to experience a
thing that's what Consciousness is and

1184
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:11,880
thing that's what Consciousness is and
 

1185
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,090
thing that's what Consciousness is and
does is more about the functional

1186
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,100
does is more about the functional
 

1187
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,810
does is more about the functional
usefulness of the thing yes yes to to

1188
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:17,820
usefulness of the thing yes yes to to
 

1189
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,510
usefulness of the thing yes yes to to
the whole beautiful mix of cognition and

1190
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:20,520
the whole beautiful mix of cognition and
 

1191
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,370
the whole beautiful mix of cognition and
just function in everyday life okay

1192
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:25,380
just function in everyday life okay
 

1193
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,630
just function in everyday life okay
uh you've also said that you can do very

1194
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:29,640
uh you've also said that you can do very
 

1195
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,210
uh you've also said that you can do very
intelligent things

1196
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:32,220
intelligent things
 

1197
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,970
intelligent things
without Consciousness yes

1198
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:34,980
without Consciousness yes
 

1199
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,710
without Consciousness yes
clearly is that obvious to you yes

1200
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720

 

1201
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,930

I don't know what I'm doing to access my

1202
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:41,940
I don't know what I'm doing to access my
 

1203
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,130
I don't know what I'm doing to access my
memory

1204
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,140
memory
 

1205
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,409
memory
it just comes up

1206
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:45,419
it just comes up
 

1207
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:50,510
it just comes up
and it comes up really intelligently

1208
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:50,520

 

1209
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,310

but the mechanisms that create

1210
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320
but the mechanisms that create
 

1211
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,990
but the mechanisms that create
Consciousness could be deeply

1212
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,000
Consciousness could be deeply
 

1213
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,110
Consciousness could be deeply
interlinked with whatever is doing the

1214
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
interlinked with whatever is doing the
 

1215
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,769
interlinked with whatever is doing the
memory access that's doing the oh I

1216
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:00,779
memory access that's doing the oh I
 

1217
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,470

think so in cognition yes yes so I guess

1218
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,480
think so in cognition yes yes so I guess
 

1219
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,350
think so in cognition yes yes so I guess
what I'm trying to say in this will uh

1220
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,360
what I'm trying to say in this will uh
 

1221
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,409
what I'm trying to say in this will uh
probably sneak up to this question a few

1222
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:09,419
probably sneak up to this question a few
 

1223
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,630
probably sneak up to this question a few
times which is whether we can build

1224
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:11,640
times which is whether we can build
 

1225
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,110
times which is whether we can build
machines that are conscious uh

1226
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
machines that are conscious uh
 

1227
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,289
machines that are conscious uh
or machines that are intelligent human

1228
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:18,299
or machines that are intelligent human
 

1229
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,390
or machines that are intelligent human
level intelligence or Beyond without

1230
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
level intelligence or Beyond without
 

1231
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,490
level intelligence or Beyond without
building the Consciousness I mean

1232
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:22,500
building the Consciousness I mean
 

1233
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,810
building the Consciousness I mean
ultimately that's one of the ways to

1234
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:23,820
ultimately that's one of the ways to
 

1235
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,450
ultimately that's one of the ways to
understand what Consciousness is is to

1236
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:26,460
understand what Consciousness is is to
 

1237
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,970
understand what Consciousness is is to
is to build the thing we can we can

1238
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:28,980
is to build the thing we can we can
 

1239
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,789
is to build the thing we can we can
either sort of from the Chomsky way try

1240
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:31,799
either sort of from the Chomsky way try
 

1241
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,070
either sort of from the Chomsky way try
to construct models like he thinks about

1242
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
to construct models like he thinks about
 

1243
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,750
to construct models like he thinks about
language in this way try to construct

1244
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
language in this way try to construct
 

1245
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,130
language in this way try to construct
models and theories of how the thing

1246
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:37,140
models and theories of how the thing
 

1247
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,990
models and theories of how the thing
works or we can just build the damn

1248
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,000
works or we can just build the damn
 

1249
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,870
works or we can just build the damn
thing exactly and that's a

1250
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:41,880
thing exactly and that's a
 

1251
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,730
thing exactly and that's a
methodological principle

1252
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:43,740
methodological principle
 

1253
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,549
methodological principle
in cognitive science in fact one of the

1254
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
in cognitive science in fact one of the
 

1255
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,769
in cognitive science in fact one of the
things that uh sort of distinguishes

1256
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:48,779
things that uh sort of distinguishes
 

1257
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:52,690
things that uh sort of distinguishes
cognitive science from other disciplines

1258
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:52,700
cognitive science from other disciplines
 

1259
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,190
cognitive science from other disciplines
dealing with the nature of cognition in

00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
dealing with the nature of cognition in
 

1261
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,130
dealing with the nature of cognition in
the mind is that cognitive science takes

1262
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,140
the mind is that cognitive science takes
 

1263
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,490
the mind is that cognitive science takes
the design stance it asks well could we

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:01,500
the design stance it asks well could we
 

1265
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,549
the design stance it asks well could we
build a machine that would not only

1266
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
build a machine that would not only
 

1267
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,190
build a machine that would not only
simulate it but serve as a bona fide

1268
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,200
simulate it but serve as a bona fide

do you find any efforts in cognitive

1272
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:12,419
do you find any efforts in cognitive
 

1273
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,169
do you find any efforts in cognitive
science compelling in this direction

1274
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:15,179
science compelling in this direction
 

1275
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,690
science compelling in this direction
in terms of how far we are there's

1276
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:17,700
in terms of how far we are there's
 

1277
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,029
in terms of how far we are there's
there's uh on the computational side of

1278
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:20,039
there's uh on the computational side of
 

1279
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,230
there's uh on the computational side of
things

1280
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,240
things
 

1281
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,970

something called cognitive modeling

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:22,980
something called cognitive modeling
 

1283
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,649
something called cognitive modeling
there's all these kinds of packages that

1284
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:24,659
there's all these kinds of packages that
 

1285
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,230
there's all these kinds of packages that
you can construct simplified models of

1286
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:27,240
you can construct simplified models of
 

1287
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,029
you can construct simplified models of
how the brain does things and see if

1288
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
how the brain does things and see if
 

1289
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,110
how the brain does things and see if
complex behaviors emerge uh do you find

1290
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
complex behaviors emerge uh do you find
 

1291
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,570
complex behaviors emerge uh do you find
any efforts in cognitive or what efforts

1292
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:35,580
any efforts in cognitive or what efforts
 

1293
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,110
any efforts in cognitive or what efforts
in cognitive science do you find most uh

1294
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
in cognitive science do you find most uh
 

1295
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,470
in cognitive science do you find most uh
inspiring and productive I think the

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
inspiring and productive I think the

and when you think about AGI do you

1338
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:33,960
and when you think about AGI do you
 

1339
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,570
and when you think about AGI do you
think about systems that have

let's go back to what I think is at the
 

1345
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,389
let's go back to what I think is at the

1361
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,889
this game and play a few other
well-designed rule-bound games but they

1362

00:29:59,870 --> 00:29:59,880
you forget
 

1461
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,909
you forget
you uh ignore things that you should

1462
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
you uh ignore things that you should
 

1463
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,549
you uh ignore things that you should
probably not ignore and that hopefully

1464
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
probably not ignore and that hopefully
 

1465
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,970
probably not ignore and that hopefully
we can Circle back to it Lux is related

1466
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:07,980
we can Circle back to it Lux is related
 

1467
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,610
we can Circle back to it Lux is related
to the meaning issue because the very

1468
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:10,620
to the meaning issue because the very
 

1469
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,370
to the meaning issue because the very
processes that make us adaptively

1470
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:13,380
processes that make us adaptively
 

1471
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,830
processes that make us adaptively
intelligent make us perennially

1472
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
intelligent make us perennially
 

1473
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,070
intelligent make us perennially
susceptible to self-deceptive

1474
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
susceptible to self-deceptive
 

1475
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,330
susceptible to self-deceptive
self-destructive Behavior because of the

1476
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:20,340
self-destructive Behavior because of the
 

1477
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,090
self-destructive Behavior because of the
way we Mis frame the environment in

1478
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,100
way we Mis frame the environment in
 

1479
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,710
way we Mis frame the environment in
fundamental ways

1480
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
fundamental ways
 

1481
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,110
fundamental ways
so to you

1482
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
so to you
 

1483
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,610
so to you
meaning is also

1484
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:31,620

 

1485
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,950

connected to ideas of wisdom and truth

1486
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:35,960
connected to ideas of wisdom and truth
 

1487
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,830
connected to ideas of wisdom and truth
and how we interpret and understand and

1488
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
and how we interpret and understand and
 

1489
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,450
and how we interpret and understand and
interact intellectually with the

1490
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:41,460
interact intellectually with the
 

1491
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,409
interact intellectually with the
environment yes so what is wisdom why do

1492
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:45,419
environment yes so what is wisdom why do
 

1493
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,110
environment yes so what is wisdom why do
we long for it how do we and where do we

1494
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,120
we long for it how do we and where do we
 

1495
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,450
we long for it how do we and where do we
find it what is it intelligence is what

1496
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:50,460
find it what is it intelligence is what
 

1497
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,310
find it what is it intelligence is what
you use to solve your problems because I

1498
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
you use to solve your problems because I
 

1499
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,330
you use to solve your problems because I
was just describing

1500
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:55,340

 

1501
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,370

rationality is how you use your

1502
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:58,380
rationality is how you use your
 

1503
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,310
rationality is how you use your
intelligence to overcome the problems of

1504
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,320
intelligence to overcome the problems of
 

1505
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,230
intelligence to overcome the problems of
self-deception that emerge when you're

1506
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,240
self-deception that emerge when you're
 

1507
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,610
self-deception that emerge when you're
trying to solve your problems so it's

1508
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:04,620
trying to solve your problems so it's
 

1509
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,169
trying to solve your problems so it's
that matter problem

1510
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:06,179
that matter problem
 

1511
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,370
that matter problem
and then the issue is do you have just

1512
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:09,380
and then the issue is do you have just
 

1513
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,889
and then the issue is do you have just
one kind of knowing I think you have

1514
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:12,899
one kind of knowing I think you have
 

1515
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:15,049
one kind of knowing I think you have
multiple ways of knowing and therefore

1516
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:15,059
multiple ways of knowing and therefore
 

1517
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,049
multiple ways of knowing and therefore
you have multiple rationalities

1518
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:18,059
you have multiple rationalities
 

1519
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,330
you have multiple rationalities
and so wisdom is to coordinate those

1520
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:20,340
and so wisdom is to coordinate those
 

1521
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,730
and so wisdom is to coordinate those
rationalities so that they are optimally

1522
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:22,740
rationalities so that they are optimally
 

1523
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,190
rationalities so that they are optimally
constraining and affording each other

1524
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,200
constraining and affording each other
 

1525
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,970
constraining and affording each other
so in that way wisdom is rationally

1526
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:27,980
so in that way wisdom is rationally
 

1527
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,830
so in that way wisdom is rationally
self-transcending rationality

1528
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:30,840
self-transcending rationality
 

1529
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,930
self-transcending rationality
right so life

1530
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:32,940
right so life
 

1531
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,049
right so life
is the kind of process where you jump

1532
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:36,059
is the kind of process where you jump
 

1533
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,889
is the kind of process where you jump
from rationality to rationality and uh

1534
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:39,899
from rationality to rationality and uh
 

1535
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,870
from rationality to rationality and uh
pick up a village of rationalities along

1536
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,880
pick up a village of rationalities along
 

1537
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,750
pick up a village of rationalities along
the way that then turns into wisdom yes

1538
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:44,760
the way that then turns into wisdom yes
 

1539
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,850
the way that then turns into wisdom yes
if properly coordinated you mentioned

1540
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:46,860
if properly coordinated you mentioned
 

1541
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,710
if properly coordinated you mentioned
framing yes so

1542
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
framing yes so
 

1543
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,330
framing yes so
what is framing is it a set of

1544
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:53,340
what is framing is it a set of
 

1545
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,490
what is framing is it a set of
assumptions you bring to the table in

1546
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:55,500
assumptions you bring to the table in
 

1547
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,610
assumptions you bring to the table in
how you see the world how you reason

1548
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:58,620
how you see the world how you reason
 

1549
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,269
how you see the world how you reason
about the world yeah how how you

1550
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:02,279
about the world yeah how how you
 

1551
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,669
about the world yeah how how you
understand the world so it depends what

1552
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:04,679
understand the world so it depends what
 

1553
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,710
understand the world so it depends what
you mean by assumptions if it by

1554
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720
you mean by assumptions if it by
 

1555
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,409
you mean by assumptions if it by
assumption you mean a proposition

1556
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:08,419
assumption you mean a proposition
 

1557
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:11,029
assumption you mean a proposition
representational or rule I think that's

1558
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
representational or rule I think that's
 

1559
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,970
representational or rule I think that's
much more Downstream from relevance

1560
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:13,980
much more Downstream from relevance
 

1561
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,350
much more Downstream from relevance
realization I think relevance

1562
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
realization I think relevance
 

1563
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,070
realization I think relevance
realization refers to

1564
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,080
realization refers to
 

1565
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,610
realization refers to
um

1566
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:19,620
um
 

1567
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,049
um
again constraints on how you are paying

1568
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:24,059
again constraints on how you are paying
 

1569
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,450
again constraints on how you are paying
attention and so

1570
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:26,460
attention and so
 

1571
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,230
attention and so
for me talking about framing is talking

1572
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240
for me talking about framing is talking
 

1573
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,310
for me talking about framing is talking
about

1574
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:31,320
about
 

1575
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,990
about
this process you're doing right now of

1576
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,000
this process you're doing right now of
 

1577
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,029
this process you're doing right now of
salience landscaping

1578
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:35,039
salience landscaping
 

1579
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,250
salience landscaping
what's Salient to you

1580
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:37,260
what's Salient to you
 

1581
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,130
what's Salient to you
and how is what Salient constantly

1582
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:40,140
and how is what Salient constantly
 

1583
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,210
and how is what Salient constantly
shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry

1584
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:44,220
shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry
 

1585
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,730
shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry
and how are you

1586
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:46,740
and how are you
 

1587
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,830
and how are you
shaping yourself

1588
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:48,840
shaping yourself
 

1589
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,409
shaping yourself
to the way that salience Landscaping is

1590
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:51,419
to the way that salience Landscaping is
 

1591
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,870
to the way that salience Landscaping is
aspectualizing the world shaping it into

1592
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:53,880
aspectualizing the world shaping it into
 

1593
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,930
aspectualizing the world shaping it into
aspects for interaction for me that is a

1594
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:56,940
aspects for interaction for me that is a
 

1595
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,169
aspects for interaction for me that is a
much more primordial process than any

1596
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:00,179
much more primordial process than any
 

1597
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:04,610
much more primordial process than any
sort of a beliefs we have and here's why

1598
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:04,620
sort of a beliefs we have and here's why
 

1599
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,430
sort of a beliefs we have and here's why
if we mean by beliefs you know a

1600
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
if we mean by beliefs you know a
 

1601
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,830
if we mean by beliefs you know a
representational proposition

1602
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840
representational proposition
 

1603
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,710
representational proposition
then we're in this very problematic

1604
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
then we're in this very problematic
 

1605
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,149
then we're in this very problematic
position

1606
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
position
 

1607
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,769
position
because then we're trying to say that

1608
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:15,779
because then we're trying to say that
 

1609
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,990
because then we're trying to say that
propositions are ultimately responsible

1610
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000
propositions are ultimately responsible
 

1611
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,049
propositions are ultimately responsible
for How We Do relevance realization

1612
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:21,059
for How We Do relevance realization
 

1613
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,610
for How We Do relevance realization
and that's problematic because

1614
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:22,620
and that's problematic because
 

1615
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,370
and that's problematic because
representations presuppose relevance

1616
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:25,380
representations presuppose relevance
 

1617
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,870
representations presuppose relevance
realization

1618
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
realization
 

1619
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,470
realization
so I represent this as a cup

1620
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
so I represent this as a cup
 

1621
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,389
so I represent this as a cup
the number of properties it actually has

1622
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399

realization yes what are the inputs and

1662
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,220
realization yes what are the inputs and
 

1663
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,829
realization yes what are the inputs and
the outputs of this thing what is it

1664
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
the outputs of this thing what is it
 

1665

what are we talking about

1666
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:23,820
what are we talking about
 

1667
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,470
what are we talking about
what we're talking about is how you are

1668
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:27,480
what we're talking about is how you are
 

1669
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,050
what we're talking about is how you are
doing something very analogous to

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,060
doing something very analogous to

evolution

1672
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:31,619
evolution
 

1673
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,849
evolution
so if you think about that adaptivity

1674
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:34,859
so if you think about that adaptivity
 

1675
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,129
so if you think about that adaptivity
isn't in the organism or in the

1676
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:37,139
isn't in the organism or in the
 

1677
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,649
isn't in the organism or in the
environment but in a dynamical relation

1678
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:39,659
environment but in a dynamical relation
 

1679
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,290
environment but in a dynamical relation
and then what does evolution do it

1680
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:42,300
and then what does evolution do it
 

1681
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,149
and then what does evolution do it
creates variation and then it puts

1682
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
creates variation and then it puts
 

1683
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,369
creates variation and then it puts
selective pressure and what that does is

1684
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:46,379
selective pressure and what that does is
 

1685
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,349
selective pressure and what that does is
that changes the niche constructions

1686
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:48,359
that changes the niche constructions
 

1687
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,849
that changes the niche constructions
that are available to a species it

1688

you just describe how it happens yes you
didn't describe what the hell it is so

make sense of you just make sense of why
 

1783
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,630
make sense of you just make sense of why
they matter what they mean to you to

1784
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:47,640
they matter what they mean to you to
 

1785
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,190
they matter what they mean to you to
your life yes and notice the language

1786
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
your life yes and notice the language
 

1787
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,690
your life yes and notice the language
you just use you're starting to use the

1788
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:50,700
you just use you're starting to use the
 

1789
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,250
you just use you're starting to use the
meaning in life language right they're

00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:52,260
meaning in life language right they're
 

1791
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,670
meaning in life language right they're
bad that's good okay that's good so what

1792
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
bad that's good okay that's good so what
 

1793
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,310
bad that's good okay that's good so what
that what what does that evolution of

1794
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,320
that what what does that evolution of
 

1795
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,569
that what what does that evolution of
your sensory motor Loop do it it

1796
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:02,579
your sensory motor Loop do it it
 

1797
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,569
your sensory motor Loop do it it
gives you and here I'll use the term for

1798
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:05,579
gives you and here I'll use the term for
 

1799

Marlo Ponte it gives you an optimal grip

1800
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:08,520
Marlo Ponte it gives you an optimal grip
 

1801
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,089
Marlo Ponte it gives you an optimal grip
on the world

1802
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:11,099
on the world
 

1803
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:15,050
on the world
so let's use your visual attention again

1804
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,060
so let's use your visual attention again
 

1805
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,270
so let's use your visual attention again
okay here's an object

1806
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
okay here's an object
 

1807
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,030
okay here's an object
how close should I be to it

1808
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,040
how close should I be to it
 

1809
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,130
how close should I be to it
is there a right what you want to do

1810
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,140
is there a right what you want to do
 

1811
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,530
is there a right what you want to do
with it exactly exactly

1812
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:24,540
with it exactly exactly
 

1813
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,490
with it exactly exactly
so you have to evolve your sensory motor

1814
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:28,500
so you have to evolve your sensory motor
 

1815
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,250
so you have to evolve your sensory motor
Loop in order to get the optimal grip

1816
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,260
Loop in order to get the optimal grip
 

1817
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,470
Loop in order to get the optimal grip
that actually creates the affordance of

okay so a mammal goes by and most people

1848
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:10,440
okay so a mammal goes by and most people
 

1849
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,010
okay so a mammal goes by and most people
will say there's a dog

1850
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,020
will say there's a dog
 

1851
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,890
will say there's a dog
now why don't they say they might but

1852
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:15,900
now why don't they say they might but
 

1853
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,870
now why don't they say they might but
typically you know probabilistically

1854
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:17,880
typically you know probabilistically
 

1855
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,910
typically you know probabilistically
they'll say there's a dog they could say

1856
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:19,920
they'll say there's a dog they could say
 

1857

they'll say there's a dog they could say
there's a German Shepherd there's a

1858

there's a German Shepherd there's a
 

1859
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,750
there's a German Shepherd there's a
mammal there's a living organism there's

they stop Eleanor Rush called these

1864
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:29,940
they stop Eleanor Rush called these
 

1865
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,270
they stop Eleanor Rush called these
basic level well what you find is that's

1866
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,280
basic level well what you find is that's
 

1867
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,190
basic level well what you find is that's
an optimal grip because it's it's

between similarity within your category
 

1873
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,790
between similarity within your category
and difference between the other

1874
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
and difference between the other
 

1875
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,190
and difference between the other
categories it's allowing you to properly

1879
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,349
fit to that object insofar as you're
setting yourself up to well I'm getting

1880
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:48,359
setting yourself up to well I'm getting
 

1881
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,569
setting yourself up to well I'm getting
so as many of the similarities and

1882
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:50,579
so as many of the similarities and
 

1883
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,970
so as many of the similarities and
differences I can on balance because

1884
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:52,980
differences I can on balance because
 

1885
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,890
differences I can on balance because
they're in a trade-off relationship that

1886

with this mammal
 

1891
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,970
with this mammal
that's optimal grip not right it's at

1892
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:01,980
that's optimal grip not right it's at
 

1893
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,250
that's optimal grip not right it's at
the level of your categorization

1894
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:04,260
the level of your categorization
 

1895
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,550
the level of your categorization
you evolve these

1896
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:06,560
you evolve these
 

1897
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,430
you evolve these
models of the world around you

1898
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:10,440
models of the world around you
 

1899
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,490
models of the world around you
and on top of them you do stuff like you

1900
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:13,500
and on top of them you do stuff like you
 

1901
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,310
and on top of them you do stuff like you
build representations like you said yes

1902
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
build representations like you said yes
 

1903
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,790

what's the salience landscape salience

1904
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:19,800
what's the salience landscape salience
 

1905
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,790
what's the salience landscape salience
meaning attention landscape

1906
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800
meaning attention landscape
 

1907
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,109
meaning attention landscape
so salience is what grabs your attention

1908
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:26,119
so salience is what grabs your attention
 

1909
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:29,390
so salience is what grabs your attention
or what results from you directing your

attention is drawn to it that's bottom
 

1917
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,230
attention is drawn to it that's bottom
up but I can also say you left big toe

and now it's Salient to you because you

1920
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:41,460
and now it's Salient to you because you
 

1921
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,770
and now it's Salient to you because you
directed your attention towards it

um The Meta problem you have when you're
solving your puzzles is that you can

00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
solving your puzzles is that you can
 

2051
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,150
solving your puzzles is that you can
often fall into self-deception you can

2052
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,160
often fall into self-deception you can
 

2053
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,250
often fall into self-deception you can
misframe self-deception right right so

2054
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:28,260
misframe self-deception right right so

2059
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,190

if what we mean by foolishness is

2060
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,200
if what we mean by foolishness is
 

2061
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,290

2063
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,089

and so what you're doing

2068
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:45,800
and so what you're doing
 

2069
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,069
and so what you're doing
is you're doing this recursive relevance

is you're doing this recursive relevance
 

2071
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,390
is you're doing this recursive relevance

2076
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:54,359
intelligence and then you're using your
 

2077
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,150

significant novelty and what can they do

2094
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:12,540
significant novelty and what can they do
 

2095
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,589
significant novelty and what can they do
they can zero in on what really matters

2096
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:15,599
they can zero in on what really matters
 

2097
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,170
they can zero in on what really matters
what's relevant and then they can shape

then that will tend to draw me back to
 

2249
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,109
then that will tend to draw me back to
it again which and you see what happens

2250
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:18,119
it again which and you see what happens
 

2251
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,790
it again which and you see what happens
which means it tends to catch my

2252

00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,010
which means it tends to catch my
attention more so that when I go into

00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:42,290
distortions of the earlier frame you
have this when you have a moment of

2415
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:42,300
have this when you have a moment of
 

2416
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,470
have this when you have a moment of
insight Insight is you doing you're you

2417
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:45,480
insight Insight is you doing you're you
 

2418
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,349
insight Insight is you doing you're you
are re-realizing what is relevant

2419
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:48,359
are re-realizing what is relevant
 

2420
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:51,829
are re-realizing what is relevant
you're going oh oh

2421
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:51,839
you're going oh oh
 

2422
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,410
you're going oh oh
I thought she was aggressive

2423
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:54,420
I thought she was aggressive
 

2424
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,530
I thought she was aggressive
and angry she's actually really afraid

2425
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:57,540
and angry she's actually really afraid
 

2426
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,930
and angry she's actually really afraid
I was misframing this

2427
00:49:59,930 --> 00:49:59,940
I was misframing this
 

2428
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,270
I was misframing this
right and you CH you change what you

2429
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:02,280
right and you CH you change what you
 

2430
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,569
right and you CH you change what you
find relevant you have those aha moments

2431
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:05,579
find relevant you have those aha moments
 

2432
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:08,329
find relevant you have those aha moments
so do you think it's possible

2433
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:08,339
so do you think it's possible
 

2434
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:12,410
so do you think it's possible
to get a a sense of objective

2435
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:12,420
to get a a sense of objective
 

2436
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,910
to get a a sense of objective
reality

2437
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
reality
 

2438
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,650
reality
so

2439
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:15,660
so
 

2440
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,870
so
is it possible to have to get to the

2441
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:17,880
is it possible to have to get to the
 

2442
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,150
is it possible to have to get to the
ground level of what something that you

2443
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,160
ground level of what something that you
 

2444
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,430
ground level of what something that you
can call objective truth

2445
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:22,440
can call objective truth
 

2446
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,390
can call objective truth
or is it are we always on Shaky Ground

2447
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400

 

2448
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,210

I think those moments of transcendence

2449
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:29,220
I think those moments of transcendence
 

2450
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,329
I think those moments of transcendence
can never get us to an absolute view

2451
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:32,339
can never get us to an absolute view
 

2452
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:34,190
can never get us to an absolute view
from nowhere

2453
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:34,200
from nowhere
 

2454
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,950
from nowhere
all right and so this is Drew Hyland's

2455
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
all right and so this is Drew Hyland's
 

2456
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,750
all right and so this is Drew Hyland's
notion of finite Transcendence we are

2457
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:38,760
notion of finite Transcendence we are
 

2458
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,150
notion of finite Transcendence we are
capable of self-transcendence and

2459
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:41,160
capable of self-transcendence and
 

2460
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,530
capable of self-transcendence and
therefore we are creatures who can

2461
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:42,540
therefore we are creatures who can
 

2462
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,569
therefore we are creatures who can
actually raise the question of Truth or

2463
00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:44,579
actually raise the question of Truth or
 

2464
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,549
actually raise the question of Truth or
goodness or beauty because I think

2465
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:46,559
goodness or beauty because I think
 

2466
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,670
goodness or beauty because I think
they're they all share this feature

2467
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:49,680
they're they all share this feature
 

2468
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,650
they're they all share this feature
but that doesn't mean we can transcend

2469
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:51,660
but that doesn't mean we can transcend
 

2470
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:55,670
but that doesn't mean we can transcend
to a godhood to some absolute view from

2471
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:55,680
to a godhood to some absolute view from
 

2472
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,329
to a godhood to some absolute view from
nowhere that takes in all information

2473
00:50:58,329 --> 00:50:58,339
nowhere that takes in all information
 

2474
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:01,250
nowhere that takes in all information
and organizes it in a comprehensive

2475
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:01,260
and organizes it in a comprehensive
 

2476
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,890
and organizes it in a comprehensive
whole but that doesn't mean that truth

2477
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:03,900
whole but that doesn't mean that truth
 

2478
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,069
whole but that doesn't mean that truth
is thereby rendered valueless

2479
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:07,079
is thereby rendered valueless
 

2480
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,930
is thereby rendered valueless
um

2481
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:08,940
um
 

2482
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,490
um
I I I think a better term is real

2483
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:13,500
I I I think a better term is real
 

2484
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,569
I I I think a better term is real
and real and illusory are comparative

2485
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:17,579
and real and illusory are comparative
 

2486
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,510
and real and illusory are comparative
terms you only know that something's an

2487
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:20,520
terms you only know that something's an
 

2488
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,530
terms you only know that something's an
illusion

2489
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:21,540
illusion
 

2490
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,470
illusion
by taking something else to be real

2491
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
by taking something else to be real
 

2492
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,930
by taking something else to be real
and so we're always in a comparative

2493
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:26,940
and so we're always in a comparative
 

2494
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,089
and so we're always in a comparative
task but that doesn't mean that we could

2495
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:29,099
task but that doesn't mean that we could
 

2496
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,970
task but that doesn't mean that we could
we can somehow jump outside of our

2497
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:31,980
we can somehow jump outside of our
 

2498
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,030
we can somehow jump outside of our
framing in some final Manner and say

2499
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,040
framing in some final Manner and say
 

2500
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,450
framing in some final Manner and say
this is how it is from a God's eye point

2501
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:38,460
this is how it is from a God's eye point
 

2502
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,730
this is how it is from a God's eye point
of view so what do you think if I may

2503
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:40,740
of view so what do you think if I may
 

2504
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,750
of view so what do you think if I may
ask

2505
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
ask
 

2506
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,390
ask
uh of somebody like iron Rand and her

2507
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
uh of somebody like iron Rand and her
 

2508
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,670
uh of somebody like iron Rand and her
philosophy of objectivism

2509
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:46,680
philosophy of objectivism
 

2510
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,710
philosophy of objectivism
so what are the core principles that

2511
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,720
so what are the core principles that
 

2512
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,450
so what are the core principles that
reality exists independently of

2513
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:50,460
reality exists independently of
 

2514
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,790
reality exists independently of
Consciousness and that human beings have

2515
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:52,800
Consciousness and that human beings have
 

2516
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,230
Consciousness and that human beings have
direct contact with reality through

2517
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
direct contact with reality through
 

2518
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,390
direct contact with reality through
sense perception so they have that you

2519
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
sense perception so they have that you
 

2520
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,170
sense perception so they have that you
do have that ability to know reality

2521
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:00,180
do have that ability to know reality
 

2522
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,630
do have that ability to know reality
there's two things knowing that there's

2523
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:02,640
there's two things knowing that there's
 

2524
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,510
there's two things knowing that there's
an independent reality is not knowing in

2525
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:05,520
an independent reality is not knowing in
 

2526
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,490
an independent reality is not knowing in
that independent reality those are not

2527
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:07,500
that independent reality those are not
 

2528
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,290
that independent reality those are not
the same thing yeah but I think

2529
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:09,300
the same thing yeah but I think
 

2530
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,950
the same thing yeah but I think
objectivism would probably

2531
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:11,960
objectivism would probably
 

2532
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,230
objectivism would probably
say that our human reason is able to

2533
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:15,240
say that our human reason is able to
 

2534
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,809
say that our human reason is able to
have contact with that then I would

2535
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:17,819
have contact with that then I would
 

2536
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:20,150
have contact with that then I would
respond and say

2537
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,160
respond and say
 

2538
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,150
respond and say
you have to I believe in fact ultimately

2539
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:23,160
you have to I believe in fact ultimately
 

2540
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,490
you have to I believe in fact ultimately
in a Conformity theory of knowing that

2541
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:25,500
in a Conformity theory of knowing that
 

2542
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,370
in a Conformity theory of knowing that
what that the deepest kind of knowing is

2543
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:28,380
what that the deepest kind of knowing is
 

2544
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,990
what that the deepest kind of knowing is
when

2545
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
when
 

2546
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,049
when
there's a a contact a Conformity between

2547
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:33,059
there's a a contact a Conformity between
 

2548
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,569
there's a a contact a Conformity between
the mind with the embodied mind and

2549
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:35,579
the mind with the embodied mind and
 

2550
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:38,870
the mind with the embodied mind and
reality but and here's where I guess I

2551
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:38,880
reality but and here's where I guess I
 

2552
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,829
reality but and here's where I guess I
push back on on Rand I would say you

2553
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:42,839
push back on on Rand I would say you
 

2554
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:45,230
push back on on Rand I would say you
have to acknowledge personal knowledge

2555
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:45,240
have to acknowledge personal knowledge
 

2556
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,870
have to acknowledge personal knowledge
as real knowledge because if you don't

2557
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:47,880
as real knowledge because if you don't
 

2558
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,370
as real knowledge because if you don't
you're going to fall preyed amino's

2559

you're going to fall preyed amino's
 

2560
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,450
you're going to fall preyed amino's

00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,030

amino's Paradox is you know it's in

could I possibly recognize it when I
 

2574
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,549
could I possibly recognize it when I
found it

2575
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:04,559
found it
 

2576
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,349
found it
I have no way of recognize it I know I

2577
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:06,359
I have no way of recognize it I know I
 

2578
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,970
I have no way of recognize it I know I
have no way of knowing that I've found

2579
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:07,980
have no way of knowing that I've found
 

2580
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,930
have no way of knowing that I've found
it

2581
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:08,940
it
 

2582
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,349
it
so I must know P but if I know P then I

2583
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:12,359
so I must know P but if I know P then I
 

2584
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:13,490
so I must know P but if I know P then I
don't need to learn about it I don't

2585
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:13,500
don't need to learn about it I don't
 

2586
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,890
don't need to learn about it I don't
need to go searching

2587
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:15,900
need to go searching
 

2588
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,349
need to go searching
so learning doesn't exist knowledge is

2589
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:18,359
so learning doesn't exist knowledge is
 

2590
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:19,549
so learning doesn't exist knowledge is
impossible

2591
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:19,559
impossible
 

2592
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:21,410
impossible
the way you break out of that Paradox is

2593
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:21,420
the way you break out of that Paradox is
 

2594
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,290
the way you break out of that Paradox is
saying no no no it is partial it is

2595
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:24,300
saying no no no it is partial it is
 

2596
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,870
saying no no no it is partial it is
possible to partially know something I

2597
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:26,880
possible to partially know something I
 

2598
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,690
possible to partially know something I
can know it enough that it will guide me

2599
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:29,700
can know it enough that it will guide me
 

2600
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,549
can know it enough that it will guide me
to recognizing it but that's not the

2601
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:31,559
to recognizing it but that's not the
 

2602
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,230
to recognizing it but that's not the
same as having a complete grasp of it

2603
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:33,240
same as having a complete grasp of it
 

2604
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,390
same as having a complete grasp of it
because I still have to search and find

2605
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:35,400
because I still have to search and find
 

2606
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,569
because I still have to search and find
what I don't yet possess in my knowledge

2607
00:53:38,569 --> 00:53:38,579
what I don't yet possess in my knowledge
 

2608
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:41,870
what I don't yet possess in my knowledge
if we so yeah partial knowledge has to

2609
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:41,880
if we so yeah partial knowledge has to
 

2610
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,030
if we so yeah partial knowledge has to
be real knowledge right personal

2611
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,040
be real knowledge right personal
 

2612
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,190
be real knowledge right personal
knowledge is still knowledge yes

2613
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:46,200
knowledge is still knowledge yes
 

2614
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,470
knowledge is still knowledge yes
what do you think about somebody like

2615
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
what do you think about somebody like
 

2616
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,410
what do you think about somebody like
Donald Hoffman who thinks the reality is

2617
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:51,420
Donald Hoffman who thinks the reality is
 

2618
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,950
Donald Hoffman who thinks the reality is
an illusion so complete illusion that

2619
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
an illusion so complete illusion that
 

2620
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,010
an illusion so complete illusion that
we're given this uh actually really nice

2621
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,020
we're given this uh actually really nice
 

2622
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,410
we're given this uh actually really nice
definition or idea that you talked about

2623
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:00,420
definition or idea that you talked about
 

2624
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,270
definition or idea that you talked about
that there's a tension between the the

2625
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:02,280
that there's a tension between the the
 

2626
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,089
that there's a tension between the the
illusory and the and what is real

2627
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:05,099
illusory and the and what is real
 

2628
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:09,470
illusory and the and what is real
he says that basically we taken that and

2629
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:09,480
he says that basically we taken that and
 

2630
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,530
he says that basically we taken that and
we ran with the reel to the point where

2631
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:12,540
we ran with the reel to the point where
 

2632
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,730
we ran with the reel to the point where
the Reel is not at all connected to some

2633
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:16,740
the Reel is not at all connected to some
 

2634
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,530
the Reel is not at all connected to some
kind of physical reality

2635
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:18,540
kind of physical reality
 

2636
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,089
kind of physical reality
well I hope to talk to him at some point

2637
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:20,099
well I hope to talk to him at some point
 

2638
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,290
well I hope to talk to him at some point
we were supposed to talk at one point

2639
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:21,300
we were supposed to talk at one point
 

2640
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,589
we were supposed to talk at one point
and so I have to talk in his absence

2641
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:24,599
and so I have to talk in his absence
 

2642
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:28,309
and so I have to talk in his absence
um I I think that first of all I think

2643
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:28,319
um I I think that first of all I think
 

2644
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,230
um I I think that first of all I think
saying that everything in his illusion

2645
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:30,240
saying that everything in his illusion
 

2646
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,910
saying that everything in his illusion
is like saying everything is tall it

2647
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
is like saying everything is tall it
 

2648
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,049
is like saying everything is tall it
doesn't make any sense it's a

2649
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:33,059
doesn't make any sense it's a
 

2650
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:34,490
doesn't make any sense it's a
comparative term

2651
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:34,500
comparative term
 

2652
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,890
comparative term
um something you have you you you have

2653
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:36,900
um something you have you you you have
 

2654
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,470
um something you have you you you have
to say against this standard of realness

2655
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:39,480
to say against this standard of realness
 

2656
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,990
to say against this standard of realness
this is an illusion

2657
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,000
this is an illusion
 

2658
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,349
this is an illusion
and

2659
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:44,359
and
 

2660
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:48,049
and
he uses arguments like from Evolution

2661
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:48,059
he uses arguments like from Evolution
 

2662
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:50,870
he uses arguments like from Evolution
which are problematic to me because it's

2663
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
which are problematic to me because it's
 

2664
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,069
which are problematic to me because it's
like well

2665
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:52,079
like well
 

2666
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,789
like well
you seem to be saying that evolution is

2667
00:54:55,789 --> 00:54:55,799
you seem to be saying that evolution is
 

2668
00:54:55,799 --> 00:55:00,170
you seem to be saying that evolution is
true that it really exists and

2669
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:00,180
true that it really exists and
 

2670
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,490
true that it really exists and
then

2671
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:01,500
then
 

2672
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,030
then
some of our cognition and a perception

2673
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:04,040
some of our cognition and a perception
 

2674
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,190
some of our cognition and a perception
has access to reality math and

2675
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
has access to reality math and
 

2676
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,349
has access to reality math and
presumably some science has access to

2677
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:09,359
presumably some science has access to
 

2678
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,109
presumably some science has access to
reality and then what he seems to be

2679
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:12,119
reality and then what he seems to be
 

2680
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,349
reality and then what he seems to be
saying is well

2681
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:14,359
saying is well
 

2682
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:17,450
saying is well
a lot of your everyday experience is

2683
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:17,460
a lot of your everyday experience is
 

2684
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,390
a lot of your everyday experience is
illusory but that we do have some

2685
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
illusory but that we do have some
 

2686
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,150
illusory but that we do have some
contact with reality whereby we can make

2687
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:23,160
contact with reality whereby we can make
 

2688
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,370
contact with reality whereby we can make
the arguments as to why most of your

2689
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:25,380
the arguments as to why most of your
 

2690
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,109
the arguments as to why most of your
experience most of your everyday

2691
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:27,119
experience most of your everyday
 

2692
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,690
experience most of your everyday
experience is an illusion but to me

2693
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:29,700
experience is an illusion but to me
 

2694
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,970
experience is an illusion but to me
that's not a novel thing that's that's

2695
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:31,980
that's not a novel thing that's that's
 

2696
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,430
that's not a novel thing that's that's
that's Descartes that's the idea that

2697
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:34,440
that's Descartes that's the idea that
 

2698
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,750
that's Descartes that's the idea that
most of our sense experience is

2699
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:35,760
most of our sense experience is
 

2700
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,150
most of our sense experience is
untrustworthy but the math is what

2701
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:38,160
untrustworthy but the math is what
 

2702
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,950
untrustworthy but the math is what
connects us to reality that's how he

2703
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:39,960
connects us to reality that's how he
 

2704
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,410
connects us to reality that's how he
interpreted the copernican revolution oh

2705
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:42,420
interpreted the copernican revolution oh
 

2706
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,270
interpreted the copernican revolution oh
look we're all seeing the sun rise and

2707
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:44,280
look we're all seeing the sun rise and
 

2708
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,370
look we're all seeing the sun rise and
move over and set and it's all an

2709
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:46,380
move over and set and it's all an
 

2710
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,069
move over and set and it's all an
illusion but the math the math gets us

2711
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:49,079
illusion but the math the math gets us
 

2712
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,049
illusion but the math the math gets us
to the reality well I think he he makes

2713
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:51,059
to the reality well I think he he makes
 

2714
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:54,650
to the reality well I think he he makes
a deeper point that most of cognition is

2715
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:54,660
a deeper point that most of cognition is
 

2716
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,250
a deeper point that most of cognition is
just is evolved and operates in the

2717
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,260
just is evolved and operates in the
 

2718
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,410
just is evolved and operates in the
illusory world how does he know that

2719
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:00,420
illusory world how does he know that
 

2720
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,030
illusory world how does he know that
things like cognition and evolution

2721
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:02,040
things like cognition and evolution
 

2722
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,770
things like cognition and evolution
exist

2723
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:03,780
exist
 

2724
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,990
exist
I think there's an important distinction

2725
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,000
I think there's an important distinction
 

2726
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,069
I think there's an important distinction
between evolution and cognition right no

2727
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
between evolution and cognition right no
 

2728
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,510
between evolution and cognition right no
no I'm just saying that's not the point

2729
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:11,520
no I'm just saying that's not the point
 

2730
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,950
no I'm just saying that's not the point
I'm making I'm making a point that he's

2731
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
I'm making I'm making a point that he's
 

2732
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,569
I'm making I'm making a point that he's
claiming that there are two things that

2733
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:14,579
claiming that there are two things that
 

2734
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,730
claiming that there are two things that
really exist

2735
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:16,740
really exist
 

2736
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,670
really exist
why are they privileged

2737
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
why are they privileged
 

2738
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,690
why are they privileged
he basically says that look the process

2739
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:23,700
he basically says that look the process
 

2740
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,809
he basically says that look the process
of evolution makes sense yes right like

2741
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:26,819
of evolution makes sense yes right like
 

2742
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:28,370
of evolution makes sense yes right like
it makes sense that you get complex

2743
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:28,380
it makes sense that you get complex
 

2744
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,289
it makes sense that you get complex
organisms from simple organisms through

2745
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:30,299
organisms from simple organisms through
 

2746
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:32,750
organisms from simple organisms through
the natural selection process here's how

2747
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:32,760
the natural selection process here's how
 

2748
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,789
the natural selection process here's how
you get to transfer information from

2749
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:34,799
you get to transfer information from
 

2750
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,829
you get to transfer information from
generation to generation it makes sense

2751
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:36,839
generation to generation it makes sense
 

2752
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:40,549
generation to generation it makes sense
and then he says that there's no

2753
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
and then he says that there's no
 

2754
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,430
and then he says that there's no
requirement for the cognition to evolve

2755
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:43,440
requirement for the cognition to evolve
 

2756
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,069
requirement for the cognition to evolve
in a way that it would actually perceive

2757
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,079
in a way that it would actually perceive
 

2758
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,349
in a way that it would actually perceive
and have direct contact with the

2759
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:48,359
and have direct contact with the
 

2760
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:50,750
and have direct contact with the
physical reality accept that cognition

2761
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:50,760
physical reality accept that cognition
 

2762
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,490
physical reality accept that cognition
evolved in such a way that it could

2763
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:52,500
evolved in such a way that it could
 

2764
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,950
evolved in such a way that it could
perceive the truth of evolution and you

2765
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
perceive the truth of evolution and you
 

2766
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,990
perceive the truth of evolution and you
can't treat Evolution like an isolated

2767
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,000
can't treat Evolution like an isolated
 

2768
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,990
can't treat Evolution like an isolated
thing Evolution depends on darwinian

2769
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000
thing Evolution depends on darwinian
 

2770
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,849
thing Evolution depends on darwinian
Theory genetics it depends on

2771
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:01,859
Theory genetics it depends on
 

2772
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:03,710
Theory genetics it depends on
understanding plate tectonics the way

2773
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:03,720
understanding plate tectonics the way
 

2774
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,530
understanding plate tectonics the way
the environment changes it depends on

2775
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:06,540
the environment changes it depends on
 

2776
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,930
the environment changes it depends on
how chromosomes are structured actually

2777
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:08,940
how chromosomes are structured actually
 

2778
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,630
how chromosomes are structured actually
that's an interesting question to him

2779
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,640
that's an interesting question to him
 

2780
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,370
that's an interesting question to him
where I don't know if he actually would

2781
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:13,380
where I don't know if he actually would
 

2782
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,370
where I don't know if he actually would
push back on this is how do you know

2783
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:16,380
push back on this is how do you know
 

2784
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,770
push back on this is how do you know
evolution is real yes

2785
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:18,780
evolution is real yes
 

2786
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,990
evolution is real yes
foreign

2787
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
foreign
 

2788
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,970
foreign
I think he would be open to the idea

2789
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:22,980
I think he would be open to the idea
 

2790
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,190
I think he would be open to the idea
that it is part of the illusion we

2791
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,200
that it is part of the illusion we
 

2792
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,710
that it is part of the illusion we
constructed that there's some it's it's

2793
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:27,720
constructed that there's some it's it's
 

2794
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,410
constructed that there's some it's it's
it's it's in some sense it is connected

2795
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:30,420
it's it's in some sense it is connected
 

2796
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,930
it's it's in some sense it is connected
to reality but we don't have a clear

2797
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:32,940
to reality but we don't have a clear
 

2798
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,650
to reality but we don't have a clear
picture of it I mean you that's a that's

2799
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:36,660
picture of it I mean you that's a that's
 

2800
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,930
picture of it I mean you that's a that's
an intellectually honest statement then

2801
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:38,940
an intellectually honest statement then
 

2802
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,809
an intellectually honest statement then
if most of our cognition yeah as

2803
00:57:41,809 --> 00:57:41,819
if most of our cognition yeah as
 

2804
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:45,589
if most of our cognition yeah as
thinking beings is operating at every

2805
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:45,599
thinking beings is operating at every
 

2806
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,349
thinking beings is operating at every
level in an illusory world

2807
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:48,359
level in an illusory world
 

2808
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:51,049
level in an illusory world
then it makes sense that this other one

2809
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:51,059
then it makes sense that this other one
 

2810
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:53,030
then it makes sense that this other one
of the main theories of science that's

2811
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
of the main theories of science that's
 

2812
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,109
of the main theories of science that's
evolution

2813
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:54,119
evolution
 

2814
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:57,829
evolution
is is also a complete part of this

2815
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:57,839
is is also a complete part of this
 

2816
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,930
is is also a complete part of this
illusory world right but then what

2817
00:57:59,930 --> 00:57:59,940
illusory world right but then what
 

2818
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,630
illusory world right but then what
happens to the premise for his argument

2819
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:01,640
happens to the premise for his argument
 

2820
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,130
happens to the premise for his argument
leading to the conclusion that cognition

2821
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:04,140
leading to the conclusion that cognition
 

2822
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,289
leading to the conclusion that cognition
is illusory I I think it makes a very

2823
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:06,299
is illusory I I think it makes a very
 

2824
00:58:06,299 --> 00:58:08,329
is illusory I I think it makes a very
specific argument about Evolution as an

2825
00:58:08,329 --> 00:58:08,339
specific argument about Evolution as an
 

2826
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:11,030
specific argument about Evolution as an
explanation of why the world is of of

2827
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
explanation of why the world is of of
 

2828
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,130
explanation of why the world is of of
our cognition operating in the loser

2829
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:13,140
our cognition operating in the loser
 

2830
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,250
our cognition operating in the loser
world but that that's just one of the

2831
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:16,260
world but that that's just one of the
 

2832
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,770
world but that that's just one of the
explanations I I think the deeper

2833
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:18,780
explanations I I think the deeper
 

2834
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,089
explanations I I think the deeper
question is

2835
00:58:20,089 --> 00:58:20,099
question is
 

2836
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:22,370
question is
why do we think we have contact with

2837
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:22,380
why do we think we have contact with
 

2838
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,910
why do we think we have contact with
reality with physical reality it's it we

2839
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:25,920
reality with physical reality it's it we
 

2840
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,630
reality with physical reality it's it we
could be very well living in a virtual

2841
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:29,640
could be very well living in a virtual
 

2842
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,549
could be very well living in a virtual
world

2843
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:30,559
world
 

2844
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,190
world
constructed by our by our minds in a way

2845
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:34,200
constructed by our by our minds in a way
 

2846
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,829
constructed by our by our minds in a way
that makes that world

2847
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:35,839
that makes that world
 

2848
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,089
that makes that world
deeply interesting in some ways whether

2849
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:38,099
deeply interesting in some ways whether
 

2850
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,370
deeply interesting in some ways whether
it's somebody playing a video game or

2851
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:40,380
it's somebody playing a video game or
 

2852
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,370
it's somebody playing a video game or
we're trying to through the process of

2853
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:43,380
we're trying to through the process of
 

2854
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,490
we're trying to through the process of
distributed cognition construct more and

2855
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:46,500
distributed cognition construct more and
 

2856
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,890
distributed cognition construct more and
more complex objects like why do we have

2857
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:48,900
more complex objects like why do we have
 

2858
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,470
more complex objects like why do we have
to why why does it have to be connected

2859
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:51,480
to why why does it have to be connected
 

2860
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,430
to why why does it have to be connected
to

2861
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:52,440
to
 

2862
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,829
to
like physics and planets and all that

2863
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:54,839
like physics and planets and all that
 

2864
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:56,510
like physics and planets and all that
kind of stuff okay so if we're going to

2865
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:56,520
kind of stuff okay so if we're going to
 

2866
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,450
kind of stuff okay so if we're going to
say like we're now considering it as a

2867
00:58:59,450 --> 00:58:59,460
say like we're now considering it as a
 

2868
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,950
say like we're now considering it as a
possibility rather than it's a

2869
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:00,960
possibility rather than it's a
 

2870
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,930
possibility rather than it's a
conclusion based on arguments because

2871
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:02,940
conclusion based on arguments because
 

2872
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,329
conclusion based on arguments because
the arguments again will always rely on

2873
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:05,339
the arguments again will always rely on
 

2874
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:07,309
the arguments again will always rely on
stipulating that there is something that

2875
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:07,319
stipulating that there is something that
 

2876
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:09,589
stipulating that there is something that
is known these are the features of

2877
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:09,599
is known these are the features of
 

2878
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,809
is known these are the features of
cognition cognition is capable of

2879
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:11,819
cognition cognition is capable of
 

2880
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:14,089
cognition cognition is capable of
Illusion that's a true statement you're

2881
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:14,099
Illusion that's a true statement you're
 

2882
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:16,309
Illusion that's a true statement you're
somehow in contact with the Mind why is

2883
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:16,319
somehow in contact with the Mind why is
 

2884
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,630
somehow in contact with the Mind why is
the mind have this privileged contact

2885
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:17,640
the mind have this privileged contact
 

2886
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,770
the mind have this privileged contact
and other aspects like my body do not so

2887
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:21,780
and other aspects like my body do not so
 

2888
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,450
and other aspects like my body do not so
that's but let's put that aside and now

2889
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:23,460
that's but let's put that aside and now
 

2890
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,049
that's but let's put that aside and now
let's just consider it now when it when

2891
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:27,059
let's just consider it now when it when
 

2892
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:28,910
let's just consider it now when it when
we put it that way it's not an epistemic

2893
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:28,920
we put it that way it's not an epistemic
 

2894
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,349
we put it that way it's not an epistemic
question anymore it's an existential

2895
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:30,359
question anymore it's an existential
 

2896
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,849
question anymore it's an existential
question and here's my reply to you

2897
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:31,859
question and here's my reply to you
 

2898
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:35,450
question and here's my reply to you
there's two possibilities either the

2899
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:35,460
there's two possibilities either the
 

2900
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,930
there's two possibilities either the
illusion is one that I cannot discover

2901
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:37,940
illusion is one that I cannot discover
 

2902
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,390
illusion is one that I cannot discover
sort of you know the The Matrix on

2903
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:41,400
sort of you know the The Matrix on
 

2904
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,609
sort of you know the The Matrix on
steroids or something there's no way no

2905
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:43,619
steroids or something there's no way no
 

2906
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,829
steroids or something there's no way no
matter what I do I can't find out that

2907
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:45,839
matter what I do I can't find out that
 

2908
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,470
matter what I do I can't find out that
it's an illusion

2909
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,480
it's an illusion
 

2910
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,910
it's an illusion
or

2911
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
or
 

2912
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,829
or
it's an illusion but I can find out that

2913
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:51,839
it's an illusion but I can find out that
 

2914
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,589
it's an illusion but I can find out that
it's an illusion

2915
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:54,599

 

2916
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:56,990

those are the two possibilities nothing

2917
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:57,000
those are the two possibilities nothing
 

2918
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,670
those are the two possibilities nothing
changes for me if those are the two

2919
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:58,680
changes for me if those are the two
 

2920
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,109
changes for me if those are the two
possibilities because if I could not

2921
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:00,119
possibilities because if I could not
 

2922
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:02,270
possibilities because if I could not
find possibly find out

2923
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:02,280
find possibly find out
 

2924
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,549
find possibly find out
it is irrational for me to pay any

2925
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:04,559
it is irrational for me to pay any
 

2926
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,970
it is irrational for me to pay any
attention to that possibility

2927
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:07,980
attention to that possibility
 

2928
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,069
attention to that possibility
so I could she I should keep doing the

2929
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:10,079
so I could she I should keep doing the
 

2930
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,349
so I could she I should keep doing the
science as I'm doing it if

2931
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:12,359
science as I'm doing it if
 

2932
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,390
science as I'm doing it if
there's a way of finding out

2933
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
there's a way of finding out
 

2934
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,030
there's a way of finding out
science is my best bet I believe for

2935
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,040
science is my best bet I believe for
 

2936
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,609
science is my best bet I believe for
finding out if it's a what's true and

2937
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:19,619
finding out if it's a what's true and
 

2938
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,170
finding out if it's a what's true and
what's an illusion so I keep doing what

2939
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:21,180
what's an illusion so I keep doing what
 

2940
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,089
what's an illusion so I keep doing what
I'm doing so it's an argument if you

2941
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:23,099
I'm doing so it's an argument if you
 

2942
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:24,829
I'm doing so it's an argument if you
move it to that that makes no

2943
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:24,839
move it to that that makes no
 

2944
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:26,829
move it to that that makes no
existential difference to me

2945
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:26,839
existential difference to me
 

2946
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:30,049
existential difference to me
oh man that is such an a deeply

2947
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:30,059
oh man that is such an a deeply
 

2948
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,089
oh man that is such an a deeply
philosophical argument no no no no no no

2949
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:32,099
philosophical argument no no no no no no
 

2950
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:34,390
philosophical argument no no no no no no
no uh

2951
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:34,400
no uh
 

2952
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,089
no uh
nobody's saying science doesn't work

2953
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:38,099
nobody's saying science doesn't work
 

2954
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:41,030
nobody's saying science doesn't work
it's an interesting question just like

2955
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,040
it's an interesting question just like
 

2956
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,670
it's an interesting question just like
before humans were able to fly they

2957
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:43,680
before humans were able to fly they
 

2958
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,829
before humans were able to fly they
would ask a question can we build a

2959
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:45,839
would ask a question can we build a
 

2960
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,049
would ask a question can we build a
machine that makes us fly in that same

2961
01:00:48,049 --> 01:00:48,059
machine that makes us fly in that same
 

2962
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:50,270
machine that makes us fly in that same
way we're asking a question to which we

2963
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:50,280
way we're asking a question to which we
 

2964
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,309
way we're asking a question to which we
don't know an answer but we may know in

2965
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:52,319
don't know an answer but we may know in
 

2966
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,450
don't know an answer but we may know in
the future

2967
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:53,460
the future
 

2968
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,210
the future
how much of this whole thing is an

2969
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:56,220
how much of this whole thing is an
 

2970
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,530
how much of this whole thing is an
illusion

2971
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:57,540
illusion
 

2972
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,990
illusion
and I think in a second category the

2973
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
and I think in a second category the
 

2974
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,089
and I think in a second category the
first guy I forgot which one yes science

2975
01:01:02,089 --> 01:01:02,099
first guy I forgot which one yes science
 

2976
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:04,569
first guy I forgot which one yes science
will be able to help us discover this

2977
01:01:04,569 --> 01:01:04,579
will be able to help us discover this
 

2978
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:07,849
will be able to help us discover this
otherwise yes for sure it doesn't matter

2979
01:01:07,849 --> 01:01:07,859
otherwise yes for sure it doesn't matter
 

2980
01:01:07,859 --> 01:01:09,829
otherwise yes for sure it doesn't matter
if we're living in a simulation we can't

2981
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:09,839
if we're living in a simulation we can't
 

2982
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,530
if we're living in a simulation we can't
find out at all yes then it doesn't

2983
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:12,540
find out at all yes then it doesn't
 

2984
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,750
find out at all yes then it doesn't
matter but yes the whole point is as we

2985
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:14,760
matter but yes the whole point is as we
 

2986
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,930
matter but yes the whole point is as we
get deeper and deeper understanding

2987
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:16,940
get deeper and deeper understanding
 

2988
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,329
get deeper and deeper understanding
of our mind of cognition

2989
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:20,339
of our mind of cognition
 

2990
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:22,609
of our mind of cognition
we might be able to discover like how

2991
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:22,619
we might be able to discover like how
 

2992
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:24,349
we might be able to discover like how
much of this is a big charade

2993
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:24,359
much of this is a big charade
 

2994
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,990
much of this is a big charade
constructed by our mind to keep us fed

2995
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:27,000
constructed by our mind to keep us fed
 

2996
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,849
constructed by our mind to keep us fed
or something like that I don't some some

2997
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:28,859
or something like that I don't some some
 

2998
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:32,210
or something like that I don't some some
weird uh some weird very simplistic

2999
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:32,220
weird uh some weird very simplistic
 

3000
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,130
weird uh some weird very simplistic
explanation that it will ultimately in

3001
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:34,140
explanation that it will ultimately in
 

3002
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,230
explanation that it will ultimately in
its Simplicity be beautiful

3003
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
its Simplicity be beautiful
 

3004
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,430
its Simplicity be beautiful
or as we try to build robots and instill

3005
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:40,440
or as we try to build robots and instill
 

3006
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,390
or as we try to build robots and instill
them instill them with Consciousness

3007
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:44,400
them instill them with Consciousness
 

3008
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,710
them instill them with Consciousness
with ability to feel

3009
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:48,720
with ability to feel
 

3010
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,870
with ability to feel
those kinds of things we'll we'll

3011
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,880
those kinds of things we'll we'll
 

3012
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,470
those kinds of things we'll we'll
discover well we let's just trick them

3013
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,480
discover well we let's just trick them
 

3014
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,750
discover well we let's just trick them
into thinking they feel and have

3015
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:56,760
into thinking they feel and have
 

3016
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,910
into thinking they feel and have
Consciousness and they'll believe it and

3017
01:01:58,910 --> 01:01:58,920
Consciousness and they'll believe it and
 

3018
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,470
Consciousness and they'll believe it and
then they'll have a deeply fulfilling

3019
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
then they'll have a deeply fulfilling
 

3020
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,809
then they'll have a deeply fulfilling
and meaningful lives and on top of that

3021
01:02:02,809 --> 01:02:02,819
and meaningful lives and on top of that
 

3022
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,730
and meaningful lives and on top of that
they will interact with us in a way that

3023
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:04,740
they will interact with us in a way that
 

3024
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,529
they will interact with us in a way that
will make our lives more meaningful and

3025
01:02:06,529 --> 01:02:06,539
will make our lives more meaningful and
 

3026
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:08,450
will make our lives more meaningful and
then all of a sudden it's like at the

3027
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:08,460
then all of a sudden it's like at the
 

3028
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,849
then all of a sudden it's like at the
end of Animal Farm you look at pigs and

3029
01:02:10,849 --> 01:02:10,859
end of Animal Farm you look at pigs and
 

3030
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:13,069
end of Animal Farm you look at pigs and
humans and you look at robots and humans

3031
01:02:13,069 --> 01:02:13,079
humans and you look at robots and humans
 

3032
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:14,450
humans and you look at robots and humans
you can't tell the difference between

3033
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:14,460
you can't tell the difference between
 

3034
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,730
you can't tell the difference between
either and we in that Way start to

3035
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:16,740
either and we in that Way start to
 

3036
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,589
either and we in that Way start to
understand that

3037
01:02:18,589 --> 01:02:18,599
understand that
 

3038
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:21,349
understand that
um that much of this existence could be

3039
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:21,359
um that much of this existence could be
 

3040
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,490
um that much of this existence could be
an illusion

3041
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:22,500
an illusion
 

3042
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,230
an illusion
okay well I have two responses to that

3043
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
okay well I have two responses to that
 

3044
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,710
okay well I have two responses to that

3050
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:35,150

01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,609
whatever the system is that's going to
be the source of intelligent more and

be the source of intelligent more and
 

3056
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,829
be the source of intelligent more and
more dynamically and recursively

that's part of what's Happening

that's part of what's Happening
 

3062

extrapolating from that you get a system

3063
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:50,460
extrapolating from that you get a system
 

3064
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,710
extrapolating from that you get a system
that gets better and better at

that gets better and better at
 

3066
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,450
that gets better and better at
self-correcting but that's exactly what

01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,450
but you're yet in another simulation I
mean that's the point that's so

3203
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:32,460
mean that's the point that's so
 

3204
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,210
mean that's the point that's so
self-correcting when you fix the

3205
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:35,220
self-correcting when you fix the
 

3206
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:36,710
self-correcting when you fix the
self-deception

3207
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
self-deception
 

3208
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,950
self-deception
you don't know if there's other bigger

3209
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:39,960
you don't know if there's other bigger
 

3210
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,510
you don't know if there's other bigger
self-deceptions you're operating of

3211
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,520
self-deceptions you're operating of
 

3212
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,789
self-deceptions you're operating of
course in in one sense that's right but

3213
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:43,799
course in in one sense that's right but
 

3214
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:45,890
course in in one sense that's right but
again we're back to when I step into the

3215
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:45,900
again we're back to when I step into the
 

3216
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,490
again we're back to when I step into the
second simulation is it uh can I get the

3217
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:49,500
second simulation is it uh can I get the
 

3218
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,829
second simulation is it uh can I get the
doorway out of that or right because if

3219
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:51,839
doorway out of that or right because if
 

3220
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,270
doorway out of that or right because if
you just make the infinite regressive

3221
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:53,280
you just make the infinite regressive
 

3222
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,490
you just make the infinite regressive
simulations you've basically said I have

3223
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:55,500
simulations you've basically said I have
 

3224
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,170
simulations you've basically said I have
a simulation that I can never get out of

3225
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:57,180
a simulation that I can never get out of
 

3226
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,970
a simulation that I can never get out of
yeah I think there's always a bigger

3227
01:05:58,970 --> 01:05:58,980
yeah I think there's always a bigger
 

3228
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,770
yeah I think there's always a bigger
pile of is the the claim I'm

3229
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:00,780
pile of is the the claim I'm
 

3230
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:04,010
pile of is the the claim I'm
trying to make here okay

3231
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,020
trying to make here okay
 

3232
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,470
trying to make here okay

sure I often ask people on this podcast

3237
01:06:11,569 --> 01:06:11,579
sure I often ask people on this podcast
 

3238
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:15,710
sure I often ask people on this podcast
or at a bar or to imaginary people I

3239
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:15,720
or at a bar or to imaginary people I
 

3240
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,750
or at a bar or to imaginary people I
talk to in a room when I'm all by myself

3241
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
talk to in a room when I'm all by myself
 

3242
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,650
talk to in a room when I'm all by myself
uh the question of the meaning of life

3243
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:21,660
uh the question of the meaning of life
 

3244
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,589
uh the question of the meaning of life
do you think this is a useful question

3245
01:06:24,589 --> 01:06:24,599
do you think this is a useful question
 

3246
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:27,349
do you think this is a useful question
you draw a line between meaning in life

3247
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:27,359
you draw a line between meaning in life
 

3248
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,230
you draw a line between meaning in life
yes and meaning of life do you think

3249
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,240
yes and meaning of life do you think
 

3250
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,630
yes and meaning of life do you think
this is a useful question no I think

3251
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:32,640
this is a useful question no I think
 

3252
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,069
this is a useful question no I think
it's like the question what's north of

3253
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
it's like the question what's north of
 

3254
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,170
it's like the question what's north of
the North Pole or what time is it on the

3255
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:36,180
the North Pole or what time is it on the
 

3256
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,849
the North Pole or what time is it on the
sun it sounds like a question but it's

3257
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:37,859
sun it sounds like a question but it's
 

3258
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,589
sun it sounds like a question but it's
actually not really a question

3259
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
actually not really a question
 

3260
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,930
actually not really a question
uh because it has a presupposition in it

3261
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:41,940
uh because it has a presupposition in it
 

3262
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,589
uh because it has a presupposition in it
that I think is fundamentally flawed

3263
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
that I think is fundamentally flawed
 

3264
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,690
that I think is fundamentally flawed
if I understand what people mean by it

3265
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:47,700
if I understand what people mean by it
 

3266
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,849
if I understand what people mean by it
and it's actually often not that clear

3267
01:06:49,849 --> 01:06:49,859
and it's actually often not that clear
 

3268
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:51,410
and it's actually often not that clear
but when they talk about the meaning of

3269
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:51,420
but when they talk about the meaning of
 

3270
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,270
but when they talk about the meaning of
life they are talking about there are

3271
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,280
life they are talking about there are
 

3272
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,170
life they are talking about there are
some feature of the universe in and of

3273
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:57,180
some feature of the universe in and of
 

3274
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,049
some feature of the universe in and of
itself that I have to discover and enter

3275
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:00,059
itself that I have to discover and enter
 

3276
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,690
itself that I have to discover and enter
into a relationship with and there's in

3277
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:02,700
into a relationship with and there's in
 

3278
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,970
into a relationship with and there's in
that sense a plan for me or something

3279
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:04,980
that sense a plan for me or something
 

3280
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:09,470
that sense a plan for me or something
and so that's a property of the universe

3281
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:09,480
and so that's a property of the universe
 

3282
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,170
and so that's a property of the universe
that's a very deep

3283
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:12,180
that's a very deep
 

3284
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,390
that's a very deep

fundamental about the structure of
 

3290
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:20,029
fundamental about the structure of
reality there were times when people

3291
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:20,039
reality there were times when people
 

3292
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,589
reality there were times when people
thought they had a world view that

3293
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:21,599
thought they had a world view that
 

3294
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,990
thought they had a world view that
legitimated it like God is running the

01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000
legitimated it like God is running the
 

3296
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,970
legitimated it like God is running the
universe and therefore and God cares

about you and there's a plan Etc

3299

about you and there's a plan Etc
 

3300
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,190
about you and there's a plan Etc
but I think a better way of

01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:31,200
but I think a better way of

01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,250
but I think a better way of
understanding meaning is not

01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:34,260
understanding meaning is not
 

3304
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,690
understanding meaning is not
right it's

3305
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:35,700
right it's
 

3306
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,309
right it's
meaning is like the graspability

3307
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:37,319
meaning is like the graspability
 

3308
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,049
meaning is like the graspability
remember I talked about optimal grip

3309
01:07:39,049 --> 01:07:39,059
remember I talked about optimal grip
 

3310
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:40,609
remember I talked about optimal grip
it's like the graspability of that cup

3311
01:07:40,609 --> 01:07:40,619
it's like the graspability of that cup
 

3312
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:43,910
it's like the graspability of that cup
is that in me no

3313
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:43,920
is that in me no
 

3314
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,250
is that in me no
is it in the cup no because the fly

3315
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:46,260
is it in the cup no because the fly
 

3316
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:49,069
is it in the cup no because the fly
can't grasp it right it well

3317
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:49,079
can't grasp it right it well
 

3318
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:50,569
can't grasp it right it well
graspability is in my hand well I can't

3319
01:07:50,569 --> 01:07:50,579
graspability is in my hand well I can't
 

3320
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:53,870
graspability is in my hand well I can't
grasp Africa no no there is a real

01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:53,880

thing with the adaptivity of an organism
 

3328
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,970
thing with the adaptivity of an organism
is the adaptivity of a great white shark

3329
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:01,980
is the adaptivity of a great white shark
 

3330
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,890
is the adaptivity of a great white shark
in the great white shark drop it in the

I think that's romantic and it

3337
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:12,359
I think that's romantic and it
 

3338
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:16,309
I think that's romantic and it
isn't in the universe it is a proper

01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:16,319
isn't in the universe it is a proper

01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,229
isn't in the universe it is a proper
relationship I've coined the phrase

3341
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
relationship I've coined the phrase
 

3342
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,269
relationship I've coined the phrase
transjective it is The Binding

3343
01:08:20,269 --> 01:08:20,279
transjective it is The Binding
 

3344
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:22,309
transjective it is The Binding
relationship between the subjective and

3345
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
relationship between the subjective and
 

3346
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,649
relationship between the subjective and
the objective and therefore when you're

3347
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:24,659
the objective and therefore when you're
 

3348
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:26,450
the objective and therefore when you're
asking

3349
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:26,460
asking
 

3350
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,610
asking
the question about the meaning of life

3351
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:28,620
the question about the meaning of life
 

3352
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,849
the question about the meaning of life
you are I think

3353
01:08:30,849 --> 01:08:30,859
you are I think
 

3354
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:33,110
you are I think
misrepresenting the nature of meaning

3355
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,120
misrepresenting the nature of meaning
 

3356
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,570
misrepresenting the nature of meaning
just like when you ask what time is it

3357
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:35,580
just like when you ask what time is it
 

3358

01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,330
and I say but why and they and and
here's my students who are usually all

3521
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:53,340
here's my students who are usually all
 

3522
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,250
here's my students who are usually all
sort of Bitten with cynicism and

3523
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:55,260
sort of Bitten with cynicism and
 

3524
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,050
sort of Bitten with cynicism and
post-modernism and they'll just say

3525
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:57,060
post-modernism and they'll just say
 

3526
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:59,870
post-modernism and they'll just say
spontaneously well because it's not real

3527
01:11:59,870 --> 01:11:59,880
spontaneously well because it's not real
 

3528
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,729
spontaneously well because it's not real
because it's not real

3529
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:01,739
because it's not real
 

3530
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:05,090
because it's not real
right so I think what you're pointing to

3531
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:05,100
right so I think what you're pointing to
 

3532
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,490
right so I think what you're pointing to
is actually

3533
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:07,500
is actually
 

3534
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,970
is actually
just like you're you're pointing not to

3535
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:10,980
just like you're you're pointing not to
 

3536
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,430
just like you're you're pointing not to
an objective or a subjective thing so

3537
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:13,440
an objective or a subjective thing so
 

3538
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,530
an objective or a subjective thing so
Romanticism says it's subjective there's

3539
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:15,540
Romanticism says it's subjective there's
 

3540
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,110
Romanticism says it's subjective there's
some sort of I guess like positivism or

3541
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:18,120
some sort of I guess like positivism or
 

3542
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,970
some sort of I guess like positivism or
locking empiricism says it's objective

3543
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:19,980
locking empiricism says it's objective
 

3544
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,470
locking empiricism says it's objective
but you're saying no no no there's

3545
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:21,480
but you're saying no no no there's
 

3546
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,330
but you're saying no no no there's
reality realization and can I get

3547
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:23,340
reality realization and can I get
 

3548
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,570
reality realization and can I get
relevance realization to be optimally

3549
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:26,580
relevance realization to be optimally
 

3550
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,209
relevance realization to be optimally
gripping in the best right relationship

3551
01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:29,219
gripping in the best right relationship
 

3552
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:31,010
gripping in the best right relationship
with it and and there's good reason you

3553
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:31,020
with it and and there's good reason you
 

3554
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,750
with it and and there's good reason you
can because think about it your

3555
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:32,760
can because think about it your
 

3556
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,450
can because think about it your
relevance realization isn't just

3557
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:34,460
relevance realization isn't just
 

3558
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,590
relevance realization isn't just
representing properties of the world

3559
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:36,600
representing properties of the world
 

3560
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,570
representing properties of the world
it's instantiating it there's something

3561
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:38,580
it's instantiating it there's something
 

3562
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,669
it's instantiating it there's something
very similar to biological evolution

3563
01:12:40,669 --> 01:12:40,679
very similar to biological evolution
 

3564
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:43,130
very similar to biological evolution
which is that the guts of life if I'm

3565
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:43,140
which is that the guts of life if I'm
 

3566
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,530
which is that the guts of life if I'm
right running your cognition is not just

3567
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:45,540
right running your cognition is not just
 

3568
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:48,550
right running your cognition is not just
that you are have ideas you actually

3569
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:48,560
that you are have ideas you actually
 

3570
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,450
that you are have ideas you actually
instantiate that's what I mean by

3571
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:50,460
instantiate that's what I mean by
 

3572
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,910
instantiate that's what I mean by
Conformity the same principles they're

3573
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:52,920
Conformity the same principles they're
 

3574
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,590
Conformity the same principles they're
within and without they don't belong to

3575
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:54,600
within and without they don't belong to
 

3576
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,270
within and without they don't belong to
you subjectively they're not just out

3577
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:56,280
you subjectively they're not just out
 

3578
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,490
you subjectively they're not just out
there they're both at the same time and

3579
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:58,500
there they're both at the same time and
 

3580
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,410
there they're both at the same time and
they help to explain how you are

3581
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:00,420
they help to explain how you are
 

3582
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,830
they help to explain how you are
actually bound to The evolutionary world

3583
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:03,840
actually bound to The evolutionary world
 

3584
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,050
actually bound to The evolutionary world
yeah so it comes from both inside and

3585
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:06,060
yeah so it comes from both inside and
 

3586
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,450
yeah so it comes from both inside and
from the outside yeah but there's still

3587
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:08,460
from the outside yeah but there's still
 

3588
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,229
from the outside yeah but there's still
the question of the meaning of life

3589
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,239
the question of the meaning of life
 

3590
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,450
the question of the meaning of life
first of all uh the big benefit of that

3591
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:14,460
first of all uh the big benefit of that
 

3592
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,669
first of all uh the big benefit of that
question is that it shakes you out of

3593
01:13:16,669 --> 01:13:16,679
question is that it shakes you out of
 

3594
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:19,610
question is that it shakes you out of
your hamster in a wheel

3595
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:19,620
your hamster in a wheel
 

3596
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:22,310
your hamster in a wheel
that is daily life the mundane process

3597
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:22,320
that is daily life the mundane process
 

3598
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,649
that is daily life the mundane process
of daily life where you have a schedule

3599
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:24,659
of daily life where you have a schedule
 

3600
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:27,050
of daily life where you have a schedule
you wake up you have kids you have to

3601
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:27,060
you wake up you have kids you have to
 

3602
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,970
you wake up you have kids you have to
take them to school then you go to work

3603
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:28,980
take them to school then you go to work
 

3604
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:29,950
take them to school then you go to work
and

3605
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:29,960
and
 

3606
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,970
and
repeats over and over and over and over

3607
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:31,980
repeats over and over and over and over
 

3608
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:34,729
repeats over and over and over and over
and then you get it increased salary and

3609
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:34,739
and then you get it increased salary and
 

3610
01:13:34,739 --> 01:13:36,229
and then you get it increased salary and
then you upgrade the home and that whole

3611
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:36,239
then you upgrade the home and that whole
 

3612
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,450
then you upgrade the home and that whole
process

3613
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:37,460
process
 

3614
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:41,030
process
uh meaning asking about the meaning of

3615
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,040
uh meaning asking about the meaning of
 

3616
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:41,810
uh meaning asking about the meaning of
life

3617
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:41,820
life
 

3618
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:46,550
life
is so so full of romantic

3619
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560
is so so full of romantic
 

3620
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,830
is so so full of romantic
that if you take it if you just allow

3621
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:48,840
that if you take it if you just allow
 

3622
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,810
that if you take it if you just allow
yourself to take it seriously for a

3623
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:50,820
yourself to take it seriously for a
 

3624
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:51,770
yourself to take it seriously for a
second

3625
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:51,780
second
 

3626
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,610
second
it forces you to pause and think like

3627
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:55,620
it forces you to pause and think like
 

3628
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,689
it forces you to pause and think like
what

3629
01:13:56,689 --> 01:13:56,699
what
 

3630
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:59,030
what
what's going on here and then It

3631
01:13:59,030 --> 01:13:59,040
what's going on here and then It
 

3632
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,709
what's going on here and then It
ultimately I think does return to the

3633
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
ultimately I think does return to the
 

3634
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,229
ultimately I think does return to the
question of meaning in those mundane

3635
01:14:03,229 --> 01:14:03,239
question of meaning in those mundane
 

3636
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,290
question of meaning in those mundane
things yes what gives what gives my life

3637
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:06,300
things yes what gives what gives my life
 

3638
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:10,370
things yes what gives what gives my life
Joy what gives it lasting

3639
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:10,380
Joy what gives it lasting
 

3640
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,430
Joy what gives it lasting
um deliciousness where do I notice the

3641
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,440
um deliciousness where do I notice the
 

3642
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,930
um deliciousness where do I notice the
magic and how can I have that magic

3643
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:14,940
magic and how can I have that magic
 

3644
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,390
magic and how can I have that magic
return again and again Beauty

3645
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:17,400
return again and again Beauty
 

3646
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,030
return again and again Beauty
and that that ultimately what it returns

3647
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:20,040
and that that ultimately what it returns
 

3648
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,950
and that that ultimately what it returns
to but it's a the same thing you do when

3649
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:21,960
to but it's a the same thing you do when
 

3650
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,930
to but it's a the same thing you do when
you look up to the sky you spend most of

3651
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:23,940
you look up to the sky you spend most of
 

3652
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:26,270
you look up to the sky you spend most of
your day hurrying around looking at

3653
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:26,280
your day hurrying around looking at
 

3654
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,649
your day hurrying around looking at
things on the surface but when you look

3655
01:14:27,649 --> 01:14:27,659
things on the surface but when you look
 

3656
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:29,810
things on the surface but when you look
up the sky and you see the stars

3657
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:29,820
up the sky and you see the stars
 

3658
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:33,110
up the sky and you see the stars
it fills you with the feeling of awe

3659
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
it fills you with the feeling of awe
 

3660
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,630
it fills you with the feeling of awe
that forces you to pause and think in

3661
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:35,640
that forces you to pause and think in
 

3662
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,689
that forces you to pause and think in
full context of like what the hell is

3663
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:38,699
full context of like what the hell is
 

3664
01:14:38,699 --> 01:14:42,169
full context of like what the hell is
going on here that but also I think

3665
01:14:42,169 --> 01:14:42,179
going on here that but also I think
 

3666
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:45,490
going on here that but also I think
um there is a

3667
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:45,500

 

3668
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,990

when you think too much about the

3669
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:48,000
when you think too much about the
 

3670
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,090
when you think too much about the
meaning of a glass

3671
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:50,100
meaning of a glass
 

3672
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,110
meaning of a glass
and uh relevance realization of a glass

3673
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
and uh relevance realization of a glass
 

3674
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,450
and uh relevance realization of a glass
you don't necessarily get at the core of

3675
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:56,460
you don't necessarily get at the core of
 

3676
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,550
you don't necessarily get at the core of
what makes music Beautiful

01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,560
what makes music Beautiful
 

3678
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,709
what makes music Beautiful
so sometimes you have to start at the

3679
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:00,719
so sometimes you have to start at the
 

3680
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,570
so sometimes you have to start at the
biggest picture first and I think

3681
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:02,580
biggest picture first and I think
 

3682
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,209
biggest picture first and I think
meaning of life forces you to really go

3683
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:05,219
meaning of life forces you to really go
 

3684
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:08,510
meaning of life forces you to really go
to the big bang and go go go to the go

3685
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:08,520
to the big bang and go go go to the go
 

3686
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,510
to the big bang and go go go to the go
to the universe and the whole thing the

3687
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:11,520
to the universe and the whole thing the
 

3688
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,970
to the universe and the whole thing the
origin of life and I think

3689
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:13,980
origin of life and I think
 

3690
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:14,570
origin of life and I think
um

3691
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:14,580
um
 

3692
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:16,550
um
sometimes you have to start there to

3693
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
sometimes you have to start there to
 

3694
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,130
sometimes you have to start there to
discover the meaning in the day-to-day

3695
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:19,140
discover the meaning in the day-to-day
 

3696
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,689
discover the meaning in the day-to-day
I think

3697
01:15:20,689 --> 01:15:20,699
I think
 

3698
01:15:20,699 --> 01:15:24,250
I think
but perhaps you would disagree

3699
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:24,260
but perhaps you would disagree
 

3700
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:26,870
but perhaps you would disagree
insofar as the question makes you ask

3701
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
insofar as the question makes you ask
 

3702
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,729
insofar as the question makes you ask
about

3703
01:15:28,729 --> 01:15:28,739
about
 

3704
01:15:28,739 --> 01:15:31,729
about
um the the whole of your life and how

3705
01:15:31,729 --> 01:15:31,739
um the the whole of your life and how
 

3706
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:33,110
um the the whole of your life and how
much meaning is in the whole of your

3707
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:33,120
much meaning is in the whole of your
 

3708
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,250
much meaning is in the whole of your
life

3709
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:34,260
life
 

3710
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,490
life
and insofar as it asks how much that is

3711
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:37,500
and insofar as it asks how much that is
 

3712
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,930
and insofar as it asks how much that is
connected to reality it's a good

3713
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:38,940
connected to reality it's a good
 

3714
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,490
connected to reality it's a good
question

3715
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:40,500
question
 

3716
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,790
question
but it's a bad question in that it also

3717
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:43,800
but it's a bad question in that it also
 

3718
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,830
but it's a bad question in that it also
makes you look for the answers in the

3719
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
makes you look for the answers in the
 

3720
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,890
makes you look for the answers in the
wrong way now you said and I agree with

3721
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:48,900
wrong way now you said and I agree with
 

3722
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,229
wrong way now you said and I agree with
what you said what how we really answer

3723
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:51,239
what you said what how we really answer
 

3724
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:52,850
what you said what how we really answer
this question is we come back to the

3725
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:52,860
this question is we come back to the
 

3726
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,250
this question is we come back to the
meaning in life and we see how much that

3727
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:55,260
meaning in life and we see how much that
 

3728
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,950
meaning in life and we see how much that
meaning in life is connected to reality

3729
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:57,960
meaning in life is connected to reality
 

3730
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,810
meaning in life is connected to reality
we pursue wisdom

3731
01:15:59,810 --> 01:15:59,820
we pursue wisdom
 

3732
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:03,830
we pursue wisdom
and so for me the ques I don't need that

3733
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:03,840
and so for me the ques I don't need that
 

3734
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,110
and so for me the ques I don't need that
question in order to provoke me into

3735
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:06,120
question in order to provoke me into
 

3736
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,030
question in order to provoke me into
that stance

3737
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:08,040
that stance
 

3738
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,669
that stance
so let's return to the meaning crisis

3739
01:16:10,669 --> 01:16:10,679
so let's return to the meaning crisis
 

3740
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:12,410
so let's return to the meaning crisis
yes

3741
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:12,420
yes
 

3742
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,890
yes
what is the nature of the meaning crisis

01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:15,900
what is the nature of the meaning crisis
 

3744
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,189
what is the nature of the meaning crisis
in modern times what's its origin what's

in modern times what's its origin what's
its explanation well remember what I

in a purely secular framework
 

3944
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,470
in a purely secular framework
by many of the measures we use to try to

3945
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
by many of the measures we use to try to
 

3946
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,110
by many of the measures we use to try to
study wisdom scientifically the people

3947
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
study wisdom scientifically the people
 

3948
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,010
study wisdom scientifically the people
in the religious paths do better than

3949
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:31,020
in the religious paths do better than
 

3950
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,590
in the religious paths do better than
the secular but here's the important

3951
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
the secular but here's the important
 

3952
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,629
the secular but here's the important
Point there's no significant difference

3953
01:20:35,629 --> 01:20:35,639
Point there's no significant difference
 

3954
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:38,270
Point there's no significant difference
between the religious paths

3955
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:38,280
between the religious paths
 

3956
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,729
between the religious paths
so it's not like if you're you know

3957
01:20:40,729 --> 01:20:40,739
so it's not like if you're you know
 

3958
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:42,350
so it's not like if you're you know
following the path of Judaism you're

3959
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:42,360
following the path of Judaism you're
 

3960
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,629
following the path of Judaism you're
more likely to end up wiser than if you

3961
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:44,639
more likely to end up wiser than if you
 

3962
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,610
more likely to end up wiser than if you
follow Buddhism by the way I don't know

3963
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:46,620
follow Buddhism by the way I don't know
 

3964
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,169
follow Buddhism by the way I don't know
if that's my case I was making the case

3965
01:20:48,169 --> 01:20:48,179
if that's my case I was making the case
 

3966
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:49,550
if that's my case I was making the case
that you don't need to have a religious

3967
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:49,560
that you don't need to have a religious
 

3968
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,910
that you don't need to have a religious
affiliation to search for wisdom it's

3969
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:52,920
affiliation to search for wisdom it's
 

3970
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,729
affiliation to search for wisdom it's
that I thought along to the point you

3971
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:55,739
that I thought along to the point you
 

3972
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:57,590
that I thought along to the point you
just made that it doesn't matter which

3973
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:57,600
just made that it doesn't matter which
 

3974
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,110
just made that it doesn't matter which
religious affiliation or none but that's

3975
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:00,120
religious affiliation or none but that's
 

3976
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,629
religious affiliation or none but that's
what I'm saying it okay so this is the

3977
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:02,639
what I'm saying it okay so this is the
 

3978
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,729
what I'm saying it okay so this is the
tricky thing we're in yeah it does

3979
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:04,739
tricky thing we're in yeah it does
 

3980
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:06,770
tricky thing we're in yeah it does
matter if you're in one but it doesn't

3981
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:06,780
matter if you're in one but it doesn't
 

3982
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:09,470
matter if you're in one but it doesn't
matter sort of the propositional Creeds

3983
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:09,480
matter sort of the propositional Creeds
 

3984
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,810
matter sort of the propositional Creeds
of that there's something else at work

3985
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:11,820
of that there's something else at work
 

3986
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,669
of that there's something else at work
there's a if you'll allow me this

3987
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:13,679
there's a if you'll allow me this
 

3988

we lost when we rejected all the
 

3992
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,990
we lost when we rejected all the

01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,669
if I may interrupt is that connected to
the hard problem of Consciousness the

4151
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:13,679
the hard problem of Consciousness the
 

4152
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,770
the hard problem of Consciousness the
subject the qualia or is that a

4153
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:15,780
subject the qualia or is that a
 

4154
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:17,689
subject the qualia or is that a
different that kind of knowing is that

4155
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:17,699
different that kind of knowing is that
 

4156
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:18,830
different that kind of knowing is that
different from the quality of

4157
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:18,840
different from the quality of
 

4158
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,629
different from the quality of
Consciousness I think it has to do with

4159
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:20,639
Consciousness I think it has to do with
 

4160
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,010
Consciousness I think it has to do with
well I make a distinction between the

4161
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,020
well I make a distinction between the
 

4162
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,050
well I make a distinction between the
adjectival and the adverbial qualia so I

4163
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:24,060
adjectival and the adverbial qualia so I
 

4164
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,490
adjectival and the adverbial qualia so I
think it has to do with the adverbial

4165
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:25,500
think it has to do with the adverbial
 

4166
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,169
think it has to do with the adverbial
quality are much more with the than with

4167
01:24:27,169 --> 01:24:27,179
quality are much more with the than with
 

4168
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:28,910
quality are much more with the than with
the adjectival so the adjectival quality

4169
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:28,920
the adjectival so the adjectival quality
 

4170
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,790
the adjectival so the adjectival quality
are like the greenness of green and the

4171
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:31,800
are like the greenness of green and the
 

4172
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,610
are like the greenness of green and the
blueness of balloon the adverbial qualia

4173
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:34,620
blueness of balloon the adverbial qualia
 

4174
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,290
blueness of balloon the adverbial qualia
are

4175
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:36,300
are
 

4176
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,030
are
the hereness

4177
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:38,040
the hereness
 

4178
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:41,270
the hereness
the nowness the togetherness yeah

4179
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:41,280
the nowness the togetherness yeah
 

4180
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,950
the nowness the togetherness yeah
and I think the perspective of knowing

4181
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:42,960
and I think the perspective of knowing
 

4182
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,390
and I think the perspective of knowing
has a lot to do with the adverbial

4183
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,400
has a lot to do with the adverbial
 

4184
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,990
has a lot to do with the adverbial
qualia adjectival qualia and adverbial

4185
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:48,000
qualia adjectival qualia and adverbial
 

4186
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,790
qualia adjectival qualia and adverbial
quality I'm learning so many new things

4187
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:49,800
quality I'm learning so many new things
 

4188
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,390
quality I'm learning so many new things
today okay so uh that's another way of

4189
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:53,400
today okay so uh that's another way of
 

4190
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,950
today okay so uh that's another way of
knowing right the perspective and then

4191
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:54,960
knowing right the perspective and then
 

4192
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,330
knowing right the perspective and then
there's a deeper one

4193
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:56,340
there's a deeper one
 

4194
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,430
there's a deeper one
and this is a philosophical Point uh and

4195
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:58,440
and this is a philosophical Point uh and
 

4196
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,290
and this is a philosophical Point uh and
I don't wanna we can go through the

4197
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:00,300
I don't wanna we can go through the
 

4198
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,330
I don't wanna we can go through the
argument right but you don't have to

4199
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:02,340
argument right but you don't have to
 

4200
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,830
argument right but you don't have to
know that you know in order to know

4201
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840
know that you know in order to know
 

4202
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,810
know that you know in order to know
because if you start doing that you get

4203
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:05,820
because if you start doing that you get
 

4204
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,250
because if you start doing that you get
an infinite regress there have there has

4205
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:07,260
an infinite regress there have there has
 

4206
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,510
an infinite regress there have there has
to be kinds of knowing that doesn't mean

4207
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:08,520
to be kinds of knowing that doesn't mean
 

4208
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,530
to be kinds of knowing that doesn't mean
you know that you know that

4209
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:11,540

 

4210
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:15,189

yeah okay of course okay great okay good

4211
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:15,199
yeah okay of course okay great okay good
 

4212
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,810
yeah okay of course okay great okay good
well there was a lot of ink spilled over

4213
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:17,820
well there was a lot of ink spilled over
 

4214
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,790
well there was a lot of ink spilled over
that over a 40-year period so by

4215
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:19,800
that over a 40-year period so by
 

4216
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,590
that over a 40-year period so by
philosophers they spilled this is what

4217
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600
philosophers they spilled this is what
 

4218
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,229
philosophers they spilled this is what
they do There's the link yeah but I want

4219
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
they do There's the link yeah but I want
 

4220
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,970
they do There's the link yeah but I want
to talk for ink spillage so I want to

4221
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:25,980
to talk for ink spillage so I want to
 

4222
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,350
to talk for ink spillage so I want to
talk about

4223
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:27,360
talk about
 

4224
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,570
talk about
what I call participatory knowing this

4225
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:29,580
what I call participatory knowing this
 

4226
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:33,169
what I call participatory knowing this
is the idea that you and the world are

4227
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:33,179
is the idea that you and the world are
 

4228
01:25:33,179 --> 01:25:35,810
is the idea that you and the world are
co-participating in things and such that

4229
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:35,820
co-participating in things and such that
 

4230
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:38,870
co-participating in things and such that
real affordances exist between you so

4231
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:38,880
real affordances exist between you so
 

4232
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,750
real affordances exist between you so
both me and this environment are shaped

4233
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:41,760
both me and this environment are shaped
 

4234
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,270
both me and this environment are shaped
by gravity so the affordance of walking

4235
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:44,280
by gravity so the affordance of walking
 

4236
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:48,590
by gravity so the affordance of walking
becomes available to me both me and a

4237
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:48,600
becomes available to me both me and a
 

4238
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,930
becomes available to me both me and a
lot of this environment are shaped by my

4239
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:50,940
lot of this environment are shaped by my
 

4240
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:54,169
lot of this environment are shaped by my
biology and so affordances for that are

4241
01:25:54,169 --> 01:25:54,179
biology and so affordances for that are
 

4242
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:55,430
biology and so affordances for that are
here

4243
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:55,440
here
 

4244
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,470
here
look at this cup

4245
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:57,480
look at this cup
 

4246
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,090
look at this cup
shared physics

4247
01:25:59,090 --> 01:25:59,100
shared physics
 

4248
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,970
shared physics
shared sort of biological factors look

4249
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:01,980
shared sort of biological factors look
 

4250
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:05,330
shared sort of biological factors look
at my hand i'm bipedal yeah also culture

4251
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:05,340
at my hand i'm bipedal yeah also culture
 

4252
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,370
at my hand i'm bipedal yeah also culture
is shaping me and shaping this I had to

4253
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:07,380
is shaping me and shaping this I had to
 

4254
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:09,590
is shaping me and shaping this I had to
learn how to use that and treat it as a

4255
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
learn how to use that and treat it as a
 

4256
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,450
learn how to use that and treat it as a
cup so

4257
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:11,460
cup so
 

4258
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,669
cup so
this is an agent Arena relationship

4259
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
this is an agent Arena relationship
 

4260
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,330
this is an agent Arena relationship
right there's identities in being

4261
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:17,340
right there's identities in being
 

4262
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:20,090
right there's identities in being
created in your agency identity is being

4263
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,100
created in your agency identity is being
 

4264
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,790
created in your agency identity is being
created in the world as an arena so you

4265
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:22,800
created in the world as an arena so you
 

4266
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,010
created in the world as an arena so you
and the world fit together you know when

4267
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:25,020
and the world fit together you know when
 

4268
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:27,530
and the world fit together you know when
that's missing when you're really lonely

4269
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:27,540
that's missing when you're really lonely
 

4270
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:30,169
that's missing when you're really lonely
or you're homesick or you're suffering

4271
01:26:30,169 --> 01:26:30,179
or you're homesick or you're suffering
 

4272
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:32,390
or you're homesick or you're suffering
culture shock so this this is

4273
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:32,400
culture shock so this this is
 

4274
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,970
culture shock so this this is
participatory knowing and it's the sense

4275
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:34,980
participatory knowing and it's the sense
 

4276
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:38,450
participatory knowing and it's the sense
of it comes with a sense of belonging

4277
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:38,460
of it comes with a sense of belonging
 

4278
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:42,830
of it comes with a sense of belonging
at every level so the ability to walk is

4279
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:42,840
at every level so the ability to walk is
 

4280
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,770
at every level so the ability to walk is
a kind of nothing yes yes that that

4281
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:45,780
a kind of nothing yes yes that that
 

4282
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:47,689
a kind of nothing yes yes that that
there's a dance between the physics that

4283
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:47,699
there's a dance between the physics that
 

4284
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:51,129
there's a dance between the physics that
enables yes this process and just

4285
01:26:51,129 --> 01:26:51,139
enables yes this process and just
 

4286
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:53,750
enables yes this process and just
participating in the process is the act

4287
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
participating in the process is the act
 

4288
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,570
participating in the process is the act
of knowing right and there's a really

4289
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:56,580
of knowing right and there's a really
 

4290
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,610
of knowing right and there's a really
weird form of memory you have for this

4291
01:26:58,610 --> 01:26:58,620
weird form of memory you have for this
 

4292
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:01,189
weird form of memory you have for this
kind of knowing it's called yourself

4293
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:01,199
kind of knowing it's called yourself
 

4294
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:05,050
kind of knowing it's called yourself
what can you elaborate well you you so

4295
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:05,060
what can you elaborate well you you so
 

4296
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:07,610
what can you elaborate well you you so
so we talked about how all the how all

4297
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:07,620
so we talked about how all the how all
 

4298
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,350
so we talked about how all the how all
the different other kinds of knowing had

4299
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:09,360
the different other kinds of knowing had
 

4300
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,510
the different other kinds of knowing had
specific kinds of memory semantic memory

4301
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:11,520
specific kinds of memory semantic memory
 

4302
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,550
specific kinds of memory semantic memory
for propositional procedural right

4303
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:13,560
for propositional procedural right
 

4304
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:16,010

01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:18,290
episodic for perspectival
what do you what's the kind of memory

4307
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:18,300
what do you what's the kind of memory
 

4308
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,990
what do you what's the kind of memory
that is the coordinated Storehouse of

4309
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:21,000
that is the coordinated Storehouse of
 

4310
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,149
that is the coordinated Storehouse of
all of your agent Arena relationships

4311
01:27:23,149 --> 01:27:23,159
all of your agent Arena relationships
 

4312
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:25,550
all of your agent Arena relationships
all the roles you can take all the

4313
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:25,560
all the roles you can take all the
 

4314
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,410
all the roles you can take all the
identities you can assume all the

4315
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:27,420
identities you can assume all the
 

4316
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:29,450
identities you can assume all the
identities you can have what what's the

4317
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:29,460
identities you can have what what's the
 

4318
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,370
identities you can have what what's the
self do you mean like Consciousness or

4319
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:31,380
self do you mean like Consciousness or
 

4320
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,729
self do you mean like Consciousness or
like senior sense of self sense of self

4321
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:34,739
like senior sense of self sense of self
 

4322
01:27:34,739 --> 01:27:37,270
like senior sense of self sense of self
in this world that's not Consciousness

4323
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
in this world that's not Consciousness
 

4324
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,550
in this world that's not Consciousness
that's uh like an agency or something

4325
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,560
that's uh like an agency or something
 

4326
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,709
that's uh like an agency or something
right it's an agent Arena relationship

4327
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:42,719
right it's an agent Arena relationship
 

4328
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:45,530
right it's an agent Arena relationship
and so in an agent Arena relationship

4329
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:45,540
and so in an agent Arena relationship
 

4330
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:49,010
and so in an agent Arena relationship
it's the sense of the agent

4331
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:49,020
it's the sense of the agent
 

4332
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,890
it's the sense of the agent
and and and that the agent belongs in

4333
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:51,900
and and and that the agent belongs in
 

4334
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,810
and and and that the agent belongs in
that Arena whatever the agent is

4335
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:53,820
that Arena whatever the agent is
 

4336
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,310
that Arena whatever the agent is
whatever the arena is because there's

4337
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:55,320
whatever the arena is because there's
 

4338
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,490
whatever the arena is because there's
probably a bunch of yes different

4339
01:27:58,490 --> 01:27:58,500
probably a bunch of yes different
 

4340
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,030
probably a bunch of yes different
framings of how you experience that yeah

4341
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,040
framings of how you experience that yeah
 

4342
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,430
framings of how you experience that yeah
and you and you do you have all within

4343
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:04,440
and you and you do you have all within
 

4344
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,590
and you and you do you have all within
your identity as a self you have all

4345
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:06,600
your identity as a self you have all
 

4346
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,570
your identity as a self you have all
kinds of roles that are somehow

4347
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:08,580
kinds of roles that are somehow
 

4348
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:10,790
kinds of roles that are somehow
contributing to that identity but are

4349
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:10,800
contributing to that identity but are
 

4350
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,830
contributing to that identity but are
not equivalent to that identity

4351
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:12,840
not equivalent to that identity
 

4352
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,270
not equivalent to that identity
yeah

4353
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:14,280
yeah
 

4354
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,129
yeah
I wonder if like my two hands have

4355
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:16,139
I wonder if like my two hands have
 

4356
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:18,470
I wonder if like my two hands have
different

4357
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:18,480

 

4358
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,090

because there's a different experience

4359
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:20,100
because there's a different experience
 

4360
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,590
because there's a different experience
of me picking up something with my right

4361
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:21,600
of me picking up something with my right
 

4362
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,350
of me picking up something with my right
hand and then my left hand

4363
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:24,360
hand and then my left hand
 

4364
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,709
hand and then my left hand
so are those like uh

4365
01:28:27,709 --> 01:28:27,719
so are those like uh
 

4366
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,410
so are those like uh
that's a really cool question Lex and

4367
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:30,420
that's a really cool question Lex and
 

4368
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:32,030
that's a really cool question Lex and
they certainly feel like their own

4369
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:32,040
they certainly feel like their own
 

4370
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,310
they certainly feel like their own
things

4371
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:34,320
things
 

4372
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,610
things
and but that could be just uh

4373
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:36,620
and but that could be just uh
 

4374
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:38,689
and but that could be just uh
anthropomorphization based on cultural

4375
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:38,699
anthropomorphization based on cultural
 

4376
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:41,030
anthropomorphization based on cultural
narratives and so on it could but I

4377
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,040
narratives and so on it could but I
 

4378
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,110
narratives and so on it could but I
think it's a legitimate empirical

4379
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:42,120
think it's a legitimate empirical
 

4380
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,610
think it's a legitimate empirical
question because it also could be sort

4381
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:43,620
question because it also could be sort
 

4382
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,189
question because it also could be sort
of email Gilchrist stuff it could be

4383
01:28:46,189 --> 01:28:46,199
of email Gilchrist stuff it could be
 

4384
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:48,350
of email Gilchrist stuff it could be
you're using different hemispheres and

4385
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:48,360
you're using different hemispheres and
 

4386
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,390
you're using different hemispheres and
they sort of have different agent Arena

4387
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:50,400
they sort of have different agent Arena
 

4388
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,310
they sort of have different agent Arena
relationships to the environment this is

4389
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:52,320
relationships to the environment this is
 

4390
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,510
relationships to the environment this is
a really important question in the

4391
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:53,520
a really important question in the
 

4392
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,669
a really important question in the
cognitive science of the self does the

4393
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:55,679
cognitive science of the self does the
 

4394
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,350
cognitive science of the self does the
does that hemispheric difference mean

4395
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:57,360
does that hemispheric difference mean
 

4396
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,149
does that hemispheric difference mean
you're multiple or you actually have a

4397
01:28:59,149 --> 01:28:59,159
you're multiple or you actually have a
 

4398
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:01,250
you're multiple or you actually have a
singular self oh so it's important to

4399
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:01,260
singular self oh so it's important to
 

4400
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,470
singular self oh so it's important to
understand how many uh cells are there

4401
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:03,480
understand how many uh cells are there
 

4402
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,110
understand how many uh cells are there
yes I think so but that's that's just

4403
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:06,120
yes I think so but that's that's just
 

4404
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,629
yes I think so but that's that's just
like a quirk of evolution that's a it's

4405
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:08,639
like a quirk of evolution that's a it's
 

4406
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,850
like a quirk of evolution that's a it's
not it surely can be fundamental to

4407
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:10,860
not it surely can be fundamental to
 

4408
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,310
not it surely can be fundamental to
cognition having multiple cells are a

4409
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:13,320
cognition having multiple cells are a
 

4410
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,669
cognition having multiple cells are a
singular self it depends

4411
01:29:16,669 --> 01:29:16,679
singular self it depends
 

4412
01:29:16,679 --> 01:29:20,390
singular self it depends
um again because uh we're getting far

4413
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:20,400
um again because uh we're getting far
 

4414
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,070
um again because uh we're getting far
from the answer to the question you

4415
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:22,080
from the answer to the question you
 

4416
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,870
from the answer to the question you
originally asked me do we you want me to

4417
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:23,880
originally asked me do we you want me to
 

4418
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,129
originally asked me do we you want me to
go back to that first or answer this

4419
01:29:25,129 --> 01:29:25,139
go back to that first or answer this
 

4420
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:26,450
go back to that first or answer this
which question I already forgot

4421
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:26,460
which question I already forgot
 

4422
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,010
which question I already forgot
everything what's the functionality of

4423
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:28,020
everything what's the functionality of
 

4424
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:32,270
everything what's the functionality of
religion yes okay okay and then we can

4425
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:32,280
religion yes okay okay and then we can
 

4426
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,550
religion yes okay okay and then we can
return to the self okay

4427
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
return to the self okay
 

4428
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,350
return to the self okay
so you said you know you have all these

4429
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:36,360
so you said you know you have all these
 

4430
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,570
so you said you know you have all these
propositions and Etc et cetera and they

4431
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:38,580
propositions and Etc et cetera and they
 

4432
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,189
propositions and Etc et cetera and they
differ from the religions and they're

4433
01:29:40,189 --> 01:29:40,199
differ from the religions and they're
 

4434
01:29:40,199 --> 01:29:42,950
differ from the religions and they're
not they don't seem to be considered

4435
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
not they don't seem to be considered
 

4436
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,129
not they don't seem to be considered
legitimate by many people

4437
01:29:46,129 --> 01:29:46,139
legitimate by many people
 

4438
01:29:46,139 --> 01:29:48,290
legitimate by many people
but yet there's something functioning in

4439
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:48,300
but yet there's something functioning in
 

4440
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,970
but yet there's something functioning in
the religions that is transforming

4441
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:49,980
the religions that is transforming
 

4442
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,050
the religions that is transforming
people

4443
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:51,060

you
 

4448
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,090
you
that the Transformations are largely

4466
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,590
are representational and they're
dependent on the non-propositional

4467
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:14,600
dependent on the non-propositional
 

4468
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,729
dependent on the non-propositional
non-representational processes of

4469
01:30:16,729 --> 01:30:16,739
non-representational processes of
 

4470
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:18,229
non-representational processes of
connectedness and relevance realization

4471
01:30:18,229 --> 01:30:18,239
connectedness and relevance realization

so religion goes down deep to the

4473
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:20,580
so religion goes down deep to the
 

4474
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,490
so religion goes down deep to the
non-propositional and works there that's

4475
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:22,500
non-propositional and works there that's
 

4476
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,010
non-propositional and works there that's
the functionality we need to grasp well

4477
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:25,020
the functionality we need to grasp well
 

4478
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:28,310
the functionality we need to grasp well
you talk about tools essentially that

4479
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:28,320
you talk about tools essentially that
 

4480
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,750
you talk about tools essentially that
humans are able to incorporate into

4481
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:29,760
humans are able to incorporate into
 

4482
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,149
humans are able to incorporate into
their cognition

4483
01:30:31,149 --> 01:30:31,159
their cognition

psychotechnologies like language is one

4485
01:30:33,169 --> 01:30:33,179
psychotechnologies like language is one
 

4486
01:30:33,179 --> 01:30:36,470
psychotechnologies like language is one
I suppose uh

4487
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480
I suppose uh
 

4488
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,590
I suppose uh
isn't religion then a psychotechnology

4489
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:39,600
isn't religion then a psychotechnology
 

4490
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,050
isn't religion then a psychotechnology
it would be a yeah an Ecology of

4491
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:42,060
it would be a yeah an Ecology of
 

4492
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,209
it would be a yeah an Ecology of
psychotechnologies yes and the question

4493
01:30:44,209 --> 01:30:44,219
psychotechnologies yes and the question
 

4494
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:45,590
psychotechnologies yes and the question
is

4495
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:45,600
is
 

4496
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,270
is
that Nietzsche ruined everything by

4497
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280

uh do we have to invent the new thing go
 

4502
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:54,770
uh do we have to invent the new thing go
go to from the old phone create the

4503
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:54,780
go to from the old phone create the
 

4504
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:56,810
go to from the old phone create the
iPhone invent the new Psycho technology

become worthy of this yeah what
 

4526

there yes the point is right there's one
 

4532
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,129
there yes the point is right there's one
thing to rejecting the proposition

there's another project of replacing the

there's another project of replacing the
 

4536
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,070
there's another project of replacing the
functionality that we lost when we

4537
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,080
functionality that we lost when we
 

4538
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,169
functionality that we lost when we
reject the religion so his worry that is

Niche I think it is possible
 

4554
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,510

stoicism that are on the gray line
 

4564
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,570

of the Legacy religions that's my
 

4578
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,930

proposal I call that the religion that's
not a religion so things like stoicism

4581
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:35,580
not a religion so things like stoicism
 

4582
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:38,750
not a religion so things like stoicism
or modern stoicism those things don't

4583
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:38,760
or modern stoicism those things don't
 

4584
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,729
or modern stoicism those things don't
you think in some sense they naturally

4585
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:40,739
you think in some sense they naturally
 

4586
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:43,070
you think in some sense they naturally
emerge

4587

don't you think there's a longing for

4589
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
don't you think there's a longing for
 

4590
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:49,129
don't you think there's a longing for
meaning so stoicism arises during the

4591
01:32:49,129 --> 01:32:49,139
meaning so stoicism arises during the
 

4592
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:51,830
meaning so stoicism arises during the
Hellenistic period when there was a

4593
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:51,840
Hellenistic period when there was a
 

4594
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,510
Hellenistic period when there was a
significant meaning crisis in the

significant meaning crisis in the
 

4596
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,729
significant meaning crisis in the
ancient world because of what had

ancient world because of what had
 

4598
01:32:55,739 --> 01:32:59,270
ancient world because of what had
happened after the breakup of Alexander

happened after the breakup of Alexander
 

4600
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,970
happened after the breakup of Alexander
the Great's Empire so if you if you

4601
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:01,980
the Great's Empire so if you if you
 

4602
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,890
the Great's Empire so if you if you

non-propositional kinds of knowing that
 

4786
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:44,030
non-propositional kinds of knowing that
make meaning by evolving our sensory

what's your take on atheism
in general

4825
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:30,060
in general
 

4826
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:31,669
in general
is uh

4827
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
is uh
 

4828
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,030
is uh
a closer to truth than uh

4829
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:35,040
a closer to truth than uh
 

4830
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,430
a closer to truth than uh
maybe is an atheist closer to truth than

4831
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:37,440
maybe is an atheist closer to truth than
 

4832
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,830
maybe is an atheist closer to truth than
a person who believes in God

4833
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:39,840
a person who believes in God
 

4834
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,830
a person who believes in God
so I'm a non-theist which I which means

4835
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:42,840
so I'm a non-theist which I which means
 

4836
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,330
so I'm a non-theist which I which means
I think the shared set of

4837
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:44,340
I think the shared set of
 

4838
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:46,189
I think the shared set of
presuppositions between the theist and

4839
01:37:46,189 --> 01:37:46,199
presuppositions between the theist and
 

4840
01:37:46,199 --> 01:37:48,229
presuppositions between the theist and
the atheist are actually what needs to

4841
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:48,239
the atheist are actually what needs to
 

4842
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:50,689
the atheist are actually what needs to
be rejected

4843
01:37:50,689 --> 01:37:50,699
be rejected
 

4844
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:54,350
be rejected
can you uh explain that further yes

4845
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:54,360
can you uh explain that further yes
 

4846
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,290
can you uh explain that further yes
I can and uh and I want to point out by

4847
01:37:57,290 --> 01:37:57,300
I can and uh and I want to point out by
 

4848
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:58,609
I can and uh and I want to point out by
the way that they're

4849
01:37:58,609 --> 01:37:58,619
the way that they're
 

4850
01:37:58,619 --> 01:38:01,729
the way that they're
uh there are lots of non-theistic uh

4851
01:38:01,729 --> 01:38:01,739
uh there are lots of non-theistic uh
 

4852
01:38:01,739 --> 01:38:03,350
uh there are lots of non-theistic uh
religious Traditions

4853
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
religious Traditions
 

4854
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,450
religious Traditions
um so I'm not I'm not I'm not coming up

4855
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:05,460
um so I'm not I'm not I'm not coming up
 

4856
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,570
um so I'm not I'm not I'm not coming up
with a sort of Airy fairy category yeah

4857
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:08,580
with a sort of Airy fairy category yeah
 

4858
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:11,050
with a sort of Airy fairy category yeah
and what's the difference in non-theism

4859
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:11,060
and what's the difference in non-theism
 

4860
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:15,290
and what's the difference in non-theism
agnosticism and Atheism so non-theists

4861
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:15,300
agnosticism and Atheism so non-theists
 

4862
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:18,490
agnosticism and Atheism so non-theists
think that the theist and the atheists

4863
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:18,500
think that the theist and the atheists
 

4864
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:22,010
think that the theist and the atheists
share a bunch of presuppositions for

4865
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:22,020
share a bunch of presuppositions for
 

4866
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:26,030
share a bunch of presuppositions for
example it's that sacredness is to be

4867
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:26,040
example it's that sacredness is to be
 

4868
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:30,350
example it's that sacredness is to be
understood in terms of a personal being

4869
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:30,360
understood in terms of a personal being
 

4870
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,629
understood in terms of a personal being
that is in some sense the Supreme Being

4871
01:38:32,629 --> 01:38:32,639
that is in some sense the Supreme Being
 

4872
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:35,810
that is in some sense the Supreme Being
and that the right relationship to that

4873
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:35,820
and that the right relationship to that
 

4874
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,790
and that the right relationship to that
being is to have a correct set of

4875
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:37,800
being is to have a correct set of
 

4876
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,350
being is to have a correct set of
beliefs

4877
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:39,360
beliefs
 

4878
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,350
beliefs
I reject all of those claims so both the

4879
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:42,360
I reject all of those claims so both the
 

4880
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:45,050
I reject all of those claims so both the
theist and the atheists in their modern

4881
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:45,060
theist and the atheists in their modern
 

4882
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:49,310
theist and the atheists in their modern
version yes yes in which do you reject

4883
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:49,320
version yes yes in which do you reject
 

4884
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:52,129
version yes yes in which do you reject
it in the sense that you don't know or

4885
01:38:52,129 --> 01:38:52,139
it in the sense that you don't know or
 

4886
01:38:52,139 --> 01:38:55,189
it in the sense that you don't know or
do you reject it in a sense that

4887
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
do you reject it in a sense that
 

4888
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,890
do you reject it in a sense that
you believe that

4889
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:57,900
you believe that
 

4890
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,590
you believe that
each one of those presuppositions is

4891
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:00,600
each one of those presuppositions is
 

4892
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,729
each one of those presuppositions is
likely to be not true the latter I both

4893
01:39:04,729 --> 01:39:04,739
likely to be not true the latter I both
 

4894
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:08,169
likely to be not true the latter I both
on reflection argument and personal

4895
01:39:08,169 --> 01:39:08,179
on reflection argument and personal
 

4896
01:39:08,179 --> 01:39:11,149
on reflection argument and personal
experimentation and ex and experience

4897
01:39:11,149 --> 01:39:11,159
experimentation and ex and experience
 

4898
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,669
experimentation and ex and experience
I've come to the conclusion that those

4899
01:39:13,669 --> 01:39:13,679
I've come to the conclusion that those
 

4900
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,950
I've come to the conclusion that those
shared propositions are probably not

4901
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:15,960
shared propositions are probably not
 

4902
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:18,590
shared propositions are probably not
true which one is the most Troublesome

4903
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:18,600
true which one is the most Troublesome
 

4904
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,790
true which one is the most Troublesome
to you

4905
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:19,800
to you
 

4906
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,490
to you
the personal being the the kind of

4907
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:22,500
the personal being the the kind of
 

4908
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,890
the personal being the the kind of
accumulation of everything into one

4909
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:24,900
accumulation of everything into one
 

4910
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,590
accumulation of everything into one
being that ultimately created stuff

4911
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:27,600
being that ultimately created stuff
 

4912
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,209
being that ultimately created stuff
so for me there's two and they're

4913
01:39:29,209 --> 01:39:29,219
so for me there's two and they're
 

4914
01:39:29,219 --> 01:39:30,410
so for me there's two and they're
interlocked together I'm not trying to

4915
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:30,420
interlocked together I'm not trying to
 

4916
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:33,109
interlocked together I'm not trying to
dodge your question it's that the idea

4917
01:39:33,109 --> 01:39:33,119
dodge your question it's that the idea
 

4918
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:34,609
dodge your question it's that the idea
that

4919
01:39:34,609 --> 01:39:34,619
that
 

4920
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:37,970
that
the ground of being is some kind of

4921
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:37,980
the ground of being is some kind of
 

4922
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:40,370
the ground of being is some kind of
being I think is a fundamental mistake

4923
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:40,380
being I think is a fundamental mistake
 

4924
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:44,750
being I think is a fundamental mistake
it's void of being no no no like

4925
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:44,760
it's void of being no no no like
 

4926
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,609
it's void of being no no no like
the ground of being some kind of being

4927
01:39:46,609 --> 01:39:46,619
the ground of being some kind of being
 

4928
01:39:46,619 --> 01:39:48,770
the ground of being some kind of being
no no turtles all the way down the

4929
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:48,780
no no turtles all the way down the
 

4930
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,390
no no turtles all the way down the
grounded being is not itself any kind of

4931
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:50,400
grounded being is not itself any kind of
 

4932
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:54,350
grounded being is not itself any kind of
being being is not a being it is the

4933
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:54,360
being being is not a being it is the
 

4934
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:57,229
being being is not a being it is the
ability for things to be which is not

4935
01:39:57,229 --> 01:39:57,239
ability for things to be which is not
 

4936
01:39:57,239 --> 01:39:59,870
ability for things to be which is not

and then you realize it can't be any
 

4954

and
 

4970
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:43,129
and
that is bound up with okay what I need

4971
01:40:43,129 --> 01:40:43,139
that is bound up with okay what I need
 

4972

that is bound up with okay what I need

to do in order to be in relationship
 

4974
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,990
to do in order to be in relationship
with so it's a misconstruing of Ultimate

4975
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:48,000
with so it's a misconstruing of Ultimate
 

4976

Reality as a Supreme Being
 

4978
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,729
Reality as a Supreme Being
which is a category mistake to my mind

4979
01:40:52,729 --> 01:40:52,739
which is a category mistake to my mind
 

4980
01:40:52,739 --> 01:40:56,149
which is a category mistake to my mind
and then that my relationship to it that

4981
01:40:56,149 --> 01:40:56,159
and then that my relationship to it that
 

4982
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:58,970
and then that my relationship to it that
sacredness is a function of belief and I

have been presenting you an argument

4985
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:00,360
have been presenting you an argument
 

4986
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,510
have been presenting you an argument
through most of our discussion that

4987
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:02,520
through most of our discussion that
 

4988
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:05,629
through most of our discussion that
meaning is at a deeper level than

4989
01:41:05,629 --> 01:41:05,639
meaning is at a deeper level than
 

4990
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:08,689
meaning is at a deeper level than
beliefs and propositions and so that is

4991
01:41:08,689 --> 01:41:08,699
beliefs and propositions and so that is
 

4992
01:41:08,699 --> 01:41:10,669
beliefs and propositions and so that is
a misunderstanding of sacredness because

4993
01:41:10,669 --> 01:41:10,679
a misunderstanding of sacredness because
 

4994
01:41:10,679 --> 01:41:12,530
a misunderstanding of sacredness because
I take sacredness to be

4995
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:12,540
I take sacredness to be
 

4996
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,290
I take sacredness to be
that which is most meaningful and it

4997
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:15,300
that which is most meaningful and it
 

4998
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,629
that which is most meaningful and it
connected to what is most real

4999
01:41:17,629 --> 01:41:17,639
connected to what is most real
 

5000
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:21,950
connected to what is most real
and theists think of what uh of

5001
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:21,960
and theists think of what uh of
 

5002
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,629
and theists think of what uh of
sacredness is what they think of

5003
01:41:23,629 --> 01:41:23,639
sacredness is what they think of
 

5004
01:41:23,639 --> 01:41:27,890
sacredness is what they think of
sacredness as a property of a particular

5005
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:27,900
sacredness as a property of a particular
 

5006
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,689
sacredness as a property of a particular
being

5007
01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:29,699
being
 

5008
01:41:29,699 --> 01:41:31,189
being
God

5009
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:31,199
God
 

5010
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:35,570
God
and that the way that is Meaningful to

5011
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:35,580
and that the way that is Meaningful to
 

5012
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:38,570
and that the way that is Meaningful to
them is by asserting a set of

5013
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:38,580
them is by asserting a set of
 

5014
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,850
them is by asserting a set of
propositions or beliefs now I want to

5015
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:40,860
propositions or beliefs now I want to
 

5016
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,590
propositions or beliefs now I want to
point out that this is what I would Now

5017
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:42,600
point out that this is what I would Now
 

5018
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,729
point out that this is what I would Now
call Modern or common theism you go back

5019
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:46,739
call Modern or common theism you go back
 

5020
01:41:46,739 --> 01:41:48,470
call Modern or common theism you go back
into

5021
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:48,480
into
 

5022
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,330
into
the classical periods of Christianity

5023
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:50,340
the classical periods of Christianity
 

5024
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,550
the classical periods of Christianity
you get a view that's really radically

5025
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:52,560
you get a view that's really radically
 

5026
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:53,810
you get a view that's really radically
different from how most people

5027
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:53,820
different from how most people
 

5028
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:56,810
different from how most people
understand theism today okay so let me

5029
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:56,820
understand theism today okay so let me
 

5030
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:58,910
understand theism today okay so let me
uh this is an interesting question that

5031
01:41:58,910 --> 01:41:58,920
uh this is an interesting question that
 

5032
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,950
uh this is an interesting question that
I usually think about in the form of

5033
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:00,960
I usually think about in the form of
 

5034
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,510
I usually think about in the form of
mathematics but

5035
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:02,520
mathematics but
 

5036
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:05,270
mathematics but
so in that case if meaning is sacred in

5037
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:05,280
so in that case if meaning is sacred in
 

5038
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:09,050
so in that case if meaning is sacred in
your non-theist view

5039
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:09,060

 

5040
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:13,970

is meaning created or is it discovered

5041
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:13,980
is meaning created or is it discovered
 

5042
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:16,430
is meaning created or is it discovered
so there's a Latin word that doesn't

5043
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:16,440
so there's a Latin word that doesn't
 

5044
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,890
so there's a Latin word that doesn't
separate them called inventio

5045
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:18,900
separate them called inventio
 

5046
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:21,890
separate them called inventio
and I would say that and before you say

5047
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:21,900
and I would say that and before you say
 

5048
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:24,530
and I would say that and before you say
oh well give me a chance because you

5049
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:24,540
oh well give me a chance because you
 

5050
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:27,109
oh well give me a chance because you
participate in it

5051
01:42:27,109 --> 01:42:27,119
participate in it
 

5052
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:29,930
participate in it
you've experienced an Insight yes did

5053
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:29,940
you've experienced an Insight yes did
 

5054
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:32,510
you've experienced an Insight yes did
you make it happen

5055
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:32,520

 

5056
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,930

the the Insight did you make it happen

5057
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:35,940
the the Insight did you make it happen
 

5058
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:38,689
the the Insight did you make it happen
or did what did you do like can you do

5059
01:42:38,689 --> 01:42:38,699
or did what did you do like can you do
 

5060
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:41,030
or did what did you do like can you do
that I'm gonna I need an Insight this is

5061
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:41,040
that I'm gonna I need an Insight this is
 

5062
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,250
that I'm gonna I need an Insight this is
what I do to make an Insight oh I see

5063
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:43,260
what I do to make an Insight oh I see
 

5064
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:45,530
what I do to make an Insight oh I see
yeah in some sense it came from

5065
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:45,540
yeah in some sense it came from
 

5066
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:47,450
yeah in some sense it came from
elsewhere right but you didn't just

5067
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:47,460
elsewhere right but you didn't just
 

5068
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:49,189
elsewhere right but you didn't just
passively receive it either you're

5069
01:42:49,189 --> 01:42:49,199
passively receive it either you're
 

5070
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,410
passively receive it either you're
engaged and involved in it that's why

5071
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:51,420
engaged and involved in it that's why
 

5072
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:53,149
engaged and involved in it that's why
you get right so that's what I mean by

5073
01:42:53,149 --> 01:42:53,159
you get right so that's what I mean by
 

5074
01:42:53,159 --> 01:42:55,550
you get right so that's what I mean by
you participate in it you participate in

5075
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:55,560
you participate in it you participate in
 

5076
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,310
you participate in it you participate in
meaning so you do think that is both

5077
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:58,320
meaning so you do think that is both
 

5078
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,709
meaning so you do think that is both
yes you do think it's both I mean that's

5079
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:00,719
yes you do think it's both I mean that's
 

5080
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:02,629
yes you do think it's both I mean that's
not a trivial thing

5081
01:43:02,629 --> 01:43:02,639
not a trivial thing
 

5082
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:06,169
not a trivial thing
to understand

5083
01:43:06,169 --> 01:43:06,179

 

5084
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:08,750

because a lot of time we think when you

5085
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:08,760
because a lot of time we think when you
 

5086
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,149
because a lot of time we think when you
think about a search for meaning

5087
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:11,159
think about a search for meaning
 

5088
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:14,750
think about a search for meaning
you think it's like you're going through

5089
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:14,760
you think it's like you're going through
 

5090
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,209
you think it's like you're going through
a big house and you open each door and

5091
01:43:17,209 --> 01:43:17,219
a big house and you open each door and
 

5092
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:19,729
a big house and you open each door and
look if it's there and so on as if there

5093
01:43:19,729 --> 01:43:19,739
look if it's there and so on as if there

and the least important you move to the
 

5408
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:51,830
and the least important you move to the
allegorical or the symbolic to the moral

5409
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:51,840
allegorical or the symbolic to the moral
 

5410
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,890
allegorical or the symbolic to the moral
to the spiritual the mystical and that's

5411
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:54,900
to the spiritual the mystical and that's
 

5412
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:58,669
to the spiritual the mystical and that's
where right so they would say to you oh

5413
01:49:58,669 --> 01:49:58,679
where right so they would say to you oh
 

5414
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:01,850
where right so they would say to you oh
uh you know but how is I how is the

5415
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:01,860
uh you know but how is I how is the
 

5416
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:04,910
uh you know but how is I how is the
story of Adam and Eve true for you now

5417
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:04,920
story of Adam and Eve true for you now
 

5418
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,410
story of Adam and Eve true for you now
and I don't mean true for you in that

5419
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:06,420
and I don't mean true for you in that
 

5420
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:08,750
and I don't mean true for you in that
relativistic sense I mean how is it

5421
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:08,760
relativistic sense I mean how is it
 

5422
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,089
relativistic sense I mean how is it
point pointing to a pattern in your life

5423
01:50:11,089 --> 01:50:11,099
point pointing to a pattern in your life
 

5424
01:50:11,099 --> 01:50:13,609
point pointing to a pattern in your life
right now so there's some sense in which

5425
01:50:13,609 --> 01:50:13,619
right now so there's some sense in which
 

5426
01:50:13,619 --> 01:50:16,790
right now so there's some sense in which
the telling of this Mythos

5427
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
the telling of this Mythos
 

5428
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,890
the telling of this Mythos
becomes real

5429
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:18,900
becomes real
 

5430
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:22,129
becomes real
in connecting to the patterns that kind

5431
01:50:22,129 --> 01:50:22,139
in connecting to the patterns that kind
 

5432
01:50:22,139 --> 01:50:24,770
in connecting to the patterns that kind
of captivate the public today sure so

5433
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:24,780
of captivate the public today sure so
 

5434
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:26,510
of captivate the public today sure so
first so you just keep telling the story

5435
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:26,520
first so you just keep telling the story
 

5436
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,189
first so you just keep telling the story
I mean there's something about some of

5437
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:28,199
I mean there's something about some of
 

5438
01:50:28,199 --> 01:50:30,770
I mean there's something about some of
these stories that are just really good

5439
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:30,780
these stories that are just really good
 

5440
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:33,350
these stories that are just really good
at being sticky to the patterns of of

5441
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:33,360
at being sticky to the patterns of of
 

5442
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,109
at being sticky to the patterns of of
each generation yes and they they'll

5443
01:50:36,109 --> 01:50:36,119
each generation yes and they they'll
 

5444
01:50:36,119 --> 01:50:37,609
each generation yes and they they'll
stick to different patterns throughout

5445
01:50:37,609 --> 01:50:37,619
stick to different patterns throughout
 

5446
01:50:37,619 --> 01:50:40,430
stick to different patterns throughout
time they're just sticky yeah in in

5447
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:40,440
time they're just sticky yeah in in
 

5448
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:42,709
time they're just sticky yeah in in
powerful ways yes and so we keep

5449
01:50:42,709 --> 01:50:42,719
powerful ways yes and so we keep
 

5450
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,649
powerful ways yes and so we keep
returning back to them again and again

5451
01:50:45,649 --> 01:50:45,659
returning back to them again and again
 

5452
01:50:45,659 --> 01:50:48,169
returning back to them again and again
and again and

5453
01:50:48,169 --> 01:50:48,179
and again and
 

5454
01:50:48,179 --> 01:50:52,250
and again and
it it's important to see that some of

5455
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:52,260
it it's important to see that some of
 

5456
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:53,990
it it's important to see that some of
these stories

5457
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,000
these stories
 

5458
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,750
these stories
are recursive they're myths are about

5459
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:56,760
are recursive they're myths are about
 

5460
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,930
are recursive they're myths are about
one particular set of patterns the their

5461
01:50:59,930 --> 01:50:59,940
one particular set of patterns the their
 

5462
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:03,410
one particular set of patterns the their
myths about right not not not just an

5463
01:51:03,410 --> 01:51:03,420
myths about right not not not just an
 

5464
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:05,390
myths about right not not not just an
important pattern like you get the you

5465
01:51:05,390 --> 01:51:05,400
important pattern like you get the you
 

5466
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:07,310
important pattern like you get the you
know Jordan stuff about

5467
01:51:07,310 --> 01:51:07,320
know Jordan stuff about
 

5468
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:10,810
know Jordan stuff about
there's Heroes and myths are trying to

5469
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:10,820
there's Heroes and myths are trying to
 

5470
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:14,810
there's Heroes and myths are trying to
uh make us understand the the need for

5471
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:14,820
uh make us understand the the need for
 

5472
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:17,209
uh make us understand the the need for
being heroic in our own lives one of the

5473
01:51:17,209 --> 01:51:17,219
being heroic in our own lives one of the
 

5474
01:51:17,219 --> 01:51:18,830
being heroic in our own lives one of the
things I'd like to put in counterbalance

5475
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:18,840
things I'd like to put in counterbalance
 

5476
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,510
things I'd like to put in counterbalance
to that is the Greek also have myths of

5477
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:20,520
to that is the Greek also have myths of
 

5478
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,530
to that is the Greek also have myths of
hubris

5479
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:21,540
hubris
 

5480
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:24,290
hubris
right the counterbalance the heroic

5481
01:51:24,290 --> 01:51:24,300
right the counterbalance the heroic
 

5482
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:29,089
right the counterbalance the heroic
right but then there are myths

5483
01:51:29,089 --> 01:51:29,099
right but then there are myths
 

5484
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,530
right but then there are myths
that

5485
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:30,540
that
 

5486
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:32,450
that
are not about those deeply important

5487
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:32,460
are not about those deeply important
 

5488
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:36,169
are not about those deeply important
patterns but they're myths about

5489
01:51:36,169 --> 01:51:36,179
patterns but they're myths about
 

5490
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:38,689
patterns but they're myths about
religio itself that the way we're

5491
01:51:38,689 --> 01:51:38,699
religio itself that the way we're
 

5492
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:41,149
religio itself that the way we're
religio means to bind to connect the way

5493
01:51:41,149 --> 01:51:41,159
religio means to bind to connect the way
 

5494
01:51:41,159 --> 01:51:43,490
religio means to bind to connect the way
relevance realization connects us and so

5495
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:43,500
relevance realization connects us and so
 

5496
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:45,109
relevance realization connects us and so
the point of the myth is not notice that

5497
01:51:45,109 --> 01:51:45,119
the point of the myth is not notice that
 

5498
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,910
the point of the myth is not notice that
pattern or notice that pattern or notice

5499
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:46,920
pattern or notice that pattern or notice
 

5500
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,370
pattern or notice that pattern or notice
that pattern it's

5501
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:49,380
that pattern it's
 

5502
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:53,990
that pattern it's
notice how all of these patterns are

5503
01:51:53,990 --> 01:51:54,000
notice how all of these patterns are
 

5504
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,089
notice how all of these patterns are
emerging and what does that say about us

5505
01:51:56,089 --> 01:51:56,099
emerging and what does that say about us
 

5506
01:51:56,099 --> 01:51:58,970
emerging and what does that say about us
and reality and those myths

5507
01:51:58,970 --> 01:51:58,980
and reality and those myths
 

5508
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:00,770
and reality and those myths
those myths

5509
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:00,780
those myths
 

5510
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:04,310
those myths
um I think are genuinely profound

5511
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:04,320
um I think are genuinely profound
 

5512
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,589
um I think are genuinely profound
and how much of the the myths how much

5513
01:52:06,589 --> 01:52:06,599
and how much of the the myths how much
 

5514
01:52:06,599 --> 01:52:07,729
and how much of the the myths how much
of

5515
01:52:07,729 --> 01:52:07,739
of
 

5516
01:52:07,739 --> 01:52:10,010
of
the power of those myth is about the

5517
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:10,020
the power of those myth is about the
 

5518
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:12,290
the power of those myth is about the
dialogues you talk about this quite a

5519
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:12,300
dialogues you talk about this quite a
 

5520
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,609
dialogues you talk about this quite a
bit I think in the first conversation

5521
01:52:13,609 --> 01:52:13,619
bit I think in the first conversation
 

5522
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:16,370
bit I think in the first conversation
with Jordan you because I'm not sure

5523
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:16,380
with Jordan you because I'm not sure
 

5524
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:18,169
with Jordan you because I'm not sure
you've gotten really into it you you

5525
01:52:18,169 --> 01:52:18,179
you've gotten really into it you you
 

5526
01:52:18,179 --> 01:52:20,750
you've gotten really into it you you
scratch the surface a little bit but the

5527
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:20,760
scratch the surface a little bit but the
 

5528
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:23,030
scratch the surface a little bit but the
role of as you say dialogue in

5529
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
role of as you say dialogue in
 

5530
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,669
role of as you say dialogue in
distributed cognition yes what is that

5531
01:52:25,669 --> 01:52:25,679
distributed cognition yes what is that
 

5532
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,709
distributed cognition yes what is that
the thing we're doing right now talking

5533
01:52:27,709 --> 01:52:27,719
the thing we're doing right now talking
 

5534
01:52:27,719 --> 01:52:31,729
the thing we're doing right now talking
with our mouth holes what is that and

5535
01:52:31,729 --> 01:52:31,739
with our mouth holes what is that and
 

5536
01:52:31,739 --> 01:52:34,250
with our mouth holes what is that and
actually can ask you this question yep

5537
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:34,260
actually can ask you this question yep
 

5538
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:37,430
actually can ask you this question yep
if aliens came to Earth and were

5539
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:37,440
if aliens came to Earth and were
 

5540
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,470
if aliens came to Earth and were
observing humans

5541
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:39,480
observing humans
 

5542
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:43,370
observing humans
would they notice our distributed

5543
01:52:43,370 --> 01:52:43,380
would they notice our distributed
 

5544
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:46,310
would they notice our distributed
cognition first or our individual

5545
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:46,320
cognition first or our individual
 

5546
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,830
cognition first or our individual
cognition first what is the most notable

5547
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:48,840
cognition first what is the most notable
 

5548
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:51,709
cognition first what is the most notable
thing about us humans is it our ability

5549
01:52:51,709 --> 01:52:51,719
thing about us humans is it our ability
 

5550
01:52:51,719 --> 01:52:54,229
thing about us humans is it our ability
to individually do well in IQ tests or

5551
01:52:54,229 --> 01:52:54,239
to individually do well in IQ tests or
 

5552
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:57,709
to individually do well in IQ tests or
whatever yeah uh or puzzle solve or is

5553
01:52:57,709 --> 01:52:57,719
whatever yeah uh or puzzle solve or is
 

5554
01:52:57,719 --> 01:52:59,510
whatever yeah uh or puzzle solve or is
it this thing we're doing together

5555
01:52:59,510 --> 01:52:59,520
it this thing we're doing together
 

5556
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,550
it this thing we're doing together
I think most of our problem solving is

5557
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:01,560
I think most of our problem solving is
 

5558
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:05,050
I think most of our problem solving is
done in distributed cognition

5559
01:53:05,050 --> 01:53:05,060
done in distributed cognition
 

5560
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:07,550
done in distributed cognition
look around you didn't make this

5561
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:07,560
look around you didn't make this
 

5562
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:08,689
look around you didn't make this
equipment you didn't build this place

5563
01:53:08,689 --> 01:53:08,699
equipment you didn't build this place
 

5564
01:53:08,699 --> 01:53:10,129
equipment you didn't build this place
you didn't invent this language that

that's what I mean by deal logos and so

5677
01:55:19,609 --> 01:55:19,619
that's what I mean by deal logos and so
 

5678
01:55:19,619 --> 01:55:24,109
that's what I mean by deal logos and so
for me I think Dia logos is

5679

for me I think Dia logos is
 

5680
01:55:24,119 --> 01:55:27,370

hear Jordan and Jonathan in my head
 

5686
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,890
hear Jordan and Jonathan in my head
right now but I think it's more I hear

5687
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:33,900
right now but I think it's more I hear
 

5688

them all the time I just wish they would
 

5690
01:55:36,179 --> 01:55:37,790
them all the time I just wish they would
shut up in my head

5691

shut up in my head
 

5692
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,350
shut up in my head
sometimes

5693
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:39,360
sometimes
 

5694
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,390
sometimes
uh so what uh what are they saying to

5695
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:41,400
uh so what uh what are they saying to
 

5696
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,830
uh so what uh what are they saying to
you in your head what they're saying it

5697
01:55:42,830 --> 01:55:42,840
you in your head what they're saying it
 

5698
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,870
you in your head what they're saying it
well see that's what the most recent

5699
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:44,880
well see that's what the most recent
 

5700
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:47,030
well see that's what the most recent
conversation was about I was trying to

5701
01:55:47,030 --> 01:55:47,040

say
 

5704
01:55:48,599 --> 01:55:52,609
say
that I don't think Mythos is I think

5705
01:55:52,609 --> 01:55:52,619
that I don't think Mythos is I think
 

5706
01:55:52,619 --> 01:55:55,430
that I don't think Mythos is I think
Mythos is really important

5707
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:55,440
Mythos is really important
 

5708
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,770
Mythos is really important
I think these kinds of narratives are

I think these kinds of narratives are
 

5710
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,810
I think these kinds of narratives are
really important but I think this

5711
01:55:59,810 --> 01:55:59,820
really important but I think this
 

5712
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:02,510
really important but I think this

intelligence and cultivate

5717
01:56:09,050 --> 01:56:09,060
intelligence and cultivate
 

5718
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:10,729
intelligence and cultivate
a shared flow state within that

5719
01:56:10,729 --> 01:56:10,739
a shared flow state within that
 

5720
01:56:10,739 --> 01:56:12,290
a shared flow state within that
collective intelligence so it starts to

5721
01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:12,300
collective intelligence so it starts to
 

5722
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,629
collective intelligence so it starts to
ramp up perhaps towards Collective

5723
01:56:14,629 --> 01:56:14,639
ramp up perhaps towards Collective
 

5724
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,390
ramp up perhaps towards Collective
wisdom I think that's more important

5725
01:56:17,390 --> 01:56:17,400
wisdom I think that's more important
 

5726
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,089
wisdom I think that's more important
because I think that's the Basin within

5727
01:56:20,089 --> 01:56:20,099
because I think that's the Basin within
 

5728
01:56:20,099 --> 01:56:22,310
because I think that's the Basin within
which the myths and the rituals are

5729
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,320
which the myths and the rituals are
 

5730
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,109
which the myths and the rituals are
ultimately created and when they

5731
01:56:24,109 --> 01:56:24,119
ultimately created and when they
 

5732
01:56:24,119 --> 01:56:25,310
ultimately created and when they
function

5733
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:25,320
function
 

5734
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,609
function
like like a myth is like a public dream

5735
01:56:27,609 --> 01:56:27,619
like like a myth is like a public dream
 

5736
01:56:27,619 --> 01:56:30,830
like like a myth is like a public dream
it depends on distributed cognition and

5737
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:30,840
it depends on distributed cognition and
 

5738
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:33,109
it depends on distributed cognition and
it depends on people enacting it and

5739
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:33,119
it depends on people enacting it and
 

5740
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,930
it depends on people enacting it and
getting into mutual flow States

5741
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:35,940
getting into mutual flow States
 

5742
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:39,229
getting into mutual flow States
so the the highest form of dialogues of

5743
01:56:39,229 --> 01:56:39,239
so the the highest form of dialogues of
 

5744
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:42,830
so the the highest form of dialogues of
conversation is this Flow State and that

5745
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:42,840
conversation is this Flow State and that
 

5746
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:46,010
conversation is this Flow State and that
it forms the foundation for myth

5747
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:46,020
it forms the foundation for myth
 

5748
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:49,129
it forms the foundation for myth
building I think so I think so so that

5749
01:56:49,129 --> 01:56:49,139
building I think so I think so so that
 

5750
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:50,990
building I think so I think so so that
communitas that's Victor Turner's phrase

5751
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:51,000
communitas that's Victor Turner's phrase
 

5752
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,510
communitas that's Victor Turner's phrase
and he specifically linked it to flow

5753
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:53,520
and he specifically linked it to flow
 

5754
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:55,910
and he specifically linked it to flow
and I study flow scientifically that you

5755
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:55,920
and I study flow scientifically that you
 

5756
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,370
and I study flow scientifically that you
know that within distributed cognition

5757
01:56:58,370 --> 01:56:58,380
know that within distributed cognition
 

5758
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:03,589
know that within distributed cognition
as as as as the home as the generator of

5759
01:57:03,589 --> 01:57:03,599
as as as as the home as the generator of
 

5760
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:05,629
as as as as the home as the generator of
Mythos and ritual and those are bound

5761
01:57:05,629 --> 01:57:05,639
Mythos and ritual and those are bound
 

5762
01:57:05,639 --> 01:57:07,550
Mythos and ritual and those are bound
together as well I think that's

5763
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:07,560
together as well I think that's
 

5764
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:09,169
together as well I think that's
fundamentally correct you know what's

5765
01:57:09,169 --> 01:57:09,179
fundamentally correct you know what's
 

5766
01:57:09,179 --> 01:57:11,330
fundamentally correct you know what's
the cool thing here because I'm a huge

5767
01:57:11,330 --> 01:57:11,340
the cool thing here because I'm a huge
 

5768
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:14,169
the cool thing here because I'm a huge
fan of podcasts uh and audiobooks but

01:57:14,169 --> 01:57:14,179
fan of podcasts uh and audiobooks but
 

5770
01:57:14,179 --> 01:57:16,370
fan of podcasts uh and audiobooks but
pockets in particular is relevant here

5771
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:16,380
pockets in particular is relevant here
 

5772
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:18,530
pockets in particular is relevant here
is there's a third person in this room

5773
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:18,540
is there's a third person in this room
 

5774
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:22,550
is there's a third person in this room
listening now and and and they're also

5775
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:22,560
listening now and and and they're also
 

5776
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,089
listening now and and and they're also
in the Flow State yes yes like I'm I'm

5777
01:57:26,089 --> 01:57:26,099
in the Flow State yes yes like I'm I'm
 

5778
01:57:26,099 --> 01:57:28,609
in the Flow State yes yes like I'm I'm
close friends with a lot of podcasts

5779
01:57:28,609 --> 01:57:28,619
close friends with a lot of podcasts
 

5780
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:31,129
close friends with a lot of podcasts
they don't know I exist I just listen to

5781
01:57:31,129 --> 01:57:31,139
they don't know I exist I just listen to
 

5782
01:57:31,139 --> 01:57:32,689
they don't know I exist I just listen to
them and because I've been in so many

5783
01:57:32,689 --> 01:57:32,699
them and because I've been in so many
 

5784
01:57:32,699 --> 01:57:34,370
them and because I've been in so many
flow states with them yeah I was like

5785
01:57:34,370 --> 01:57:34,380
flow states with them yeah I was like
 

5786
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:37,370
flow states with them yeah I was like
yes yes this is good but they don't they

5787
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:37,380
yes yes this is good but they don't they
 

5788
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:38,870
yes yes this is good but they don't they
don't know I exist but they are in

5789
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:38,880
don't know I exist but they are in
 

5790
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,609
don't know I exist but they are in
conversation with me ultimately and

5791
01:57:40,609 --> 01:57:40,619
conversation with me ultimately and
 

5792
01:57:40,619 --> 01:57:42,649
conversation with me ultimately and
think think like of what what that's

5793
01:57:42,649 --> 01:57:42,659
think think like of what what that's
 

5794
01:57:42,659 --> 01:57:44,209
think think like of what what that's
doing you've got like you've got

5795
01:57:44,209 --> 01:57:44,219
doing you've got like you've got
 

5796
01:57:44,219 --> 01:57:45,890
doing you've got like you've got
dialogues and then you've got this meta

5797
01:57:45,890 --> 01:57:45,900
dialogues and then you've got this meta
 

5798
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:47,570
dialogues and then you've got this meta
dialogue like you're describing and

5799
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:47,580
dialogue like you're describing and
 

5800
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:50,689
dialogue like you're describing and
think about how things like podcasts and

5801
01:57:50,689 --> 01:57:50,699
think about how things like podcasts and
 

5802
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:53,750
think about how things like podcasts and
YouTube they break down old boundaries

5803
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:53,760
YouTube they break down old boundaries
 

5804
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,609
YouTube they break down old boundaries
between the private and the public

5805
01:57:55,609 --> 01:57:55,619
between the private and the public
 

5806
01:57:55,619 --> 01:57:58,609
between the private and the public
between writing and oral speech so we

5807
01:57:58,609 --> 01:57:58,619
between writing and oral speech so we
 

5808
01:57:58,619 --> 01:58:01,189
between writing and oral speech so we
have the Dynamics of living oral speech

5809
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199
have the Dynamics of living oral speech
 

5810
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,649
have the Dynamics of living oral speech
but it has the permanency of writing

5811
01:58:03,649 --> 01:58:03,659
but it has the permanency of writing
 

5812
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:05,689
but it has the permanency of writing
like we're we're we're we're in the

5813
01:58:05,689 --> 01:58:05,699
like we're we're we're we're in the
 

5814
01:58:05,699 --> 01:58:09,950
like we're we're we're we're in the
midst of creating a vehicle right and

5815
01:58:09,950 --> 01:58:09,960
midst of creating a vehicle right and
 

5816
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:12,290
midst of creating a vehicle right and
and a medium for distributed cognition

5817
01:58:12,290 --> 01:58:12,300
and a medium for distributed cognition
 

5818
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:15,770
and a medium for distributed cognition
that breaks down a lot of the categories

5819
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:15,780
that breaks down a lot of the categories
 

5820
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:18,470
that breaks down a lot of the categories
by which we organized our cognition I

5821
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:18,480
by which we organized our cognition I
 

5822
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,330
by which we organized our cognition I
mean because of the tools of YouTube and

5823
01:58:20,330 --> 01:58:20,340
mean because of the tools of YouTube and
 

5824
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:23,510
mean because of the tools of YouTube and
so on just the the network the the graph

5825
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:23,520
so on just the the network the the graph
 

5826
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,669
so on just the the network the the graph
of how quickly the distributed cognition

5827
01:58:25,669 --> 01:58:25,679
of how quickly the distributed cognition
 

5828
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:28,070
of how quickly the distributed cognition
can spread is really powerful and you

5829
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,080
can spread is really powerful and you
 

5830
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,270
can spread is really powerful and you
just a huge amount of people have

5831
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:29,280
just a huge amount of people have
 

5832
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,010
just a huge amount of people have
listened to your lectures yeah I've

5833
01:58:31,010 --> 01:58:31,020
listened to your lectures yeah I've
 

5834
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:32,330
listened to your lectures yeah I've
listened to your lectures but I've

5835
01:58:32,330 --> 01:58:32,340
listened to your lectures but I've
 

5836
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:34,910
listened to your lectures but I've
experienced them as at least in your

5837
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:34,920
experienced them as at least in your
 

5838
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:38,030
experienced them as at least in your
style there's something about your style

5839
01:58:38,030 --> 01:58:38,040
style there's something about your style
 

5840
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,030
style there's something about your style
it felt like a conversation yeah like it

5841
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:41,040
it felt like a conversation yeah like it
 

5842
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:42,589
it felt like a conversation yeah like it
felt like at any point moment I could

5843
01:58:42,589 --> 01:58:42,599
felt like at any point moment I could
 

5844
01:58:42,599 --> 01:58:45,229
felt like at any point moment I could
interrupt you and say something oh and I

5845
01:58:45,229 --> 01:58:45,239
interrupt you and say something oh and I
 

5846

was just listening thank you thank you

5847
01:58:46,669 --> 01:58:46,679
was just listening thank you thank you
 

5848
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:49,370
was just listening thank you thank you
for saying that because I aspire to

5849
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:49,380
for saying that because I aspire to
 

5850
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:52,430
for saying that because I aspire to
being genuinely as Socratic as I can

5851
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:52,440
being genuinely as Socratic as I can
 

5852
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:55,010
being genuinely as Socratic as I can
when I'm doing this yeah those that

5853
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:55,020
when I'm doing this yeah those that
 

5854
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:57,169
when I'm doing this yeah those that
sounds actually as I'm saying it now why

5855
01:58:57,169 --> 01:58:57,179
sounds actually as I'm saying it now why
 

5856
01:58:57,179 --> 01:58:59,089
sounds actually as I'm saying it now why
was that it didn't feel like sometimes

5857
01:58:59,089 --> 01:58:59,099
was that it didn't feel like sometimes
 

5858
01:58:59,099 --> 01:59:02,750
was that it didn't feel like sometimes
lectures are kind of uh you you know you

5859
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:02,760
lectures are kind of uh you you know you
 

5860
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,370
lectures are kind of uh you you know you
came you come down with the Commandments

5861
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:04,380
came you come down with the Commandments
 

5862
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:05,810
came you come down with the Commandments
and you're just trying to list them yeah

5863
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:05,820
and you're just trying to list them yeah
 

5864
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:07,850
and you're just trying to list them yeah
but there is a sense like I mean I think

5865
01:59:07,850 --> 01:59:07,860
but there is a sense like I mean I think
 

5866
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:09,470
but there is a sense like I mean I think
it was the excitement that you have like

5867
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:09,480
it was the excitement that you have like
 

5868
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:11,030
it was the excitement that you have like
you have to understand and also the fact

5869
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:11,040
you have to understand and also the fact
 

5870
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:14,089
you have to understand and also the fact
that you were kind of I think

5871
01:59:14,089 --> 01:59:14,099
that you were kind of I think
 

5872
01:59:14,099 --> 01:59:16,070
that you were kind of I think
ing off the top of your head sometimes

5873
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:16,080
ing off the top of your head sometimes
 

5874
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,530
ing off the top of your head sometimes
yes there was a you were interrupting

yes there was a you were interrupting
 

5876
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:20,450
yes there was a you were interrupting
yourself with thoughts you're playing

5877
01:59:20,450 --> 01:59:20,460
yourself with thoughts you're playing
 

5878
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:22,010
yourself with thoughts you're playing
with thoughts like you're you're

5879
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:22,020
with thoughts like you're you're
 

5880
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:24,470
with thoughts like you're you're
reasoning through things often like you

5881
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:24,480
reasoning through things often like you
 

5882
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,930
reasoning through things often like you
had what you referenced a lot of books

5883
01:59:26,930 --> 01:59:26,940
had what you referenced a lot of books
 

5884
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:29,270
had what you referenced a lot of books
so surely you were extremely well

5885
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:29,280
so surely you were extremely well
 

5886
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,370
so surely you were extremely well
prepared and you're referencing a lot of

5887
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:31,380
prepared and you're referencing a lot of
 

5888
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:32,990
prepared and you're referencing a lot of
ideas but then you're also struggling in

5889
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:33,000
ideas but then you're also struggling in
 

5890
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,790
ideas but then you're also struggling in
the way to present those ideas yes there

5891
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:34,800
the way to present those ideas yes there
 

5892
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,729
the way to present those ideas yes there
was and so the Jazz like the Jazz the

5893
01:59:37,729 --> 01:59:37,739
was and so the Jazz like the Jazz the
 

5894

Jazz and getting into the Flow State and
 

5896
01:59:40,199 --> 01:59:42,109
Jazz and getting into the Flow State and
and trying to

5897
01:59:42,109 --> 01:59:42,119
and trying to
 

5898
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:44,570
and trying to
share in a participatory and perspective

5899
01:59:44,570 --> 01:59:44,580
share in a participatory and perspective
 

5900
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:46,790
share in a participatory and perspective
of fashion the learning with the people

5901
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:46,800
of fashion the learning with the people
 

5902
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:50,270
of fashion the learning with the people
rather than just pronouncing at them yes

5903
01:59:50,270 --> 01:59:50,280
rather than just pronouncing at them yes
 

5904
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:52,669
rather than just pronouncing at them yes
what's mindfulness

5905
01:59:52,669 --> 01:59:52,679
what's mindfulness
 

5906
01:59:52,679 --> 01:59:55,070
what's mindfulness
so published on that as well

5907
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:55,080
so published on that as well
 

5908
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:56,750
so published on that as well
um and I practice I've been practicing

5909
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:56,760
um and I practice I've been practicing
 

5910
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:59,390
um and I practice I've been practicing
many forms of mindfulness and Ecology of

5911
01:59:59,390 --> 01:59:59,400
many forms of mindfulness and Ecology of
 

5912
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:02,589
many forms of mindfulness and Ecology of
practices since 1991 so I both have

5913
02:00:02,589 --> 02:00:02,599
practices since 1991 so I both have
 

5914
02:00:02,599 --> 02:00:05,149
practices since 1991 so I both have
practitioners knowledge and I also study

5915
02:00:05,149 --> 02:00:05,159
practitioners knowledge and I also study
 

5916
02:00:05,159 --> 02:00:07,250
practitioners knowledge and I also study
it scientifically I think I'm pretty

5917
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:07,260
it scientifically I think I'm pretty
 

5918
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:09,649
it scientifically I think I'm pretty
sure I was the first person to

5919
02:00:09,649 --> 02:00:09,659
sure I was the first person to
 

5920
02:00:09,659 --> 02:00:12,109
sure I was the first person to
academically talk about mindfulness at

5921
02:00:12,109 --> 02:00:12,119
academically talk about mindfulness at
 

5922
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:13,910
academically talk about mindfulness at
the University of Toronto within a

5923
02:00:13,910 --> 02:00:13,920
the University of Toronto within a
 

5924
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,910
the University of Toronto within a
classroom setting like lecturing on it

5925
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:15,920
classroom setting like lecturing on it
 

5926
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,350
classroom setting like lecturing on it
so this is a topic that a lot of people

5927
02:00:18,350 --> 02:00:18,360
so this is a topic that a lot of people
 

5928
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,570
so this is a topic that a lot of people
have recently become very interested in

5929
02:00:20,570 --> 02:00:20,580
have recently become very interested in
 

5930
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:24,350
have recently become very interested in
think about so from that from the early

5931
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:24,360
think about so from that from the early
 

5932
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:26,750
think about so from that from the early
days how do you think about what it is

5933
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:26,760
days how do you think about what it is
 

5934
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:29,149
days how do you think about what it is
I've critiqued the sort of standard

5935
02:00:29,149 --> 02:00:29,159
I've critiqued the sort of standard
 

5936
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:31,609
I've critiqued the sort of standard
definitions being you know aware of the

5937
02:00:31,609 --> 02:00:31,619
definitions being you know aware of the
 

5938
02:00:31,619 --> 02:00:33,649
definitions being you know aware of the
present moment without judgment because

5939
02:00:33,649 --> 02:00:33,659
present moment without judgment because
 

5940
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:36,290
present moment without judgment because
I think they're they're flawed

5941
02:00:36,290 --> 02:00:36,300
I think they're they're flawed
 

5942
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:37,550
I think they're they're flawed
um and if you want to get into the

5943
02:00:37,550 --> 02:00:37,560
um and if you want to get into the
 

5944
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:39,709
um and if you want to get into the
detail of why we can but this is how I

5945
02:00:39,709 --> 02:00:39,719
detail of why we can but this is how I
 

5946
02:00:39,719 --> 02:00:41,990
detail of why we can but this is how I
want to explain it to you

5947
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:42,000
want to explain it to you
 

5948
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,209
want to explain it to you
and it also points to the fact of why

5949
02:00:44,209 --> 02:00:44,219
and it also points to the fact of why
 

5950
02:00:44,219 --> 02:00:45,830
and it also points to the fact of why
you need an Ecology of mindfulness

5951
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:45,840
you need an Ecology of mindfulness
 

5952
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,450
you need an Ecology of mindfulness
practices you shouldn't equate

5953
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:47,460
practices you shouldn't equate
 

5954
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:49,669
practices you shouldn't equate
mindfulness with meditation I think

5955
02:00:49,669 --> 02:00:49,679
mindfulness with meditation I think
 

5956
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:51,169
mindfulness with meditation I think
that's a primary mistake when you say

5957
02:00:51,169 --> 02:00:51,179
that's a primary mistake when you say
 

5958
02:00:51,179 --> 02:00:52,669
that's a primary mistake when you say
ecology what do you mean by the way like

5959
02:00:52,669 --> 02:00:52,679
ecology what do you mean by the way like
 

5960
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:55,850
ecology what do you mean by the way like
so lots of many different variants no so

5961
02:00:55,850 --> 02:00:55,860
so lots of many different variants no so
 

5962
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:57,470
so lots of many different variants no so
what I mean by ecology is exactly what

5963
02:00:57,470 --> 02:00:57,480
what I mean by ecology is exactly what
 

5964
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:58,790
what I mean by ecology is exactly what
you have in an ecology you have a

5965
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:58,800
you have in an ecology you have a
 

5966
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,169
you have in an ecology you have a
dynamical system in which there are

5967
02:01:00,169 --> 02:01:00,179
dynamical system in which there are
 

5968
02:01:00,179 --> 02:01:02,270
dynamical system in which there are
checks and balances on each other and

5969
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:02,280
checks and balances on each other and
 

5970
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:05,089
checks and balances on each other and
right and I'll get to that with this

5971
02:01:05,089 --> 02:01:05,099
right and I'll get to that with this
 

5972
02:01:05,099 --> 02:01:06,530
right and I'll get to that with this
about mindfulness I'll make that

5973
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:06,540
about mindfulness I'll make that
 

5974
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:08,149
about mindfulness I'll make that
connection if you allow me

5975
02:01:08,149 --> 02:01:08,159
connection if you allow me
 

5976
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:10,070
connection if you allow me
so we're always framing we've been

5977
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:10,080
so we're always framing we've been
 

5978
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:13,129
so we're always framing we've been
talking about that right and for those

5979
02:01:13,129 --> 02:01:13,139
talking about that right and for those
 

5980
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:14,570
talking about that right and for those
of you who are not on YouTube there's

5981
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:14,580
of you who are not on YouTube there's
 

5982
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:17,089
of you who are not on YouTube there's
podcast I wear glasses and I'm now sort

5983
02:01:17,089 --> 02:01:17,099
podcast I wear glasses and I'm now sort
 

5984
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:19,490
podcast I wear glasses and I'm now sort
of putting my my my fingers and thumb

5985
02:01:19,490 --> 02:01:19,500
of putting my my my fingers and thumb
 

5986
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:22,250
of putting my my my fingers and thumb
around the frames of my glasses so this

5987
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:22,260
around the frames of my glasses so this
 

5988
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:25,370
around the frames of my glasses so this
is my frame and I and my lenses right

5989
02:01:25,370 --> 02:01:25,380
is my frame and I and my lenses right
 

5990
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:27,950
is my frame and I and my lenses right
and that frame the the frame holds a

5991
02:01:27,950 --> 02:01:27,960
and that frame the the frame holds a
 

5992
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:30,830
and that frame the the frame holds a
lens and I'm seeing through it in both

5993
02:01:30,830 --> 02:01:30,840
lens and I'm seeing through it in both
 

5994
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:33,530
lens and I'm seeing through it in both
senses Beyond and by means of it

5995
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:33,540
senses Beyond and by means of it
 

5996
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:36,169
senses Beyond and by means of it
so right now my glasses are transparent

5997
02:01:36,169 --> 02:01:36,179
so right now my glasses are transparent
 

5998
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:37,850
so right now my glasses are transparent
to me I want to use that as a strong

5999
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:37,860
to me I want to use that as a strong
 

6000
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:41,330
to me I want to use that as a strong
analogy for my mental framing okay now

6001
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:41,340
analogy for my mental framing okay now
 

6002
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:42,649
analogy for my mental framing okay now
sometimes this is what you do in

6003
02:01:42,649 --> 02:01:42,659
sometimes this is what you do in
 

6004
02:01:42,659 --> 02:01:45,589
sometimes this is what you do in
meditation I would argue

6005
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
meditation I would argue
 

6006
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:47,510
meditation I would argue
you step back from looking through your

6007
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:47,520
you step back from looking through your
 

6008
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,550
you step back from looking through your
frame and you look at them I'm taking my

6009
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:49,560
frame and you look at them I'm taking my
 

6010
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:51,470
frame and you look at them I'm taking my
glasses off right now and I'm looking at

6011
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:51,480
glasses off right now and I'm looking at
 

6012
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,629
glasses off right now and I'm looking at
them why might I do that to see if

6013
02:01:53,629 --> 02:01:53,639
them why might I do that to see if
 

6014
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:55,609
them why might I do that to see if
there's something in the lenses

6015
02:01:55,609 --> 02:01:55,619
there's something in the lenses
 

6016
02:01:55,619 --> 02:01:57,350
there's something in the lenses
that is distorting

6017
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:57,360
that is distorting
 

6018
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:00,709
that is distorting
right causing me to right now if I just

6019
02:02:00,709 --> 02:02:00,719
right causing me to right now if I just
 

6020
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:03,350
right causing me to right now if I just
did that that could be helpful but how

6021
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:03,360
did that that could be helpful but how
 

6022
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:06,470
did that that could be helpful but how
do I know if I've actually corrected

6023
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:06,480
do I know if I've actually corrected
 

6024
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:09,350
do I know if I've actually corrected
the change I made to my lenses what do I

6025
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:09,360
the change I made to my lenses what do I
 

6026
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,750
the change I made to my lenses what do I
need to do I need to put my glasses on

6027
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:11,760
need to do I need to put my glasses on
 

6028
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:14,390
need to do I need to put my glasses on
and see if I can now see more clearly

6029
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:14,400
and see if I can now see more clearly
 

6030
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,330
and see if I can now see more clearly
and deeply than I could before

6031
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:16,340
and deeply than I could before
 

6032
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:19,189
and deeply than I could before
meditation is this stepping back and

6033

meta and uh and I go for what's called
 

6322
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:09,109
meta and uh and I go for what's called
an existential interpretation over a an

trying to awaken in two ways
 

6330
02:08:17,579 --> 02:08:20,930
trying to awaken in two ways
I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I

6331
02:08:20,930 --> 02:08:20,940
I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I
 

6332
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:23,750
I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I
am constantly assuming an identity and

6333
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:23,760
am constantly assuming an identity and
 

6334
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:26,089
am constantly assuming an identity and
assigning an identity so I'm looking at

6335
02:08:26,089 --> 02:08:26,099
assigning an identity so I'm looking at
 

6336
02:08:26,099 --> 02:08:27,530
assigning an identity so I'm looking at
that

6337
02:08:27,530 --> 02:08:27,540
that
 

6338
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:29,810
that
I'm trying to awaken to that and then

6339
02:08:29,810 --> 02:08:29,820
I'm trying to awaken to that and then
 

6340
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:32,450
I'm trying to awaken to that and then
I'm trying to awake from the modal

6341
02:08:32,450 --> 02:08:32,460
I'm trying to awake from the modal
 

6342
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:35,209
I'm trying to awake from the modal
confusion that I can get into around

6343
02:08:35,209 --> 02:08:35,219
confusion that I can get into around
 

6344
02:08:35,219 --> 02:08:38,390
confusion that I can get into around
that and so I'm looking out onto the

6345
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:38,400
that and so I'm looking out onto the
 

6346
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:42,169
that and so I'm looking out onto the
world and I'm trying to see

6347
02:08:42,169 --> 02:08:42,179

02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:40,260
that I had like with with Conway
 

6506
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:43,430
that I had like with with Conway
that I should have pushed him on it um

6507
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:43,440
that I should have pushed him on it um
 

6508
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,550
that I should have pushed him on it um
because yeah as you get later in life

6509
02:11:45,550 --> 02:11:45,560
because yeah as you get later in life
 

6510
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:48,350
because yeah as you get later in life
things the simple things become more

6511
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:48,360
things the simple things become more
 

6512
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:50,810
things the simple things become more
difficult but a voice especially one

6513
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:50,820
difficult but a voice especially one
 

6514
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:52,669
difficult but a voice especially one
that hasn't been really heard is

6515
02:11:52,669 --> 02:11:52,679
that hasn't been really heard is
 

6516
02:11:52,679 --> 02:11:55,970
that hasn't been really heard is
important to hear so anyway I I

6517
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:55,980
important to hear so anyway I I
 

6518
02:11:55,980 --> 02:11:58,970
important to hear so anyway I I
apologize but you know I I share that I

6519
02:11:58,970 --> 02:11:58,980
apologize but you know I I share that I
 

6520
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:01,569
apologize but you know I I share that I
mean I can tell you that Within

6521
02:12:01,569 --> 02:12:01,579
mean I can tell you that Within
 

6522
02:12:01,579 --> 02:12:05,270
mean I can tell you that Within
my area he is important and he's famous

6523
02:12:05,270 --> 02:12:05,280
my area he is important and he's famous
 

6524
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:08,689
my area he is important and he's famous
and in academics in a sense so the Flow

6525
02:12:08,689 --> 02:12:08,699
and in academics in a sense so the Flow
 

6526
02:12:08,699 --> 02:12:09,410
and in academics in a sense so the Flow
State

6527
02:12:09,410 --> 02:12:09,420
State
 

6528
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:11,390
State
two important sets of conditions and

6529
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:11,400
two important sets of conditions and
 

6530
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:13,189
two important sets of conditions and
very often people only talk about one

6531
02:12:13,189 --> 02:12:13,199
very often people only talk about one
 

6532
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:14,390
very often people only talk about one
and and that's a little bit of a

6533
02:12:14,390 --> 02:12:14,400
and and that's a little bit of a
 

6534
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:16,370
and and that's a little bit of a
misrepresentation

6535
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:16,380
misrepresentation
 

6536
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:20,030
misrepresentation
so the flow state is in situations in

6537
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:20,040
so the flow state is in situations in
 

6538
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:22,729
so the flow state is in situations in
which the demand of the situation is

6539
02:12:22,729 --> 02:12:22,739
which the demand of the situation is
 

6540
02:12:22,739 --> 02:12:25,669
which the demand of the situation is
slightly beyond your skills

6541
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:25,679
slightly beyond your skills
 

6542
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:27,709
slightly beyond your skills
so you both have to apply all the skills

6543
02:12:27,709 --> 02:12:27,719
so you both have to apply all the skills
 

6544
02:12:27,719 --> 02:12:30,410
so you both have to apply all the skills
you can with as much sort of attention

6545
02:12:30,410 --> 02:12:30,420
you can with as much sort of attention
 

6546
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:32,330
you can with as much sort of attention
and concentration

6547
02:12:32,330 --> 02:12:32,340
and concentration
 

6548
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:34,609
and concentration
as you possibly can and you have to

6549
02:12:34,609 --> 02:12:34,619
as you possibly can and you have to
 

6550
02:12:34,619 --> 02:12:37,129
as you possibly can and you have to
actually be stretching your skills

6551
02:12:37,129 --> 02:12:37,139
actually be stretching your skills
 

6552
02:12:37,139 --> 02:12:39,169
actually be stretching your skills
now in this circumstance

6553
02:12:39,169 --> 02:12:39,179
now in this circumstance
 

6554
02:12:39,179 --> 02:12:43,010
now in this circumstance
people report optimal experience optimal

6555
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:43,020
people report optimal experience optimal
 

6556
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:45,290
people report optimal experience optimal
in two ways optimal in that this is one

6557
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:45,300
in two ways optimal in that this is one
 

6558
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:46,850
in two ways optimal in that this is one
of the best experiences I've had in my

6559
02:12:46,850 --> 02:12:46,860
of the best experiences I've had in my
 

6560
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:49,189
of the best experiences I've had in my
life it's distinct from pleasure and yet

6561
02:12:49,189 --> 02:12:49,199
life it's distinct from pleasure and yet
 

6562
02:12:49,199 --> 02:12:51,109
life it's distinct from pleasure and yet
it explains why people do very bizarre

6563
02:12:51,109 --> 02:12:51,119
it explains why people do very bizarre
 

6564
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:52,790
it explains why people do very bizarre
things like rock climbing because it's a

6565
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:52,800
things like rock climbing because it's a
 

6566
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,609
things like rock climbing because it's a
good flow induction right but they also

6567
02:12:55,609 --> 02:12:55,619
good flow induction right but they also
 

6568
02:12:55,619 --> 02:12:57,709
good flow induction right but they also
mean optimal in a second sense my best

6569
02:12:57,709 --> 02:12:57,719
mean optimal in a second sense my best
 

6570
02:12:57,719 --> 02:12:59,810
mean optimal in a second sense my best
performance so it's both the best

6571
02:12:59,810 --> 02:12:59,820
performance so it's both the best
 

6572
02:12:59,820 --> 02:13:02,629
performance so it's both the best
experience and the best performance

6573
02:13:02,629 --> 02:13:02,639
experience and the best performance
 

6574
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:04,250
experience and the best performance
so

6575
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:04,260
so
 

6576
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:06,229
so
checks out my also talked about the

6577
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:06,239
checks out my also talked about the
 

6578
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:08,990
checks out my also talked about the
information flow conditions you need

6579
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:09,000
information flow conditions you need
 

6580
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,729
information flow conditions you need
right in order for there to be this

6581
02:13:10,729 --> 02:13:10,739
right in order for there to be this
 

6582
02:13:10,739 --> 02:13:12,649
right in order for there to be this
state of flow and then I'll talk about

6583
02:13:12,649 --> 02:13:12,659
state of flow and then I'll talk about
 

6584
02:13:12,659 --> 02:13:14,030
state of flow and then I'll talk about
what it's like to be inflow in a sec

6585
02:13:14,030 --> 02:13:14,040
what it's like to be inflow in a sec
 

6586
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:17,030
what it's like to be inflow in a sec
what you need is three things you need

6587
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:17,040
what you need is three things you need
 

6588
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:18,109
what you need is three things you need
the information that you're getting to

6589
02:13:18,109 --> 02:13:18,119
the information that you're getting to
 

6590
02:13:18,119 --> 02:13:20,510
the information that you're getting to
be clear it can't be ambiguous or vague

6591
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:20,520
be clear it can't be ambiguous or vague
 

6592
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:21,830
be clear it can't be ambiguous or vague
think about a rock climber it's

6593
02:13:21,830 --> 02:13:21,840
think about a rock climber it's
 

6594
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,689
think about a rock climber it's
ambiguous and Vegas you're in trouble

6595
02:13:23,689 --> 02:13:23,699
ambiguous and Vegas you're in trouble
 

6596
02:13:23,699 --> 02:13:25,970
ambiguous and Vegas you're in trouble
right

6597
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:25,980
right
 

6598
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:27,830
right
there has to be tightly coupled feedback

6599
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:27,840
there has to be tightly coupled feedback
 

6600
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:29,450
there has to be tightly coupled feedback
between what you do and how the

6601
02:13:29,450 --> 02:13:29,460
between what you do and how the
 

6602
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:32,149
between what you do and how the
environment responds so when you act

6603
02:13:32,149 --> 02:13:32,159
environment responds so when you act
 

6604
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:33,649
environment responds so when you act
there's an immediate response there

6605
02:13:33,649 --> 02:13:33,659
there's an immediate response there
 

6606
02:13:33,659 --> 02:13:35,930
there's an immediate response there
isn't a big time lag between your action

6607
02:13:35,930 --> 02:13:35,940
isn't a big time lag between your action
 

6608
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:38,930
isn't a big time lag between your action
and your ability to detect the response

6609
02:13:38,930 --> 02:13:38,940
and your ability to detect the response
 

6610
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:40,729
and your ability to detect the response
from the environment

6611
02:13:40,729 --> 02:13:40,739
from the environment
 

6612
02:13:40,739 --> 02:13:43,910
from the environment
third failure has to matter error really

6613
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:43,920

so there should be some anxiety about
 

6618
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:50,569
so there should be some anxiety about
failure and failure matters so so that

that's what's called implicit learning
 

6770
02:17:01,319 --> 02:17:03,530
that's what's called implicit learning
and what's interesting is if you try and

02:17:03,530 --> 02:17:03,540
and what's interesting is if you try and
 

6772
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:06,110

results in you being able to track
 

6790
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:24,290
results in you being able to track
complex variables in a way but you don't

complex variables in a way but you don't
 

6792
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:26,330
complex variables in a way but you don't
know how you came up with that knowledge

6793
02:17:26,330 --> 02:17:26,340
know how you came up with that knowledge

history all kinds of stuff and yet you
 

6814
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:53,150
history all kinds of stuff and yet you
know how to do it and you didn't have to

02:17:53,150 --> 02:17:53,160
know how to do it and you didn't have to
 

6816

go to funeral school I'm just using that

6817

phenomenology but I think the

6979
02:20:58,969 --> 02:20:58,979
phenomenology but I think the
 

6980
02:20:58,979 --> 02:21:00,650

functionality has to do with the fact
 

6982

functionality has to do with the fact
that what's happening in flow is that

what's the opposite of flow depression

7043
02:22:16,849 --> 02:22:16,859
what's the opposite of flow depression
 

7044
02:22:16,859 --> 02:22:18,770
what's the opposite of flow depression
the fact depression has been called

7045
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:18,780
the fact depression has been called

anti-flow
 

7048
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:23,150
anti-flow
so you get these people that are flowing

7049
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:23,160
so you get these people that are flowing
 

7050
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:27,290
so you get these people that are flowing
in this non-real world and it's they

7051
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:27,300
in this non-real world and it's they
 

7052
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:30,230
in this non-real world and it's they
can't transfer it to the real world and

7053
02:22:30,230 --> 02:22:30,240
can't transfer it to the real world and
 

7054
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,969
can't transfer it to the real world and
it's actually costing them flow in the

7055
02:22:31,969 --> 02:22:31,979
it's actually costing them flow in the
 

7056
02:22:31,979 --> 02:22:33,650
it's actually costing them flow in the
real world so they tend to get they tend

7057
02:22:33,650 --> 02:22:33,660
real world so they tend to get they tend
 

7058
02:22:33,660 --> 02:22:35,270
real world so they tend to get they tend
to suffer depression and all kinds of

7059
02:22:35,270 --> 02:22:35,280
to suffer depression and all kinds of
 

7060
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:39,410
to suffer depression and all kinds of
things oh your ability your uh Habit and

yeah I'm not sure about that I just I

02:24:15,410 --> 02:24:15,420
they go to the physical world and turn
 

7136
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:17,270
they go to the physical world and turn
it back on when they're playing the

7137
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:17,280
it back on when they're playing the
 

7138
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:19,490
it back on when they're playing the
video games probably more effectively

7139
02:24:19,490 --> 02:24:19,500
video games probably more effectively
 

7140
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:20,990
video games probably more effectively
than

7141
02:24:20,990 --> 02:24:21,000
than
 

7142
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,870

um the the old timers so I just want to

7143
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:23,880
um the the old timers so I just want to
 

7144
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:26,450
um the the old timers so I just want to
say the sort of I'm not sure it's a

02:24:26,450 --> 02:24:26,460
say the sort of I'm not sure it's a
 

7146
02:24:26,460 --> 02:24:27,530
say the sort of I'm not sure it's a
really interesting question how

7147
02:24:27,530 --> 02:24:27,540
really interesting question how
 

7148
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:30,290
really interesting question how
transferable the flow state is I don't

7149
02:24:30,290 --> 02:24:30,300
transferable the flow state is I don't
 

7150
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:31,610
transferable the flow state is I don't
know if there's if you want to comment

7151
02:24:31,610 --> 02:24:31,620
know if there's if you want to comment
 

7152
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:33,530
know if there's if you want to comment
on I do I do um first of all I did

7153
02:24:33,530 --> 02:24:33,540
on I do I do um first of all I did
 

7154
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:35,150
on I do I do um first of all I did
qualify and I'm saying it's not all the

7155
02:24:35,150 --> 02:24:35,160
qualify and I'm saying it's not all the
 

7156

7159
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:38,760
people I'm holding out the possibility
 

7160
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:41,450
people I'm holding out the possibility
and I know this possibility because I've

7161
02:24:41,450 --> 02:24:41,460
and I know this possibility because I've
 

7162
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:44,090
and I know this possibility because I've
had students who actually suffer from

7163
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:44,100
had students who actually suffer from
 

7164
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:47,450
had students who actually suffer from
this and have done work around it with

7165
02:24:47,450 --> 02:24:47,460
this and have done work around it with
 

7166
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:48,410
this and have done work around it with
me

7167
02:24:48,410 --> 02:24:48,420
me
 

7168
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:54,469
me
um the the yeah

7169
02:24:54,469 --> 02:24:54,479

 

7170
02:24:54,479 --> 02:24:56,270

um and then they were able to step back

7171
02:24:56,270 --> 02:24:56,280
um and then they were able to step back
 

7172
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:58,490
um and then they were able to step back
from that and then take up the cognitive

7173
02:24:58,490 --> 02:24:58,500
from that and then take up the cognitive
 

7174
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:00,530
from that and then take up the cognitive
science and write about it and work on

7175
02:25:00,530 --> 02:25:00,540
science and write about it and work on
 

7176
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:01,610
science and write about it and work on
it

7177
02:25:01,610 --> 02:25:01,620
it
 

7178
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:04,190
it
um also I'm not so sure about the

7179
02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:04,200
um also I'm not so sure about the
 

7180
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:07,070
um also I'm not so sure about the
resiliency claim because

7181
02:25:07,070 --> 02:25:07,080
resiliency claim because
 

7182
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:09,590
resiliency claim because
um there seems to be

7183
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,600
um there seems to be
 

7184
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:13,730
um there seems to be
mounting evidence it's not consensus

7185
02:25:13,730 --> 02:25:13,740
mounting evidence it's not consensus
 

7186
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:15,170
mounting evidence it's not consensus
but it's certainly not regarded as

7187
02:25:15,170 --> 02:25:15,180
but it's certainly not regarded as
 

7188
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:18,050
but it's certainly not regarded as
Fringe that the increase in Social Media

7189
02:25:18,050 --> 02:25:18,060
Fringe that the increase in Social Media
 

7190
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:19,910
Fringe that the increase in Social Media
is being is is pretty strongly

7191

is being is is pretty strongly
 

7192
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,730
is being is is pretty strongly
correlated with increase in depression

7193
02:25:21,730 --> 02:25:21,740
correlated with increase in depression

self-destructive Behavior Uh things like

7195
02:25:24,290 --> 02:25:24,300
self-destructive Behavior Uh things like
 

7196
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:26,030
self-destructive Behavior Uh things like
this I would like to see that evidence

7197
02:25:26,030 --> 02:25:26,040
this I would like to see that evidence
 

7198
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:28,690
this I would like to see that evidence
because no no no no no

7199
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:28,700
because no no no no no
 

7200
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:32,889
because no no no no no
let me um

7202
02:25:32,899 --> 02:25:36,469

I'm always hesitant

7203
02:25:36,469 --> 02:25:36,479
I'm always hesitant
 

7204
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:40,090
I'm always hesitant
to too eagerly kind of agree with things

7205
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:40,100
to too eagerly kind of agree with things
 

7206
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:43,670
to too eagerly kind of agree with things
that I want to agree with that there's a

7207
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:43,680
that I want to agree with that there's a
 

7208
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:45,650
that I want to agree with that there's a
public perception everyone seems to hate

7209
02:25:45,650 --> 02:25:45,660
public perception everyone seems to hate
 

7210
02:25:45,660 --> 02:25:47,090
public perception everyone seems to hate
on social media

7211
02:25:47,090 --> 02:25:47,100
on social media
 

7212
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:50,929
on social media
I I I wonder as always with these things

7213
02:25:50,929 --> 02:25:50,939
I I I wonder as always with these things
 

7214
02:25:50,939 --> 02:25:53,450
I I I wonder as always with these things
does it reveal

7215
02:25:53,450 --> 02:25:53,460
does it reveal
 

7216
02:25:53,460 --> 02:25:55,849
does it reveal
depression or does it create depression

7217
02:25:55,849 --> 02:25:55,859
depression or does it create depression
 

7218
02:25:55,859 --> 02:25:57,889
depression or does it create depression
sure this is always the question it's

7219
02:25:57,889 --> 02:25:57,899
sure this is always the question it's
 

7220
02:25:57,899 --> 02:26:00,050
sure this is always the question it's
like uh whenever you talk about any

7221
02:26:00,050 --> 02:26:00,060
like uh whenever you talk about any
 

7222
02:26:00,060 --> 02:26:02,450
like uh whenever you talk about any
political or ideological movement does

7223
02:26:02,450 --> 02:26:02,460
political or ideological movement does
 

7224
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:05,750
political or ideological movement does
it create hate or does it reveal hate

7225
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:05,760
it create hate or does it reveal hate
 

7226
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:07,910
it create hate or does it reveal hate
and that's a good thing to ask and you

7227
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:07,920
and that's a good thing to ask and you
 

7228
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:09,530
and that's a good thing to ask and you
should always challenge the things that

7229
02:26:09,530 --> 02:26:09,540
should always challenge the things that
 

7230
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:11,809
should always challenge the things that
you intuitively want to believe I agree

7231
02:26:11,809 --> 02:26:11,819
you intuitively want to believe I agree
 

7232
02:26:11,819 --> 02:26:12,710
you intuitively want to believe I agree
with that

7233
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
with that
 

7234
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:13,670
with that
um

7235
02:26:13,670 --> 02:26:13,680
um
 

7236
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:16,910
um
like aliens so one of the ways you

7237
02:26:16,910 --> 02:26:16,920
like aliens so one of the ways you
 

7238
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:19,250
like aliens so one of the ways you
address this and it's not it's not

7239
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:19,260
address this and it's not it's not
 

7240
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:20,690
address this and it's not it's not
sufficient and I did say that work is

7241
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:20,700
sufficient and I did say that work is
 

7242
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:23,450
sufficient and I did say that work is
preliminary but you you if if I can give

7243
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:23,460
preliminary but you you if if I can give
 

7244
02:26:23,460 --> 02:26:27,230
preliminary but you you if if I can give
you a plausible mechanism that's new and

7245
02:26:27,230 --> 02:26:27,240
you a plausible mechanism that's new and
 

7246
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,450
you a plausible mechanism that's new and
then that lands Credence and part of

7247
02:26:29,450 --> 02:26:29,460
then that lands Credence and part of
 

7248
02:26:29,460 --> 02:26:31,790
then that lands Credence and part of
what happens right is illusory social

7249
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:31,800
what happens right is illusory social

events in fact they will stage things

events in fact they will stage things
 

7260
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:44,090
events in fact they will stage things
but we what the people that are looking

7261
02:26:44,090 --> 02:26:44,100
but we what the people that are looking
 

7262
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:47,090
but we what the people that are looking
at these right they take it often as

7263
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:47,100
at these right they take it often as
 

7264
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:50,210
at these right they take it often as
real and so they get downward social

7265
02:26:50,210 --> 02:26:50,220
real and so they get downward social
 

7266
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:53,510
real and so they get downward social
comparison and this is and and this is

02:26:53,510 --> 02:26:53,520
comparison and this is and and this is
 

7268
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:56,690
comparison and this is and and this is
like compared to how you and I probably

7269
02:26:56,690 --> 02:26:56,700
like compared to how you and I probably
 

7270
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:58,190
like compared to how you and I probably
live where we may get one or two of

7271
02:26:58,190 --> 02:26:58,200
live where we may get one or two of
 

7272
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,889
live where we may get one or two of
those events a week they're getting the

7273
02:27:00,889 --> 02:27:00,899
those events a week they're getting the
 

7274
02:27:00,899 --> 02:27:03,590
those events a week they're getting the
moment by moment and so it's a plausible

7275
02:27:03,590 --> 02:27:03,600
moment by moment and so it's a plausible
 

7276
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:05,690
moment by moment and so it's a plausible
mechanism that why it might be driving

7277
02:27:05,690 --> 02:27:05,700
mechanism that why it might be driving
 

7278
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:07,969
mechanism that why it might be driving
people into a more depressed state so

7279
02:27:07,969 --> 02:27:07,979
people into a more depressed state so
 

7280
02:27:07,979 --> 02:27:10,490
people into a more depressed state so
okay the the flip side of that is

7281
02:27:10,490 --> 02:27:10,500
okay the the flip side of that is
 

7282
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:13,010
okay the the flip side of that is
because there's a greater greater Gap

7283
02:27:13,010 --> 02:27:13,020
because there's a greater greater Gap

going from Real World to Instagram world
 

7286
02:27:15,180 --> 02:27:17,809
going from Real World to Instagram world
you start to be able to laugh at it and

7287
02:27:17,809 --> 02:27:17,819
you start to be able to laugh at it and
 

7288
02:27:17,819 --> 02:27:20,330
you start to be able to laugh at it and

example even just artificial filters
 

7292
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:24,889

people start to realize like yeah

7293
02:27:24,889 --> 02:27:24,899
people start to realize like yeah
 

7294
02:27:24,899 --> 02:27:27,530
people start to realize like yeah
there's like it's the same kind of Gap

7295
02:27:27,530 --> 02:27:27,540
there's like it's the same kind of Gap
 

7296
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:30,170
there's like it's the same kind of Gap
as there is between the Video Game World

7297
02:27:30,170 --> 02:27:30,180
as there is between the Video Game World
 

7298
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:32,150
as there is between the Video Game World
and the real world in the Video Game

7299
02:27:32,150 --> 02:27:32,160
and the real world in the Video Game
 

7300
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:33,590
and the real world in the Video Game
World you can do all kind kinds of wild

7301
02:27:33,590 --> 02:27:33,600
World you can do all kind kinds of wild
 

7302
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:36,770
World you can do all kind kinds of wild
things uh Grand Theft Auto you can shoot

7303
02:27:36,770 --> 02:27:36,780
things uh Grand Theft Auto you can shoot
 

7304
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:38,090
things uh Grand Theft Auto you can shoot
people up you can do whatever the heck

7305
02:27:38,090 --> 02:27:38,100
people up you can do whatever the heck
 

7306
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:40,010
people up you can do whatever the heck
you want in the real world you can't and

7307
02:27:40,010 --> 02:27:40,020
you want in the real world you can't and
 

7308
02:27:40,020 --> 02:27:42,710
you want in the real world you can't and
you start to develop an understanding of

7309
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:42,720
you start to develop an understanding of
 

7310
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:44,870
you start to develop an understanding of
how to have fun in the virtual world and

7311
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:44,880
how to have fun in the virtual world and
 

7312
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:47,270
how to have fun in the virtual world and
in the physical world and I think it's

7313
02:27:47,270 --> 02:27:47,280
in the physical world and I think it's
 

7314
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:49,130
in the physical world and I think it's
just a push back I'm not saying either

7315
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:49,140
just a push back I'm not saying either
 

7316
02:27:49,140 --> 02:27:50,570
just a push back I'm not saying either
is true though yeah those are very

7317
02:27:50,570 --> 02:27:50,580
is true though yeah those are very
 

7318
02:27:50,580 --> 02:27:52,910
is true though yeah those are very
interesting claims the more ridiculously

7319
02:27:52,910 --> 02:27:52,920
interesting claims the more ridiculously
 

7320
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:55,610
interesting claims the more ridiculously
out of touch Instagram becomes the

7321
02:27:55,610 --> 02:27:55,620
out of touch Instagram becomes the
 

7322
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:57,710
out of touch Instagram becomes the
easier you can laugh it off

7323
02:27:57,710 --> 02:27:57,720
easier you can laugh it off
 

7324
02:27:57,720 --> 02:27:59,929
easier you can laugh it off
potentially in terms of the effect it

7325
02:27:59,929 --> 02:27:59,939
potentially in terms of the effect it
 

7326
02:27:59,939 --> 02:28:01,370
potentially in terms of the effect it
has on your side okay I'll respond to

7327
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:01,380
has on your side okay I'll respond to
 

7328
02:28:01,380 --> 02:28:03,230
has on your side okay I'll respond to
that but at some point we should get

7329
02:28:03,230 --> 02:28:03,240
that but at some point we should get
 

7330
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:05,090
that but at some point we should get
back to flow yeah

7331
02:28:05,090 --> 02:28:05,100
back to flow yeah
 

7332
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:08,389
back to flow yeah
um as we engage in flow you laugh at the

7333
02:28:08,389 --> 02:28:08,399
um as we engage in flow you laugh at the
 

7334
02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:11,090
um as we engage in flow you laugh at the
the hair the shampoo commercial

7335
02:28:11,090 --> 02:28:11,100
the hair the shampoo commercial
 

7336
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:14,870
the hair the shampoo commercial
and you buy the shampoo

7337
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:14,880

 

7338
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:17,630

yeah there's a capacity for tremendous

7339
02:28:17,630 --> 02:28:17,640
yeah there's a capacity for tremendous
 

7340
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:19,910
yeah there's a capacity for tremendous
bullshitting because of the way these

7341
02:28:19,910 --> 02:28:19,920
bullshitting because of the way these
 

7342
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:22,070
bullshitting because of the way these
machines are designed to trigger

7343
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,080
machines are designed to trigger
 

7344
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:25,790
machines are designed to trigger
salience without triggering reflective

7345
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:25,800
salience without triggering reflective
 

7346
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:32,870
salience without triggering reflective
truth seeking

7347
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:32,880

 

7348
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:35,330

I'm thinking of counter examples uh

7349
02:28:35,330 --> 02:28:35,340
I'm thinking of counter examples uh
 

7350
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:39,410
I'm thinking of counter examples uh
because you're sometimes you're

7351
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:39,420
because you're sometimes you're
 

7352
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:42,110
because you're sometimes you're
can laugh all the way to the bank so you

7353
02:28:42,110 --> 02:28:42,120
can laugh all the way to the bank so you
 

7354
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:44,330
can laugh all the way to the bank so you
could you can laugh and not buy the

7355
02:28:44,330 --> 02:28:44,340
could you can laugh and not buy the
 

7356
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:46,370
could you can laugh and not buy the
shampoo right there's there's many cases

7357
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:46,380
shampoo right there's there's many cases
 

7358
02:28:46,380 --> 02:28:48,710
shampoo right there's there's many cases
so I think you have to laugh hard enough

7359
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:48,720
so I think you have to laugh hard enough
 

7360
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:51,590
so I think you have to laugh hard enough
you do have to laugh hard enough but the

7361
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:51,600
you do have to laugh hard enough but the
 

7362
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:54,050
you do have to laugh hard enough but the
advertising the advertisers get millions

7363
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:54,060
advertising the advertisers get millions
 

7364
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:56,030
advertising the advertisers get millions
of dollars precisely because for many

7365
02:28:56,030 --> 02:28:56,040
of dollars precisely because for many
 

7366
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:58,250
of dollars precisely because for many
many people it does make you buy the

7367
02:28:58,250 --> 02:28:58,260
many people it does make you buy the
 

7368
02:28:58,260 --> 02:29:00,710
many people it does make you buy the
shampoo and that's the concern and maybe

7369
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:00,720
shampoo and that's the concern and maybe
 

7370
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:03,110
shampoo and that's the concern and maybe
the machine of social media is such that

7371
02:29:03,110 --> 02:29:03,120
the machine of social media is such that
 

7372
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:05,750
the machine of social media is such that
it optimizes the shampoo buying yes the

7373
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:05,760
it optimizes the shampoo buying yes the
 

7374
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:08,030
it optimizes the shampoo buying yes the
point I was trying to make is

7375
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:08,040
point I was trying to make is
 

7376
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:10,490
point I was trying to make is
whether or not that particular example

7377
02:29:10,490 --> 02:29:10,500
whether or not that particular example
 

7378
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:14,090
whether or not that particular example
is you know ultimately right the

7379
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:14,100
is you know ultimately right the
 

7380
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:16,910
is you know ultimately right the
possibility of transfer failure is a

7381
02:29:16,910 --> 02:29:16,920
possibility of transfer failure is a
 

7382
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:18,349
possibility of transfer failure is a
real thing

7383
02:29:18,349 --> 02:29:18,359
real thing
 

7384
02:29:18,359 --> 02:29:21,349
real thing
um and I want to contrast that to an

7385
02:29:21,349 --> 02:29:21,359
um and I want to contrast that to an
 

7386
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:22,429
um and I want to contrast that to an
experience I had when I was in grad

7387
02:29:22,429 --> 02:29:22,439
experience I had when I was in grad
 

7388

02:29:33,469 --> 02:29:33,479
and I was having all the weird
 

7402
02:29:33,479 --> 02:29:35,929

lava all that stuff right
 

7406
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:42,290
lava all that stuff right
but my friends in grad school

02:29:42,290 --> 02:29:42,300
but my friends in grad school
 

7408
02:29:42,300 --> 02:29:44,690
but my friends in grad school
they said to me what's what what's

7409
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:44,700
they said to me what's what what's
 

7410

they said to me what's what what's
what's going on you're different

7411
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:46,560
what's going on you're different
 

7412
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:48,770
what's going on you're different
and I said what do you mean and they

02:29:49,790 --> 02:29:49,800
said
 

7416
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:51,889
said
well you're a lot more balanced in your

7417
02:29:51,889 --> 02:29:51,899
well you're a lot more balanced in your
 

7418
02:29:51,899 --> 02:29:54,230
well you're a lot more balanced in your
interactions and you're a lot more

7419
02:29:54,230 --> 02:29:54,240
interactions and you're a lot more
 

7420
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:56,389
interactions and you're a lot more
flowing and you're a lot more sort of

7421
02:29:56,389 --> 02:29:56,399
flowing and you're a lot more sort of
 

7422
02:29:56,399 --> 02:29:58,969
flowing and you're a lot more sort of
flexible and you adjust more and I

7423
02:29:58,969 --> 02:29:58,979
flexible and you adjust more and I
 

7424
02:29:58,979 --> 02:30:00,889
flexible and you adjust more and I
realized oh

7425
02:30:00,889 --> 02:30:00,899
realized oh
 

7426
02:30:00,899 --> 02:30:02,809
realized oh
you know and this was this was the sort

7427
02:30:02,809 --> 02:30:02,819
you know and this was this was the sort
 

7428
02:30:02,819 --> 02:30:06,590
you know and this was this was the sort
of Taoist claim around taichiton that it

7429
02:30:06,590 --> 02:30:06,600
of Taoist claim around taichiton that it
 

7430
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:09,530
of Taoist claim around taichiton that it
actually transfers in ways that you

7431
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:09,540
actually transfers in ways that you
 

7432
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:11,150
actually transfers in ways that you
might not expect you start to be able

7433
02:30:11,150 --> 02:30:11,160
might not expect you start to be able
 

7434
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:13,790
might not expect you start to be able
and I've now noticed that I now notice

7435
02:30:13,790 --> 02:30:13,800
and I've now noticed that I now notice
 

7436
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:16,429
and I've now noticed that I now notice
how how I'm doing Tai Chi even in this

7437
02:30:16,429 --> 02:30:16,439
how how I'm doing Tai Chi even in this
 

7438
02:30:16,439 --> 02:30:18,590
how how I'm doing Tai Chi even in this
interaction and how it can facilitate

7439
02:30:18,590 --> 02:30:18,600
interaction and how it can facilitate
 

7440
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:21,889
interaction and how it can facilitate
and afford and so there's a powerful

7441
02:30:21,889 --> 02:30:21,899
and afford and so there's a powerful
 

7442
02:30:21,899 --> 02:30:24,230
and afford and so there's a powerful
transfer and that's what I meant by you

7443
02:30:24,230 --> 02:30:24,240
transfer and that's what I meant by you
 

7444
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:26,809
transfer and that's what I meant by you
know flow wisely not only flow in a way

7445
02:30:26,809 --> 02:30:26,819
know flow wisely not only flow in a way
 

7446
02:30:26,819 --> 02:30:29,510
know flow wisely not only flow in a way
that's right making sure that you're

7447
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:29,520
that's right making sure that you're
 

7448
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:30,950
that's right making sure that you're
distinguishing causation from

7449
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:30,960
distinguishing causation from
 

7450
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:32,809
distinguishing causation from
correlation which flow can do

7451
02:30:32,809 --> 02:30:32,819
correlation which flow can do
 

7452
02:30:32,819 --> 02:30:36,889
correlation which flow can do
but find how to situate it home it so

7453
02:30:36,889 --> 02:30:36,899
but find how to situate it home it so
 

7454
02:30:36,899 --> 02:30:38,330
but find how to situate it home it so
that it will percolate through your

7455
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:38,340
that it will percolate through your
 

7456
02:30:38,340 --> 02:30:40,190
that it will percolate through your
psyche and permeate through many domains

7457
02:30:40,190 --> 02:30:40,200
psyche and permeate through many domains
 

7458
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:42,469
psyche and permeate through many domains
of your life

7459
02:30:42,469 --> 02:30:42,479
of your life
 

7460
02:30:42,479 --> 02:30:44,870
of your life
is there something you could say

7461
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:44,880
is there something you could say
 

7462
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:46,550
is there something you could say
similar to our discussion about

7463
02:30:46,550 --> 02:30:46,560
similar to our discussion about
 

7464
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:49,250
similar to our discussion about
mindfulness and meditation

7465
02:30:49,250 --> 02:30:49,260
mindfulness and meditation
 

7466
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:52,090
mindfulness and meditation
and contemplation about the world that

7467
02:30:52,090 --> 02:30:52,100
and contemplation about the world that
 

7468
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:56,090
and contemplation about the world that
psychedelics take our mind where does it

7469
02:30:56,090 --> 02:30:56,100
psychedelics take our mind where does it
 

7470
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:59,950
psychedelics take our mind where does it
where does the mind go

7471
02:30:59,950 --> 02:30:59,960
where does the mind go
 

7472
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:04,610
where does the mind go
uh when it's on psychedelics

7473
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:04,620
uh when it's on psychedelics
 

7474
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:07,670
uh when it's on psychedelics
I want to remind you of something you

7475
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:07,680
I want to remind you of something you
 

7476
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:10,490
I want to remind you of something you
said which is a is a gem

7477
02:31:10,490 --> 02:31:10,500
said which is a is a gem
 

7478
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:12,590
said which is a is a gem
it's not so much the experience but the

7479
02:31:12,590 --> 02:31:12,600
it's not so much the experience but the
 

7480
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:14,030
it's not so much the experience but the
degree to which it can be integrated

7481
02:31:14,030 --> 02:31:14,040
degree to which it can be integrated
 

7482
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:16,370
degree to which it can be integrated
back

7483
02:31:16,370 --> 02:31:16,380
back
 

7484
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:18,650
back
so here's a proposal comes from Woodward

7485
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:18,660
so here's a proposal comes from Woodward
 

7486
02:31:18,660 --> 02:31:20,929
so here's a proposal comes from Woodward
and others a lot of convergence around

7487
02:31:20,929 --> 02:31:20,939
and others a lot of convergence around
 

7488
02:31:20,939 --> 02:31:22,910
and others a lot of convergence around
this card Harris is talking about it

7489
02:31:22,910 --> 02:31:22,920
this card Harris is talking about it
 

7490
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:25,429
this card Harris is talking about it
similarly in the entropic brain but I'm

7491
02:31:25,429 --> 02:31:25,439
similarly in the entropic brain but I'm
 

7492
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:26,270
similarly in the entropic brain but I'm
not going to talk first about

7493
02:31:26,270 --> 02:31:26,280
not going to talk first about
 

7494
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,469
not going to talk first about
psychedelics I'm going to talk about

7495
02:31:27,469 --> 02:31:27,479
psychedelics I'm going to talk about
 

7496
02:31:27,479 --> 02:31:28,910
psychedelics I'm going to talk about
neural networks

7497
02:31:28,910 --> 02:31:28,920
neural networks
 

7498
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:31,070
neural networks
and I'm going to talk about a classic

7499
02:31:31,070 --> 02:31:31,080
and I'm going to talk about a classic
 

7500
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:32,690
and I'm going to talk about a classic
problem in neural networks so neural

7501
02:31:32,690 --> 02:31:32,700
problem in neural networks so neural
 

7502
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:35,210
problem in neural networks so neural
networks like us with intuition and

7503
02:31:35,210 --> 02:31:35,220
networks like us with intuition and
 

7504
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:37,010
networks like us with intuition and
implicit learning are fantastic at

7505
02:31:37,010 --> 02:31:37,020
implicit learning are fantastic at
 

7506
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:40,250
implicit learning are fantastic at
picking up on complex patterns uh which

7507
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:40,260
picking up on complex patterns uh which
 

7508
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:41,809
picking up on complex patterns uh which
no one else we were talking about I'm

7509
02:31:41,809 --> 02:31:41,819
no one else we were talking about I'm
 

7510
02:31:41,819 --> 02:31:43,910
no one else we were talking about I'm
talking about a general just general

7511
02:31:43,910 --> 02:31:43,920
talking about a general just general
 

7512
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:47,389
talking about a general just general
artificial and biological yes yes yes

7513
02:31:47,389 --> 02:31:47,399
artificial and biological yes yes yes
 

7514
02:31:47,399 --> 02:31:50,389
artificial and biological yes yes yes
um I I think at this point there is no

7515
02:31:50,389 --> 02:31:50,399
um I I think at this point there is no
 

7516
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:52,010
um I I think at this point there is no
relevant difference

7517
02:31:52,010 --> 02:31:52,020
relevant difference
 

7518
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:53,929
relevant difference
so one of the classic problems because

7519
02:31:53,929 --> 02:31:53,939
so one of the classic problems because
 

7520
02:31:53,939 --> 02:31:56,270
so one of the classic problems because
of their power is they suffer from

7521
02:31:56,270 --> 02:31:56,280
of their power is they suffer from
 

7522
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:58,730
of their power is they suffer from
overfitting to the data or for those of

7523
02:31:58,730 --> 02:31:58,740
overfitting to the data or for those of
 

7524
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:01,130
overfitting to the data or for those of
you are you know from a statistical

7525
02:32:01,130 --> 02:32:01,140
you are you know from a statistical
 

7526
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:04,670
you are you know from a statistical
orientation they pick up patterns in the

7527
02:32:04,670 --> 02:32:04,680
orientation they pick up patterns in the
 

7528
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:07,309
orientation they pick up patterns in the
sample that aren't actually present in

7529
02:32:07,309 --> 02:32:07,319
sample that aren't actually present in
 

7530
02:32:07,319 --> 02:32:10,550
sample that aren't actually present in
the population right and so

7531
02:32:10,550 --> 02:32:10,560
the population right and so
 

7532
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:12,830
the population right and so
what you do is there's various

7533
02:32:12,830 --> 02:32:12,840
what you do is there's various
 

7534
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:15,469
what you do is there's various
strategies you can do Dropout where you

7535
02:32:15,469 --> 02:32:15,479
strategies you can do Dropout where you
 

7536
02:32:15,479 --> 02:32:17,870
strategies you can do Dropout where you
you to periodically turn off half of the

7537
02:32:17,870 --> 02:32:17,880
you to periodically turn off half of the
 

7538
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:20,290
you to periodically turn off half of the
nodes in a network you can drop noise

7539
02:32:20,290 --> 02:32:20,300
nodes in a network you can drop noise
 

7540
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:24,110
nodes in a network you can drop noise
into the network and what that does is

7541
02:32:24,110 --> 02:32:24,120
into the network and what that does is
 

7542
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:27,050
into the network and what that does is
it prevents overfitting to the data and

7543
02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:27,060
it prevents overfitting to the data and
 

7544
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:28,790
it prevents overfitting to the data and
allows the network to generalize more

7545
02:32:28,790 --> 02:32:28,800
allows the network to generalize more
 

7546
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:32,150
allows the network to generalize more
powerfully to the environment

7547
02:32:32,150 --> 02:32:32,160

 

7548
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:35,570

I propose to you that that's basically

7549
02:32:35,570 --> 02:32:35,580
I propose to you that that's basically
 

7550
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:37,510
I propose to you that that's basically
what psychedelics do

7551
02:32:37,510 --> 02:32:37,520
what psychedelics do
 

7552
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:41,030
what psychedelics do
they they do that they basically do

7553
02:32:41,030 --> 02:32:41,040
they they do that they basically do
 

7554
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:45,770
they they do that they basically do
significant constraint reduction and so

7555
02:32:45,770 --> 02:32:45,780
significant constraint reduction and so
 

7556
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:48,110
significant constraint reduction and so
you get areas of the brain talking to

7557
02:32:48,110 --> 02:32:48,120
you get areas of the brain talking to
 

7558
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:49,790
you get areas of the brain talking to
each other that don't normally talk to

7559
02:32:49,790 --> 02:32:49,800
each other that don't normally talk to
 

7560
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:51,889
each other that don't normally talk to
each other areas that do talk to each

7561
02:32:51,889 --> 02:32:51,899
each other areas that do talk to each
 

7562
02:32:51,899 --> 02:32:53,450
each other areas that do talk to each
other not talking to each other down

7563
02:32:53,450 --> 02:32:53,460
other not talking to each other down
 

7564
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:55,130
other not talking to each other down
regulation of areas that are very

7565
02:32:55,130 --> 02:32:55,140
regulation of areas that are very
 

7566
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:57,349
regulation of areas that are very
dominant like the default mode Network

7567
02:32:57,349 --> 02:32:57,359

7568
02:32:57,359 --> 02:32:59,450
dominant like the default mode Network
Etc and what that does is exactly

7569
02:32:59,450 --> 02:32:59,460
Etc and what that does is exactly
 

7570
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:02,030
Etc and what that does is exactly
something strongly analogous sorry to

beings an Insight problem that they're

7579
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:11,100
beings an Insight problem that they're
 

7580
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:13,070
beings an Insight problem that they're
trying to solve and you throw in some

7581
02:33:13,070 --> 02:33:13,080
trying to solve and you throw in some
 

7582
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:15,530
trying to solve and you throw in some
noise like literally static on the

7583
02:33:15,530 --> 02:33:15,540
noise like literally static on the
 

7584
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:17,090

screen you can trigger an Insight in

7585
02:33:17,090 --> 02:33:17,100
screen you can trigger an Insight in
 

7586
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:18,670
screen you can trigger an Insight in
them

7587
02:33:18,670 --> 02:33:18,680
them
 

7588
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:21,650
them
so like literally a very simplistic kind

7589
02:33:21,650 --> 02:33:21,660
so like literally a very simplistic kind
 

7590
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:23,690
so like literally a very simplistic kind
of noise to the perception system right

7591
02:33:23,690 --> 02:33:23,700
of noise to the perception system right
 

7592
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:25,910
of noise to the perception system right
can it can break it out of overfitting

7593
02:33:25,910 --> 02:33:25,920
can it can break it out of overfitting
 

7594
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:28,969
can it can break it out of overfitting
to the data and open you up now that

7595
02:33:28,969 --> 02:33:28,979
to the data and open you up now that
 

7596
02:33:28,979 --> 02:33:30,530
to the data and open you up now that
means though

7597
02:33:30,530 --> 02:33:30,540
means though
 

7598
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:33,710
means though
that just doing that right

7599
02:33:33,710 --> 02:33:33,720
that just doing that right
 

7600
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:35,450
that just doing that right
in and of itself

7601
02:33:35,450 --> 02:33:35,460
in and of itself
 

7602
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:36,950
in and of itself
is not

7603
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:36,960
is not
 

7604
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,870
is not
the answer

7605
02:33:38,870 --> 02:33:38,880
the answer
 

7606
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:42,170
the answer
because you also have to make sure that

7607
02:33:42,170 --> 02:33:42,180
because you also have to make sure that
 

7608
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:45,050
because you also have to make sure that
the system can go back to exploring that

7609
02:33:45,050 --> 02:33:45,060
the system can go back to exploring that
 

7610
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:47,150
the system can go back to exploring that
new space properly this isn't a problem

7611
02:33:47,150 --> 02:33:47,160
new space properly this isn't a problem
 

7612
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:48,889
new space properly this isn't a problem
with neural networks you turn off

7613
02:33:48,889 --> 02:33:48,899
with neural networks you turn off
 

7614
02:33:48,899 --> 02:33:50,330
with neural networks you turn off
Dropout and they just go back to being

7615
02:33:50,330 --> 02:33:50,340
Dropout and they just go back to being
 

7616
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:52,309
Dropout and they just go back to being
powerful neural networks and now they

7617
02:33:52,309 --> 02:33:52,319
powerful neural networks and now they
 

7618
02:33:52,319 --> 02:33:53,570
powerful neural networks and now they
explore the state space that they

7619
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:53,580
explore the state space that they
 

7620
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:55,969
explore the state space that they
couldn't explore before human beings are

7621
02:33:55,969 --> 02:33:55,979
couldn't explore before human beings are
 

7622
02:33:55,979 --> 02:33:58,370
couldn't explore before human beings are
a little bit more messy uh around this

7623
02:33:58,370 --> 02:33:58,380
a little bit more messy uh around this
 

7624
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:00,830
a little bit more messy uh around this
and this is where the analogy does get a

7625
02:34:00,830 --> 02:34:00,840
and this is where the analogy does get a
 

7626
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:02,929
and this is where the analogy does get a
little bit strained so they need

7627
02:34:02,929 --> 02:34:02,939
little bit strained so they need
 

7628
02:34:02,939 --> 02:34:05,030
little bit strained so they need
practices

7629
02:34:05,030 --> 02:34:05,040
practices
 

7630
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:08,990
practices
to help them integrate that opening up

7631
02:34:08,990 --> 02:34:09,000
to help them integrate that opening up
 

7632
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,210
to help them integrate that opening up
to the new state space so they can

7633
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:11,220
to the new state space so they can
 

7634
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:14,270
to the new state space so they can
properly integrate it so beyond Leary's

7635
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:14,280
properly integrate it so beyond Leary's
 

7636
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:15,969
properly integrate it so beyond Leary's
State

7637
02:34:15,969 --> 02:34:15,979

psychedelics need to be practiced within

7645
02:34:27,230 --> 02:34:27,240
psychedelics need to be practiced within
 

7646
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:29,389
psychedelics need to be practiced within
a sapiential framework a framework in

7647
02:34:29,389 --> 02:34:29,399
a sapiential framework a framework in
 

7648
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:31,969
a sapiential framework a framework in
which people are independently and

7649
02:34:31,969 --> 02:34:31,979
which people are independently and
 

7650
02:34:31,979 --> 02:34:34,969
which people are independently and
beforehand improving their abilities to

7651
02:34:34,969 --> 02:34:34,979
beforehand improving their abilities to
 

7652
02:34:34,979 --> 02:34:37,010
beforehand improving their abilities to
deal with self-deception and afford

7653
02:34:37,010 --> 02:34:37,020
deal with self-deception and afford
 

7654
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:39,290
deal with self-deception and afford
insight and self-regulate this is of

7655
02:34:39,290 --> 02:34:39,300
insight and self-regulate this is of
 

7656
02:34:39,300 --> 02:34:41,750
insight and self-regulate this is of
course the overwhelming way in which

7657
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:41,760
course the overwhelming way in which
 

7658
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:43,429
course the overwhelming way in which
psychedelics are used by indigenous

7659
02:34:43,429 --> 02:34:43,439
psychedelics are used by indigenous
 

7660
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:44,389
psychedelics are used by indigenous
cultures

7661
02:34:44,389 --> 02:34:44,399
cultures
 

7662
02:34:44,399 --> 02:34:46,910
cultures
and I think if we put them into that

7663
02:34:46,910 --> 02:34:46,920
and I think if we put them into that
 

7664
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:51,170
and I think if we put them into that
context then they can help the project

7665
02:34:51,170 --> 02:34:51,180
context then they can help the project
 

7666
02:34:51,180 --> 02:34:52,929
context then they can help the project
of people

7667
02:34:52,929 --> 02:34:52,939
of people
 

7668
02:34:52,939 --> 02:34:55,429
of people
self-transcending cultivating meaning

7669
02:34:55,429 --> 02:34:55,439
self-transcending cultivating meaning
 

7670
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:57,830
self-transcending cultivating meaning
and increasing wisdom but if I think we

7671
02:34:57,830 --> 02:34:57,840
and increasing wisdom but if I think we
 

7672
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:00,770
and increasing wisdom but if I think we
removed them out of that context and put

7673
02:35:00,770 --> 02:35:00,780
removed them out of that context and put
 

7674
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:04,190
removed them out of that context and put
them in the context of Commodities taken

7675
02:35:04,190 --> 02:35:04,200
them in the context of Commodities taken
 

7676
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:06,590
them in the context of Commodities taken
just to have certain phenomenological

7677
02:35:06,590 --> 02:35:06,600
just to have certain phenomenological
 

7678
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:10,550
just to have certain phenomenological
changes we run certain important risks

7679
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:10,560
changes we run certain important risks
 

7680
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:13,670
changes we run certain important risks
so using the term of higher States Of

7681
02:35:13,670 --> 02:35:13,680
so using the term of higher States Of
 

7682
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:15,730
so using the term of higher States Of
Consciousness yes

7683
02:35:15,730 --> 02:35:15,740
Consciousness yes
 

7684
02:35:15,740 --> 02:35:18,349
Consciousness yes
is consciousness an important part of

7685
02:35:18,349 --> 02:35:18,359
is consciousness an important part of
 

7686
02:35:18,359 --> 02:35:21,110
is consciousness an important part of
that word what what why higher

7687
02:35:21,110 --> 02:35:21,120
that word what what why higher
 

7688
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:25,130
that word what what why higher
uh is it is it is it a higher state or

7689
02:35:25,130 --> 02:35:25,140
uh is it is it is it a higher state or
 

7690
02:35:25,140 --> 02:35:29,210
uh is it is it is it a higher state or
is it a detour a side road on the main

7691
02:35:29,210 --> 02:35:29,220
is it a detour a side road on the main
 

7692
02:35:29,220 --> 02:35:32,630
is it a detour a side road on the main
road of Consciousness what so where do

7693
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:32,640
road of Consciousness what so where do
 

7694
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:35,990
road of Consciousness what so where do
we go here I think the Psychedelic state

7695
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:36,000
we go here I think the Psychedelic state
 

7696
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,809
we go here I think the Psychedelic state
is on a Continuum there's insight and

7697
02:35:38,809 --> 02:35:38,819
is on a Continuum there's insight and
 

7698
02:35:38,819 --> 02:35:41,090
is on a Continuum there's insight and
then it flows an inside Cascade there's

7699
02:35:41,090 --> 02:35:41,100
then it flows an inside Cascade there's
 

7700
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:43,010
then it flows an inside Cascade there's
flow and then you can have sort of

7701
02:35:43,010 --> 02:35:43,020
flow and then you can have sort of
 

7702
02:35:43,020 --> 02:35:44,809
flow and then you can have sort of
psychedelic experiences mind revealing

7703
02:35:44,809 --> 02:35:44,819
psychedelic experiences mind revealing
 

7704
02:35:44,819 --> 02:35:47,330
psychedelic experiences mind revealing
experiences and then but they overlap

7705
02:35:47,330 --> 02:35:47,340
experiences and then but they overlap
 

7706
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:49,670
experiences and then but they overlap
with mystical experiences and they

7707
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:49,680
with mystical experiences and they
 

7708
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:51,530
with mystical experiences and they
aren't the same

7709
02:35:51,530 --> 02:35:51,540
aren't the same
 

7710
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:53,770
aren't the same
um so for example in the Griffis lab

7711
02:35:53,770 --> 02:35:53,780
um so for example in the Griffis lab
 

7712
02:35:53,780 --> 02:35:56,450
um so for example in the Griffis lab
they gave people cytocybin and they

7713
02:35:56,450 --> 02:35:56,460
they gave people cytocybin and they
 

7714
02:35:56,460 --> 02:35:58,250
they gave people cytocybin and they
taught them ahead of time

7715
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:58,260
taught them ahead of time
 

7716
02:35:58,260 --> 02:36:00,530
taught them ahead of time
how like sort of the features of a

7717
02:36:00,530 --> 02:36:00,540
how like sort of the features of a
 

7718
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:02,870
how like sort of the features of a
mystical experience and only a certain

7719
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:02,880
mystical experience and only a certain
 

7720
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:04,910
mystical experience and only a certain
proportion of the people that took the

7721
02:36:04,910 --> 02:36:04,920
proportion of the people that took the
 

7722
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:07,130
proportion of the people that took the
psilocybin went from a psychedelic into

7723
02:36:07,130 --> 02:36:07,140
psilocybin went from a psychedelic into
 

7724
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:08,570
psilocybin went from a psychedelic into
a mystical experience what was

7725
02:36:08,570 --> 02:36:08,580
a mystical experience what was
 

7726
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:10,429
a mystical experience what was
interesting is the people that had the

7727
02:36:10,429 --> 02:36:10,439
interesting is the people that had the
 

7728
02:36:10,439 --> 02:36:13,250
interesting is the people that had the
mystical experience had measurable and

7729
02:36:13,250 --> 02:36:13,260
mystical experience had measurable and
 

7730
02:36:13,260 --> 02:36:15,290
mystical experience had measurable and
long-standing change to one of the big

7731
02:36:15,290 --> 02:36:15,300
long-standing change to one of the big
 

7732
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:17,330
long-standing change to one of the big
five factors of Personality they had

7733
02:36:17,330 --> 02:36:17,340
five factors of Personality they had
 

7734
02:36:17,340 --> 02:36:19,010
five factors of Personality they had
increased openness openness is supposed

7735
02:36:19,010 --> 02:36:19,020
increased openness openness is supposed
 

7736
02:36:19,020 --> 02:36:21,290
increased openness openness is supposed
to actually go down over time and these

7737
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:21,300
to actually go down over time and these
 

7738
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:22,309
to actually go down over time and these
traits aren't supposed to be that

7739
02:36:22,309 --> 02:36:22,319
traits aren't supposed to be that
 

7740
02:36:22,319 --> 02:36:25,190
traits aren't supposed to be that
malleable and it was significantly like

7741
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,200
malleable and it was significantly like
 

7742
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:29,150
malleable and it was significantly like
altered right but imagine if you just

7743
02:36:29,150 --> 02:36:29,160
altered right but imagine if you just
 

7744
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:32,030
altered right but imagine if you just
created more openness in a person

7745
02:36:32,030 --> 02:36:32,040
created more openness in a person
 

7746
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:34,910
created more openness in a person
right and they're now open to a lot more

7747
02:36:34,910 --> 02:36:34,920
right and they're now open to a lot more
 

7748
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:36,830
right and they're now open to a lot more
and they want to explore a lot more but

7749
02:36:36,830 --> 02:36:36,840
and they want to explore a lot more but
 

7750
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:38,270
and they want to explore a lot more but
you don't give them the tools of

7751
02:36:38,270 --> 02:36:38,280
you don't give them the tools of
 

7752
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:40,849
you don't give them the tools of
discernment that could be problematic

7753
02:36:40,849 --> 02:36:40,859
discernment that could be problematic
 

7754
02:36:40,859 --> 02:36:43,429
discernment that could be problematic
for them in important ways that could be

7755
02:36:43,429 --> 02:36:43,439
for them in important ways that could be
 

7756
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:45,950
for them in important ways that could be
very problematic yes I got it but you

7757
02:36:45,950 --> 02:36:45,960
very problematic yes I got it but you
 

7758
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:50,150
very problematic yes I got it but you
know so you have to land the plane

7759
02:36:50,150 --> 02:36:50,160
know so you have to land the plane
 

7760
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:53,270
know so you have to land the plane
uh in a productive way somehow

7761
02:36:53,270 --> 02:36:53,280
uh in a productive way somehow
 

7762
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:55,070
uh in a productive way somehow
integrated back into your life and how

7763
02:36:55,070 --> 02:36:55,080
integrated back into your life and how
 

7764
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:57,050
integrated back into your life and how
you see the world and how you frame your

7765
02:36:57,050 --> 02:36:57,060
you see the world and how you frame your
 

7766
02:36:57,060 --> 02:36:58,730
you see the world and how you frame your
perception of that world and when people

7767
02:36:58,730 --> 02:36:58,740
perception of that world and when people
 

7768
02:36:58,740 --> 02:37:01,429
perception of that world and when people
do that that's when I call it a

7769
02:37:01,429 --> 02:37:01,439

the way he's a genius but basically what
it did was it it took that religious

it did was it it took that religious
 

7968
02:40:56,819 --> 02:40:59,450
it did was it it took that religious
vision and gave it the air of

7969
02:40:59,450 --> 02:40:59,460
vision and gave it the air of
 

7970
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:02,210
vision and gave it the air of
philosophical intelligibility and

and then Marx takes that and says you
 

7976
02:41:07,319 --> 02:41:09,469
and then Marx takes that and says you
know that process of the by which the

very focused on the propositional level
 

8050
02:42:42,899 --> 02:42:47,030
very focused on the propositional level

that's why kirkegon met when he said
Hegel made a system and then he sat down

it's very popular to criticize communism

02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:53,570
it's very popular to criticize communism
Marxism these days

Marxism these days

02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:56,570
Marxism these days
and I often put myself in the place

8151
02:44:56,570 --> 02:44:56,580
and I often put myself in the place
 

8152
02:44:56,580 --> 02:44:59,090
and I often put myself in the place
before any of the implementations came

8153
02:44:59,090 --> 02:44:59,100
before any of the implementations came
 

8154

before any of the implementations came
to be

to be

to be
I I tried to think if I would be able to

8157
02:45:03,889 --> 02:45:03,899
I I tried to think if I would be able to
 

8158
02:45:03,899 --> 02:45:06,110
I I tried to think if I would be able to
predict

8159
02:45:06,110 --> 02:45:06,120
predict
 

8160
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:09,469
predict
what the implementations of Marxism and

8161
02:45:09,469 --> 02:45:09,479
what the implementations of Marxism and
 

8162
02:45:09,479 --> 02:45:11,570
what the implementations of Marxism and
communism would result in in the 20th

8163
02:45:11,570 --> 02:45:11,580
communism would result in in the 20th
 

8164
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:13,670
communism would result in in the 20th
century and I'm not sure

8165
02:45:13,670 --> 02:45:13,680
century and I'm not sure
 

8166
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:15,590
century and I'm not sure
I'm smart enough to make that prediction

8167
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:15,600
I'm smart enough to make that prediction
 

8168
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:20,050
I'm smart enough to make that prediction
because at the core of the ideas are

8169
02:45:20,050 --> 02:45:20,060
because at the core of the ideas are
 

8170
02:45:20,060 --> 02:45:23,450
because at the core of the ideas are
respecting it's uh with with Marx it's

8171
02:45:23,450 --> 02:45:23,460
respecting it's uh with with Marx it's
 

8172
02:45:23,460 --> 02:45:25,910
respecting it's uh with with Marx it's
very economics type of theory so it's

8173
02:45:25,910 --> 02:45:25,920
very economics type of theory so it's
 

8174
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:27,650
very economics type of theory so it's
basically respecting the value of the

8175
02:45:27,650 --> 02:45:27,660
basically respecting the value of the
 

8176
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:29,230
basically respecting the value of the
worker

8177
02:45:29,230 --> 02:45:29,240
worker
 

8178
02:45:29,240 --> 02:45:32,690
worker
and the the regular man in society for

8179
02:45:32,690 --> 02:45:32,700
and the the regular man in society for
 

8180
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:34,309
and the the regular man in society for
for making a contribution to that

8181
02:45:34,309 --> 02:45:34,319
for making a contribution to that
 

8182
02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:37,790
for making a contribution to that
society and to me that seems like

8183
02:45:37,790 --> 02:45:37,800
society and to me that seems like
 

8184
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:41,450
society and to me that seems like
a powerful idea and it's not clear to me

8185
02:45:41,450 --> 02:45:41,460
a powerful idea and it's not clear to me
 

8186
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:44,450
a powerful idea and it's not clear to me
how it goes wrong in fact it's still not

8187
02:45:44,450 --> 02:45:44,460
how it goes wrong in fact it's still not
 

8188
02:45:44,460 --> 02:45:45,969
how it goes wrong in fact it's still not
clear to me

8189
02:45:45,969 --> 02:45:45,979
clear to me
 

8190
02:45:45,979 --> 02:45:49,849
clear to me
why the hell did this like would Stalin

8191
02:45:49,849 --> 02:45:49,859
why the hell did this like would Stalin
 

8192
02:45:49,859 --> 02:45:53,090
why the hell did this like would Stalin
happen or mile happened it's there's

8193
02:45:53,090 --> 02:45:53,100
happen or mile happened it's there's
 

8194
02:45:53,100 --> 02:45:54,769
happen or mile happened it's there's
something very interesting and complex

8195
02:45:54,769 --> 02:45:54,779
something very interesting and complex
 

8196
02:45:54,779 --> 02:45:57,710
something very interesting and complex
about human nature in hierarchies about

8197
02:45:57,710 --> 02:45:57,720
about human nature in hierarchies about
 

8198
02:45:57,720 --> 02:45:59,510
about human nature in hierarchies about
distributed cognition the results in

8199
02:45:59,510 --> 02:45:59,520
distributed cognition the results in
 

8200
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:01,490
distributed cognition the results in
that and it's not trivial to understand

8201
02:46:01,490 --> 02:46:01,500
that and it's not trivial to understand
 

8202
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:04,010
that and it's not trivial to understand
no no

8203
02:46:04,010 --> 02:46:04,020
no no
 

8204
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:05,750
no no
um so I I mean I wonder if you can put a

8205
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:05,760
um so I I mean I wonder if you can put a
 

8206
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:07,610
um so I I mean I wonder if you can put a
finger on it why like why did it go so

8207
02:46:07,610 --> 02:46:07,620
finger on it why like why did it go so
 

8208
02:46:07,620 --> 02:46:11,210
finger on it why like why did it go so
wrong so I think uh you know what Ohana

8209
02:46:11,210 --> 02:46:11,220
wrong so I think uh you know what Ohana
 

8210
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:13,910
wrong so I think uh you know what Ohana
talks about in uh the intellectual

8211
02:46:13,910 --> 02:46:13,920
talks about in uh the intellectual
 

8212
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:15,710
talks about in uh the intellectual
history of modernity

8213
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:15,720
history of modernity
 

8214
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:17,150
history of modernity
um

8215
02:46:17,150 --> 02:46:17,160
um
 

8216
02:46:17,160 --> 02:46:19,790
um
talks about

8217
02:46:19,790 --> 02:46:19,800
talks about
 

8218
02:46:19,800 --> 02:46:23,090
talks about
the the Promethean spirit

8219
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:23,100
the the Promethean spirit
 

8220
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:27,590
the the Promethean spirit
the idea the really radical proposal and

8221
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:27,600
the idea the really radical proposal and
 

8222
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:30,050
the idea the really radical proposal and
think about how it's not so radical to

8223
02:46:30,050 --> 02:46:30,060
think about how it's not so radical to
 

8224
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:32,809
think about how it's not so radical to
us and in that sense Marxism has

8225
02:46:32,809 --> 02:46:32,819
us and in that sense Marxism has
 

8226
02:46:32,819 --> 02:46:35,269
us and in that sense Marxism has
succeeded the radical proposal that you

8227
02:46:35,269 --> 02:46:35,279
succeeded the radical proposal that you
 

8228
02:46:35,279 --> 02:46:37,910
succeeded the radical proposal that you
see even in the French Revolution

8229
02:46:37,910 --> 02:46:37,920
see even in the French Revolution
 

8230
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:39,650
see even in the French Revolution
and don't forget the terror comes in the

8231
02:46:39,650 --> 02:46:39,660
and don't forget the terror comes in the
 

8232
02:46:39,660 --> 02:46:41,570
and don't forget the terror comes in the
French Revolution too

8233
02:46:41,570 --> 02:46:41,580
French Revolution too
 

8234
02:46:41,580 --> 02:46:45,410

beings think of the Hubris in that
 

8238
02:46:48,479 --> 02:46:51,110
beings think of the Hubris in that
right and think of the overconfidence to

02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:51,120
right and think of the overconfidence to

02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:11,630
yes exactly and so I want to I think
this the term sin is good because

8567
02:54:11,630 --> 02:54:11,640
this the term sin is good because
 

8568
02:54:11,640 --> 02:54:14,630
this the term sin is good because
somebody may not be doing something that

8569
02:54:14,630 --> 02:54:14,640
somebody may not be doing something that
 

8570
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:17,889
somebody may not be doing something that
we would prototypically call immoral

8571
02:54:17,889 --> 02:54:17,899
we would prototypically call immoral
 

8572
02:54:17,899 --> 02:54:21,070
we would prototypically call immoral
but if they're failing to love wisely

8573
02:54:21,070 --> 02:54:21,080
but if they're failing to love wisely
 

8574
02:54:21,080 --> 02:54:23,469
but if they're failing to love wisely
they are

8575
02:54:23,469 --> 02:54:23,479
they are
 

8576
02:54:23,479 --> 02:54:26,750
they are
disconnecting themselves in some

8577
02:54:26,750 --> 02:54:26,760
disconnecting themselves in some
 

8578
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:29,210
disconnecting themselves in some
important way from the structures of

8579
02:54:29,210 --> 02:54:29,220
important way from the structures of
 

8580
02:54:29,220 --> 02:54:32,210
important way from the structures of
reality and

8581
02:54:32,210 --> 02:54:32,220
reality and
 

8582
02:54:32,220 --> 02:54:34,550
reality and
I think I think it was Hume I may be

8583
02:54:34,550 --> 02:54:34,560
I think I think it was Hume I may be
 

8584
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:36,290
I think I think it was Hume I may be
wrong you've said you know people don't

8585
02:54:36,290 --> 02:54:36,300
wrong you've said you know people don't
 

8586
02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:38,990
wrong you've said you know people don't
do things because they think it's wrong

8587
02:54:38,990 --> 02:54:39,000
do things because they think it's wrong
 

8588
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,570
do things because they think it's wrong
they do a lesser good in place of a

8589
02:54:41,570 --> 02:54:41,580
they do a lesser good in place of a
 

8590
02:54:41,580 --> 02:54:43,190
they do a lesser good in place of a
greater good

8591
02:54:43,190 --> 02:54:43,200
greater good
 

8592
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:44,990
greater good
and that's a different thing than being

8593
02:54:44,990 --> 02:54:45,000
and that's a different thing than being
 

8594
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,030
and that's a different thing than being
immoral I mean we're always saying

8595
02:54:47,030 --> 02:54:47,040
immoral I mean we're always saying
 

8596

should wrestle with these questions and
 

8620
02:55:13,859 --> 02:55:15,950
should wrestle with these questions and
I think sin is a failure to wrestle with

8621
02:55:15,950 --> 02:55:15,960
I think sin is a failure to wrestle with
 

8622
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:19,130
I think sin is a failure to wrestle with
these questions properly yeah to be

8623
02:55:19,130 --> 02:55:19,140
these questions properly yeah to be
 

8624
02:55:19,140 --> 02:55:20,690
these questions properly yeah to be
content with the choices you made

8625
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:20,700
content with the choices you made
 

8626
02:55:20,700 --> 02:55:22,849
content with the choices you made
without considering yeah

um
 

8630
02:55:23,700 --> 02:55:25,730
um
is there a greater good that could be

8631
02:55:25,730 --> 02:55:25,740
is there a greater good that could be
 

8632
02:55:25,740 --> 02:55:27,230
is there a greater good that could be
done yeah

8633
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:27,240
done yeah
 

8634
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:29,150
done yeah
your lecture series on the meaning

8635
02:55:29,150 --> 02:55:29,160
your lecture series on the meaning
 

8636
02:55:29,160 --> 02:55:32,150
your lecture series on the meaning
crisis uh puts us in dialogue in the

8637
02:55:32,150 --> 02:55:32,160
crisis uh puts us in dialogue in the
 

8638
02:55:32,160 --> 02:55:34,610
crisis uh puts us in dialogue in the
same way as with the podcast with a

8639
02:55:34,610 --> 02:55:34,620
same way as with the podcast with a
 

8640
02:55:34,620 --> 02:55:36,889
same way as with the podcast with a
bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout

8641
02:55:36,889 --> 02:55:36,899
bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout
 

8642
02:55:36,899 --> 02:55:40,190
bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout
history Corbin

8643
02:55:40,190 --> 02:55:40,200

 

8644
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:43,130

uh the man Carl Young tillage Barfield

8645
02:55:43,130 --> 02:55:43,140
uh the man Carl Young tillage Barfield
 

8646
02:55:43,140 --> 02:55:46,370
uh the man Carl Young tillage Barfield
is there can you describe this might be

8647
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:46,380
is there can you describe this might be
 

8648
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:49,190
is there can you describe this might be
challenging but one powerful idea from

8649
02:55:49,190 --> 02:55:49,200
challenging but one powerful idea from
 

8650
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:51,170
challenging but one powerful idea from
each that

8651
02:55:51,170 --> 02:55:51,180
each that
 

8652
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:54,650
each that
yeah jumps to mind yes maybe Heidegger

8653
02:55:54,650 --> 02:55:54,660
yeah jumps to mind yes maybe Heidegger
 

8654
02:55:54,660 --> 02:55:57,050
yeah jumps to mind yes maybe Heidegger
so for Heidegger

8655
02:55:57,050 --> 02:55:57,060
so for Heidegger
 

8656
02:55:57,060 --> 02:56:00,469
so for Heidegger
one real powerful idea that has had a

8657
02:56:00,469 --> 02:56:00,479
one real powerful idea that has had a
 

8658
02:56:00,479 --> 02:56:02,510
one real powerful idea that has had a
huge influence on me he's he's had a

8659
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:02,520
huge influence on me he's he's had a
 

8660
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:04,550
huge influence on me he's he's had a
huge influence on me in many ways he's a

8661
02:56:04,550 --> 02:56:04,560
huge influence on me in many ways he's a
 

8662
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:05,990
huge influence on me in many ways he's a
big influence on what's called 40

8663
02:56:05,990 --> 02:56:06,000
big influence on what's called 40
 

8664
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,030
big influence on what's called 40
cognitive science and this whole idea

8665
02:56:08,030 --> 02:56:08,040
cognitive science and this whole idea
 

8666
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:09,950
cognitive science and this whole idea
about the non-propositional that was

8667
02:56:09,950 --> 02:56:09,960
about the non-propositional that was
 

8668
02:56:09,960 --> 02:56:13,010
about the non-propositional that was
deeply uh you know afforded by Heidegger

8669
02:56:13,010 --> 02:56:13,020
deeply uh you know afforded by Heidegger
 

8670
02:56:13,020 --> 02:56:14,750
deeply uh you know afforded by Heidegger
and Marla Ponte but I guess maybe the

8671
02:56:14,750 --> 02:56:14,760
and Marla Ponte but I guess maybe the
 

8672
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:17,269
and Marla Ponte but I guess maybe the
one idea if I had to pick one is his

8673
02:56:17,269 --> 02:56:17,279
one idea if I had to pick one is his
 

8674
02:56:17,279 --> 02:56:19,910
one idea if I had to pick one is his
critique of onto theology his critique

8675
02:56:19,910 --> 02:56:19,920
critique of onto theology his critique
 

8676
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:22,910
critique of onto theology his critique
of the attempt to understand being in

8677
02:56:22,910 --> 02:56:22,920
of the attempt to understand being in
 

8678
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:24,830
of the attempt to understand being in
terms of a Supreme Being something like

8679
02:56:24,830 --> 02:56:24,840
terms of a Supreme Being something like
 

8680
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:26,750
terms of a Supreme Being something like
that and how that gets us fundamentally

8681
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:26,760
that and how that gets us fundamentally
 

8682
02:56:26,760 --> 02:56:29,630
that and how that gets us fundamentally
messed up and and we get disconnected

8683
02:56:29,630 --> 02:56:29,640
messed up and and we get disconnected
 

8684
02:56:29,640 --> 02:56:32,090
messed up and and we get disconnected
from being because we are over focused

8685
02:56:32,090 --> 02:56:32,100
from being because we are over focused
 

8686
02:56:32,100 --> 02:56:33,950
from being because we are over focused
on particular beings we're failing to

8687
02:56:33,950 --> 02:56:33,960
on particular beings we're failing to
 

8688
02:56:33,960 --> 02:56:36,050
on particular beings we're failing to
love wisely we're loving the individual

8689
02:56:36,050 --> 02:56:36,060
love wisely we're loving the individual
 

8690
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:37,969
love wisely we're loving the individual
things and we're not loving the ground

8691
02:56:37,969 --> 02:56:37,979
things and we're not loving the ground
 

8692
02:56:37,979 --> 02:56:40,550
things and we're not loving the ground
from which they they spring can you

8693
02:56:40,550 --> 02:56:40,560
from which they they spring can you
 

8694
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:42,590
from which they they spring can you
explain that a little more what's the

8695
02:56:42,590 --> 02:56:42,600
explain that a little more what's the
 

8696
02:56:42,600 --> 02:56:43,670
explain that a little more what's the
difference between the being and the

8697
02:56:43,670 --> 02:56:43,680
difference between the being and the
 

8698
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:45,349
difference between the being and the
Supreme Being and why that gets us into

8699
02:56:45,349 --> 02:56:45,359
Supreme Being and why that gets us into
 

8700
02:56:45,359 --> 02:56:48,050
Supreme Being and why that gets us into
trouble okay so uh like well we talked

8701
02:56:48,050 --> 02:56:48,060
trouble okay so uh like well we talked
 

8702
02:56:48,060 --> 02:56:49,969
trouble okay so uh like well we talked
about this before The Supreme Being is a

8703
02:56:49,969 --> 02:56:49,979
about this before The Supreme Being is a
 

8704
02:56:49,979 --> 02:56:52,490
about this before The Supreme Being is a
particular being whereas being is no

8705
02:56:52,490 --> 02:56:52,500
particular being whereas being is no
 

8706
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:54,230
particular being whereas being is no
thing it's not any particular kind of

8707
02:56:54,230 --> 02:56:54,240
thing it's not any particular kind of
 

8708
02:56:54,240 --> 02:56:56,990
thing it's not any particular kind of
thing and so if you're thinking of being

8709
02:56:56,990 --> 02:56:57,000
thing and so if you're thinking of being
 

8710
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,570
thing and so if you're thinking of being
as a being you're thinking of it in a

8711
02:56:59,570 --> 02:56:59,580
as a being you're thinking of it in a
 

8712
02:56:59,580 --> 02:57:01,309
as a being you're thinking of it in a
thingy way about something that is

8713
02:57:01,309 --> 02:57:01,319
thingy way about something that is
 

8714
02:57:01,319 --> 02:57:03,410
thingy way about something that is
fundamentally no thingness yeah and so

8715
02:57:03,410 --> 02:57:03,420
fundamentally no thingness yeah and so
 

8716
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:05,929
fundamentally no thingness yeah and so
then you're disconnecting yourself from

8717
02:57:05,929 --> 02:57:05,939
then you're disconnecting yourself from
 

8718
02:57:05,939 --> 02:57:08,090
then you're disconnecting yourself from
presumably Ultimate Reality

8719
02:57:08,090 --> 02:57:08,100
presumably Ultimate Reality
 

8720
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:11,330
presumably Ultimate Reality
this takes me to telek Telex great idea

8721
02:57:11,330 --> 02:57:11,340
this takes me to telek Telex great idea
 

8722
02:57:11,340 --> 02:57:13,969
this takes me to telek Telex great idea
is understanding Faith as ultimate

8723
02:57:13,969 --> 02:57:13,979

I'm on young Freud is the better writer

8757
02:57:58,849 --> 02:57:58,859

8758
02:57:58,859 --> 02:58:02,030
I'm on young Freud is the better writer
but young has I think a model of the

8759
02:58:02,030 --> 02:58:02,040
but young has I think a model of the
 

8760
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:03,830
but young has I think a model of the
psyche that is closer to where cognitive

8761
02:58:03,830 --> 02:58:03,840
psyche that is closer to where cognitive
 

8762

science is heading
um he's more prescient so which aspect

8765
02:58:08,210 --> 02:58:08,220
um he's more prescient so which aspect
 

8766
02:58:08,220 --> 02:58:10,370
um he's more prescient so which aspect
of his model is like directly so Freud

8767
02:58:10,370 --> 02:58:10,380
of his model is like directly so Freud
 

8768
02:58:10,380 --> 02:58:12,290
of his model is like directly so Freud
has a hydraulic model the psyche is like

8769
02:58:12,290 --> 02:58:12,300
has a hydraulic model the psyche is like
 

8770
02:58:12,300 --> 02:58:13,790
has a hydraulic model the psyche is like
a steam engine things are under pressure

8771
02:58:13,790 --> 02:58:13,800
a steam engine things are under pressure

02:58:13,800 --> 02:58:16,010
a steam engine things are under pressure
and there's a fluid that's moving around

8773
02:58:16,010 --> 02:58:16,020
and there's a fluid that's moving around
 

8774
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:19,309
and there's a fluid that's moving around
it's like like this is a record note of

8775
02:58:19,309 --> 02:58:19,319
it's like like this is a record note of
 

8776
02:58:19,319 --> 02:58:21,950
it's like like this is a record note of
this young has an organic model the

8777
02:58:21,950 --> 02:58:21,960
this young has an organic model the
 

8778
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:24,410
this young has an organic model the
psyche is like a living being it's doing

all this opponent processing it's doing
 

8782
02:58:26,819 --> 02:58:29,150
all this opponent processing it's doing
all of this self-transcending and

8783
02:58:29,150 --> 02:58:29,160
all of this self-transcending and
 

8784
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:32,150
all of this self-transcending and
growing right and I think that's a much

8785
02:58:32,150 --> 02:58:32,160
growing right and I think that's a much
 

8786
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:34,969
growing right and I think that's a much
better model of the psyche than the sort

8787
02:58:34,969 --> 02:58:34,979
better model of the psyche than the sort
 

8788

better model of the psyche than the sort
of uh steam engine model what do you

02:59:54,170 --> 02:59:54,180
and can we integrate it together
 

8862
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:56,630
and can we integrate it together
theoretically and so he's working on

8863
02:59:56,630 --> 02:59:56,640
theoretically and so he's working on
 

8864
02:59:56,640 --> 02:59:58,969
theoretically and so he's working on
that exactly that project

8865
02:59:58,969 --> 02:59:58,979
that exactly that project
 

8866
02:59:58,979 --> 03:00:01,309
that exactly that project
but nevertheless your census there is a

8867
03:00:01,309 --> 03:00:01,319
but nevertheless your census there is a
 

8868
03:00:01,319 --> 03:00:03,349
but nevertheless your census there is a
subconscious or at least an unconscious

8869
03:00:03,349 --> 03:00:03,359
subconscious or at least an unconscious
 

8870
03:00:03,359 --> 03:00:05,330

young continually reminded people that

8873
03:00:07,610 --> 03:00:07,620
young continually reminded people that
 

8874
03:00:07,620 --> 03:00:09,950
young continually reminded people that
the unconscious is unconscious that

8875
03:00:09,950 --> 03:00:09,960
the unconscious is unconscious that
 

8876
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:11,929
the unconscious is unconscious that
we're not conscious of it and and that's

8877
03:00:11,929 --> 03:00:11,939
we're not conscious of it and and that's
 

8878
03:00:11,939 --> 03:00:14,150
we're not conscious of it and and that's
its fundamental property yeah and then

8879
03:00:14,150 --> 03:00:14,160
its fundamental property yeah and then
 

8880
03:00:14,160 --> 03:00:16,070
its fundamental property yeah and then
isn't the task

8881
03:00:16,070 --> 03:00:16,080
isn't the task
 

8882

unconscious conscious yeah to a degree

8885
03:00:22,429 --> 03:00:22,439
unconscious conscious yeah to a degree
 

8886
03:00:22,439 --> 03:00:26,210
unconscious conscious yeah to a degree
right but also I mean yeah to bring to

8887
03:00:26,210 --> 03:00:26,220
right but also I mean yeah to bring to
 

8888
03:00:26,220 --> 03:00:29,030
right but also I mean yeah to bring to
to bring to bring Consciousness where

8889
03:00:29,030 --> 03:00:29,040

that that can be completed part of the
 

8896
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:39,590
that that can be completed part of the
why you're extending the reach of the

8897

why you're extending the reach of the
 

8898
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:41,630
why you're extending the reach of the
conscious mind is it so it can enter

8899
03:00:41,630 --> 03:00:41,640
conscious mind is it so it can enter
 

8900
03:00:41,640 --> 03:00:44,830
conscious mind is it so it can enter
into more proper dialogical relationship

8901
03:00:44,830 --> 03:00:44,840
into more proper dialogical relationship
 

8902
03:00:44,840 --> 03:00:48,050
into more proper dialogical relationship
with the self-organizing system of the

8903
03:00:48,050 --> 03:00:48,060
with the self-organizing system of the
 

8904
03:00:48,060 --> 03:00:50,870
with the self-organizing system of the
unconscious mind what do they have uh to

8905
03:00:50,870 --> 03:00:50,880
unconscious mind what do they have uh to
 

8906
03:00:50,880 --> 03:00:53,150
unconscious mind what do they have uh to
say about the the motivations of humans

8907
03:00:53,150 --> 03:00:53,160
say about the the motivations of humans

what advice would you give to young

03:02:20,279 --> 03:02:22,429
what advice would you give to young
people today

people today
 

8976
03:02:22,439 --> 03:02:24,530
people today
they're in high school trying to figure

8977
03:02:24,530 --> 03:02:24,540
they're in high school trying to figure

03:02:30,170 --> 03:02:30,180
what advice would you give how to have a
 

8984
03:02:30,180 --> 03:02:32,030

will sound ridiculous

9007
03:03:04,790 --> 03:03:04,800
will sound ridiculous
 

9008
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:08,150
will sound ridiculous
but if you take care of that

9009
03:03:08,150 --> 03:03:08,160
but if you take care of that
