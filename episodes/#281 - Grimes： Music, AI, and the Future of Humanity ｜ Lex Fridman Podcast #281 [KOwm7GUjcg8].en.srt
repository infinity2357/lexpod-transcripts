00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
homo techno i i think we have evolved
 

13
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,070
homo techno i i think we have evolved
into homo techno which is like

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
into homo techno which is like

technologies i mean may have even been

18
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
technologies i mean may have even been
 

19
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,830
technologies i mean may have even been
more profound and moved us to a certain

20
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
more profound and moved us to a certain
 

21
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,510
more profound and moved us to a certain
degree but i think the computers are

22
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
degree but i think the computers are
 

23
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,109
degree but i think the computers are
what make us homotech know i think this

24
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
what make us homotech know i think this
 

25
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,990
what make us homotech know i think this
is what it's a brain augmentation so it

26
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
is what it's a brain augmentation so it
 

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,830
is what it's a brain augmentation so it
like allows for actual evolution like

28
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
like allows for actual evolution like
 

29
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,429
like allows for actual evolution like
the computers accelerate the degree to

30
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
the computers accelerate the degree to
 

31
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,189
the computers accelerate the degree to
which all the other technologies can

32
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
which all the other technologies can
 

33
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,350
which all the other technologies can
also be accelerated would you classify

34
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
also be accelerated would you classify
 

35
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,270
also be accelerated would you classify
yourself as a homo sapien or a homo tech

36
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
yourself as a homo sapien or a homo tech

no definitely home attack no so i think

microphone yes it's very flattering on

86
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
microphone yes it's very flattering on
 

87
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,670

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
great for demo vocals it's great in a
 

91
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,350
great for demo vocals it's great in a
room like sometimes it's easier to

92
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
room like sometimes it's easier to
 

93
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,270
room like sometimes it's easier to
record vocals if you're just in a room

94
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
record vocals if you're just in a room
 

95
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,630

and like the music's playing and you

96
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
and like the music's playing and you
 

97
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,749
and like the music's playing and you
just want to like feel it and it's not

98
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
just want to like feel it and it's not
 

99
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,429
just want to like feel it and it's not
so it's not in the headphones and this

100
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
so it's not in the headphones and this
 

101
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,870
so it's not in the headphones and this
mic is pretty directional so i think

102
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
mic is pretty directional so i think
 

103
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,710
mic is pretty directional so i think
it's like a good mic for like

104
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
it's like a good mic for like
 

105
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,469
it's like a good mic for like
just vibing out and just getting a real

106
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
just vibing out and just getting a real
 

107
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,270
just vibing out and just getting a real
good vocal take just vibing just in a

108
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
good vocal take just vibing just in a
 

109
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,109
good vocal take just vibing just in a
room anyway this is the

110
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
room anyway this is the
 

111
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,389

i feel way more badass now all right

118
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
i feel way more badass now all right
 

119
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,109
i feel way more badass now all right
let's get it you want to just get into

120
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
let's get it you want to just get into
 

121
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,950
let's get it you want to just get into
it i guess so

122
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
it i guess so
 

123
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,109
it i guess so
all right one of your names at least in

124
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
all right one of your names at least in
 

125
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,350
all right one of your names at least in
the space and time is c like the letter

126
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
the space and time is c like the letter
 

127
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,749
the space and time is c like the letter
c and and you told me that

128
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
c and and you told me that
 

129
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,670
c and and you told me that
c means a lot of things it's the speed

130
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
c means a lot of things it's the speed
 

131
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,589
c means a lot of things it's the speed
of light it's the render rate of the

132
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
of light it's the render rate of the
 

133
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,229
of light it's the render rate of the
universe it's yes in spanish it's the

134
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
universe it's yes in spanish it's the
 

135
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,589
universe it's yes in spanish it's the
crescent moon

136
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
crescent moon
 

137
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,510
crescent moon
and it happens to be my favorite

138
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
and it happens to be my favorite
 

139
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,630
and it happens to be my favorite
programming language because it's uh it

140
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
programming language because it's uh it
 

141
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,510
programming language because it's uh it
basically runs the world but it's also

142
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
basically runs the world but it's also
 

143
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,030
basically runs the world but it's also
powerful fast

144
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
powerful fast
 

145
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,710
powerful fast
and it's dangerous because you can mess

146
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
and it's dangerous because you can mess
 

147
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,150
and it's dangerous because you can mess
things up really bad with it because of

148
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
things up really bad with it because of
 

149
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,150
things up really bad with it because of
all the pointers but anyway which of

150
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
all the pointers but anyway which of
 

151
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,350
all the pointers but anyway which of
these associations uh with the name c is

152
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
these associations uh with the name c is
 

153
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,589
these associations uh with the name c is
the coolest to you

154
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
the coolest to you
 

155
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,150
the coolest to you
i mean to me the coolest is the speed of

156
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
i mean to me the coolest is the speed of
 

157
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,550
i mean to me the coolest is the speed of
light obviously or the speed of light

158
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
light obviously or the speed of light
 

159
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,390
light obviously or the speed of light
when i say render rate of the universe i

160
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
when i say render rate of the universe i
 

161
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,150
when i say render rate of the universe i
think i mean the speed of light

162
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
think i mean the speed of light
 

163
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,910
think i mean the speed of light
because essentially that's

164
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
because essentially that's
 

165
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,910
because essentially that's
what we're rendering it see i think

166
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
what we're rendering it see i think
 

167
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,869
what we're rendering it see i think
we'll know

168
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
we'll know
 

169
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,630
we'll know
if we're in a simulation if the speed of

170
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
if we're in a simulation if the speed of
 

171
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,630
if we're in a simulation if the speed of
light changes because if they can

172
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
light changes because if they can
 

173
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,110
light changes because if they can
improve their render speed then

174
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
improve their render speed then
 

175
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,790
improve their render speed then
it's already pretty good it's already

176
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
it's already pretty good it's already
 

177
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,949
it's already pretty good it's already
pretty good but if it improves

178
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
pretty good but if it improves
 

179
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,830
pretty good but if it improves
then

180
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
then
 

181
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,430
then
we'll know you know we can probably be

182
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
we'll know you know we can probably be
 

183
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,270
we'll know you know we can probably be
like okay they've updated or upgraded

184
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
like okay they've updated or upgraded
 

185
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,869
like okay they've updated or upgraded
it's fast enough for us humans because

186
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
it's fast enough for us humans because
 

187
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,470
it's fast enough for us humans because
it seems

188
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
it seems
 

189
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,270
it seems
like um it seems immediate there's no

190
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
like um it seems immediate there's no
 

191
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,750
like um it seems immediate there's no
delay there's no latency in terms of

192
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
delay there's no latency in terms of
 

193
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,509
delay there's no latency in terms of
like us humans on earth interacting with

194
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
like us humans on earth interacting with
 

195
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,550
like us humans on earth interacting with
things but if you're like uh like

196
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
things but if you're like uh like
 

197
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,390
things but if you're like uh like
intergalactic species operating on a

198
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
intergalactic species operating on a
 

199
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,910
intergalactic species operating on a
much larger scale then you're gonna

200
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
much larger scale then you're gonna
 

201
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,990
much larger scale then you're gonna
start noticing some weird stuff or if

202
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
start noticing some weird stuff or if
 

203
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,670
start noticing some weird stuff or if
you can operate

204
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
you can operate
 

205
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,430
you can operate
in like around a black hole then you're

206
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
in like around a black hole then you're
 

207
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,589
in like around a black hole then you're
gonna start to see some render issues

208
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
gonna start to see some render issues
 

209
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,270
gonna start to see some render issues
you can't go faster than the speed of

210
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
you can't go faster than the speed of
 

211
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,550
you can't go faster than the speed of
light correct

212
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
light correct
 

213
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,869
light correct
so it really limits our ability or and

214
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
so it really limits our ability or and
 

215
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,550
so it really limits our ability or and
it's one's ability to travel space

216
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
it's one's ability to travel space
 

217
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,869
it's one's ability to travel space
theoretically you can you have wormholes

218
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
theoretically you can you have wormholes
 

219
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,390
theoretically you can you have wormholes
so i there's nothing in general

220
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
so i there's nothing in general
 

221
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,990
so i there's nothing in general
relativity

222
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
relativity
 

223
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,710
relativity
that uh precludes faster than

224
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
that uh precludes faster than
 

225
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,390
that uh precludes faster than
um

226
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
um
 

227
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,030
um
speed of light travel but it just seems

228
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
speed of light travel but it just seems
 

229
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,309
speed of light travel but it just seems
you're gonna have to do some really

230
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
you're gonna have to do some really
 

231
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,789
you're gonna have to do some really
funky stuff with uh

232
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
funky stuff with uh
 

233
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,030
funky stuff with uh
very heavy things that have like

234
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
very heavy things that have like
 

235
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,509
very heavy things that have like
weirdnesses that have basically tears in

236
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
weirdnesses that have basically tears in
 

237
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,589
weirdnesses that have basically tears in
space-time we don't know how to do that

238
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
space-time we don't know how to do that
 

239
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,990
space-time we don't know how to do that
dune navigators know how to do it

240
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
dune navigators know how to do it
 

241
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,110
dune navigators know how to do it
dude navigators yeah yeah folding space

242
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
dude navigators yeah yeah folding space
 

243
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,869
dude navigators yeah yeah folding space
basically making wormholes

244
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
basically making wormholes
 

245
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,070
basically making wormholes
so

246
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
so
 

247
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,429
so
the name c

248
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
the name c
 

249
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,910
the name c
yes

250
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920

 

251
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,110

who are you are you do you think of

252
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
who are you are you do you think of
 

253
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,430
who are you are you do you think of
yourself as multiple people are you one

254
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
yourself as multiple people are you one
 

255
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,270
yourself as multiple people are you one
person do you know

256
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
person do you know
 

257
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,270
person do you know
like in this morning were you different

258
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
like in this morning were you different
 

259
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,990
like in this morning were you different
person than you are tonight we are i

260
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
person than you are tonight we are i
 

261
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,749
person than you are tonight we are i
should say recording this

262
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
should say recording this
 

263
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,749
should say recording this
basically at midnight which is awesome

264
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
basically at midnight which is awesome
 

265
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,629
basically at midnight which is awesome
yes thank you so much i think i'm about

266
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
yes thank you so much i think i'm about
 

267
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,830
yes thank you so much i think i'm about
eight hours late no you're right on time

268
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
eight hours late no you're right on time
 

269
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,749
eight hours late no you're right on time
good morning this is the beginning of a

270
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
good morning this is the beginning of a
 

271
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,950
good morning this is the beginning of a
new day soon anyway uh are you the same

272
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
new day soon anyway uh are you the same
 

273
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,870
new day soon anyway uh are you the same
person you were in the morning in the

274
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
person you were in the morning in the
 

275
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,749
person you were in the morning in the
evening

276
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
evening
 

277
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,670
evening
do you you're you're is there multiple

278
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
do you you're you're is there multiple
 

279
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,030
do you you're you're is there multiple
people in there do you think of yourself

280
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
people in there do you think of yourself
 

281
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,350
people in there do you think of yourself
as one person or maybe you have no clue

282
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
as one person or maybe you have no clue
 

283
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,990
as one person or maybe you have no clue
are you just a giant mystery to yourself

284
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
are you just a giant mystery to yourself
 

285
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,670
are you just a giant mystery to yourself
okay these are really intense questions

286
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
okay these are really intense questions
 

287
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,629
okay these are really intense questions
but uh

288
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
but uh
 

289
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,390
but uh
that's cool because i asked this myself

290
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
that's cool because i asked this myself
 

291
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,150
that's cool because i asked this myself
like look in the mirror who are you

292
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
like look in the mirror who are you
 

293
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,909
like look in the mirror who are you
people tell you to just be yourself but

294
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
people tell you to just be yourself but
 

295
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,909
people tell you to just be yourself but
what does that even mean uh i mean i

296
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
what does that even mean uh i mean i
 

297
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,510
what does that even mean uh i mean i
think my personality changes with

298
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
think my personality changes with
 

299
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,870
think my personality changes with
everyone i talk to

300
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
everyone i talk to
 

301
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,710
everyone i talk to
so i have a very inconsistent

302
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
so i have a very inconsistent
 

303
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,469
so i have a very inconsistent
personality

304
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
personality
 

305
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,790
personality
yeah person to person so the interaction

306
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
yeah person to person so the interaction
 

307
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,710
yeah person to person so the interaction
your personality

308
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
your personality
 

309
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,909
your personality
materializes

310
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
materializes
 

311
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,029
materializes
like i'll go from being like a

312
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
like i'll go from being like a
 

313
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,510
like i'll go from being like a
megalomaniac to being like

314
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
megalomaniac to being like
 

315
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,350
megalomaniac to being like
you know just like a total

316
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
you know just like a total
 

317
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,670
you know just like a total
hermit who is very shy so some

318
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
hermit who is very shy so some
 

319
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,990
hermit who is very shy so some
combinatorial com combination of your

like yeah takes a lot to get there let's
 

361
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,629
like yeah takes a lot to get there let's
talk about constraints

362
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
talk about constraints
 

363
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,710
talk about constraints
you've talked about constraints and

364
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
you've talked about constraints and
 

365
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,390
you've talked about constraints and
limits

366
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
limits
 

367
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,390
limits
uh do those help you out as an artist or

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
as a human being or do they get in the
 

371
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,230
as a human being or do they get in the
way do you like the constraints so in

372
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
way do you like the constraints so in
 

373
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,469
way do you like the constraints so in
creating music and creating art and

374
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
creating music and creating art and
 

375
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,550
creating music and creating art and
living life

376
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
living life
 

377
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,390
living life
do you like the constraints that this

378
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
do you like the constraints that this
 

379
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,909
do you like the constraints that this
world puts on you

380
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919

 

381
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,950

or

or
do you hate them

do you hate them
 

385
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,550
do you hate them
if constraints are

386
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
if constraints are
 

387
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,830
if constraints are
moving

388
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
moving
 

389
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,270

progressing with technology we're

394
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
progressing with technology we're
 

395
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,510
progressing with technology we're
changing the constraints of like

396
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
changing the constraints of like
 

397
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,950
changing the constraints of like
artistic creation you know um making

398
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
artistic creation you know um making
 

399
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,029
artistic creation you know um making
video and music and stuff is getting a

400
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
video and music and stuff is getting a
 

401
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,790
video and music and stuff is getting a
lot cheaper there's constantly new

402
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
lot cheaper there's constantly new
 

403
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,150
lot cheaper there's constantly new
technology and new software that's

404
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
technology and new software that's
 

405
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,469
technology and new software that's
making it faster and easier we have so

406
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
making it faster and easier we have so
 

407
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,550
making it faster and easier we have so
much more freedom than we had in the 70s

408
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
much more freedom than we had in the 70s
 

409
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,629
much more freedom than we had in the 70s
like when michael jackson you know when

microphone
 

415
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,189
microphone
like they had to use a mixing desk and

00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
like they had to use a mixing desk and
 

417
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,790
like they had to use a mixing desk and
all this stuff and like probably even

418
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
all this stuff and like probably even
 

419
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,909
all this stuff and like probably even
get in the studio it's probably really

420
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
get in the studio it's probably really
 

421
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,950
get in the studio it's probably really
expensive and you have to be a really

422
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
expensive and you have to be a really
 

423
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,469
expensive and you have to be a really
good singer and you have to know how to

427
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,550
use like the mixing desk and everything
and now i can just you know

428
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
and now i can just you know
 

429
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,070
and now i can just you know
make i've made a whole album on this

make i've made a whole album on this
 

431
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,110
make i've made a whole album on this
computer

432
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
computer
 

433
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,189
computer
i have a lot more freedom but then i'm

434
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
i have a lot more freedom but then i'm
 

435
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,150
i have a lot more freedom but then i'm
also constrained in different ways

also constrained in different ways
 

437
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,510
also constrained in different ways
because there's like

438
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520

this is becoming
 

471
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,550
this is becoming
it's like merging with technology

472
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
it's like merging with technology
 

473
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,510

it's becoming some weird composition

480
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
it's becoming some weird composition
 

481
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,350
it's becoming some weird composition
that requires engineering skills

482
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
that requires engineering skills
 

483

some kind of human robot interaction
 

487
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,550
some kind of human robot interaction
skills and still some of the same things

of a scarcity mindset why don't we just

1458
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
of a scarcity mindset why don't we just
 

1459
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,990
of a scarcity mindset why don't we just
increase the efficiency

1460
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
increase the efficiency
 

1461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,950
increase the efficiency
um and you know in that way expand the

1462
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
um and you know in that way expand the
 

1463
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,310
um and you know in that way expand the
size of the pie

1464
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
size of the pie
 

1465
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,390
size of the pie
let me ask about experimentation

1466
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
let me ask about experimentation
 

1467
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,710
let me ask about experimentation
so you said which is beautiful

1468
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
so you said which is beautiful
 

1469
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,470
so you said which is beautiful
uh

1470
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
uh
 

1471
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,990
uh
being a musician is like having a

1472
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
being a musician is like having a
 

1473
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,590
being a musician is like having a
conversation with all those that came

1474
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
conversation with all those that came
 

1475
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,870
conversation with all those that came
before you

1476
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
before you
 

1477
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,110
before you
um how much of uh creating music is like

1478
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120

 

1479
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,269

kind of having that conversation trying

1480
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
kind of having that conversation trying
 

1481
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,830
kind of having that conversation trying
to fit into the cultural

1482
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
to fit into the cultural
 

1483
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,789
to fit into the cultural
uh trends and how much of it is like

1484
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
uh trends and how much of it is like
 

1485
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,310
uh trends and how much of it is like
trying to as much as possible being

1486
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320
trying to as much as possible being
 

1487
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,350
trying to as much as possible being
outside and come up with something

1488
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
outside and come up with something
 

1489
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,190
outside and come up with something
totally new it's like when you're

1490
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
totally new it's like when you're
 

1491
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,590
totally new it's like when you're
thinking when you're experimenting are

1492
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
thinking when you're experimenting are
 

1493
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,430
thinking when you're experimenting are
you trying to be totally different

1494
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
you trying to be totally different
 

1495
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,310
you trying to be totally different
totally weird are you trying to

1496
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
totally weird are you trying to
 

1497
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,909
totally weird are you trying to
um fit in

1498
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
um fit in
 

1499
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,430
um fit in
man this is so hard because i feel like

1500
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
man this is so hard because i feel like
 

1501
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,549
man this is so hard because i feel like
i'm

1502
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
i'm
 

1503
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,230
i'm
kind of in the process of semi retiring

1504
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
kind of in the process of semi retiring
 

1505
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,830
kind of in the process of semi retiring
from music so i'm this is like my old

1506
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
from music so i'm this is like my old
 

1507
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,710
from music so i'm this is like my old
brain yeah bring it back

1508
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
brain yeah bring it back
 

1509
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,390
brain yeah bring it back
bring it from like the shelf put it on

1510
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
bring it from like the shelf put it on
 

1511
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,470
bring it from like the shelf put it on
the table for for a couple minutes we'll

1512
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
the table for for a couple minutes we'll
 

1513
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,630
the table for for a couple minutes we'll
just we'll just poke it i think it's a

1514
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
just we'll just poke it i think it's a
 

1515
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,029
just we'll just poke it i think it's a
bit of both because i think uh

1516
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:29,039
bit of both because i think uh
 

1517
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,549
bit of both because i think uh
forcing yourself to engage with new

1518
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
forcing yourself to engage with new
 

1519
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,070
forcing yourself to engage with new
music um it's really great for neural

1520
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
music um it's really great for neural
 

1521
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,630
music um it's really great for neural
plasticity like i think uh

1522
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
plasticity like i think uh
 

1523
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,350
plasticity like i think uh
you know as people

1524
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,360
you know as people
 

1525
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,110
you know as people
part of the reason music is marketed at

1526
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
part of the reason music is marketed at
 

1527
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,230
part of the reason music is marketed at
young people is because young people are

1528
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
young people is because young people are
 

1529
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,510
young people is because young people are
very neuroplastic so um like if you're

1530
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
very neuroplastic so um like if you're
 

1531
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,310
very neuroplastic so um like if you're
16 to like 23 or whatever you're it's

1532
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
16 to like 23 or whatever you're it's
 

1533
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,990
16 to like 23 or whatever you're it's
gonna be really easy for you to love new

1534
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
gonna be really easy for you to love new
 

1535
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,149
gonna be really easy for you to love new
music and if you're older than that it

1536
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
music and if you're older than that it
 

1537
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,830
music and if you're older than that it
gets harder and harder and harder and i

1538
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840
gets harder and harder and harder and i
 

1539
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,950
gets harder and harder and harder and i
think one of the beautiful things about

1540
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
think one of the beautiful things about
 

1541
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,110
think one of the beautiful things about
being a musician is i just constantly

1542
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
being a musician is i just constantly
 

1543
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,710
being a musician is i just constantly
force myself to listen to new music and

1544
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
force myself to listen to new music and
 

1545
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,029
force myself to listen to new music and
i think it keeps my brain really plastic

1546
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
i think it keeps my brain really plastic
 

1547
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,990
i think it keeps my brain really plastic
and i think this is a really good

1548
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
and i think this is a really good
 

1549
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,669
and i think this is a really good
exercise i just think everyone should do

1550
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
exercise i just think everyone should do
 

1551
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,190
exercise i just think everyone should do
this you listen to new music and you

1552
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
this you listen to new music and you
 

1553
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,950
this you listen to new music and you
hate it i think you should just keep

1554
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
hate it i think you should just keep
 

1555
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,110
hate it i think you should just keep
force yourself to like okay well why do

1556
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
force yourself to like okay well why do
 

1557
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,190
force yourself to like okay well why do
people like it and like

1558
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
people like it and like
 

1559
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,990
people like it and like
you know make your brain form new neural

1560
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
you know make your brain form new neural
 

1561
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,269
you know make your brain form new neural
pathways and

1562
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:15,279
pathways and
 

1563
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,190
pathways and
uh be more open to change that's really

1564
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
uh be more open to change that's really
 

1565
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,789
uh be more open to change that's really
brilliant actually sorry to interrupt

1566
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
brilliant actually sorry to interrupt
 

1567
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,430
brilliant actually sorry to interrupt
but like get that exercise

amazing
to sort of

1574
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
to sort of
 

1575
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,830
to sort of
embrace change embrace sort of practice

1576
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
embrace change embrace sort of practice
 

1577
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,230
embrace change embrace sort of practice
on your plasticity because like that's

1578
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
on your plasticity because like that's
 

1579
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,590
on your plasticity because like that's
one of the things you you fall in love

1580
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
one of the things you you fall in love
 

1581
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,110
one of the things you you fall in love
with a certain band you just kind of

1582
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,120
with a certain band you just kind of
 

1583
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,710

music that's a really good experience

1588
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
music that's a really good experience
 

1589
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,950
music that's a really good experience
most of the streaming on spotify is like

1590
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
most of the streaming on spotify is like
 

1591
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,269
most of the streaming on spotify is like
classic rock and stuff like new music

1592
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:43,279
classic rock and stuff like new music
 

1593
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,590
classic rock and stuff like new music
makes up a very small chunk of what is

1594
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:45,600
makes up a very small chunk of what is
 

1595
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,350
makes up a very small chunk of what is
played on spotify and i think this is

1596
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
played on spotify and i think this is
 

1597
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,070
played on spotify and i think this is
like

1598
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
like
 

1599
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,390
like
not a good sign for us as a species i i

1600
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
not a good sign for us as a species i i
 

1601
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,070
not a good sign for us as a species i i
think uh

1602
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
think uh
 

1603
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,029
think uh
yeah so it's a it's a good measure of

1604
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
yeah so it's a it's a good measure of
 

1605
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,830
yeah so it's a it's a good measure of
the the species open-mindedness to

1606
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
the the species open-mindedness to
 

1607
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,990
the the species open-mindedness to
change is how often you listen to new

1608
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
change is how often you listen to new
 

1609
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,149
change is how often you listen to new
music yeah the brain the brain let's put

1610
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:02,159
music yeah the brain the brain let's put
 

1611
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,710
music yeah the brain the brain let's put
the the the music brain on the back on

1612
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
the the the music brain on the back on
 

1613
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,710
the the the music brain on the back on
the shelf i gotta pull out the

1614
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
the shelf i gotta pull out the
 

1615
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,789
the shelf i gotta pull out the

of different types of
ai in the banksian future but um in the

1778
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
ai in the banksian future but um in the
 

1779
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,110
ai in the banksian future but um in the
opening scene of surface detail there's

1780
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
opening scene of surface detail there's
 

1781
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,389
opening scene of surface detail there's
this place called the culture and the

1782
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:02,399
this place called the culture and the
 

1783
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,310
this place called the culture and the
culture is basically a protopian future

1784
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,320
culture is basically a protopian future
 

1785
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,190
culture is basically a protopian future
and a proto a protopian future i think

1786
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,200
and a proto a protopian future i think
 

1787
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,590
and a proto a protopian future i think
is like a future that is like

1788
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
is like a future that is like
 

1789
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,350
is like a future that is like
obviously it's not it's not utopia it's

1790
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
obviously it's not it's not utopia it's
 

1791
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,870
obviously it's not it's not utopia it's
not perfect and like because like

1792
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
not perfect and like because like
 

1793
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,389
not perfect and like because like
striving for utopia i think feels

1794
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
striving for utopia i think feels
 

1795
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,870
striving for utopia i think feels
hopeless and and it's sort of like

1796
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
hopeless and and it's sort of like
 

1797
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,630
hopeless and and it's sort of like
maybe not the best terminology to be

1798
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
maybe not the best terminology to be
 

1799
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,310
maybe not the best terminology to be
using um

1800
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320
using um
 

1801
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,269
using um
so

1802
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
so
 

1803
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,470
so
it's like it's a pretty good place like

1804
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,480
it's like it's a pretty good place like
 

1805
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,590
it's like it's a pretty good place like
mostly

1806
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
mostly
 

1807
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,389
mostly
like

1808
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
like
 

1809
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,590
like
you know

1810
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
you know
 

1811
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,830
you know
super intelligence and biological beings

1812
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
super intelligence and biological beings
 

1813
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,389
super intelligence and biological beings
exist fairly in harmony there's not too

1814
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
exist fairly in harmony there's not too
 

1815
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,470
exist fairly in harmony there's not too
much war there's like as as close to

1816
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
much war there's like as as close to
 

1817
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,990
much war there's like as as close to
equality as you can get you know it's

1818
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,000
equality as you can get you know it's
 

1819
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,070
equality as you can get you know it's
like it's like approximately a good

1820
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
like it's like approximately a good
 

1821
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,070
like it's like approximately a good
future like there's really awesome stuff

1822
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
future like there's really awesome stuff
 

1823
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,870
future like there's really awesome stuff
it's

1824
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
it's
 

1825
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,669
it's
um

1826
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
um
 

1827
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,950
um
and uh the

uh
 

1831
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,470
uh

traveling on a ship through the culture

1846
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279
traveling on a ship through the culture
 

1847
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,269
traveling on a ship through the culture
with him one day um

1848
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
with him one day um
 

1849
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,990
with him one day um
a ship put a neural lace in her head and

1850
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
a ship put a neural lace in her head and
 

1851
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,950
a ship put a neural lace in her head and
um

1852
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
um
 

1853
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,470
um
neural lace is sort of like it's

1854
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
neural lace is sort of like it's
 

1855
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,870
neural lace is sort of like it's
basically a neural link uh

1856
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880
basically a neural link uh
 

1857
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,909
basically a neural link uh
because life imitates art it does indeed

1858
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
because life imitates art it does indeed
 

1859
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,750
because life imitates art it does indeed
it doesn't need so she wakes up and the

1860
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
it doesn't need so she wakes up and the
 

1861
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,430
it doesn't need so she wakes up and the
opening scene is her memory has been

1862
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440
opening scene is her memory has been
 

1863
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,350
opening scene is her memory has been
uploaded by this nero lace when she's

1864
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,360
uploaded by this nero lace when she's
 

1865
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,750
uploaded by this nero lace when she's
been killed and now she gets to choose a

1866
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:21,760
been killed and now she gets to choose a
 

1867
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,269
been killed and now she gets to choose a
new body and this ai um is interfacing

1868
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
new body and this ai um is interfacing
 

1869
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,350
new body and this ai um is interfacing
with her recorded memory in her neural

1870
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
with her recorded memory in her neural
 

1871
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,750
with her recorded memory in her neural
lace um and helping her and being like

1872
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
lace um and helping her and being like
 

1873
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,070
lace um and helping her and being like
hello you're dead but because you had a

1874
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,080
hello you're dead but because you had a
 

1875
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,669
hello you're dead but because you had a
neurologist your memory is uploaded do

1876
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
neurologist your memory is uploaded do
 

1877
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,029
neurologist your memory is uploaded do
you want to choose a new body and you're

1878
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,039
you want to choose a new body and you're
 

1879
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,389
you want to choose a new body and you're
going to be born here in the culture and

1880
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
going to be born here in the culture and
 

1881
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,909
going to be born here in the culture and
like start a new life

1882
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
like start a new life
 

1883
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,750
like start a new life
which is just that's like the opening

1884
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
which is just that's like the opening
 

1885
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,269
which is just that's like the opening
it's like so sick

1886
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
it's like so sick
 

1887
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,510
it's like so sick
and the ship is the super intelligence

1888
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,520
and the ship is the super intelligence
 

1889
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,470
and the ship is the super intelligence
all the ships are kind of super

1890
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
all the ships are kind of super
 

1891
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,230
all the ships are kind of super
intelligence but they still want to

1892
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
intelligence but they still want to
 

1893
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,070
intelligence but they still want to
preserve a kind of rich fulfilling

1894
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,080
preserve a kind of rich fulfilling
 

1895
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,909
preserve a kind of rich fulfilling
experience for the humans yeah like

1896
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:49,919
experience for the humans yeah like
 

1897
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,950
experience for the humans yeah like
they're like friends with the humans and

1898
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
they're like friends with the humans and
 

1899
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,549
they're like friends with the humans and
then there's a bunch of ships that

1900
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
then there's a bunch of ships that
 

1901
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,230
then there's a bunch of ships that
don't want to exist biological beings

1902
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
don't want to exist biological beings
 

1903
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,990
don't want to exist biological beings
but they just have their own place like

1904
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
but they just have their own place like
 

1905
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,990
but they just have their own place like
way over there but they don't they just

1906
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
way over there but they don't they just
 

1907
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,269
way over there but they don't they just
do their own thing they're not

1908
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
do their own thing they're not
 

1909
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,509
do their own thing they're not
necessarily so it's a pretty

1910
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,519
necessarily so it's a pretty
 

1911
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,950
necessarily so it's a pretty
this portopian existence is pretty

1912
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:02,960
this portopian existence is pretty
 

1913
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,190
this portopian existence is pretty
peaceful yeah i mean and then and then

1914
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
peaceful yeah i mean and then and then
 

1915
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,950
peaceful yeah i mean and then and then
for example one of the main fights in

1916
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:06,960
for example one of the main fights in
 

1917
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,870
for example one of the main fights in
the book is um

1918
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:08,880
the book is um
 

1919
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,470
the book is um
uh they're fighting there's these

1920
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,480
uh they're fighting there's these
 

1921
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,909
uh they're fighting there's these
artificial hells

1922
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:11,919
artificial hells
 

1923
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,029
artificial hells
um

1924
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039
um
 

1925
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,789
um
that uh and people

1926
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
that uh and people
 

1927
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,789
that uh and people
are don't think it's ethical to have

1928
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:16,799
are don't think it's ethical to have
 

1929
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,070
are don't think it's ethical to have
artificial hell like basically when

1930
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
artificial hell like basically when
 

1931
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,830
artificial hell like basically when
people do crime they get sent like when

1932
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
people do crime they get sent like when
 

1933
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,190
people do crime they get sent like when
they die their memory gets sent to an

1934
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
they die their memory gets sent to an
 

1935
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,549
they die their memory gets sent to an
artificial hell and they're eternally

1936
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
artificial hell and they're eternally
 

1937
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,710
artificial hell and they're eternally
tortured and so um

1938
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:24,720
tortured and so um
 

1939
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,029
tortured and so um
though and then the way that society is

1940
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
though and then the way that society is
 

1941
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,470
though and then the way that society is
deciding whether or not to have the

1942
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,480
deciding whether or not to have the
 

1943
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,389
deciding whether or not to have the
artificial hell is that they're having

1944
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,399
artificial hell is that they're having
 

1945
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,230
artificial hell is that they're having
these simulated they're having like a

1946
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
these simulated they're having like a
 

1947
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,389
these simulated they're having like a
simulated war so instead of

1948
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:34,399
simulated war so instead of
 

1949
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,230
simulated war so instead of
actual blood you know people are

1950
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
actual blood you know people are
 

1951
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,590
actual blood you know people are
basically essentially fighting in a

1952
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:37,600
basically essentially fighting in a
 

1953
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,909
basically essentially fighting in a
video game to choose the outcome of this

1954
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
video game to choose the outcome of this
 

1955
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,029
video game to choose the outcome of this
but they're still experiencing the

1956
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
but they're still experiencing the
 

1957
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,230
but they're still experiencing the
suffering

1958
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
suffering
 

1959
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,389
suffering
or wait in this artificial hell or no

1960
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
or wait in this artificial hell or no
 

1961
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,909
or wait in this artificial hell or no
can you experience stuff or so the

1962
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:45,919
can you experience stuff or so the
 

1963
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,590
can you experience stuff or so the
artificial health sucks and a lot of

1964
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,600
artificial health sucks and a lot of
 

1965
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,710
artificial health sucks and a lot of
people in the culture want to get rid of

1966
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
people in the culture want to get rid of
 

1967
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,710
people in the culture want to get rid of
the artificial hell there's a simulated

1968
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
the artificial hell there's a simulated
 

1969
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,470
the artificial hell there's a simulated
wars are they happening in the

1970
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:52,480
wars are they happening in the
 

1971
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,630
wars are they happening in the
artificial light so no the simulated

1972
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
artificial light so no the simulated
 

1973
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,909
artificial light so no the simulated
wars are happening outside of the

1974
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
wars are happening outside of the
 

1975
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,310
wars are happening outside of the
artificial health between the political

1976
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,320
artificial health between the political
 

1977
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,549
artificial health between the political
factions who are the so this political

1978
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
factions who are the so this political
 

1979
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,549
factions who are the so this political
faction says we should have simulated

1980
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
faction says we should have simulated
 

1981
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,430
faction says we should have simulated
hell to um deter crime and and this

1982
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,440
hell to um deter crime and and this
 

1983
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,029
hell to um deter crime and and this
political faction is saying no

political faction is saying no
 

1985
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,269
political faction is saying no
stimulated hell is unethical and so

1986
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:09,279
stimulated hell is unethical and so
 

1987
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,110
stimulated hell is unethical and so
instead of like having

1988
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
instead of like having
 

1989
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,389
instead of like having
you know blowing each other up with

1990
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:12,399
you know blowing each other up with
 

1991
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,269
you know blowing each other up with
nukes they're having like a giant

nukes they're having like a giant
 

1993
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,830
nukes they're having like a giant
fortnight battle yes uh to just to

1994
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:17,840
fortnight battle yes uh to just to
 

1995
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,750
fortnight battle yes uh to just to
decide this which

1996
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:19,760
decide this which
 

1997
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,830
decide this which
you know to me that's protopia that's

1998
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:21,840
you know to me that's protopia that's
 

1999
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,710
you know to me that's protopia that's
like okay we can have war without death

2000
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
like okay we can have war without death
 

2001
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,470
like okay we can have war without death
um you know i don't think there should

2002
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
um you know i don't think there should
 

2003
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,070
um you know i don't think there should
be simulated hells i think that is

2004
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
be simulated hells i think that is
 

2005
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,950
be simulated hells i think that is
definitely one of the ways in which

2006
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
definitely one of the ways in which
 

2007
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,590
definitely one of the ways in which
technology could go very very very very

2008
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
technology could go very very very very
 

2009
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,070
technology could go very very very very
wrong so almost punishing people in a

2010
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
wrong so almost punishing people in a
 

2011
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,149
wrong so almost punishing people in a
digital space or something yeah like

2012
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
digital space or something yeah like
 

2013
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,110
digital space or something yeah like
torturing

2014
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,120

00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:08,799
we as humans seem to enjoy
 

2039
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,350
we as humans seem to enjoy
secretly enjoy or used to be openly

2040
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,360
secretly enjoy or used to be openly
 

2041
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,590
secretly enjoy or used to be openly

00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
enjoyed sort of the torture
 

2043
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,669
enjoyed sort of the torture
and the death watching the death and

2044
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
and the death watching the death and
 

2045
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,590
and the death watching the death and

torture of other humans
 

2047
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,669
torture of other humans
i do think

2048
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
i do think
 

2049
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,149
i do think
if people were consenting we should be

2050
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:22,159
if people were consenting we should be
 

2051
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,430
if people were consenting we should be
allowed to have

2052
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
allowed to have
 

2053
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,029
allowed to have
gladiatorial

2054
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:25,039
gladiatorial
 

2055
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,149
gladiatorial
matches

2056
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,159
matches
 

2057
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,909
matches
but consent is hard to achieve in those

2058
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
but consent is hard to achieve in those
 

2059
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,070
but consent is hard to achieve in those
situations it always starts getting

2060
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,080
situations it always starts getting
 

2061
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,310
situations it always starts getting
slippery like it could be also forced

2062
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,320
slippery like it could be also forced
 

2063
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,710
slippery like it could be also forced
cons like it starts getting weird yeah

2064
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,720
cons like it starts getting weird yeah
 

2065
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,190
cons like it starts getting weird yeah
yeah there's way too much excitement

2066
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,200
yeah there's way too much excitement
 

2067
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,630
yeah there's way too much excitement
that this is what he highlights there's

2068
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
that this is what he highlights there's
 

2069
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,950
that this is what he highlights there's
something about human nature that wants

2070
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:40,960
something about human nature that wants
 

2071
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,950
something about human nature that wants
to see that violence and it's really

2072
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:42,960
to see that violence and it's really
 

2073
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,230
to see that violence and it's really
dark

2074
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,240
dark
 

2075
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,470
dark
and you hope that we can sort of

2076
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,480
and you hope that we can sort of
 

2077
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,789
and you hope that we can sort of
overcome that aspect of human nature but

2078
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
overcome that aspect of human nature but
 

2079
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,070
overcome that aspect of human nature but
that's still one

2080
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
that's still one
 

2081
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,669
that's still one
within us somewhere well i think that's

2082
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:51,679
within us somewhere well i think that's
 

2083
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,830
within us somewhere well i think that's
what we're doing right now i have this

2084
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:53,840
what we're doing right now i have this
 

2085
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,230
what we're doing right now i have this
theory that um what is very important

2086
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,240
theory that um what is very important
 

2087
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,509
theory that um what is very important
about the current moment is that um

2088
00:33:59,509 --> 00:33:59,519
about the current moment is that um
 

2089
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,909
about the current moment is that um
all of evolution has been survival of

2090
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
all of evolution has been survival of
 

2091
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,710
all of evolution has been survival of
the fittest up until now and um at some

2092
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,720
the fittest up until now and um at some
 

2093
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,470
the fittest up until now and um at some
point you know it's kind of the lines

2094
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480
point you know it's kind of the lines
 

2095
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,990
point you know it's kind of the lines

in the recent

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,069
in the recent
past or maybe even just right now we're

past or maybe even just right now we're
 

2101
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,510
past or maybe even just right now we're
getting to this

2102
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,520
getting to this
 

2103
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,389
getting to this
point

2104
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:14,399
point
 

2105
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,270
point
where

2106
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
where
 

2107
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,710
where
we

2108
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
we
 

2109
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,349
we
can choose intelligent design

2110
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:19,359
can choose intelligent design
 

2111
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,869
can choose intelligent design
like we

2112
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
like we
 

2113
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,310
like we
probably since like the integration of

2114
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
probably since like the integration of
 

2115
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,710
probably since like the integration of
the iphone like we are becoming cyborgs

2116
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
the iphone like we are becoming cyborgs
 

2117
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,430
the iphone like we are becoming cyborgs
like

2118
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:25,440
like
 

2119
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,510
like
our brains are fundamentally changed

2120
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
our brains are fundamentally changed
 

2121
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,430
our brains are fundamentally changed
everyone who grew up with electronics we

2122
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440
everyone who grew up with electronics we
 

2123
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,750
everyone who grew up with electronics we
are fundamentally different from

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
previous from homo sapiens i call us

previous from homo sapiens i call us
homo techno i i think we have evolved

2128
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:35,919
homo techno i i think we have evolved
 

2129
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,510
homo techno i i think we have evolved
into homo techno which is like

2130
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,520
into homo techno which is like
 

2131
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,470
into homo techno which is like
essentially a new species like um if you

2132
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:40,480
essentially a new species like um if you
 

2133
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,990
essentially a new species like um if you
if you look at the way if you mr if you

2134
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
if you look at the way if you mr if you
 

2135
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,669
if you look at the way if you mr if you
took an mri of my brain and you took an

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
took an mri of my brain and you took an
 

2137
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,510
took an mri of my brain and you took an
mri of like a

2138
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
mri of like a
 

2139
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,430
mri of like a
medieval brain i think it would be very

2140
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:47,440
medieval brain i think it would be very
 

2141
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,109
medieval brain i think it would be very
different the way the way that it has

2142
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:49,119
different the way the way that it has
 

2143
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,869
different the way the way that it has
evolved do you think when historians

2144
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
evolved do you think when historians
 

2145
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,310
evolved do you think when historians
look back at this time they'll see like

2146
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
look back at this time they'll see like
 

2147
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,149
look back at this time they'll see like
this was a fundamental shift to what a

2148
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
this was a fundamental shift to what a
 

2149
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,149
this was a fundamental shift to what a
human being is i think i i i do not

2150
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
human being is i think i i i do not
 

2151
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,990
human being is i think i i i do not
think we're we are still homo sapiens i

2152
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,000
think we're we are still homo sapiens i
 

2153
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,069
think we're we are still homo sapiens i
believe we are homo techno and i i think

2154
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
believe we are homo techno and i i think
 

2155
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,430
believe we are homo techno and i i think
we have evolved

2156
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,440
we have evolved
 

2157
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,790
we have evolved
um and

2158
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:02,800
um and
 

2159
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,230
um and
uh

2160
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,240
uh
 

2161
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,750
uh
and i think right now the way we are

2162
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:05,760
and i think right now the way we are
 

2163
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,390
and i think right now the way we are
evolving um we can we can choose how we

2164
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
evolving um we can we can choose how we
 

2165
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,910
evolving um we can we can choose how we
do that and i think we are being very

2166
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:09,920
do that and i think we are being very
 

2167
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,750
do that and i think we are being very
reckless about how we're doing that like

2168
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
reckless about how we're doing that like
 

2169
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,109
reckless about how we're doing that like
we're just having social media but i

2170
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
we're just having social media but i
 

2171
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,150
we're just having social media but i
think this idea that like this is a time

2172
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
think this idea that like this is a time
 

2173
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,829
think this idea that like this is a time
to choose intelligent design should be

2174
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
to choose intelligent design should be
 

2175
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,310
to choose intelligent design should be
taken very seriously it like now is the

2176
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,320
taken very seriously it like now is the
 

2177
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,950
taken very seriously it like now is the
moment to reprogram the human computer

2178
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
moment to reprogram the human computer
 

2179
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,109
moment to reprogram the human computer
um you know it's like if you go blind um

2180
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
um you know it's like if you go blind um
 

2181
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,510
um you know it's like if you go blind um
your uh visual cortex will get taken

2182
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
your uh visual cortex will get taken
 

2183
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,670
your uh visual cortex will get taken
over with um other functions we can

2184
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
over with um other functions we can
 

2185
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,829
over with um other functions we can
choose our own evolution we can change

2186
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:35,839
choose our own evolution we can change
 

2187
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,910
choose our own evolution we can change
the way our brains work and so we

2188
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
the way our brains work and so we
 

2189
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,349
the way our brains work and so we
actually have a huge responsibility to

2190
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
actually have a huge responsibility to
 

2191
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,950
actually have a huge responsibility to
do that and i think

2192
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
do that and i think
 

2193
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,470
do that and i think
i'm not sure who should be responsible

2194
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:42,480
i'm not sure who should be responsible
 

2195
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,990
i'm not sure who should be responsible
for that but there's definitely not

2196
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
for that but there's definitely not
 

2197
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,829
for that but there's definitely not
adequate education we're being inundated

2198
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
adequate education we're being inundated
 

2199
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,030
adequate education we're being inundated
with all this technology that is

2200
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
with all this technology that is
 

2201
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,670
with all this technology that is
fundamentally changing um the physical

2202
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
fundamentally changing um the physical
 

2203
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,910
fundamentally changing um the physical
structure of our brains and we are not

2204
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:51,920
structure of our brains and we are not
 

2205
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,750
structure of our brains and we are not
um adequately responding to to that

2206
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:55,760
um adequately responding to to that
 

2207
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,670
um adequately responding to to that
to choose how we want to evolve and we

2208
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:57,680
to choose how we want to evolve and we
 

2209
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,710
to choose how we want to evolve and we
could evolve

2210
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:58,720
could evolve
 

2211
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,550
could evolve
we could be really whatever we want and

2212
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,560
we could be really whatever we want and
 

2213
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,790
we could be really whatever we want and
i think this is a really important time

2214
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:02,800
i think this is a really important time
 

2215
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,230
i think this is a really important time
and i think if we choose correctly and

2216
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,240
and i think if we choose correctly and
 

2217
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,670
and i think if we choose correctly and
we choose wisely

2218
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:05,680
we choose wisely
 

2219
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,550
we choose wisely
um consciousness could exist for

2220
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:08,560
um consciousness could exist for
 

2221
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,790
um consciousness could exist for
a very long time and integration with ai

2222
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
a very long time and integration with ai
 

2223
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,710
a very long time and integration with ai
could be extremely positive

2224
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:12,720
could be extremely positive
 

2225
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,829
could be extremely positive
and i don't think enough people are

2226
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
and i don't think enough people are
 

2227
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,230
and i don't think enough people are
focusing on this specific situation do

2228
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
focusing on this specific situation do
 

2229
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,069
focusing on this specific situation do
you think we might irreversibly screw

2230
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
you think we might irreversibly screw
 

2231
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,750
you think we might irreversibly screw
things up if we get things wrong now

2232
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
things up if we get things wrong now
 

2233
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,430
things up if we get things wrong now
because like the flip side of that it

2234
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,440
because like the flip side of that it
 

2235
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,589
because like the flip side of that it
seems humans are pretty adaptive so

2236
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:23,599
seems humans are pretty adaptive so
 

2237
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,069
seems humans are pretty adaptive so
maybe the way we figure things out is by

2238
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:26,079
maybe the way we figure things out is by
 

2239
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,710
maybe the way we figure things out is by
screwing it up like social media over a

2240
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:28,720
screwing it up like social media over a
 

2241
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,069
screwing it up like social media over a
generation we'll see the negative

2242
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:30,079
generation we'll see the negative
 

2243
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,349
generation we'll see the negative
effects of social media and then we

2244
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:31,359
effects of social media and then we
 

2245
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,589
effects of social media and then we
build new social medias and we just keep

2246
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
build new social medias and we just keep
 

2247
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,069
build new social medias and we just keep
improving stuff and then we learn the

2248
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
improving stuff and then we learn the
 

2249
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,430
improving stuff and then we learn the
failure from the failures of the past

2250
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
failure from the failures of the past
 

2251
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,870
failure from the failures of the past
because humans seem to be really

2252
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,880
because humans seem to be really
 

2253
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,430
because humans seem to be really
adaptive on the flip side

2254
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
adaptive on the flip side
 

2255
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,109
adaptive on the flip side
you we can get it wrong in a way where

2256

and and i think that when i talk about
 

3091
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,270
and and i think that when i talk about
this nexus point of um

3092
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
this nexus point of um
 

3093
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,109
this nexus point of um
that we're in this point in society

3094
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:53,119
that we're in this point in society
 

3095
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,470
that we're in this point in society
where we're switching to intelligent

3096
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
where we're switching to intelligent
 

3097
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,990
where we're switching to intelligent
design i think part of our switch to

3098
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,000
design i think part of our switch to
 

3099
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,750
design i think part of our switch to
intelligent design is that we need to

3100
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:57,760
intelligent design is that we need to
 

3101
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,549
intelligent design is that we need to
choose non-violence and we need to like

3102
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
choose non-violence and we need to like

start i don't think we can eradicate
 

3107
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,589
start i don't think we can eradicate
violence from our species um because i

3108
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:07,599
violence from our species um because i
 

3109
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,109
violence from our species um because i
think

3110
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
think
 

3111
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,030
think
we we need it a little bit but i think

3112
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
we we need it a little bit but i think
 

3113
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,270
we we need it a little bit but i think
we can choose to really reorient our

3114
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:13,280
we can choose to really reorient our
 

3115
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,309
we can choose to really reorient our
primitive

3116

into it we can optimize for creativity

3124
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:23,599
into it we can optimize for creativity
 

3125
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,190
into it we can optimize for creativity
and building

3126
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
and building
 

3127
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,710
and building
yeah it's interesting to think how that

3128
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
yeah it's interesting to think how that
 

3129
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,510
yeah it's interesting to think how that
happens so some of it is just education

3130
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,520
happens so some of it is just education
 

3131
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,589
happens so some of it is just education
some of it is

3132
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
some of it is
 

3133
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,430
some of it is
living life and introspecting your own

3134
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:33,440
living life and introspecting your own
 

3135
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,670
living life and introspecting your own
mind and trying to

nature for each one of us
 

3141
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,670
nature for each one of us
all those kinds of things at scale

3142
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:41,680
all those kinds of things at scale
 

3143
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,910
all those kinds of things at scale
that's how we can sort of um start to

3144
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:43,920
that's how we can sort of um start to
 

3145
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,150
that's how we can sort of um start to
minimize the amount of destructive uh

3146
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
minimize the amount of destructive uh
 

3147
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,270
minimize the amount of destructive uh
war

3148
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
war
 

3149
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,990
war
in our world and that that's to me i

3150
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
in our world and that that's to me i
 

3151
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,430
in our world and that that's to me i
probably you're the same technology's

3152
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,440
probably you're the same technology's
 

3153
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,030
probably you're the same technology's
it's a really promising way to do that

3154
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,040
it's a really promising way to do that
 

3155
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,950
it's a really promising way to do that
like social media should be a really

3156
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:56,960
like social media should be a really
 

3157
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,950
like social media should be a really
promising way to do that it's a way to

00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
promising way to do that it's a way to
 

3159
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,510
promising way to do that it's a way to
reconnect i you know for the most part i

3160
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:01,520
reconnect i you know for the most part i

something negative
 

3177
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,990
something negative
i see it

3178
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,000
i see it
 

3179
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,470
i see it
i immediately think positive thoughts

3180
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:22,480
i immediately think positive thoughts
 

3181
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,349
i immediately think positive thoughts
about them and i just forget they exist

3182
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:25,359
about them and i just forget they exist
 

3183
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,109
about them and i just forget they exist
after that just move on because like

3184
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,119
after that just move on because like
 

3185
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,430
after that just move on because like
that negative energy if i return the

3186
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:29,440
that negative energy if i return the
 

3187
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,670
that negative energy if i return the
negative energy they're going to get

3188
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
negative energy they're going to get
 

3189
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,109
negative energy they're going to get
they're going to get excited in a

3190
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
they're going to get excited in a
 

3191
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,109
they're going to get excited in a
negative way right back and it's just

3192
00:52:35,109 --> 00:52:35,119
negative way right back and it's just
 

3193
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,670
negative way right back and it's just
this kind of vicious cycle

3194
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,680
this kind of vicious cycle
 

3195
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,750
this kind of vicious cycle
um but you would think technology would

3196
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:39,760
um but you would think technology would
 

3197
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,710
um but you would think technology would
assist us in this process of letting go

3198
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
assist us in this process of letting go
 

3199
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,950
assist us in this process of letting go
of not taking things personally of not

3200
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:44,960
of not taking things personally of not
 

3201
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,549
of not taking things personally of not
engaging the negativity but

3202
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
engaging the negativity but
 

3203
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,710
engaging the negativity but
unfortunately social media

3204
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:48,720
unfortunately social media
 

3205
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,790
unfortunately social media
profits from the negativity so the

3206
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:50,800
profits from the negativity so the
 

3207
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,630
profits from the negativity so the
current models i mean social media is

3208
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:52,640
current models i mean social media is
 

3209
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,349
current models i mean social media is
like a gun like you should take

3210
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
like a gun like you should take
 

3211
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,589
like a gun like you should take
a course before you you use it like it's

3212
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
a course before you you use it like it's
 

3213

3215
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,030
like it's true this is what i mean like
when i say reprogram the human computer

should
 

3241
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,270
should
i guess it should exist i'm not sure

3242
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,280
i guess it should exist i'm not sure
 

3243
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,549
i guess it should exist i'm not sure
i mean we're in the messy it's it's the

3244
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,559
i mean we're in the messy it's it's the
 

3245
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,990
i mean we're in the messy it's it's the
experimental phase like we're going to

3246
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:30,000
experimental phase like we're going to
 

3247
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,750
experimental phase like we're going to
the early days i don't even know when

3248
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:31,760
the early days i don't even know when
 

3249
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,950
the early days i don't even know when
you say social media i don't know what

3250
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:32,960
you say social media i don't know what
 

3251
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,549
you say social media i don't know what
that even means we're in the very early

3252
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
that even means we're in the very early
 

3253
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,710
that even means we're in the very early
days i think social media is just basic

and that
 

3259
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,470
and that
i think it should exist but there's so

3260
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,480
i think it should exist but there's so
 

3261
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,990
i think it should exist but there's so
many ways to do it in a bad way there's

3262
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
many ways to do it in a bad way there's
 

3263

many ways to do it in a bad way there's
so many ways to do it in a good way

so many ways to do it in a good way
 

3265
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,349
so many ways to do it in a good way
there's all discussions of all the same

3266
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
there's all discussions of all the same

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,390
about all these things that we had to
figure out back in the day with in the

3278
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,400
figure out back in the day with in the
 

3279
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,309
figure out back in the day with in the
physical space we're not figuring out in

3280
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:02,319
physical space we're not figuring out in
 

3281
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,430
physical space we're not figuring out in
the digital space and it's like baby

3282
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
the digital space and it's like baby
 

3283
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,430
the digital space and it's like baby
baby stages when the printing press came

3284
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:07,440
baby stages when the printing press came
 

3285
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,670
baby stages when the printing press came
out it was like pure chaos for a minute

3286
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:09,680
out it was like pure chaos for a minute
 

3287
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,510
out it was like pure chaos for a minute
you know it's like it's like when you

3288
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:11,520
you know it's like it's like when you
 

3289
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,030
you know it's like it's like when you
inject when there's a massive

3290
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,040
inject when there's a massive
 

3291
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,670
inject when there's a massive
information injection into the into the

3292
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
information injection into the into the
 

3293
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,309
information injection into the into the
general population um

3294
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
general population um
 

3295
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,670
general population um
there's just gonna be

3296
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:19,680
there's just gonna be
 

3297
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,750
there's just gonna be
i like i feel like the printing press i

3298
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:21,760
i like i feel like the printing press i
 

3299
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,670
i like i feel like the printing press i
i don't have the years but it was like

3300
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:23,680
i don't have the years but it was like
 

3301
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,910
i don't have the years but it was like
printing press came out [\h__\h] got really

3302
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:25,920
printing press came out [\h__\h] got really
 

3303
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,829
printing press came out [\h__\h] got really
[\h__\h] bad for a minute but then we got

3304
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:27,839
[\h__\h] bad for a minute but then we got
 

3305
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,030
[\h__\h] bad for a minute but then we got
the enlightenment

3306
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
the enlightenment
 

3307
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,030
the enlightenment
and so it's like i think we're in this

3308
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,040
and so it's like i think we're in this
 

3309
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,549
and so it's like i think we're in this
is like a

3310
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
is like a
 

3311
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,630
is like a
the second coming of the printing press

3312
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:34,640
the second coming of the printing press
 

3313
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,069
the second coming of the printing press
we're probably gonna have some shitty

3314
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
we're probably gonna have some shitty
 

3315
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,710
we're probably gonna have some shitty
times for a minute um and then we're

3316
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:38,720
times for a minute um and then we're
 

3317
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,190
times for a minute um and then we're
going to have recalibrate to have a

3318
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:41,200
going to have recalibrate to have a
 

3319
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,670
going to have recalibrate to have a
better understanding of how we consume

3320
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:43,680
better understanding of how we consume
 

3321
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,309
better understanding of how we consume
media and how we

3322
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:46,319
media and how we
 

3323
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,349
media and how we
deliver media speaking of programming

3324
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:49,359
deliver media speaking of programming
 

3325
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,230
deliver media speaking of programming
the human computer you mentioned baby x

3326
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:52,240
the human computer you mentioned baby x
 

3327
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,349
the human computer you mentioned baby x
uh so there's this young consciousness

3328
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:55,359
uh so there's this young consciousness
 

3329
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,870
uh so there's this young consciousness
coming to be

3330
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:56,880
coming to be
 

3331
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,270
coming to be
came from a cell it like

3332
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,280
came from a cell it like
 

3333
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,030
came from a cell it like
like that whole thing doesn't even makes

3334

like that whole thing doesn't even makes
 

3335
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,430
like that whole thing doesn't even makes
it came from dna yeah and then there's

3336
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,440
it came from dna yeah and then there's
 

3337
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,430
it came from dna yeah and then there's
this baby computer it just like grows

3338
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,440
this baby computer it just like grows
 

3339
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,870
this baby computer it just like grows
and grows and grows and grows and now

3340
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
and grows and grows and grows and now
 

3341
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,230
and grows and grows and grows and now
there's a conscious being with extremely

3342
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
there's a conscious being with extremely
 

3343
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,870

hurling yourself into the abyss and

3890
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,400
hurling yourself into the abyss and
 

3891
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,470
hurling yourself into the abyss and
discovering it's a feather bed

3892
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:48,480
discovering it's a feather bed
 

3893
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,750
discovering it's a feather bed
yeah

3894
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:49,760
yeah
 

3895
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,190
yeah
and for this reason i

3896
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,200
and for this reason i
 

3897
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,549
and for this reason i
i do think there are no technological

3898
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:54,559
i do think there are no technological
 

3899
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,589
i do think there are no technological
limits i i think like what what is

3900
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:57,599
limits i i think like what what is
 

3901
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:58,950
limits i i think like what what is
already happening here this is like

3902
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:58,960
already happening here this is like
 

3903
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,270
already happening here this is like
impossible this is insane and we've done

3904
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,280
impossible this is insane and we've done
 

3905
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,190
impossible this is insane and we've done
this in a very limited amount of time

3906
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:03,200
this in a very limited amount of time
 

3907
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,710
this in a very limited amount of time
and we're accelerating the rate at which

3908
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:04,720
and we're accelerating the rate at which
 

3909
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,109
and we're accelerating the rate at which
we're doing this so i i think digital

3910
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
we're doing this so i i think digital
 

3911
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,710
we're doing this so i i think digital
consciousness

3912
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:08,720
consciousness
 

3913
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,950
consciousness
uh it's inevitable and we we may not be

3914
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:10,960
uh it's inevitable and we we may not be
 

3915
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,190
uh it's inevitable and we we may not be
able to even understand what that means

3916
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200
able to even understand what that means
 

3917
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,950
able to even understand what that means
but i like curling yourself into the

3918
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:14,960
but i like curling yourself into the
 

3919
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,870
but i like curling yourself into the
abyss so we're surrounded by all this

3920
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:16,880
abyss so we're surrounded by all this
 

3921
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,230
abyss so we're surrounded by all this
mystery and we just keep hurling

3922
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:18,240
mystery and we just keep hurling
 

3923
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,670
mystery and we just keep hurling
ourselves into it

3924
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
ourselves into it
 

3925
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,910
ourselves into it
like fearlessly and keep discovering

3926
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,920
like fearlessly and keep discovering
 

3927
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,950
like fearlessly and keep discovering
cool [\h__\h]

3928
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:22,960
cool [\h__\h]
 

3929
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,750
cool [\h__\h]
yeah

3930
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:23,760
yeah
 

3931
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,950
yeah
like

3932
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
like
 

3933
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,829
like
i just i just think it's like

3934
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:29,839

 

3935
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,190

the

3936
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
the
 

3937
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,549
the
like who even knows if the laws are

3938
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:32,559
like who even knows if the laws are
 

3939
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,309
like who even knows if the laws are
physical the laws of physics are

3940
01:04:34,309 --> 01:04:34,319
physical the laws of physics are
 

3941
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:35,829
physical the laws of physics are
probably just the current like as i'm

3942
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:35,839
probably just the current like as i'm
 

3943
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,870
probably just the current like as i'm
saying speed of light is the current

3944
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:36,880
saying speed of light is the current
 

3945
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,029
saying speed of light is the current
render rate it's like

3946
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:39,039
render rate it's like
 

3947
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,390
render rate it's like
if we're in a simulation they'll be able

3948
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
if we're in a simulation they'll be able
 

3949
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,990
if we're in a simulation they'll be able
to upgrade that like i sort of suspect

3950
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:42,000
to upgrade that like i sort of suspect
 

3951
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,750
to upgrade that like i sort of suspect
when uh

3952
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
when uh
 

3953
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,670
when uh
we made the james webb telescope like

3954
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:45,680
we made the james webb telescope like
 

3955
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,789
we made the james webb telescope like
part of the reason we made that is

3956
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:46,799
part of the reason we made that is
 

3957
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,029
part of the reason we made that is
because we had an upgrade

3958
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:49,039
because we had an upgrade
 

3959
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,990
because we had an upgrade
uh you know and so now more more of

3960
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,000
uh you know and so now more more of
 

3961
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,390
uh you know and so now more more of
space has been rendered so we can see

3962
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:54,400
space has been rendered so we can see
 

3963
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,710
space has been rendered so we can see
more of it now

3964
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:56,720
more of it now
 

3965
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,710
more of it now
yeah but i think humans are super super

3966
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:58,720
yeah but i think humans are super super
 

3967
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,150
yeah but i think humans are super super
super limited cognitively so i wonder

3968
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,160
super limited cognitively so i wonder
 

3969
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,990
super limited cognitively so i wonder
uh i wonder if we'll be allowed to

3970
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,000
uh i wonder if we'll be allowed to
 

3971
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,230
uh i wonder if we'll be allowed to
create more intelligent beings that can

3972
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
create more intelligent beings that can
 

3973
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,789
create more intelligent beings that can
see more of the universe as the as their

3974
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
see more of the universe as the as their
 

3975
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,589
see more of the universe as the as their
render rate is upgraded maybe we're

3976
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:11,599
render rate is upgraded maybe we're
 

3977
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:12,870
render rate is upgraded maybe we're
cognitively limited everyone keeps

3978
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,880
cognitively limited everyone keeps
 

3979
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,990
cognitively limited everyone keeps
talking about how we're cognitive

3980
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,000
talking about how we're cognitive
 

3981
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,910
talking about how we're cognitive
cognitively limited and ai is going to

3982
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:15,920
cognitively limited and ai is going to
 

3983
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,549
cognitively limited and ai is going to
render us obsolete but it's like

3984
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:18,559
render us obsolete but it's like
 

3985
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,230
render us obsolete but it's like
you know

3986
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
you know
 

3987
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,270
you know
like this is not the same thing as like

3988
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
like this is not the same thing as like
 

3989
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,069
like this is not the same thing as like
an amoeba becoming an alligator like

3990
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
an amoeba becoming an alligator like
 

3991
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,710
an amoeba becoming an alligator like
it's like if we create ai again that's

3992
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:28,720
it's like if we create ai again that's
 

3993
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,549
it's like if we create ai again that's
intelligent design that's literally all

3994
01:05:30,549 --> 01:05:30,559
intelligent design that's literally all
 

3995
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,309
intelligent design that's literally all
religions are based on

3996
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:32,319
religions are based on
 

3997
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,710
religions are based on
gods that create consciousness like we

3998
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:34,720
gods that create consciousness like we
 

3999
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,470
gods that create consciousness like we
are god making like what we are doing is

4000
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
are god making like what we are doing is
 

4001
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,829
are god making like what we are doing is
incredibly profound and like even if we

4002
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:39,839
incredibly profound and like even if we
 

4003
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,870
incredibly profound and like even if we
uh can't compute even

4004
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:42,880

um like i think even if we want i think
 

4117
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,230
um like i think even if we want i think
one of the values

4118
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,240
one of the values
 

4119
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,510
one of the values
if uh

4120
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
if uh
 

4121
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,750
if uh
consciousness is the thing

4122
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:43,760
consciousness is the thing
 

4123
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,390
consciousness is the thing
that is most worth preserving

4124
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:46,400
that is most worth preserving
 

4125
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,309
that is most worth preserving
um which i think is the case i think

4126
01:07:48,309 --> 01:07:48,319
um which i think is the case i think
 

4127
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,750
um which i think is the case i think
consciousness i think if there's any

4128
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:49,760
consciousness i think if there's any
 

4129
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,109
consciousness i think if there's any
kind of like religious or spiritual

4130
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:51,119
kind of like religious or spiritual
 

4131

thing um
 

4133
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,870
thing um
it should be that consciousness is

4134
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
it should be that consciousness is
 

4135
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,109
it should be that consciousness is
sacred uh

4136
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:57,119
sacred uh
 

4137
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,230
sacred uh
like

4138
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,240
like
 

4139
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,750
like
then you know

4140
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
then you know
 

4141
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,910
then you know
i still think even if ai renders

4142
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
i still think even if ai renders
 

4143
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,870
i still think even if ai renders
obsolete and we climate change

4144
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:04,880
obsolete and we climate change
 

4145
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,710
obsolete and we climate change
it's too bad and we get hit by a comet

4146
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:06,720
it's too bad and we get hit by a comet
 

4147
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,069
it's too bad and we get hit by a comet
and we don't become a multi-planetary

4148
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:08,079
and we don't become a multi-planetary
 

4149
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,710
and we don't become a multi-planetary
species fast enough but like ai is able

4150
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:10,720
species fast enough but like ai is able
 

4151
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,870
species fast enough but like ai is able
to populate the universe like i imagine

4152
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:12,880
to populate the universe like i imagine
 

4153
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,229
to populate the universe like i imagine
like if i was an ai i would uh find more

4154
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:16,239
like if i was an ai i would uh find more
 

4155
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:18,470
like if i was an ai i would uh find more
planets that are capable of hosting

4156
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
planets that are capable of hosting
 

4157
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,470
planets that are capable of hosting
biological life forms and like recreate

4158
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:20,480
biological life forms and like recreate
 

4159
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,990
biological life forms and like recreate

yeah but i i do believe that ai can have

4164
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:25,520
yeah but i i do believe that ai can have
 

4165
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,269
yeah but i i do believe that ai can have
some of the same magic

4166
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
some of the same magic
 

4167
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,669
some of the same magic
of consciousness within it

4168
01:08:29,669 --> 01:08:29,679
of consciousness within it
 

4169
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:30,950
of consciousness within it
because consciousness we don't know what

4170
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:30,960
because consciousness we don't know what
 

4171
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,870
because consciousness we don't know what
it is so you know there's some kind of

4172
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
it is so you know there's some kind of
 

4173
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,229
it is so you know there's some kind of
it might be a different magic it might

4174
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:34,239
it might be a different magic it might
 

4175
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,070
it might be a different magic it might
be like a strange

4176
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:36,080
be like a strange
 

4177
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,590
be like a strange
a strange different

4178
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:37,600
a strange different
 

4179
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,709
a strange different
right because they're not gonna have

4180
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:38,719
right because they're not gonna have
 

4181
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:39,910
right because they're not gonna have
hormones like i feel like a lot of our

4182
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:39,920
hormones like i feel like a lot of our
 

4183
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,950
hormones like i feel like a lot of our
magic is a hormonal uh kind of i i don't

4184
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960
magic is a hormonal uh kind of i i don't
 

4185
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,550
magic is a hormonal uh kind of i i don't
know i think some of our magic is the

4186
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
know i think some of our magic is the
 

4187
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,870
know i think some of our magic is the
limitations the constraints and within

4188
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:46,880
limitations the constraints and within
 

4189
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,309
limitations the constraints and within
that the hormones and all that kind of

4190
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:48,319
that the hormones and all that kind of
 

4191
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,630
that the hormones and all that kind of
stuff the finiteness of life and then we

4192
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:50,640
stuff the finiteness of life and then we
 

4193
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,550
stuff the finiteness of life and then we
get given our limitations

4194
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560
get given our limitations
 

4195
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,149
get given our limitations
we get to some come up with creative

4196
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:54,159
we get to some come up with creative
 

4197
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:55,590
we get to some come up with creative
solutions of how to dance around those

4198
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:55,600
solutions of how to dance around those
 

4199
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,070
solutions of how to dance around those
limitations we partner up like penguins

4200
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
limitations we partner up like penguins
 

4201
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,990
limitations we partner up like penguins
against the cold we

4202
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,000
against the cold we
 

4203
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,709
against the cold we
we fall in love and uh and then love is

4204
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:02,719
we fall in love and uh and then love is
 

4205
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,390
we fall in love and uh and then love is
ultimately some kind of

4206
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,400
ultimately some kind of
 

4207
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,229
ultimately some kind of
allows us to delude ourselves that we're

4208
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
allows us to delude ourselves that we're
 

4209
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,189
allows us to delude ourselves that we're
not

4210
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
not
 

4211
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,669
not
mortal and finite and that life is not

4212
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:09,679
mortal and finite and that life is not
 

4213
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,510
mortal and finite and that life is not
ultimately you live alone

4214
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
ultimately you live alone
 

4215
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,070
ultimately you live alone
you're born alone you die alone and then

4216
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,080
you're born alone you die alone and then
 

4217
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,829
you're born alone you die alone and then
love is like a for a moment or for a

4218
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839
love is like a for a moment or for a
 

4219
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,229
love is like a for a moment or for a
long time forgetting that and so like we

4220
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:18,239
long time forgetting that and so like we
 

4221
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:20,149
long time forgetting that and so like we
come up with all these creative hacks

4222
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:20,159
come up with all these creative hacks
 

4223
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:21,910
come up with all these creative hacks
that make life

4224
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920
that make life
 

4225
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,950
that make life
like fascinatingly

4226
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:24,960
like fascinatingly
 

4227
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,910
like fascinatingly
fun

4228
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920
fun
 

4229
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,390
fun
yeah yeah yeah fun yeah and then ai

4230
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:28,400
yeah yeah yeah fun yeah and then ai
 

4231
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,110
yeah yeah yeah fun yeah and then ai
might have different kinds of fun yes

4232
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,120
might have different kinds of fun yes
 

4233
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,189
might have different kinds of fun yes
and hopefully our funds intersect

4234
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:33,199
and hopefully our funds intersect
 

4235
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:34,870
and hopefully our funds intersect
intersect i think once in a while i

4236
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:34,880
intersect i think once in a while i
 

4237
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,390
intersect i think once in a while i
think there would be there there'd be a

4238
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:36,400
think there would be there there'd be a
 

4239
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,990
think there would be there there'd be a
little intersection there'd be a little

4240
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:38,000
little intersection there'd be a little
 

4241
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,390
little intersection there'd be a little
intersection of the fun yeah yeah what

4242
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:40,400
intersection of the fun yeah yeah what
 

4243
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,789
intersection of the fun yeah yeah what
do you think is the role of love

4244
01:09:42,789 --> 01:09:42,799
do you think is the role of love
 

4245
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:46,390
do you think is the role of love
in the human condition

4246
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:46,400

 

4247
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,189

why is it useful is it useful like uh

4248
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
why is it useful is it useful like uh
 

4249
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,669
why is it useful is it useful like uh
hack or is this like fundamental to what

4250
01:09:51,669 --> 01:09:51,679
hack or is this like fundamental to what
 

4251
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,829
hack or is this like fundamental to what
it means to be human the capacity to

4252
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:53,839
it means to be human the capacity to
 

4253
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:54,790
it means to be human the capacity to
love

4254
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:54,800
love
 

4255
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,189
love
i mean i think love is the evolutionary

4256
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:57,199
i mean i think love is the evolutionary
 

4257
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,590
i mean i think love is the evolutionary
mechanism that is like beginning the

4258
01:09:59,590 --> 01:09:59,600
mechanism that is like beginning the
 

4259
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,870
mechanism that is like beginning the
intelligent design like i was just

4260
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,880
intelligent design like i was just
 

4261
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,990
intelligent design like i was just
reading about uh

4262
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
reading about uh
 

4263
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,990
reading about uh
do you know about crop pot kropotkin

anarchist okay anarchists are fun i'm
 

4275
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,510
anarchist okay anarchists are fun i'm
kind of getting into anarchism a little

4276
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
kind of getting into anarchism a little
 

4277
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,350
kind of getting into anarchism a little
bit this is probably

4278
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:19,360
bit this is probably
 

4279
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,149
bit this is probably
yeah not a good route to be taking but

4280
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:22,159
yeah not a good route to be taking but
 

4281
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,550
yeah not a good route to be taking but
oh no i i think if you're listen you

4282
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:24,560
oh no i i think if you're listen you
 

4283
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,229
oh no i i think if you're listen you
should expose yourself to ideas there's

4284
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:26,239
should expose yourself to ideas there's
 

4285
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,630
should expose yourself to ideas there's
no harm to thinking about ideas i think

4286
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:28,640
no harm to thinking about ideas i think
 

4287
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,229
no harm to thinking about ideas i think
anarchists

4288
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:30,239
anarchists
 

4289
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,310

challenge systems in interesting ways
 

4291
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,149
challenge systems in interesting ways
and they think in interesting ways it's

4292
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:34,159
and they think in interesting ways it's
 

4293
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:35,430
and they think in interesting ways it's
just it's good for the soul it's like

i i've never actually gone deep on on
anarchy as a philosophy so i'm you still

4304
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:44,560
anarchy as a philosophy so i'm you still
 

4305
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,990
anarchy as a philosophy so i'm you still
think about it like when you when you

4306
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
think about it like when you when you
 

4307
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,350

listen because i'm like reading about

4308
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:47,360
listen because i'm like reading about
 

4309
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,550
listen because i'm like reading about
the russian revolution a lot and it was

4310
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:48,560
the russian revolution a lot and it was
 

4311
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,270
the russian revolution a lot and it was
like

4312
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:49,280
like
 

4313
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,030
like
there was like the soviets and lenin all

and his like anarchist sect and they
 

4319
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,270
and his like anarchist sect and they
were sort of interesting because he was

4320
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:55,280
were sort of interesting because he was
 

4321
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,350
were sort of interesting because he was
kind of a technocrat actually like he

4322
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:57,360
kind of a technocrat actually like he
 

4323
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,430
kind of a technocrat actually like he
was like you know like women can be more

4324
01:10:59,430 --> 01:10:59,440
was like you know like women can be more
 

4325
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,510
was like you know like women can be more
equal if we have appliances like he was

4326
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
equal if we have appliances like he was
 

4327
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,149
equal if we have appliances like he was
like really into like um you know

4328
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:04,159
like really into like um you know
 

4329
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,990
like really into like um you know
using technology to like reduce the

4330
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
using technology to like reduce the
 

4331
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,750
using technology to like reduce the
amount of work people had to do

4332
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:07,760
amount of work people had to do
 

4333
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,149
amount of work people had to do
but so kropochen was a

4334
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:10,159
but so kropochen was a
 

4335
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:11,830
but so kropochen was a
like a biologist or something like he

4336
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:11,840
like a biologist or something like he
 

4337
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,709
like a biologist or something like he
studied animals um and he was re really

4338
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:14,719
studied animals um and he was re really
 

4339
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:15,990
studied animals um and he was re really
at the time

4340
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000
at the time
 

4341
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,189
at the time
like uh i think it's nature

4342
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:19,199
like uh i think it's nature
 

4343
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,630
like uh i think it's nature
magazine

4344
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640
magazine
 

4345
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,990
magazine
i think it might have even started like

4346
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,000
i think it might have even started like
 

4347
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,110
i think it might have even started like
a russian magazine but he was like

4348
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:23,120
a russian magazine but he was like
 

4349
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,310
a russian magazine but he was like
publishing studies like everyone was

4350
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:24,320
publishing studies like everyone was
 

4351
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,990
publishing studies like everyone was
really into like darwinism at the time

4352
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000
really into like darwinism at the time
 

4353
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,189
really into like darwinism at the time
and like survival of the fittest and

4354
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:27,199
and like survival of the fittest and
 

4355
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,590
and like survival of the fittest and
like war is like the mechanism by which

4356
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:29,600
like war is like the mechanism by which
 

4357
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,110
like war is like the mechanism by which
we become better and it was like this

4358
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,120
we become better and it was like this
 

4359
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,070
we become better and it was like this
real

4360
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
real
 

4361
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,270
real
kind of like

4362
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:33,280
kind of like
 

4363
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,950
kind of like
like like

4364
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:34,960
like like
 

4365
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,870
like like
cementing this idea in society that like

4366
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:36,880
cementing this idea in society that like
 

4367
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,070
cementing this idea in society that like
violence uh you know kill the weak and

4368
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:40,080
violence uh you know kill the weak and
 

4369
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,430
violence uh you know kill the weak and
like that's how we become better and

4370
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:41,440
like that's how we become better and
 

4371
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,030
like that's how we become better and
then kropotkin was kind of interesting

4372
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:43,040
then kropotkin was kind of interesting
 

4373
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,590
then kropotkin was kind of interesting
because he was looking at um instances

4374
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:45,600
because he was looking at um instances
 

4375
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,110
because he was looking at um instances
he was finding all these instances in

4376
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:47,120
he was finding all these instances in
 

4377
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,470
he was finding all these instances in
nature where animals were like helping

4378
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
nature where animals were like helping
 

4379
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,790
nature where animals were like helping
each other and stuff um and he was like

4380
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,800
each other and stuff um and he was like
 

4381
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,470
each other and stuff um and he was like
you know actually love is a survival

4382
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
you know actually love is a survival
 

4383
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,590
you know actually love is a survival
mechanism

4384
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:53,600
mechanism
 

4385
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,550
mechanism
like there's

4386
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:54,560
like there's
 

4387
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,030
like there's
so many uh

4388
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,040
so many uh
 

4389
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,950
so many uh
instances in the animal kingdom where

4390
01:11:58,950 --> 01:11:58,960
instances in the animal kingdom where
 

4391
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,630
instances in the animal kingdom where
like cooperation

4392
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:00,640
like cooperation
 

4393
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,630
like cooperation
and you know like helping weaker

4394
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:02,640
and you know like helping weaker
 

4395
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,709
and you know like helping weaker
creatures and all this stuff is actually

4396
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:04,719
creatures and all this stuff is actually
 

4397
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,470
creatures and all this stuff is actually
um an evolutionary mechanism i mean you

4398
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,480
um an evolutionary mechanism i mean you
 

4399
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,550
um an evolutionary mechanism i mean you
even look at child rearing like child

4400
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:08,560
even look at child rearing like child
 

4401
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,070
even look at child rearing like child
rearing is

4402
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:10,080
rearing is
 

4403
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,430
rearing is
like

4404
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:11,440
like
 

4405
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,070
like
immense amounts of just love and good

4406
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,080
immense amounts of just love and good
 

4407
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,910
immense amounts of just love and good
will and just like there's no immediate

4408
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
will and just like there's no immediate
 

4409
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,189
will and just like there's no immediate
um

4410
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:19,199
um
 

4411
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,870
um
you're there you know you're not getting

4412
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:20,880
you're there you know you're not getting
 

4413
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,149
you're there you know you're not getting
any immediate feedback of like

4414
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:24,159
any immediate feedback of like
 

4415
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,470
any immediate feedback of like
winning it's not competitive it's

4416
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:26,480
winning it's not competitive it's
 

4417
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,910
winning it's not competitive it's
literally it's you know it's like we

4418
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
literally it's you know it's like we
 

4419
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,510
literally it's you know it's like we
actually use love as an evolutionary

4420
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,520
actually use love as an evolutionary
 

4421
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,110
actually use love as an evolutionary
mechanism just as much as we use war and

4422
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:31,120
mechanism just as much as we use war and
 

4423
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,750
mechanism just as much as we use war and
i think we've like missing the other

4424
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:33,760
i think we've like missing the other
 

4425
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,590
i think we've like missing the other
part and we've reoriented we've

4426
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:35,600
part and we've reoriented we've
 

4427
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,950
part and we've reoriented we've
culturally reoriented like science and

4428
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960
culturally reoriented like science and
 

4429
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,189
culturally reoriented like science and
philosophy has re has

4430
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:41,199
philosophy has re has
 

4431
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:43,030
philosophy has re has
oriented itself around darwinism a

4432
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:43,040
oriented itself around darwinism a
 

4433
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,950
oriented itself around darwinism a
little bit too much and the krapotkin

4434
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:44,960
little bit too much and the krapotkin
 

4435
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:45,830
little bit too much and the krapotkin
model

4436
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:45,840
model
 

4437
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,950
model
um i think is equally valid like it's

4438
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:48,960
um i think is equally valid like it's
 

4439
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,830
um i think is equally valid like it's
like cooperation and um

4440
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
like cooperation and um
 

4441
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,270
like cooperation and um
uh

4442
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
uh
 

4443
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,990
uh
and love and stuff is just as essential

4444
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,000
and love and stuff is just as essential
 

4445
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,709
and love and stuff is just as essential
for

4446
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:56,719
for
 

4447
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,030
for
uh sp species survival and evolution to

4448
01:12:59,030 --> 01:12:59,040
uh sp species survival and evolution to
 

4449
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,510
uh sp species survival and evolution to
be a more powerful survival mechanism

4450
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520
be a more powerful survival mechanism
 

4451
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,669
be a more powerful survival mechanism
in the context of evolution and it comes

4452
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:03,679
in the context of evolution and it comes
 

4453
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,030
in the context of evolution and it comes
back to like you know we think

4454
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:05,040
back to like you know we think
 

4455
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,709
back to like you know we think
engineering is so much more important

4456
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
engineering is so much more important
 

4457
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,950
engineering is so much more important
than motherhood but it's like

4458
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:08,960
than motherhood but it's like
 

4459
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,990
than motherhood but it's like
if you lose the motherhood the

4460
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
if you lose the motherhood the
 

4461
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,110
if you lose the motherhood the
engineering means nothing we have no

4462
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:11,120
engineering means nothing we have no
 

4463
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,750
engineering means nothing we have no
more humans like it's like uh

4464
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:13,760
more humans like it's like uh
 

4465
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,510
more humans like it's like uh
you know it's like we

4466
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,520
you know it's like we
 

4467
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,550
you know it's like we
i i think our society should

4468
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:18,560
i i think our society should
 

4469
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,390
i i think our society should
the survival of the the way we see we

4470
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:22,400
the survival of the the way we see we
 

4471
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,070
the survival of the the way we see we
conceptualize evolution should really

4472
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:24,080
conceptualize evolution should really
 

4473
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,870
conceptualize evolution should really
change to also include this idea i guess

4474
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
change to also include this idea i guess
 

4475
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,830
change to also include this idea i guess
yeah there's some weird thing that seems

4476
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:30,840
yeah there's some weird thing that seems
 

4477
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,470
yeah there's some weird thing that seems
irrational

4478
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:32,480
irrational
 

4479
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,310
irrational
that it

4480
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,320
that it
 

4481
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,709
that it
is also core to what it means to be

4482
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:36,719
is also core to what it means to be
 

4483

you do a lot of irrational things but

4488
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
you do a lot of irrational things but
 

4489
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,870
you do a lot of irrational things but
that depth of connection and that

4490
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:44,880
that depth of connection and that

01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:06,239
what are our actual values like well
 

4509
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,630
what are our actual values like well
right i mean the rational thing is

4510
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:08,640
right i mean the rational thing is
 

4511
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,189
right i mean the rational thing is
if you have a cold economist perspective

4512
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:11,199
if you have a cold economist perspective

you know if you turn in terms of salary

4518
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:18,159
you know if you turn in terms of salary
 

4519
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,870
you know if you turn in terms of salary
in terms of economic well-being in terms

4520
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:20,880
in terms of economic well-being in terms
 

4521

of flourishing of you as a human being
that could be seen

4524
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:24,159
that could be seen
 

4525
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,950
that could be seen
on some kind of metrics as a irrational

4526
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:26,960
on some kind of metrics as a irrational
 

4527
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,990
on some kind of metrics as a irrational
decision or suboptimal decision but

4528
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
decision or suboptimal decision but
 

4529
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,669
decision or suboptimal decision but
there is the

4530
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:31,679
there is the
 

4531
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:34,070

manifestation of love
 

4533
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,630
manifestation of love
could could be the optimal thing to do

4534
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:36,640
could could be the optimal thing to do
 

4535
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,229
could could be the optimal thing to do
there's a kind of saying

4536
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:38,239
there's a kind of saying
 

4537
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,189
there's a kind of saying
save one life save the world

4538

save one life save the world
 

4539
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,630
save one life save the world
this is the thing that doctors often

4540
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:42,640
this is the thing that doctors often
 

4541
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,550
this is the thing that doctors often
face which is like well it's considered

4542
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:44,560
face which is like well it's considered
 

4543
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,070
face which is like well it's considered
irrational because the profit model

4544
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:46,080
irrational because the profit model
 

4545
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,430
irrational because the profit model
doesn't include social good yes yeah so

4546
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:49,440
doesn't include social good yes yeah so
 

4547
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,030
doesn't include social good yes yeah so
food is social good then suddenly these

4548
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
food is social good then suddenly these
 

4549
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,310
food is social good then suddenly these
would be rational decisions this might

4550
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,320
would be rational decisions this might
 

4551
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,830
would be rational decisions this might
be difficult to

4552
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:53,840
be difficult to
 

4553
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,430
be difficult to
you know it requires a shift in our

4554
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:55,440
you know it requires a shift in our
 

4555
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,510
you know it requires a shift in our
thinking about profit

4556
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:57,520
thinking about profit
 

4557
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,149
thinking about profit
and might be difficult to measure

4558
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
and might be difficult to measure
 

4559
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,149
and might be difficult to measure
social good yes

4560
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
social good yes
 

4561
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,070
social good yes
but we're learning to measure a lot of

4562
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:04,080
but we're learning to measure a lot of
 

4563
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,750
but we're learning to measure a lot of
things like we're digitizing we're

4564
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:05,760
things like we're digitizing we're
 

4565
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,830
things like we're digitizing we're
actually you know quantifying

4566
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:08,840
actually you know quantifying
 

4567
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,189
actually you know quantifying
vision and stuff like where like we're

4568
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:11,199
vision and stuff like where like we're
 

4569
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:12,870
vision and stuff like where like we're
like

4570
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:12,880
like
 

4571
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,550
like
you know like you you go on facebook and

4572
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
you know like you you go on facebook and
 

4573
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,390
you know like you you go on facebook and
they can like facebook can pretty much

4574
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:16,400
they can like facebook can pretty much
 

4575
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,030
they can like facebook can pretty much
predict our behaviors like we we're

4576
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:19,040
predict our behaviors like we we're
 

4577
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,430

a surprising amount of things that seem

4578
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:21,440
a surprising amount of things that seem
 

4579
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,550
a surprising amount of things that seem
like

4580
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560
like
 

4581
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,950
like
uh mysterious consciousness

4582
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
uh mysterious consciousness
 

4583
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,030
uh mysterious consciousness
soul things have been quantified at this

4584
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,040
soul things have been quantified at this
 

4585
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,030
soul things have been quantified at this
point so surely we can quantify these

4586
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040
point so surely we can quantify these
 

4587
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,790
point so surely we can quantify these
other things yeah

4588
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:30,800
other things yeah
 

4589
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,270
other things yeah
um but as more and more of us are moving

4590
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
um but as more and more of us are moving
 

4591
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,110

it seems like you have all these
identities and you play with them

4604
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:47,440
identities and you play with them
 

4605
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,870
identities and you play with them
um

4606
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:48,880
um
 

4607
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,310
um
one of the cool things about the

4608
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:50,320
one of the cool things about the
 

4609
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,229
one of the cool things about the
internet it seems like you can play with

4610
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
internet it seems like you can play with
 

4611
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,310
internet it seems like you can play with
identities so as we move into the

4612
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
identities so as we move into the
 

4613
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,630
identities so as we move into the
digital world more and more maybe even

4614
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:56,640
digital world more and more maybe even
 

4615
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,270
digital world more and more maybe even
in the in the so-called metabours i mean

4616
01:15:59,270 --> 01:15:59,280
in the in the so-called metabours i mean
 

4617

i think that's temporary i think it's
temporary just like you know how all the

4632
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,520
temporary just like you know how all the
 

4633
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,030
temporary just like you know how all the

has all these ideas and they're already
figured out but whenever he is an expert

5766
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:07,440
figured out but whenever he is an expert
 

5767
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,990
figured out but whenever he is an expert
in anything see okay go ahead but when

01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,390
whether the thing it has converged
towards is the right answer so the the

5916
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
towards is the right answer so the the
 

5917
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,790

voices of the young people

5918
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:44,800
voices of the young people

is a society asking itself a question

5920
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,080
is a society asking itself a question
 

5921

is a society asking itself a question
the way i've been doing stuff for the

5922
01:37:49,669 --> 01:37:49,679
the way i've been doing stuff for the
 

5923
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:52,229
the way i've been doing stuff for the
past 50 years maybe it's the wrong way

5924
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:52,239
past 50 years maybe it's the wrong way
 

5925
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,070
past 50 years maybe it's the wrong way
and so you can have all of that within

5926
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:54,080
and so you can have all of that within
 

5927
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,470
and so you can have all of that within
one ai system i also think though that

5928
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:56,480
one ai system i also think though that
 

5929
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,030
one ai system i also think though that
we need to i mean actually that's

5930
01:37:59,030 --> 01:37:59,040
we need to i mean actually that's
 

5931
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,070
we need to i mean actually that's
actually really interesting and really

5932
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:00,080
actually really interesting and really
 

5933
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,669
actually really interesting and really
cool um

5934
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:01,679
cool um
 

5935
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,830
cool um
but i also think there's a fine balance

5936
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
but i also think there's a fine balance
 

5937
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,270
but i also think there's a fine balance
of

5938
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:05,280
of
 

5939
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:09,430
of
i think we maybe also overvalue

5940
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:09,440
i think we maybe also overvalue
 

5941
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,430
i think we maybe also overvalue
the idea that the old systems are always

5942
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:11,440
the idea that the old systems are always
 

5943
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,910
the idea that the old systems are always
bad and i think there are things that we

5944
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:13,920
bad and i think there are things that we
 

5945
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,750
bad and i think there are things that we
are perfecting and we might be

5946
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:15,760
are perfecting and we might be
 

5947
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,590
are perfecting and we might be
accidentally overthrowing things that we

5948
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:17,600
accidentally overthrowing things that we
 

5949
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,189
accidentally overthrowing things that we
actually have gotten to a good point

5950
01:38:19,189 --> 01:38:19,199
actually have gotten to a good point
 

5951
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,189
actually have gotten to a good point
yeah just because we are valuing we

5952

drastically
 

6225
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:50,709
drastically
like our algorithm bubbles are are

like our algorithm bubbles are are
 

6227
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:53,669
like our algorithm bubbles are are
creating many dialects and and of how

language is interpreted how language is
 

6231
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,590

used that's so fascinating and so we're

6232
01:42:57,590 --> 01:42:57,600
used that's so fascinating and so we're
 

6233
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,750
used that's so fascinating and so we're
like having these arguments that we do

6234
01:42:59,750 --> 01:42:59,760
like having these arguments that we do
 

6235
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,109
like having these arguments that we do
not need to be having and there's

6236
01:43:01,109 --> 01:43:01,119
not need to be having and there's
 

6237
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:02,470
not need to be having and there's
polarization that's happening that

6238
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:02,480
polarization that's happening that
 

6239
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,510
polarization that's happening that
doesn't need to be happening because

6240
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:03,520
doesn't need to be happening because
 

6241
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,830
doesn't need to be happening because
we've got these like algorithmically

6242
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:05,840
we've got these like algorithmically
 

6243
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,189
we've got these like algorithmically
created um

6244

01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:44,080
hitler
 

6711
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,270
hitler
like time and time again failed

6712
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:47,280
like time and time again failed
 

6713
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,830
like time and time again failed
and they were so close valkyrie mm-hmm

6714
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:49,840
and they were so close valkyrie mm-hmm
 

6715
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,589
and they were so close valkyrie mm-hmm
such a good

6716
01:50:51,589 --> 01:50:51,599
such a good
 

6717
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:54,229
such a good
and and then there is also also the role

6718
01:50:54,229 --> 01:50:54,239
and and then there is also also the role
 

6719
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:54,950
and and then there is also also the role
of

6720
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:54,960
of
 

6721
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,270
of
that's a really heavy burden which is

6722
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:57,280
that's a really heavy burden which is
 

6723
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,109
that's a really heavy burden which is
the from a geopolitical perspective the

6724
01:50:59,109 --> 01:50:59,119
the from a geopolitical perspective the
 

6725
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:01,350
the from a geopolitical perspective the
role of leaders to see evil before it

6726
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,360
role of leaders to see evil before it
 

6727
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,589
role of leaders to see evil before it
truly becomes evil to anticipate it and

6728
01:51:03,589 --> 01:51:03,599
truly becomes evil to anticipate it and
 

6729
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:05,350
truly becomes evil to anticipate it and
to stand up to evil

6730
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,360
to stand up to evil
 

6731
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,109
to stand up to evil
because evil was actually pretty rare in

6732
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,119
because evil was actually pretty rare in
 

6733
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,430
because evil was actually pretty rare in
this world at a skill that hitler was we

6734
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:09,440
this world at a skill that hitler was we
 

6735
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,910
this world at a skill that hitler was we
tend to you know in the modern discourse

6736
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:11,920
tend to you know in the modern discourse
 

6737
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,070
tend to you know in the modern discourse
kind of call people evil too quickly if

6738
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:14,080
kind of call people evil too quickly if
 

6739
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:14,870
kind of call people evil too quickly if
you

6740
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:14,880
you
 

6741
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,270
you
look at ancient history

6742
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:17,280
look at ancient history
 

6743
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,350
look at ancient history
like there was a ton of hitler's i i

6744
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,360
like there was a ton of hitler's i i
 

6745
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,430
like there was a ton of hitler's i i
actually think it's more the norm

6746
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:21,440
actually think it's more the norm
 

6747
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:22,550
actually think it's more the norm
than

6748
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:22,560
than
 

6749
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,629
than
like again going back to like my sort of

6750
01:51:24,629 --> 01:51:24,639
like again going back to like my sort of
 

6751
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:26,310
like again going back to like my sort of
intelligent design theory i think one of

6752
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:26,320
intelligent design theory i think one of
 

6753
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,310
intelligent design theory i think one of
the things we've been successfully doing

6754
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:28,320
the things we've been successfully doing
 

6755
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,790
the things we've been successfully doing
in our slow move from survival of the

6756
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:30,800
in our slow move from survival of the
 

6757
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:35,109
in our slow move from survival of the
finished to intelligent design is we've

6758
01:51:35,109 --> 01:51:35,119
finished to intelligent design is we've
 

6759
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:37,510
finished to intelligent design is we've
kind of been eradicating

6760
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
kind of been eradicating
 

6761
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,430
kind of been eradicating
like if you look like ancient assyria

6762
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:39,440
like if you look like ancient assyria
 

6763
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,790
like if you look like ancient assyria
and stuff like

6764

and stuff like
 

6765
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,709
and stuff like
that [\h__\h] was like brutal and just like

6766
01:51:42,709 --> 01:51:42,719
that [\h__\h] was like brutal and just like
 

6767

the heads on the like like brutal like
 

6769
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,669
the heads on the like like brutal like
like genghis khan just like genocide

6770
01:51:47,669 --> 01:51:47,679
like genghis khan just like genocide
 

6771
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:49,830
like genghis khan just like genocide
after genocide after genocide was like

6772
01:51:49,830 --> 01:51:49,840
after genocide after genocide was like
 

6773
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,669
after genocide after genocide was like
throwing plague bodies over the walls

6774
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:51,679
throwing plague bodies over the walls
 

6775
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,589
throwing plague bodies over the walls
and decimating whole cities or like like

6776
01:51:53,589 --> 01:51:53,599
and decimating whole cities or like like
 

6777
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:56,070
and decimating whole cities or like like
the muslim conquests of like damascus

6778
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:56,080
the muslim conquests of like damascus
 

6779
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,070
the muslim conquests of like damascus
and [\h__\h] just like people cities used to

6780
01:51:58,070 --> 01:51:58,080
and [\h__\h] just like people cities used to
 

6781
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,350
and [\h__\h] just like people cities used to
get leveled

6782
01:51:59,350 --> 01:51:59,360
get leveled
 

6783
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,830
get leveled
all the [\h__\h] time okay get into the

6784
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:01,840
all the [\h__\h] time okay get into the
 

6785
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,550
all the [\h__\h] time okay get into the
bronze age collapse it's basically there

6786
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:04,560
bronze age collapse it's basically there
 

6787
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,750
bronze age collapse it's basically there
was like almost like roman level like

6788
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:07,760
was like almost like roman level like
 

6789
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,589
was like almost like roman level like
society like there was like all over the

6790
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:09,599
society like there was like all over the
 

6791
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:11,350
society like there was like all over the
world like global trade like everything

6792
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:11,360
world like global trade like everything
 

6793
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:13,189
world like global trade like everything
was awesome through a mix of i think a

6794
01:52:13,189 --> 01:52:13,199
was awesome through a mix of i think a
 

6795
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:15,109
was awesome through a mix of i think a
bit of climate change and then the

6796
01:52:15,109 --> 01:52:15,119
bit of climate change and then the
 

6797
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:17,030
bit of climate change and then the
development of iron because basically

6798
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:17,040
development of iron because basically
 

6799
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,030
development of iron because basically
bronze could only come from this uh the

6800
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,040
bronze could only come from this uh the
 

6801
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,629
bronze could only come from this uh the
way to make bronze like everything had

6802
01:52:20,629 --> 01:52:20,639
way to make bronze like everything had
 

6803
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:22,709
way to make bronze like everything had
to be funneled through this one iranian

6804
01:52:22,709 --> 01:52:22,719
to be funneled through this one iranian
 

6805
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,270
to be funneled through this one iranian
um mine and so it's like there was just

6806
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:25,280
um mine and so it's like there was just
 

6807
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,669
um mine and so it's like there was just
this one supply chain and this is one of

6808
01:52:27,669 --> 01:52:27,679
this one supply chain and this is one of
 

6809
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:28,550
this one supply chain and this is one of
the things that makes me worried about

6810
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:28,560
the things that makes me worried about
 

6811
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,229
the things that makes me worried about
supply chains and why i think we need to

6812
01:52:30,229 --> 01:52:30,239
supply chains and why i think we need to
 

6813
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:31,910
supply chains and why i think we need to
be so thoughtful about

6814
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
be so thoughtful about
 

6815
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,589
be so thoughtful about
i think our biggest issue with society

6816
01:52:33,589 --> 01:52:33,599
i think our biggest issue with society
 

6817
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:34,790
i think our biggest issue with society
right now

6818
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:34,800
right now
 

6819
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,629
right now
like the thing that is most likely to go

6820
01:52:36,629 --> 01:52:36,639
like the thing that is most likely to go
 

6821
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,950
like the thing that is most likely to go
wrong is probably supply chain collapse

6822
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:38,960
wrong is probably supply chain collapse
 

6823
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,149
wrong is probably supply chain collapse
you know because war climate change

6824
01:52:40,149 --> 01:52:40,159
you know because war climate change
 

6825
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:41,350
you know because war climate change
whatever like anything that causes

6826
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
whatever like anything that causes
 

6827
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,030
whatever like anything that causes
supply chain collapse our population is

6828
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:43,040
supply chain collapse our population is
 

6829
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,030
supply chain collapse our population is
too big to handle that and like the

6830
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:45,040
too big to handle that and like the
 

6831
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,870
too big to handle that and like the
thing that seems to cause dark ages is

6832
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:46,880
thing that seems to cause dark ages is
 

6833
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,189
thing that seems to cause dark ages is
mass supply chain collapse but

6834
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:49,199
mass supply chain collapse but
 

6835
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,669
mass supply chain collapse but
the bronze age collapse happened um

6836
01:52:51,669 --> 01:52:51,679
the bronze age collapse happened um
 

6837
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:52,629
the bronze age collapse happened um
like

6838
01:52:52,629 --> 01:52:52,639
like
 

6839
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,709
like
uh it was sort of like this

6840
01:52:54,709 --> 01:52:54,719
uh it was sort of like this
 

6841
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:56,550
uh it was sort of like this
ancient collapse that happened where

6842
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:56,560
ancient collapse that happened where
 

6843
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,870
ancient collapse that happened where
like literally like um

6844
01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:58,880
like literally like um
 

6845
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,550
like literally like um
ancient egypt all these cities

6846
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:00,560
ancient egypt all these cities
 

6847
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,149
ancient egypt all these cities
everything just got like decimated

6848
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:02,159
everything just got like decimated
 

6849
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,310
everything just got like decimated
destroyed abandoned cities like hundreds

6850
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:04,320
destroyed abandoned cities like hundreds
 

6851
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,830
destroyed abandoned cities like hundreds
of them there was like a flourishing

6852
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:05,840
of them there was like a flourishing
 

6853
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,270
of them there was like a flourishing
society like we were almost coming to

6854
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:07,280
society like we were almost coming to
 

6855
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,950
society like we were almost coming to
modernity and everything got leveled and

6856
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:08,960
modernity and everything got leveled and
 

6857
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,709
modernity and everything got leveled and
they had this many dark ages but it was

6858
01:53:10,709 --> 01:53:10,719
they had this many dark ages but it was
 

6859
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:12,629
they had this many dark ages but it was
just like there's so little writing or

6860
01:53:12,629 --> 01:53:12,639
just like there's so little writing or
 

6861
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,229
just like there's so little writing or
recording from that time that like there

6862
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:14,239
recording from that time that like there
 

6863
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:15,430
recording from that time that like there
isn't a lot of information about the

6864
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:15,440
isn't a lot of information about the
 

6865
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,430
isn't a lot of information about the
bronze age collapse but it was basically

6866
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:17,440
bronze age collapse but it was basically
 

6867
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:20,550
bronze age collapse but it was basically
equivalent to like medieval the medieval

6868
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:20,560
equivalent to like medieval the medieval
 

6869
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:23,270
equivalent to like medieval the medieval
dark ages but it just happened

6870
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:23,280
dark ages but it just happened
 

6871
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,950
dark ages but it just happened
i don't know the years but like

6872
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
i don't know the years but like
 

6873
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,390
i don't know the years but like
thousands of years

6874
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:26,400
thousands of years
 

6875
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,990
thousands of years
earlier and then

6876
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:28,000
earlier and then
 

6877
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,189
earlier and then
um we sort of like recovered from the

6878
01:53:29,189 --> 01:53:29,199
um we sort of like recovered from the
 

6879
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:31,189
um we sort of like recovered from the
bronze age collapse

6880
01:53:31,189 --> 01:53:31,199
bronze age collapse
 

6881
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:34,310
bronze age collapse
empire re-emerged writing and trade and

6882
01:53:34,310 --> 01:53:34,320
empire re-emerged writing and trade and
 

6883
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,830
empire re-emerged writing and trade and
everything re-emerged

6884
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:35,840
everything re-emerged
 

6885
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:36,629
everything re-emerged
um

6886
01:53:36,629 --> 01:53:36,639
um
 

6887
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:38,629
um
you know and then we of course had the

6888
01:53:38,629 --> 01:53:38,639
you know and then we of course had the
 

6889
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,550
you know and then we of course had the
more contemporary dark ages

6890
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:40,560
more contemporary dark ages
 

6891
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,950
more contemporary dark ages
um and then over time we've designed

6892
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:42,960
um and then over time we've designed
 

6893
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,189
um and then over time we've designed
mechanism to lessen and lessen the

6894
01:53:45,189 --> 01:53:45,199
mechanism to lessen and lessen the
 

6895
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:48,229
mechanism to lessen and lessen the
capability for the destructive

6896
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:48,239
capability for the destructive
 

6897
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:50,390
capability for the destructive
uh there's more centers to emerge

6898
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:50,400
uh there's more centers to emerge
 

6899
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,790
uh there's more centers to emerge
there's more recording about the the

6900
01:53:52,790 --> 01:53:52,800
there's more recording about the the
 

6901
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,390
there's more recording about the the
more contemporary dark ages so i think

6902
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:54,400
more contemporary dark ages so i think
 

6903
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,589
more contemporary dark ages so i think
we have like a better understanding of

6904
01:53:55,589 --> 01:53:55,599
we have like a better understanding of
 

6905
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:56,790
we have like a better understanding of
how to avoid it but i still think we're

6906
01:53:56,790 --> 01:53:56,800
how to avoid it but i still think we're
 

6907
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,310
how to avoid it but i still think we're
at high high risk for it i think that's

6908
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
at high high risk for it i think that's
 

6909
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,709
at high high risk for it i think that's
one of the big the big risks right so

6910
01:54:00,709 --> 01:54:00,719
one of the big the big risks right so
 

6911
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:03,270
one of the big the big risks right so
the natural state of being for humans is

6912
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:03,280
the natural state of being for humans is
 

6913
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,870
the natural state of being for humans is
for there to be a lot of hitler's we

6914
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:04,880
for there to be a lot of hitler's we
 

6915
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,629
for there to be a lot of hitler's we
just gotten really good

6916
01:54:06,629 --> 01:54:06,639
just gotten really good
 

6917
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:09,830
just gotten really good
at making it hard for them to emerge

6918
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:09,840
at making it hard for them to emerge
 

6919
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,550
at making it hard for them to emerge
we've gotten better at collaboration yes

6920
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:12,560
we've gotten better at collaboration yes
 

6921
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,629
we've gotten better at collaboration yes
and resisting the power

6922
01:54:14,629 --> 01:54:14,639
and resisting the power
 

6923
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:16,709
and resisting the power
like authoritarians to come to power

6924
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:16,719
like authoritarians to come to power
 

6925
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:18,390
like authoritarians to come to power
we're trying to go country by country

6926
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:18,400
we're trying to go country by country
 

6927
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,990
we're trying to go country by country
like we're moving past this we're kind

6928
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:20,000
like we're moving past this we're kind
 

6929
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,390
like we're moving past this we're kind
of like slowly incrementally like moving

6930
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:22,400
of like slowly incrementally like moving
 

6931
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,709
of like slowly incrementally like moving
like moving towards like

6932
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:24,719
like moving towards like
 

6933
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:25,830
like moving towards like
not

scary old-school

6936
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:27,520
scary old-school
 

6937
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:28,310

war
 

6939
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:31,270
war
stuff and i think seeing it happen in

6940
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:31,280
stuff and i think seeing it happen in
 

6941
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,629
stuff and i think seeing it happen in
some of the countries that at least

6942
01:54:32,629 --> 01:54:32,639
some of the countries that at least
 

6943
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,950
some of the countries that at least
nominally are like

6944
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:34,960
nominally are like
 

6945
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,790
nominally are like
supposed to have moved past that that's

6946
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:36,800
supposed to have moved past that that's
 

6947
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,470
supposed to have moved past that that's
scary because it reminds us that it can

6948
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:38,480
scary because it reminds us that it can
 

6949
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,669
scary because it reminds us that it can
happen

happen
 

6951
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:42,709
happen
like in in in the places that have made

moved past that and possibly at a

6956
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:48,239
moved past that and possibly at a
 

6957
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:50,310
moved past that and possibly at a
civilization level like you said supply

6958
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:50,320
civilization level like you said supply

chain collapse

6960
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:51,520
chain collapse
 

6961
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,229
chain collapse
might make people resource constrained

6962
01:54:54,229 --> 01:54:54,239
might make people resource constrained
 

6963
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:55,189
might make people resource constrained
might

might
 

6965
01:54:55,199 --> 01:54:57,030
might
make people desperate

and drag us right back in i mean supply

6970
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:01,920
and drag us right back in i mean supply
 

6971
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,709

chain collapse is how like the ultimate

6972
01:55:04,709 --> 01:55:04,719
chain collapse is how like the ultimate
 

6973
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:07,109
chain collapse is how like the ultimate
thing that caused the middle ages was

6974
01:55:07,109 --> 01:55:07,119
thing that caused the middle ages was
 

6975
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:09,270
thing that caused the middle ages was
supply chain collapse it's like people

6976
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:09,280
supply chain collapse it's like people
 

6977
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,430
supply chain collapse it's like people
because people were reliant on a certain

6978
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:11,440
because people were reliant on a certain
 

6979
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,109
because people were reliant on a certain
level of technology like people like you

6980
01:55:13,109 --> 01:55:13,119
level of technology like people like you
 

6981
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:15,189
level of technology like people like you
look at like britain like they had glass

6982
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:15,199
look at like britain like they had glass
 

6983
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:17,990
look at like britain like they had glass
like people had um aqueducts people had

6984
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:18,000
like people had um aqueducts people had
 

6985
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:18,790
like people had um aqueducts people had
like

6986
01:55:18,790 --> 01:55:18,800
like
 

6987
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,629
like
indoor heating and cooling and like

6988
01:55:20,629 --> 01:55:20,639
indoor heating and cooling and like
 

6989
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,229
indoor heating and cooling and like
running water and like

6990
01:55:22,229 --> 01:55:22,239
running water and like
 

6991
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,350
running water and like
buy food

6992
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:23,360
buy food
 

6993
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,270
buy food
from all over the world and trade in

6994
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:25,280
from all over the world and trade in
 

6995
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,030
from all over the world and trade in
markets like people didn't know how to

6996
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:27,040
markets like people didn't know how to
 

6997
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,870
markets like people didn't know how to
hunt and forage and gather and so we're

6998
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:28,880
hunt and forage and gather and so we're
 

6999
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,149
hunt and forage and gather and so we're
in a similar situation we are not

7000
01:55:30,149 --> 01:55:30,159
in a similar situation we are not
 

7001
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:31,750
in a similar situation we are not
educated enough

7002
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:31,760
educated enough
 

7003
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,149
educated enough
to survive without technology so if we

7004
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:34,159
to survive without technology so if we
 

7005
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:35,510
to survive without technology so if we
have a supply chain collapse that like

7006
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:35,520
have a supply chain collapse that like
 

7007
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:36,629
have a supply chain collapse that like
limits our

7008
01:55:36,629 --> 01:55:36,639
limits our
 

7009
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:38,870
limits our
access to technology there will be like

7010
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:38,880
access to technology there will be like
 

7011
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,830
access to technology there will be like
massive starvation and violence and and

7012
01:55:41,830 --> 01:55:41,840
massive starvation and violence and and
 

7013
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:44,070
massive starvation and violence and and
displacement and war like

7014
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,080
displacement and war like
 

7015
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,510
displacement and war like
you know

7016
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:45,520
you know
 

7017
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:47,669
you know
it's also it like yeah in my opinion

7018
01:55:47,669 --> 01:55:47,679
it's also it like yeah in my opinion
 

7019
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:50,390
it's also it like yeah in my opinion
it's like the primary marker of of

7020
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:50,400
it's like the primary marker of of
 

7021
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,510
it's like the primary marker of of
dark

7022
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:51,520
dark
 

7023
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,350
dark
like what a dark ages well technology is

7024
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:53,360
like what a dark ages well technology is
 

7025
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,589
like what a dark ages well technology is
kind of enabling us to be more resilient

7026
01:55:55,589 --> 01:55:55,599
kind of enabling us to be more resilient
 

7027
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,149
kind of enabling us to be more resilient
uh in terms of supply chain in terms of

uh in terms of supply chain in terms of
 

7029
01:55:58,159 --> 01:56:00,390
uh in terms of supply chain in terms of

01:56:20,709 --> 01:56:20,719
one what do you think the previous
 

7053
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:22,950
one what do you think the previous
technologies i mean may have even been

7054
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:22,960
technologies i mean may have even been
 

7055
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,390
technologies i mean may have even been
more profound and moved us to a certain

7056
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:24,400
more profound and moved us to a certain
 

7057
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,149
more profound and moved us to a certain
degree but i think the computers are

7058
01:56:26,149 --> 01:56:26,159
degree but i think the computers are
 

7059
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:27,750
degree but i think the computers are
what make us homotech no i think this is

7060
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:27,760
what make us homotech no i think this is
 

7061
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:30,629
what make us homotech no i think this is
what it's a brain augmentation

7062
01:56:30,629 --> 01:56:30,639
what it's a brain augmentation
 

7063
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:33,189
what it's a brain augmentation
and and so it like allows for actual

7064
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:33,199
and and so it like allows for actual
 

7065
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:34,870
and and so it like allows for actual
evolution like the computers accelerate

7066
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:34,880
evolution like the computers accelerate
 

7067
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,229
evolution like the computers accelerate
the degree to which all the other

7068
01:56:36,229 --> 01:56:36,239
the degree to which all the other
 

7069
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,470
the degree to which all the other
technologies can also be accelerated

7070
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:38,480
technologies can also be accelerated
 

7071
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,149

would you classify yourself as a homo

7072
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:40,159
would you classify yourself as a homo
 

7073
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:42,149
would you classify yourself as a homo
sapien or a homo tech definitely homotec

7074
01:56:42,149 --> 01:56:42,159
sapien or a homo tech definitely homotec
 

7075
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:42,870
sapien or a homo tech definitely homotec
now

7076
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:42,880
now
 

7077
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,149
now
so i think we're all

7078
01:56:44,149 --> 01:56:44,159
so i think we're all
 

7079
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:46,149
so i think we're all
you're you're one of the earliest of the

you're you're one of the earliest of the
 

7081
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:49,830
you're you're one of the earliest of the
species i think most of us are like i i

7082
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:49,840
species i think most of us are like i i
 

7083
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,990
species i think most of us are like i i
like as i said like i think if you

7084
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,000
like as i said like i think if you
 

7085
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,669
like as i said like i think if you
um

7086
01:56:53,669 --> 01:56:53,679
um
 

7087
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:54,629
um
like

7088
01:56:54,629 --> 01:56:54,639
like
 

7089
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:58,149
like
looked at brain scans of us versus um

7090
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
looked at brain scans of us versus um
 

7091
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:00,149
looked at brain scans of us versus um
humans a hundred years ago it would look

7092
01:57:00,149 --> 01:57:00,159
humans a hundred years ago it would look
 

7093
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:01,350
humans a hundred years ago it would look
very different i think we are

7094
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:01,360
very different i think we are
 

7095
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:02,870
very different i think we are
physiologically

7096
01:57:02,870 --> 01:57:02,880
physiologically
 

7097
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,790
physiologically
different just even the interaction with

7098
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:04,800
different just even the interaction with
 

7099
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,950
different just even the interaction with
the devices has changed our brain well

7100
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:06,960
the devices has changed our brain well
 

7101
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,030
the devices has changed our brain well
and if you look at um a lot of studies

7102
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,040
and if you look at um a lot of studies
 

7103
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,109
and if you look at um a lot of studies
are coming out to show that like

7104
01:57:11,109 --> 01:57:11,119
are coming out to show that like
 

7105
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:13,109
are coming out to show that like
there's a degree of inherited memory so

7106
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:13,119
there's a degree of inherited memory so
 

7107
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:14,870
there's a degree of inherited memory so
some of these physiological changes in

7108
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:14,880
some of these physiological changes in
 

7109
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,550
some of these physiological changes in
theory should be we should be passing

7110
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:16,560
theory should be we should be passing
 

7111
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,990
theory should be we should be passing
them on

7112
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:18,000
them on
 

7113
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,270
them on
so like

7114
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:19,280
so like
 

7115
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,510
so like
that's you know that's not like a

7116
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:21,520
that's you know that's not like a
 

7117
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,030
that's you know that's not like a
an instance of physiological change

7118
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:23,040
an instance of physiological change
 

7119
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,709
an instance of physiological change
that's going to fizzle out in theory

7120
01:57:24,709 --> 01:57:24,719
that's going to fizzle out in theory
 

7121
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:26,390
that's going to fizzle out in theory
that should progress

7122
01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:26,400
that should progress
 

7123
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,950
that should progress

teaching creativity and i think

7150
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:57,040
teaching creativity and i think
 

7151
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:59,109

says says something like um
 

7367
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:38,870
says says something like um
uh what if our consciousness

7368
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:38,880
uh what if our consciousness
 

7369
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:40,950
uh what if our consciousness
like right now like

7370
02:01:40,950 --> 02:01:40,960
like right now like
 

7371
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:41,830
like right now like
this

7372
02:01:41,830 --> 02:01:41,840
this
 

7373
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,589
this
is the universe waking up like what if

7374
02:01:43,589 --> 02:01:43,599
is the universe waking up like what if
 

7375
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:45,589
is the universe waking up like what if
instead of discovering the universe this

7376
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
instead of discovering the universe this
 

7377
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:47,270
instead of discovering the universe this
is the universe

7378
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:47,280
is the universe
 

7379
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,270
is the universe
like this is the evolution

7380
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,280
like this is the evolution
 

7381
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,430
like this is the evolution
of the little literal universe herself

7382
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:51,440
of the little literal universe herself
 

7383
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,550
of the little literal universe herself
like we are not separate from the

7384
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:52,560
like we are not separate from the
 

7385
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:53,990
like we are not separate from the
universe like this is the universe

7386
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,000
universe like this is the universe
 

7387
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,910
universe like this is the universe
waking up this is the universe seeing

7388
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:55,920
waking up this is the universe seeing
 

7389
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,229
waking up this is the universe seeing
herself for the first time like this is

7390
02:01:58,229 --> 02:01:58,239
herself for the first time like this is
 

7391
02:01:58,239 --> 02:02:00,709
herself for the first time like this is
um the universe becoming conscious yeah

7392
02:02:00,709 --> 02:02:00,719
um the universe becoming conscious yeah
 

7393
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:02,390
um the universe becoming conscious yeah
first time and we're part of that yeah

7394
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:02,400
first time and we're part of that yeah
 

7395
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,470
first time and we're part of that yeah
because it's like we aren't separate

7396
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:04,480
because it's like we aren't separate
 

7397
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,149
because it's like we aren't separate
from the universe like like this could

7398
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:06,159
from the universe like like this could
 

7399
02:02:06,159 --> 02:02:08,629
from the universe like like this could
be of like an incredibly sacred moment

7400
02:02:08,629 --> 02:02:08,639
be of like an incredibly sacred moment
 

7401
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:09,910
be of like an incredibly sacred moment
and maybe like social media and all

7402
02:02:09,910 --> 02:02:09,920
and maybe like social media and all
 

7403
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:11,750
and maybe like social media and all
these things the the stuff where we're

7404
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:11,760
these things the the stuff where we're
 

7405
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,910
these things the the stuff where we're
all getting connected together like

7406
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:13,920
all getting connected together like
 

7407
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:15,990
all getting connected together like
maybe this these are the neurons

7408
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:16,000
maybe this these are the neurons
 

7409
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,470
maybe this these are the neurons
connecting of the like collective super

7410
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:18,480
connecting of the like collective super
 

7411
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:19,750
connecting of the like collective super
intelligence

7412
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:19,760
intelligence
 

7413
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,270
intelligence
that is

7414
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:21,280
that is
 

7415
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,669
that is
you know waking up the the yeah like

7416
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:23,679
you know waking up the the yeah like
 

7417
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:25,910
you know waking up the the yeah like
like you know it's like maybe instead of

7418
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:25,920
like you know it's like maybe instead of
 

7419
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,070
like you know it's like maybe instead of
something cynical or maybe if there's

7420
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:28,080
something cynical or maybe if there's
 

7421
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,990
something cynical or maybe if there's
something to discover like maybe this is

7422
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:30,000
something to discover like maybe this is
 

7423
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,950
something to discover like maybe this is
just

7424
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:30,960
just
 

7425
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,310
just
you know we're a blastocyst of of like

7426
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:34,320
you know we're a blastocyst of of like
 

7427
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:35,910
you know we're a blastocyst of of like
some incredible

7428
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:35,920
some incredible
 

7429
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,229
some incredible
kind of consciousness

7430
02:02:38,229 --> 02:02:38,239
kind of consciousness
 

7431
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:40,149
kind of consciousness
or being and just like in the first

7432
02:02:40,149 --> 02:02:40,159
or being and just like in the first
 

7433
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:42,070
or being and just like in the first
three years of life or for human

7434
02:02:42,070 --> 02:02:42,080
three years of life or for human
 

7435
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,830
three years of life or for human
children we'll forget about all the

7436
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:43,840
children we'll forget about all the
 

7437
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,350
children we'll forget about all the
suffering that we're going through now i

7438
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:45,360
suffering that we're going through now i
 

7439
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,550
suffering that we're going through now i
think we'll probably forget about this i

7440
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:46,560
think we'll probably forget about this i
 

7441
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,830
think we'll probably forget about this i
mean probably

7442
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:47,840
mean probably
 

7443
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,390
mean probably
you know artificial intelligence

7444
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,400
you know artificial intelligence
 

7445
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,629
you know artificial intelligence
will eventually render us obsolete i

7446
02:02:52,629 --> 02:02:52,639
will eventually render us obsolete i
 

7447
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:54,470
will eventually render us obsolete i
don't think they'll do it in a

7448
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:54,480
don't think they'll do it in a
 

7449
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,709
don't think they'll do it in a
malicious way but i think probably we

7450
02:02:56,709 --> 02:02:56,719
malicious way but i think probably we
 

7451
02:02:56,719 --> 02:02:59,270
malicious way but i think probably we
are very weak the sun is expanding like

7452
02:02:59,270 --> 02:02:59,280
are very weak the sun is expanding like
 

7453
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,030
are very weak the sun is expanding like
i don't know like hopefully we can get

7454
02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:01,040
i don't know like hopefully we can get
 

7455
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,910
i don't know like hopefully we can get
to mars but like we're pretty vulnerable

7456
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:03,920
to mars but like we're pretty vulnerable
 

7457
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:06,629
to mars but like we're pretty vulnerable
and i i you know like

7458
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:06,639
and i i you know like
 

7459
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:08,149
and i i you know like
i think we can coexist for a long time

7460
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
i think we can coexist for a long time
 

7461
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,229
i think we can coexist for a long time
with ai and we can also probably make

7462
02:03:10,229 --> 02:03:10,239
with ai and we can also probably make
 

7463
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:12,310
with ai and we can also probably make
ourselves less vulnerable but

7464
02:03:12,310 --> 02:03:12,320
ourselves less vulnerable but
 

7465
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:15,589
ourselves less vulnerable but
you know i just think um

7466
02:03:15,589 --> 02:03:15,599
you know i just think um
 

7467
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:18,310
you know i just think um
consciousness sentence self-awareness

7468
02:03:18,310 --> 02:03:18,320
consciousness sentence self-awareness
 

7469
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,270
consciousness sentence self-awareness
like

7470
02:03:19,270 --> 02:03:19,280
like
 

7471
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:20,709
like
i think this might be the single

7472
02:03:20,709 --> 02:03:20,719
i think this might be the single
 

7473
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:21,830
i think this might be the single
greatest

7474
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:21,840
greatest
 

7475
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,510
greatest

like moment in
 

7477
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,350
like moment in
evolution ever and like maybe this is

7478
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:27,360
evolution ever and like maybe this is
 

7479
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,109
evolution ever and like maybe this is
you know

7480
02:03:29,109 --> 02:03:29,119
you know
 

7481
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:30,629
you know
the big like the

the big like the
 

7483
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:33,030
the big like the
true beginning of of life and we're just

7484
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:33,040
true beginning of of life and we're just
 

7485
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:34,629

organisms of something amazing the
 

7491
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,790
organisms of something amazing the
universe awakens and this is this is it
