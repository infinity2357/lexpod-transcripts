what do you think they would notice

234
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
what do you think they would notice
 

235
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,589
what do you think they would notice
so there's road networks there's all

236
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
so there's road networks there's all
 

237
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,670
so there's road networks there's all
kinds of networks there's uh there's

kinds of networks there's uh there's
 

239
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,830
kinds of networks there's uh there's
lights that keep popping up cities

240
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
lights that keep popping up cities
 

241
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,189

bringing up like from an alien

242
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
bringing up like from an alien

perspective you're observing what i'm

244
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
perspective you're observing what i'm
 

245
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,070

going to tell you is you have this

246
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
going to tell you is you have this
 

247
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,390
going to tell you is you have this
contrast of incredible

248
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
contrast of incredible
 

249
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,070
contrast of incredible
development of technology but then you

250
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
development of technology but then you
 

251
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,950
development of technology but then you
see some of the things that are

252
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
see some of the things that are
 

253
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,430
see some of the things that are
happening right now which is probably

254
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
happening right now which is probably
 

255
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,590
happening right now which is probably
you would not expect them to happen uh

256
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
you would not expect them to happen uh
 

257
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,510
you would not expect them to happen uh
on the 21st century just what happened

258
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
on the 21st century just what happened
 

259
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,870
on the 21st century just what happened
in in ukraine so i think uh that that

260
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
in in ukraine so i think uh that that
 

261
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,469
in in ukraine so i think uh that that
will be a more puzzling question for the

262
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
will be a more puzzling question for the
 

263
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,710
will be a more puzzling question for the
aliens i would imagine the new

264
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
aliens i would imagine the new
 

265
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,790
aliens i would imagine the new
technology is kind of impressive

266
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
technology is kind of impressive
 

267
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,390
technology is kind of impressive
actually that might not be so puzzling

268
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
actually that might not be so puzzling
 

269
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,909
actually that might not be so puzzling
because that's just human nature

270
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
because that's just human nature
 

271
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,749
because that's just human nature
revealing itself as it has throughout

272
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
revealing itself as it has throughout
 

273
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,710
revealing itself as it has throughout
human history that's correct

274
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
human history that's correct
 

275
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,790
human history that's correct
let's talk about wireless communication

276
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
let's talk about wireless communication
 

277
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,030
let's talk about wireless communication
so qualcomm was instrumental in

278
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
so qualcomm was instrumental in
 

279
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,830
so qualcomm was instrumental in
developing 5g now you were with qualcomm

280
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
developing 5g now you were with qualcomm
 

281
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,150
developing 5g now you were with qualcomm
since the early days the good old 90s

282
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
since the early days the good old 90s
 

283
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,830
since the early days the good old 90s
with the 2g

284
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
with the 2g
 

285
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,350
with the 2g
but what is 5g including sub 6 gigahertz

286
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
but what is 5g including sub 6 gigahertz
 

287
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,390
but what is 5g including sub 6 gigahertz
5g and millimeter wave 5g how does it

288
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
5g and millimeter wave 5g how does it
 

289
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,670
5g and millimeter wave 5g how does it
work and

290
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
work and
 

291
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,430
work and
maybe the most important question is how

292
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
maybe the most important question is how
 

293
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,870
maybe the most important question is how
will it change the world in the coming

294
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
will it change the world in the coming
 

295
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,830
will it change the world in the coming
years

296
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
years
 

297
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,790
years
when we set ourselves to develop 5g and

298
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
when we set ourselves to develop 5g and
 

299
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,469
when we set ourselves to develop 5g and
you know we look at this every

300
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
you know we look at this every
 

301
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,870
you know we look at this every
generation of technology had a problem

302
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
generation of technology had a problem
 

303
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,670
generation of technology had a problem
to be solved right so you mentioned 2g

304
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
to be solved right so you mentioned 2g
 

305
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,070
to be solved right so you mentioned 2g
to g challenge the challenge of cdma was

306
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
to g challenge the challenge of cdma was
 

307
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,469
to g challenge the challenge of cdma was
can we give every person on earth a cell

308
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
can we give every person on earth a cell
 

309
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,310
can we give every person on earth a cell
phone that was can you get to a

310
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
phone that was can you get to a
 

311
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,550
phone that was can you get to a
technology that you can

312

3g was about the ability to connect that

318
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
3g was about the ability to connect that
 

319
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,270
3g was about the ability to connect that
to the internet i think 4g was broadband

320
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
to the internet i think 4g was broadband
 

321
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,749
to the internet i think 4g was broadband
and with 4g was about have the ability

322
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
and with 4g was about have the ability
 

323
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,029
and with 4g was about have the ability
for you to have a computer in the palm

324
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
for you to have a computer in the palm
 

325
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,430
for you to have a computer in the palm
of your hand we just talked about that

326
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
of your hand we just talked about that
 

327
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,870
of your hand we just talked about that
5g the challenge was a little bit

328
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
5g the challenge was a little bit
 

329
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,029
5g the challenge was a little bit
different is how do we build a

330
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
different is how do we build a
 

331
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,350
different is how do we build a
technology for a society that is going

332
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
technology for a society that is going
 

333
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,150
technology for a society that is going
to be 100 connected to the cloud how do

334
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
to be 100 connected to the cloud how do
 

335
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,390
to be 100 connected to the cloud how do
we provide the technology that is going

336
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
we provide the technology that is going
 

337
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,110
we provide the technology that is going
to be the last mile connectivity for

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
to be the last mile connectivity for
 

339
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,150
to be the last mile connectivity for
everything

everything
 

341
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,670
everything
so 5g has it's basically been designed

342
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
so 5g has it's basically been designed
 

343
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,430
so 5g has it's basically been designed
to eliminate all issues with data

344
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
to eliminate all issues with data
 

345
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,110
to eliminate all issues with data

00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
to have access to broadband so deal with
 

353
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,990
to have access to broadband so deal with
congestion deal with the fact that not

354
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
congestion deal with the fact that not
 

355
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,150
congestion deal with the fact that not
only people but billions of things need

356
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
only people but billions of things need
 

357
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,990
only people but billions of things need
to be connected

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
to be connected
 

359
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,309
to be connected
create a technology that for the first

00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
create a technology that for the first
 

361
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,710
create a technology that for the first
time in wireless you could deliver

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
of that
 

375
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,830
of that
is provide this fabric that will allow

376
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
is provide this fabric that will allow
 

377
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,670
is provide this fabric that will allow
us as a society

to look at things that are not connected

380
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
to look at things that are not connected
 

381
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,589
to look at things that are not connected
and say that's the exception that's why

382
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
and say that's the exception that's why
 

383
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,469
and say that's the exception that's why
we made uh comparison in the early days

384
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
we made uh comparison in the early days
 

385
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,830
we made uh comparison in the early days
of 5g that that's going to be like

386
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
of 5g that that's going to be like
 

387
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,670
of 5g that that's going to be like
electricity right now you don't have a

388
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
electricity right now you don't have a
 

389
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,309
electricity right now you don't have a
discussion about what is the use cases

390
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
discussion about what is the use cases
 

391
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,749
discussion about what is the use cases
for electricity you don't talk about

392
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
for electricity you don't talk about
 

393
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,909
for electricity you don't talk about
that anymore you just assume it's there

394
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
that anymore you just assume it's there
 

395
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,510
that anymore you just assume it's there
and that's how we're thinking about

396
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
and that's how we're thinking about
 

397
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,589
and that's how we're thinking about
everything connected to the cloud that's

398
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
everything connected to the cloud that's
 

399
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,950
everything connected to the cloud that's
what 5g is and that's the role of 5g

400
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
what 5g is and that's the role of 5g
 

401
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,870
what 5g is and that's the role of 5g
so first of all everything connected to

402
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
so first of all everything connected to
 

403
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,390
so first of all everything connected to
the cloud is interesting because the

404
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
the cloud is interesting because the
 

405
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,150
the cloud is interesting because the
space of everything is constantly

406
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
space of everything is constantly
 

407
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,629
space of everything is constantly
increasing that isn't correct you know i

408
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
increasing that isn't correct you know i
 

409
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,550
increasing that isn't correct you know i
don't think the refrigerator over there

410
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
don't think the refrigerator over there
 

411
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,830
don't think the refrigerator over there
it looks kind of smart but i don't think

412
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
it looks kind of smart but i don't think
 

413
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,749
it looks kind of smart but i don't think
it's connected yet

414
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
it's connected yet
 

415
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,749
it's connected yet
uh to the cloud so this includes

416
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
uh to the cloud so this includes
 

417
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,350
uh to the cloud so this includes
internet of things

what is the full space of everything

420
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
what is the full space of everything
 

421
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,390
what is the full space of everything
the full space of everything is it's uh

the full space of everything is it's uh
 

423
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,390
the full space of everything is it's uh
maybe going back to

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
maybe going back to
 

425
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,309
maybe going back to
where you start defining qualcomm

where you start defining qualcomm
 

427
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,309
where you start defining qualcomm
qualcomm is about communications and

to everything and
 

481
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,949
to everything and
i think that's one of the largest

482
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
i think that's one of the largest
 

483
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,550
i think that's one of the largest
addressable markets we have for

addressable markets we have for
 

485
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,829
addressable markets we have for
technology because you can't really

00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
technology because you can't really
 

487
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,269
technology because you can't really
define everything

488
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
define everything
 

489
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,030
define everything
right exactly it's a nice market because

490
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
right exactly it's a nice market because
 

491
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,470
right exactly it's a nice market because
it keeps growing potentially

492
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
it keeps growing potentially
 

493
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,509
it keeps growing potentially
exponentially in speed um

494
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
exponentially in speed um
 

495
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,990
exponentially in speed um
what about coverage so how are we doing

496
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
what about coverage so how are we doing
 

497
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,710
what about coverage so how are we doing
on the everything part so you know there

498
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
on the everything part so you know there
 

499
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,509
on the everything part so you know there
is like i mentioned sub six gigahertz 5g

500
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
is like i mentioned sub six gigahertz 5g
 

501
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,949
is like i mentioned sub six gigahertz 5g
and there's a millimeter wave 5g so not

502
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
and there's a millimeter wave 5g so not
 

503
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,030
and there's a millimeter wave 5g so not
all 5g is made the same so there's a

504
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
all 5g is made the same so there's a
 

505
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,350
all 5g is made the same so there's a
speed there's a bandwidth thing

506
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
speed there's a bandwidth thing
 

507
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,030
speed there's a bandwidth thing
and then there's coverage how many

508
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
and then there's coverage how many
 

509
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,590
and then there's coverage how many
people get to enjoy

510
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
people get to enjoy
 

511
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,509
people get to enjoy
today and how does the progress in the

512
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
today and how does the progress in the
 

513
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,389
today and how does the progress in the
next 5 10 20 30 50 years you think looks

514
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
next 5 10 20 30 50 years you think looks
 

515
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,389
next 5 10 20 30 50 years you think looks
like in terms of coverage great topic

516
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
like in terms of coverage great topic
 

517
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,030
like in terms of coverage great topic
conversation so let's talk about this

518
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
conversation so let's talk about this
 

519
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,110
conversation so let's talk about this
when i meet with regulators

520
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
when i meet with regulators
 

521
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,550
when i meet with regulators
across the globe

522
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
across the globe
 

523
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,310
across the globe
i i tell them

524
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
i i tell them
 

525
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,949
i i tell them
resistance is futile allocate every

526
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
resistance is futile allocate every
 

527
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,590
resistance is futile allocate every
spectrum to wireless every spectrum

528
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
spectrum to wireless every spectrum
 

529
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,670
spectrum to wireless every spectrum
needs to be allocated to wireless the

530
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
needs to be allocated to wireless the
 

531
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,070
needs to be allocated to wireless the
reality is when we start moving from

532
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
reality is when we start moving from
 

533
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,509
reality is when we start moving from
cdma to ofdma

534
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
cdma to ofdma
 

535
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,030
cdma to ofdma
we knew that

536
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
we knew that
 

537
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,829
we knew that
there's this industry has done a lot to

538
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
there's this industry has done a lot to
 

539
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,870
there's this industry has done a lot to
get more bits per hertz but the reality

540
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
get more bits per hertz but the reality
 

541
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,670
get more bits per hertz but the reality
is

542
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
is
 

543
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,269
is
uh the massive amount of improvements

544
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
uh the massive amount of improvements
 

545
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,949
uh the massive amount of improvements
that is required

546
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
that is required
 

547
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,470
that is required
in capacity and in speed uh you need

548
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
in capacity and in speed uh you need
 

549
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,110
in capacity and in speed uh you need
more spectrum you know there's there's

550
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
more spectrum you know there's there's
 

551
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,070
more spectrum you know there's there's
not so much we can rely on more bits per

552
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
not so much we can rely on more bits per
 

553
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,710
not so much we can rely on more bits per
hertz you just need more spectrum and if

554
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
hertz you just need more spectrum and if
 

555
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,230
hertz you just need more spectrum and if
you look for example what carriers since

556
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
you look for example what carriers since
 

557
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,590
you look for example what carriers since
the 2g

558
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
the 2g
 

559
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,829
the 2g
era they participate in different

560
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
era they participate in different
 

561
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,910
era they participate in different
license and auctions and every spectrum

562
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
license and auctions and every spectrum
 

563
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,069
license and auctions and every spectrum
they accumulated from 2g or 3g or 4g

564
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
they accumulated from 2g or 3g or 4g
 

565
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,710
they accumulated from 2g or 3g or 4g
all of that you may be able to get one

566
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
all of that you may be able to get one
 

567
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,710
all of that you may be able to get one
or two channels max of sub six uh which

568
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
or two channels max of sub six uh which
 

569
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,389
or two channels max of sub six uh which
is a channel is about 100 megahertz or

570
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
is a channel is about 100 megahertz or
 

571
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,350
is a channel is about 100 megahertz or
200 megahertz and that's it so

572
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
200 megahertz and that's it so
 

573
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,509
200 megahertz and that's it so
we we need more spectrum so 5g has been

574
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
we we need more spectrum so 5g has been
 

575
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,230
we we need more spectrum so 5g has been
designed to work across every spectrum

576
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
designed to work across every spectrum
 

577
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,190
designed to work across every spectrum
from the low frequency bands that's we

578
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
from the low frequency bands that's we
 

579
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,949
from the low frequency bands that's we
call the sub six

580
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
call the sub six
 

581
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,949
call the sub six
but you needed more you needed to go to

582
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
but you needed more you needed to go to
 

583
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,430
but you needed more you needed to go to
the millimeter wave so that's why

584
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
the millimeter wave so that's why
 

585
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,350
the millimeter wave so that's why
five 5g is a technology that you can

586
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
five 5g is a technology that you can
 

587
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,910
five 5g is a technology that you can
deploy from 450 megahertz as an example

588
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
deploy from 450 megahertz as an example
 

589
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,710
deploy from 450 megahertz as an example
or 600 or 700

590
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
or 600 or 700
 

591
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,630
or 600 or 700
all the way to in the 42

592
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
all the way to in the 42
 

593
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,990
all the way to in the 42
gigahertz

594
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
gigahertz
 

595
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,150
gigahertz
and that's where millimeter wave comes

596
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
and that's where millimeter wave comes
 

597
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,230
and that's where millimeter wave comes
into the picture now

598
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
into the picture now
 

599
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,470
into the picture now
let's now connect this to your question

600
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
let's now connect this to your question
 

601
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,430
let's now connect this to your question
about coverage uh of 5g

602
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
about coverage uh of 5g
 

603
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,750
about coverage uh of 5g
the easiest thing to do uh

604
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
the easiest thing to do uh
 

605
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,670
the easiest thing to do uh
is to deploy

606
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
is to deploy
 

607
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,550
is to deploy
5g in the new spectrum you can get uh

608
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
5g in the new spectrum you can get uh
 

609
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,269
5g in the new spectrum you can get uh
which is uh in the sub 6 you see bands

610
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
which is uh in the sub 6 you see bands
 

611
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,949
which is uh in the sub 6 you see bands
being auctioned across the globe into

612
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
being auctioned across the globe into
 

613
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,269
being auctioned across the globe into
3.5 gigahertz

614
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
3.5 gigahertz
 

615
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,630
3.5 gigahertz
there's nothing special about the band

616
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
there's nothing special about the band
 

617
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,069
there's nothing special about the band
is this the only one that was available

618
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
is this the only one that was available
 

619
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,350
is this the only one that was available
because everything else being used for

620
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
because everything else being used for
 

621
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,550
because everything else being used for
4g

622
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
4g
 

623
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,790
4g
and you can deploy on that go into

624
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
and you can deploy on that go into
 

625
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,269
and you can deploy on that go into
existing cell towers and just put a new

626
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
existing cell towers and just put a new
 

627
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,790
existing cell towers and just put a new
equipment without having to build new

628
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
equipment without having to build new
 

629
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,030
equipment without having to build new
towers but when we go to technology such

630
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
towers but when we go to technology such
 

631
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,269
towers but when we go to technology such
as millimeter wave then you have to

632
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
as millimeter wave then you have to
 

633
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,590
as millimeter wave then you have to
build more dense networks you need to

634
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
build more dense networks you need to
 

635
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,350
build more dense networks you need to
build more stations because the

636
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
build more stations because the
 

637
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,190
build more stations because the
deployment in that case look like a

638
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
deployment in that case look like a
 

639
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,509
deployment in that case look like a
wi-fi deployment it's almost like wi-fi

640
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
wi-fi deployment it's almost like wi-fi
 

641
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,750
wi-fi deployment it's almost like wi-fi
access points when you need to build

642
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
access points when you need to build
 

643
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,230
access points when you need to build
more stations you need permits you need

644
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
more stations you need permits you need
 

645
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,509
more stations you need permits you need
to build

646
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
to build
 

647
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,389
to build
fiber so it takes more time to densify

648
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
fiber so it takes more time to densify
 

649
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,389
fiber so it takes more time to densify
so what you see happening is coverage

650
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
so what you see happening is coverage
 

651
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,509
so what you see happening is coverage
has been built fast with subjects uh

652
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519

to to to this question
 

791
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,269
to to to this question
as we built

792
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,470
as we built
new capabilities such as 5g power is

794
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
new capabilities such as 5g power is
 

795
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,910
new capabilities such as 5g power is
going down

796
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
going down
 

797
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,710
going down
especially when you think about reducing

798
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
especially when you think about reducing
 

799
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,629
especially when you think about reducing
the number of base stations the

800
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
the number of base stations the
 

801
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,949
the number of base stations the
network's becoming more dense

802
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
network's becoming more dense
 

803
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,030
network's becoming more dense
so as you do that the the power

804
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
so as you do that the the power
 

805
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,509
so as you do that the the power
becomes lower if you're radiated from

806
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
becomes lower if you're radiated from
 

807
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,350
becomes lower if you're radiated from
power radiated from the phone and from

808
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
power radiated from the phone and from
 

809
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,670
power radiated from the phone and from
the tower as you get closer to the tower

810
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
the tower as you get closer to the tower
 

811
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,110
the tower as you get closer to the tower
you don't need that much power to reach

812
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
you don't need that much power to reach
 

813
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,110
you don't need that much power to reach
the tower so as

814
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
the tower so as
 

815
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,550
the tower so as
as we move from 4g to 5g i think we see

816
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
as we move from 4g to 5g i think we see
 

817
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,550
as we move from 4g to 5g i think we see
a reduction in the amount of powers

818
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
a reduction in the amount of powers
 

819
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,069
a reduction in the amount of powers
required to close the radio link now

820
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
required to close the radio link now
 

821
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,230
required to close the radio link now
also you have a number of organizations

822
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
also you have a number of organizations
 

823
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,110
also you have a number of organizations
the fcc for example has rigorous

824
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
the fcc for example has rigorous
 

825
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,629
the fcc for example has rigorous
programs which they do a lot of tests uh

826
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
programs which they do a lot of tests uh
 

827
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,310
programs which they do a lot of tests uh
to validate uh you know the safety of

828
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
to validate uh you know the safety of
 

829
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,710
to validate uh you know the safety of
those devices and i think we have

830
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
those devices and i think we have
 

831
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,710
those devices and i think we have
has been a model for other countries

832
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
has been a model for other countries
 

833
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,829
has been a model for other countries
also to adopt the same things

834
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
also to adopt the same things
 

835
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,069
also to adopt the same things
uh cellular has been around for a number

836
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
uh cellular has been around for a number
 

837
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,870
uh cellular has been around for a number
of decades now uh i think smartphone is

838
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
of decades now uh i think smartphone is
 

839
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,310
of decades now uh i think smartphone is
our most beloved device uh today

840
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
our most beloved device uh today
 

841
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,030
our most beloved device uh today
and i i would argue

842
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
and i i would argue
 

843
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,710
and i i would argue
how it's difficult to answer those

844
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
how it's difficult to answer those
 

845
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,949
how it's difficult to answer those
questions because you yeah but i'll

846
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
questions because you yeah but i'll
 

847
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,230
questions because you yeah but i'll
argue that the data to date have we seen

848
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
argue that the data to date have we seen
 

849
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,030
argue that the data to date have we seen
in 3g and 4g

850
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
in 3g and 4g
 

851
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,870
in 3g and 4g
you know has

852
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
you know has
 

853
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,870
you know has
shown that

854
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
shown that
 

855
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,749
shown that
a lot of the initial concerns we're not

856
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
a lot of the initial concerns we're not
 

857
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,870
a lot of the initial concerns we're not
valid

858
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
valid
 

859
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,269
valid
we look at 5g even though it's new it's

860
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
we look at 5g even though it's new it's
 

861
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,829
we look at 5g even though it's new it's
just less power so we look at from

862
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
just less power so we look at from
 

863
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,150
just less power so we look at from
from a physics standpoint so from a

864
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
from a physics standpoint so from a
 

865
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,269
from a physics standpoint so from a

physics from a biology perspective
 

867
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,350
physics from a biology perspective
there's a lot of evidence there's

868
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
there's a lot of evidence there's
 

869
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,550
there's a lot of evidence there's
studies

870
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
studies
 

871
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,470
studies
that show that it's not

872
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
that show that it's not
 

873
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,870
that show that it's not
dangerous that it is in fact safe

874
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
dangerous that it is in fact safe
 

875
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,629
dangerous that it is in fact safe
however the concern that people have is

876
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
however the concern that people have is

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,470
however the concern that people have is
when you scale technology exponentially

878
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
when you scale technology exponentially
 

879
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,550
when you scale technology exponentially
how would that change human civilization

880
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
how would that change human civilization
 

881
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,389
how would that change human civilization
i mean that doesn't apply to 5g that

882
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
i mean that doesn't apply to 5g that
 

883
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,870
i mean that doesn't apply to 5g that
applies to every technology how you said

884
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
applies to every technology how you said

smartphone is the most beloved device

886
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
smartphone is the most beloved device
 

887
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,310
smartphone is the most beloved device
but love

888
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
but love
 

889
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,749
but love
sometimes hurts

890
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
sometimes hurts
 

891
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,790
sometimes hurts
that's uh the impact on society we don't

892
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
that's uh the impact on society we don't
 

893
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,550
that's uh the impact on society we don't
know and there's a little bit of fear

894
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
know and there's a little bit of fear
 

895
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,629
know and there's a little bit of fear
there's both excitement and fear

896
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
there's both excitement and fear
 

897
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,550
there's both excitement and fear
it's a great topic a conversation

898
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
it's a great topic a conversation
 

899
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,150
it's a great topic a conversation
actually so so let me give you my

900
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
actually so so let me give you my
 

901
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,749
actually so so let me give you my
perspective on this and you started to

902
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
perspective on this and you started to
 

903
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,269
perspective on this and you started to
see something exactly happening right

904
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
see something exactly happening right
 

905
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,670
see something exactly happening right
now so let me step back

906
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
now so let me step back
 

907
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,430
now so let me step back
and let's talk about the fact that we

908
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
and let's talk about the fact that we
 

909
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,030
and let's talk about the fact that we
are in a fully interconnected society

910
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
are in a fully interconnected society
 

911
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,389
are in a fully interconnected society
that when

912
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
that when
 

913
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,670
that when
when uh when you look of the situation

914
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
when uh when you look of the situation
 

915
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,230
when uh when you look of the situation
today we talk about smartphones uh

916
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
today we talk about smartphones uh
 

917
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,990
today we talk about smartphones uh
largest uh development platform uh so

918
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
largest uh development platform uh so
 

919
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,949
largest uh development platform uh so
much now of our life uh

920
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
much now of our life uh
 

921
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,669
much now of our life uh
we are connected to the smartphone and

922
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
we are connected to the smartphone and
 

923
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,069
we are connected to the smartphone and
as a result and we are all connected and

924
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
as a result and we are all connected and
 

925
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,510
as a result and we are all connected and
we're connected

926
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
we're connected
 

927
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,309
we're connected
and then we're building digital twins of

928
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
and then we're building digital twins of
 

929
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,390
and then we're building digital twins of
everything right so so when you look at

930
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
everything right so so when you look at
 

931
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,669
everything right so so when you look at
that picture when you look at the

932
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
that picture when you look at the
 

933
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,429
that picture when you look at the
picture of this connected society

934
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
picture of this connected society
 

935
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,590
picture of this connected society
you started to have

936
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
you started to have
 

937
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,829
you started to have
the following thoughts which i think are

938
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
the following thoughts which i think are
 

939
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,909
the following thoughts which i think are
very healthy which means in the same way

940
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
very healthy which means in the same way
 

941
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,070
very healthy which means in the same way
that in the physical world

942
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
that in the physical world
 

943
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,630
that in the physical world
you're entitled to some rights you have

944
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
you're entitled to some rights you have
 

945
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,909
you're entitled to some rights you have
obligations and there's a lot of uh

946
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
obligations and there's a lot of uh
 

947
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,510
obligations and there's a lot of uh
things that protect your your integrity

948
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
things that protect your your integrity
 

949
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,390
things that protect your your integrity
i think as a rule we're gonna see the

950
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
i think as a rule we're gonna see the
 

951
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,270
i think as a rule we're gonna see the
society evolving so those things extend

952
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
society evolving so those things extend
 

953
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,590
society evolving so those things extend
to your digital being

954
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
to your digital being
 

955
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,909
to your digital being
of people and things and i think just

956
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
of people and things and i think just
 

957
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,390
of people and things and i think just
natural it's just natural

958
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
natural it's just natural
 

959
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,470
natural it's just natural
it's just a natural path and you started

960
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
it's just a natural path and you started
 

961
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,990
it's just a natural path and you started
to see things like that for example the

962
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
to see things like that for example the
 

963
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,230
to see things like that for example the
europeans has done

964
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
europeans has done
 

965
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,310
europeans has done
a lot in this area i'll say the

966
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
a lot in this area i'll say the
 

967
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,789
a lot in this area i'll say the
europeans probably ahead in the united

968
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
europeans probably ahead in the united
 

969
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,590
europeans probably ahead in the united
states and thinking about privacy laws

970
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
states and thinking about privacy laws
 

971
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,669
states and thinking about privacy laws
digital privacy's law most recent the

972
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
digital privacy's law most recent the
 

973
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,990
digital privacy's law most recent the
dma the digital markets act which i

974
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,000
dma the digital markets act which i
 

975
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,110
dma the digital markets act which i
think is a great thing i think we're

976
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
think is a great thing i think we're
 

977
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,750
think is a great thing i think we're
we believe there's incredible uh thought

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,029
in to enable
ability to regulate the digital markets

982
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
ability to regulate the digital markets
 

983
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,150
ability to regulate the digital markets
so that there's innovation and

984
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
so that there's innovation and
 

985
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,150
so that there's innovation and
competitions and not not a single

986

competitions and not not a single
 

987
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,789

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799
company uh can control all the data and
 

989
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,190
company uh can control all the data and
then decide you know uh

how things gonna be work on the digital

992
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
how things gonna be work on the digital
 

993
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,950
how things gonna be work on the digital
realm and even if we think about the

994
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
realm and even if we think about the
 

995
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,710
realm and even if we think about the
potential of things like the meta versus

996
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
potential of things like the meta versus
 

997
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,390

we're connecting physical and digital

998
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
we're connecting physical and digital
 

999
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,710
we're connecting physical and digital
spaces so i think it's a natural

1000
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
spaces so i think it's a natural
 

1001
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,990
spaces so i think it's a natural
evolution of course regulate regulation

and laws always follow technology but

1004
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
and laws always follow technology but
 

1005
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,750
and laws always follow technology but
but the fact that we're uh moving to our

1006
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
but the fact that we're uh moving to our
 

1007

in the in the digital space and you have
 

1033
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,270
in the in the digital space and you have
to start to think about all the basic

important to think about the thing you
 

1047
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,590
important to think about the thing you
mentioned about regulators that has been

they follow technology so sometimes they

1054
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
they follow technology so sometimes they
 

1055

don't get the technology at all
 

1057
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,070
don't get the technology at all
so they're very clumsy in writing laws

1058

about regulators
i think it's a valid point

i think it's a valid point
 

1115
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,190
i think it's a valid point
as i said before i think the europeans

you know the way the way i'll oh think

1120
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
you know the way the way i'll oh think
 

1121
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,470
you know the way the way i'll oh think
about it we we depend on have the

about it we we depend on have the
 

1123
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,789
about it we we depend on have the
ability to innovate we depend on the

that would be disruptive

1130
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
that would be disruptive
 

1131
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,310
that would be disruptive
but at some time i think the tech

1132
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
but at some time i think the tech
 

1133
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,710
but at some time i think the tech
companies probably should spend time

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,870
be able to be
in the leadership position generation

1302
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
in the leadership position generation
 

1303
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,789
in the leadership position generation
after generation is an incredible thing

1304
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
after generation is an incredible thing
 

1305
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,870
after generation is an incredible thing
and we're very proud of that at qualcomm

1306
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
and we're very proud of that at qualcomm
 

1307
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,669
and we're very proud of that at qualcomm
yeah so you have to do the wi-fi 5g all

1308
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
yeah so you have to do the wi-fi 5g all
 

1309
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,750
yeah so you have to do the wi-fi 5g all
the and you have to be good to everyone

1310
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
the and you have to be good to everyone
 

1311
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,149
the and you have to be good to everyone
all of those technologies pack it all in

1312
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
all of those technologies pack it all in
 

1313
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:26,870
all of those technologies pack it all in
and

1314
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:26,880
and
 

1315
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,710
and
there's also pressure to make the thing

1316
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
there's also pressure to make the thing
 

1317
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,870
there's also pressure to make the thing
faster and faster and faster and then

1318
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:30,880
faster and faster and faster and then
 

1319
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,310
faster and faster and faster and then
there's more and more applications

1320
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
there's more and more applications
 

1321
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,390
there's more and more applications
you're supposed to be effortlessly

1322
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
you're supposed to be effortlessly
 

1323
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,390
you're supposed to be effortlessly
using and then you you mentioned the npu

1324
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
using and then you you mentioned the npu
 

1325
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,269
using and then you you mentioned the npu
gpu cpu they have to also dance together

1326
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,279
gpu cpu they have to also dance together
 

1327
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,390
gpu cpu they have to also dance together
somehow

1328
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,400
somehow
 

1329
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,830
somehow
they have to communicate well share

1330
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
they have to communicate well share
 

1331
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,430
they have to communicate well share
memory or not depending on what the

so think about that from a company

1340
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
so think about that from a company
 

1341
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,549
so think about that from a company
qualcomm we have to be good and each and

1342
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
qualcomm we have to be good and each and
 

1343
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,830
qualcomm we have to be good and each and
every one of those technology we can

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840
every one of those technology we can
 

1345
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,990
every one of those technology we can
just say oh we're a cpu company or a gpu

1346
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
just say oh we're a cpu company or a gpu
 

1347

do everything

1350
00:24:59,669 --> 00:24:59,679
do everything
 

1351
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,830
do everything
what does it take to design a great

1352
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
what does it take to design a great
 

1353
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,870
what does it take to design a great
processor so design this system on a

1354
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
processor so design this system on a
 

1355
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,630
processor so design this system on a
chip that you mentioned is there some

1356
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
chip that you mentioned is there some
 

1357
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,110

1365
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,310
leaders
uh you know the people that think about

1366
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
uh you know the people that think about
 

1367
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,710
uh you know the people that think about
how much this is all gonna cost all the

1368
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
how much this is all gonna cost all the
 

1369
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,870
how much this is all gonna cost all the
whole mess of it i'm of course very

1370
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
whole mess of it i'm of course very
 

1371
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,310
whole mess of it i'm of course very
partial about it i've been in this

1372
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
partial about it i've been in this
 

1373
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,870
partial about it i've been in this
company for probably more than 26 years

1374
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
company for probably more than 26 years
 

1375
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,870
company for probably more than 26 years
but um i

1376
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
but um i
 

1377
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,390
but um i
argued that there are a couple things

1378
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
argued that there are a couple things
 

1379
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,750
argued that there are a couple things
that are ingredients for the success

1380
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
that are ingredients for the success
 

1381
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,269
that are ingredients for the success
so we talk about the fact that you have

1382
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279
so we talk about the fact that you have
 

1383
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,710
so we talk about the fact that you have
all those different technologies they

1384
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
all those different technologies they
 

1385
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,710
all those different technologies they
evolve at their own pace and you have to

1386
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
evolve at their own pace and you have to
 

1387
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,110
evolve at their own pace and you have to
be good in each one of them and you need

1388
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
be good in each one of them and you need
 

1389
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,310
be good in each one of them and you need
to then to make them working together so

1390
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,320
to then to make them working together so
 

1391
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,830
to then to make them working together so
so you need to have an engineering

1392
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
so you need to have an engineering
 

1393
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,789
so you need to have an engineering
organization that

1394
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
organization that
 

1395
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,830
organization that
with a

1396
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
with a
 

1397
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,710
with a
incredible collaboration culture because

1398
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
incredible collaboration culture because
 

1399
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,110
incredible collaboration culture because
everybody has to be working the train is

1400
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
everybody has to be working the train is
 

1401
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,110
everybody has to be working the train is
going to leave the station every car it

1402
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
going to leave the station every car it
 

1403
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,110
going to leave the station every car it
needs to be there right when it leaves

1404
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,120
needs to be there right when it leaves
 

1405
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,549
needs to be there right when it leaves
the station it needs to live on time

1406
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
the station it needs to live on time
 

1407
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,630
the station it needs to live on time
especially in the phone business you can

1408
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
especially in the phone business you can
 

1409
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,510
especially in the phone business you can
change

1410
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
change
 

1411
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,990
change
christmas you cannot change black friday

1412
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
christmas you cannot change black friday
 

1413
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,909
christmas you cannot change black friday
you cannot change all of the selling

1414
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:05,919
you cannot change all of the selling
 

1415
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,310
you cannot change all of the selling
season so the phones are going to launch

1416
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
season so the phones are going to launch
 

1417
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,909
season so the phones are going to launch
on time and every technology needs to be

1418
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:09,919
on time and every technology needs to be
 

1419
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,549
on time and every technology needs to be
there the engineer needs to work as one

1420
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
there the engineer needs to work as one
 

1421
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,549
there the engineer needs to work as one
and we do have that at qualcomm the

1422
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
and we do have that at qualcomm the
 

1423
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,710
and we do have that at qualcomm the
other thing you have to have incredible

1424
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
other thing you have to have incredible
 

1425
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,310
other thing you have to have incredible
discipline

1426
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,320
discipline
 

1427
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,669
discipline
because

1428
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
because
 

1429
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,549
because
you know those are very complex systems

1430
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
you know those are very complex systems
 

1431
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,430
you know those are very complex systems
so

1432
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
so
 

1433
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,149
so
in one way you have to design with

1434
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
in one way you have to design with
 

1435
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,310
in one way you have to design with
quality uh

1436
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
quality uh
 

1437
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,149
quality uh
because in many cases

1438
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
because in many cases
 

1439
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,390
because in many cases
we're going to be ramping production and

1440
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,400
we're going to be ramping production and
 

1441
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,789
we're going to be ramping production and
even before we have the silicon back and

1442
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
even before we have the silicon back and
 

1443
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,230
even before we have the silicon back and
you have to rely

1444
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,240
you have to rely
 

1445
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,630
you have to rely
on on runner simulation models and you

1446
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
on on runner simulation models and you
 

1447
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,070
on on runner simulation models and you
have to rely

1448
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
have to rely
 

1449
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,590
have to rely
on on the fact that you design uh for

1450
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
on on the fact that you design uh for
 

1451
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,070
on on the fact that you design uh for
commercial applications that takes

1452
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
commercial applications that takes
 

1453
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,669
commercial applications that takes
that takes a while to build and uh and

1454
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
that takes a while to build and uh and
 

1455
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,510
that takes a while to build and uh and
you know it's probably been the

1456
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
you know it's probably been the
 

1457
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,350
you know it's probably been the
history of a semiconductor business at

1458
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
history of a semiconductor business at
 

1459
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,350
history of a semiconductor business at
qualcomm so you mean like the framework

1460
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
qualcomm so you mean like the framework
 

1461
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,190
qualcomm so you mean like the framework

before i answer that question let me
just step back a little bit because and

1762
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
just step back a little bit because and
 

1763
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,630
just step back a little bit because and
i'm sure we can we can talk more about

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
i'm sure we can we can talk more about
 

1765
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,870
i'm sure we can we can talk more about
those things but the

1766
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:34,880
those things but the
 

1767
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,190
those things but the
the reality is qualcomm is changing a

1768
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,200
the reality is qualcomm is changing a
 

1769
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,750
the reality is qualcomm is changing a
lot and we use i know we spend a lot of

1770
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:39,760
lot and we use i know we spend a lot of
 

1771
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,669
lot and we use i know we spend a lot of
time talking about 5g and smartphone and

1772
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:41,679
time talking about 5g and smartphone and

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,909
time talking about 5g and smartphone and
snapdragon and i think that has been

1774

snapdragon and i think that has been
 

1775
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,909
snapdragon and i think that has been
what had defined qualcomm for many years

1776
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
what had defined qualcomm for many years
 

1777
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,789
what had defined qualcomm for many years
but the reality is even consistent with

1778
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
but the reality is even consistent with
 

1779
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,789
but the reality is even consistent with
that 5g conversation which is a

1780

that 5g conversation which is a
 

1781
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,669
that 5g conversation which is a
technology to connect everything

1782
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:53,679
technology to connect everything
 

1783
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,350
technology to connect everything
qualcomm is also changing our technology

1784
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,360
qualcomm is also changing our technology
 

1785
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,909
qualcomm is also changing our technology
that was in many cases designed for

1786
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
that was in many cases designed for
 

1787
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,509
that was in many cases designed for
phones and

1788
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:01,519
phones and
 

1789
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,830
phones and
we said at the beginning connectivity

1790
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
we said at the beginning connectivity
 

1791
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,269
we said at the beginning connectivity
and processing

1792
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
and processing
 

1793
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,909
and processing
is going to virtually every industry and

1794
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
is going to virtually every industry and
 

1795
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,430
is going to virtually every industry and
as a result qualcomm is really changing

1796
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,440
as a result qualcomm is really changing
 

1797
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,590
as a result qualcomm is really changing
with it and expanding to a number of

1798
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
with it and expanding to a number of
 

1799
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,750
with it and expanding to a number of
different addressable markets

1800
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,760
different addressable markets
 

1801
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,430
different addressable markets
some of those markets

1802
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:17,440
some of those markets
 

1803
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,630
some of those markets
is

1804
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:18,640
is
 

1805
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,950
is
is the pc as you talk about it

1806
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:20,960
is the pc as you talk about it
 

1807
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,549
is the pc as you talk about it
the the conversions of mobile and pc

1808
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:24,559
the the conversions of mobile and pc
 

1809
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,870
the the conversions of mobile and pc
and the reason i'm excited about this

1810
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
and the reason i'm excited about this
 

1811
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,230
and the reason i'm excited about this
because you see a lot of things

1812
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240
because you see a lot of things
 

1813
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,950
because you see a lot of things
happening that bring this right front

1814
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:30,960
happening that bring this right front
 

1815
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,230
happening that bring this right front
and center when you think about the

1816
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
and center when you think about the
 

1817
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,470
and center when you think about the
future technology so

1818
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,480
future technology so
 

1819
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,430
future technology so
what we learn with the pandemic

1820
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,440
what we learn with the pandemic
 

1821
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,909
what we learn with the pandemic
is that the number one use case

1822
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919
is that the number one use case
 

1823
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,909
is that the number one use case
of personal computers

1824
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
of personal computers
 

1825
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,870
of personal computers
is communications

1826
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
is communications
 

1827
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,149
is communications
it is interesting when you think about

1828
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:46,159
it is interesting when you think about
 

1829
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,470
it is interesting when you think about
that that's the number one use case on a

1830
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
that that's the number one use case on a
 

1831
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,190
that that's the number one use case on a
pc today is communications it's actually

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
pc today is communications it's actually
 

1833
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,430
pc today is communications it's actually
funny because in the cellular industry

1834
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
funny because in the cellular industry
 

1835
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,190
funny because in the cellular industry
actually i'll say let me step back in

1836
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
actually i'll say let me step back in
 

1837
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,509
actually i'll say let me step back in
the telecom industry

1838

the telecom industry
 

1839
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,070
the telecom industry
we've been chasing this killer

1840
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,080
we've been chasing this killer
 

1841
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,630
we've been chasing this killer
application of video telephony for

1842
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
application of video telephony for
 

1843
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,590
application of video telephony for
decades right i remember

00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,600
decades right i remember
 

1845
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,230
decades right i remember
back then in the wire line uh even

1846
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,240
back then in the wire line uh even
 

1847
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,349
back then in the wire line uh even
before the internet and ip isdn you

1848
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,359
before the internet and ip isdn you
 

1849
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,629
before the internet and ip isdn you
remember those uh att desk phones with a

1850
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
remember those uh att desk phones with a
 

1851
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,149
remember those uh att desk phones with a
little screen and they said you can do

1852
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
little screen and they said you can do
 

1853
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,869
little screen and they said you can do
video telephony we don't watch that uh

1854
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
video telephony we don't watch that uh
 

1855
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,589
video telephony we don't watch that uh
in uh back to the future too then when

1856
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
in uh back to the future too then when
 

1857
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,589
in uh back to the future too then when
we started developing 3g said people

1858
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:23,599
we started developing 3g said people
 

1859
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,270
we started developing 3g said people
said what's the application for having

1860
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
said what's the application for having
 

1861
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,430
said what's the application for having
data to cell phone all video telephony

1862
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
data to cell phone all video telephony
 

1863
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,230
data to cell phone all video telephony
then we started doing 4g

1864
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
then we started doing 4g
 

1865
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,149
then we started doing 4g
and in the beginning people said well

1866
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
and in the beginning people said well
 

1867
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,750
and in the beginning people said well
why do you need all this broadband oh

1868
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
why do you need all this broadband oh
 

1869

vega telephony
 

1871
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,990
vega telephony
but it took a pandemic to make video

1872
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,000
but it took a pandemic to make video
 

1873
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,629
but it took a pandemic to make video
telephony the killer application and

1874
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:40,639
telephony the killer application and
 

1875
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,629
telephony the killer application and
that's now the number one

1876
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
that's now the number one
 

1877
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,510
that's now the number one
uh use case on a pc so now think about

1878
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
uh use case on a pc so now think about
 

1879
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,109
uh use case on a pc so now think about
that for a second

1880
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:47,119
that for a second
 

1881
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,710
that for a second
personal computers now their

1882
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
personal computers now their
 

1883
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,990
personal computers now their
technologies that people when they're

1884
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,000
technologies that people when they're
 

1885
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,430
technologies that people when they're
going to buy a pc they didn't care much

1886
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440
going to buy a pc they didn't care much
 

1887
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,829
going to buy a pc they didn't care much
about it now they do camera

1888
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
about it now they do camera
 

1889
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,869
about it now they do camera
camera how good is the camera the audio

1890
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
camera how good is the camera the audio
 

1891
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,230
camera how good is the camera the audio
is they connected how good is the

1892
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,240
is they connected how good is the
 

1893
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,589
is they connected how good is the
connectivity do you have the latest and

1894
00:34:59,589 --> 00:34:59,599
connectivity do you have the latest and
 

1895
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,230
connectivity do you have the latest and
greatest wi-fi in cellular what's the

1896
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
greatest wi-fi in cellular what's the
 

1897
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,990
greatest wi-fi in cellular what's the
battery life because you're going to be

1898
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,000
battery life because you're going to be
 

1899
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,430
battery life because you're going to be
working from anywhere sometimes you near

1900
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,440
working from anywhere sometimes you near
 

1901
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,109
working from anywhere sometimes you near
that sometimes you're not

1902
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
that sometimes you're not
 

1903
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,630
that sometimes you're not
so all those things what's the

1904
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:08,640
so all those things what's the
 

1905
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,630
so all those things what's the
portability like so those things started

1906
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
portability like so those things started
 

1907
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,750
portability like so those things started
to change

1908
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
to change
 

1909
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,990
to change
how we should think about the pc but i

1910
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
how we should think about the pc but i
 

1911
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,750
how we should think about the pc but i
won't stop there let me talk about

1912
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
won't stop there let me talk about
 

1913
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,430
won't stop there let me talk about
another trend so and it and all come as

1914
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
another trend so and it and all come as
 

1915
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,670
another trend so and it and all come as
a result of what we saw the pandemic

1916
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680
a result of what we saw the pandemic
 

1917
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,510
a result of what we saw the pandemic
let's say that you are you're an

1918
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
let's say that you are you're an
 

1919
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,589
let's say that you are you're an
engineer in the computer aided design

1920
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:25,599
engineer in the computer aided design
 

1921
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,349
engineer in the computer aided design
you you have advanced

1922
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
you you have advanced
 

1923
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,589
you you have advanced
uh desktop

1924
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
uh desktop
 

1925
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,950
uh desktop
computer or workstation in your office

1926
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,960
computer or workstation in your office
 

1927
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,950
computer or workstation in your office
but you want to work from home someday

1928
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
but you want to work from home someday
 

1929
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,310
but you want to work from home someday
so you're not going to move that to your

1930
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,320
so you're not going to move that to your
 

1931
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,069
so you're not going to move that to your
home so what do you need to do you're

1932
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
home so what do you need to do you're
 

1933
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,069
home so what do you need to do you're
going to have to rely on that

1934
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
going to have to rely on that
 

1935
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,670
going to have to rely on that
you're going to run that on the cloud

1936
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:41,680
you're going to run that on the cloud
 

1937
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,030
you're going to run that on the cloud
and you're going to run out of the cloud

1938
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040

call somebody or connect with somebody
with a hologram it's possible and also

2098
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,880
with a hologram it's possible and also
 

2099
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,870
with a hologram it's possible and also
to mention some

2100
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
to mention some
 

2101
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,870
to mention some
increasing amount of intelligence in our

2102
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:34,880
increasing amount of intelligence in our
 

2103
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,990
increasing amount of intelligence in our
cars

2104
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
cars
 

2105
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,990
cars
so semi-autonomous autonomous cars and

2106
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,000
so semi-autonomous autonomous cars and
 

2107
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,790
so semi-autonomous autonomous cars and
the interactivity between human and

2108
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
the interactivity between human and
 

2109
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,150
the interactivity between human and
and car which are for me things are

2110
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
and car which are for me things are
 

2111
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,589
and car which are for me things are
really exciting let me ask you a big

2112
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
really exciting let me ask you a big
 

2113
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,589
really exciting let me ask you a big
question so when when aliens again now

2114
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
question so when when aliens again now
 

2115
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,109
question so when when aliens again now
on the other side

2116
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:49,119
on the other side
 

2117
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,790
on the other side
right and humans destroy themselves

2118
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:50,800
right and humans destroy themselves
 

2119
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,630
right and humans destroy themselves
through nuclear war centuries from now

what would they remember qualcomm

2132
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:04,320
what would they remember qualcomm
 

2133
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,230
what would they remember qualcomm
in the 21st century as a company would

2134
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
in the 21st century as a company would
 

2135
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,550
in the 21st century as a company would
be a car company would it be like think

2136
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,560
be a car company would it be like think
 

2137
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,230
be a car company would it be like think
of all the crazy pivots that might

2138
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,240
of all the crazy pivots that might
 

2139
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,190
of all the crazy pivots that might
happen the next like 50 years because

2140
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,200
happen the next like 50 years because
 

2141
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,109
happen the next like 50 years because
you're thinking you said qualcomm

2142
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,119
you're thinking you said qualcomm
 

2143
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,430
you're thinking you said qualcomm
enables all of these things with 5g and

2144
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:17,440
enables all of these things with 5g and
 

2145
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,069
enables all of these things with 5g and
there'll be probably other g's it keeps

2146
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:20,079
there'll be probably other g's it keeps
 

2147
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,230
there'll be probably other g's it keeps
increasing so basically connectivity and

2148
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,240
increasing so basically connectivity and
 

2149
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,550
increasing so basically connectivity and
computation and everything becomes

2150
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
computation and everything becomes
 

2151
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,390
computation and everything becomes
connected and everything is capable of

2152
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
connected and everything is capable of
 

2153
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,670
connected and everything is capable of
computation

2154
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:27,680

might you be become a robotics and car

2156
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
might you be become a robotics and car

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,589
company
um i will argue we're already an

um i will argue we're already an
 

2161
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,190
um i will argue we're already an
automotive uh company today and uh but

2162
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,200
automotive uh company today and uh but
 

2163
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,109
automotive uh company today and uh but
let me tell what i what i would like

2164
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
let me tell what i what i would like
 

2165
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,870
let me tell what i what i would like
qualcomm to be remember recognized for

2166
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:42,880
qualcomm to be remember recognized for
 

2167
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,310
qualcomm to be remember recognized for
i think everyone

i think everyone
 

2169
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,870
i think everyone
that knows qualcomm immediately

to connectivity and wireless but the
 

2175
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,310
to connectivity and wireless but the
reality is we're being actually the

everything outside the data center
that we're doing those billions of

there's some technical jargon but people
 

2205
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,390
there's some technical jargon but people
use the word edge like edge computing

2206
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
use the word edge like edge computing
 

2207
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,270
use the word edge like edge computing
it's

2208
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,280
it's
 

2209
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,710
it's
by the way that's probably changing what

by the way that's probably changing what
 

2211
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,470
by the way that's probably changing what
that even means but it's basically

2212
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
that even means but it's basically
 

2213
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,910
that even means but it's basically
everything that's not a giant thing

2214
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:33,920
everything that's not a giant thing
 

2215
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,109
everything that's not a giant thing
that's making a lot of noise in a

that's making a lot of noise in a
 

2217
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,030
that's making a lot of noise in a
building somewhere so it's mobile

00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
but it would be edge so it's it's like
 

2225

um
 

2231
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,790
um
but basically edge computing

2232
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:50,800
but basically edge computing
 

2233
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,550
but basically edge computing
is is uh the edge of that expanding

2234
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,560
is is uh the edge of that expanding
 

2235
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,150
is is uh the edge of that expanding
space that you mentioned

2236
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,160
space that you mentioned
 

2237
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,309
space that you mentioned
that qualcomm is trying to

2238
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:58,319
that qualcomm is trying to
 

2239
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,550
that qualcomm is trying to
connect and enable with computation

2240
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,560
connect and enable with computation
 

2241
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,790
connect and enable with computation
here's a simple way to describe what the

2242
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:02,800
here's a simple way to describe what the
 

2243
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,150
here's a simple way to describe what the
edge is in edge computing is i think as

2244
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,160
edge is in edge computing is i think as
 

2245
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,829
edge is in edge computing is i think as
we think about the evolution of the data

2246
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:07,839
we think about the evolution of the data
 

2247
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,430
we think about the evolution of the data
center

2248
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440
center
 

2249
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,750
center
you need to bring the computational

2250
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:11,760
you need to bring the computational
 

2251
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,990
you need to bring the computational
closer to where the device is

2252
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,000
closer to where the device is
 

2253
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,390
closer to where the device is
also when you put the computation

2254
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,400
also when you put the computation
 

2255
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,550
also when you put the computation
together with the connectivity at the

2256
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:18,560

00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:24,640
is now
 

2321
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,710

00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
uh you could argue with as much as an
 

2323
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,550
uh you could argue with as much as an
automotive company as wireless company

and it's easy to see
 

2329
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,390
and it's easy to see
if you look at our mobile heritage and

a big topic of conversation and we only

2620
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,040
a big topic of conversation and we only
 

2621
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,349
a big topic of conversation and we only
have five minutes so i'll try i'll try

have five minutes so i'll try i'll try
to be as objective as i can

2624
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
to be as objective as i can
 

2625
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,750
to be as objective as i can
so first let's talk about what caused it

2626
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
so first let's talk about what caused it
 

2627
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,670
so first let's talk about what caused it
and and i you know you hear a lot of

2628
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
and and i you know you hear a lot of
 

2629
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,109
and and i you know you hear a lot of
different things i will try to put it

2630
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:47,119
different things i will try to put it
 

2631
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,349
different things i will try to put it
within the right context the first thing

2632
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:49,359
within the right context the first thing
 

2633
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,190
within the right context the first thing
that caused it really

2634
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:51,200
that caused it really
 

2635
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,829
that caused it really
is the acceleration of digital

2636
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
is the acceleration of digital
 

2637
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,109
is the acceleration of digital
transformation of pretty much everything

2638
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:57,119
transformation of pretty much everything
 

2639
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,710
transformation of pretty much everything
in every industry

00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
in every industry
 

2641
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,470
in every industry
uh every industry has been digitally

2642
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
uh every industry has been digitally
 

2643
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,910
uh every industry has been digitally
transformed and as such the amount of

2644
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
transformed and as such the amount of
 

2645
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,829
transformed and as such the amount of
semiconductors that are required it's

2646
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:05,839
semiconductors that are required it's
 

2647
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,270
semiconductors that are required it's
much larger

2648
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
much larger
 

2649
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,030
much larger
just to give you a practical example if

2650
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,040
just to give you a practical example if
 

2651
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,309
just to give you a practical example if
you think about the automotive as an

2652
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:10,319
you think about the automotive as an
 

2653
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,589
you think about the automotive as an

launch a new model launching today the
 

2659
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,589
launch a new model launching today the
new model launching today most likely

2667
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,510
working on this coming in next probably
10x that one so you see the amount of

2668
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:29,520
10x that one so you see the amount of
 

2669
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,190
10x that one so you see the amount of
silicon and then billions of things

00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
silicon and then billions of things
 

2671
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,549
silicon and then billions of things
become smart

more and more data goes to the cloud the
 

2675
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,190
more and more data goes to the cloud the
data center grows so the floor for

2676
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
data center grows so the floor for
 

2677
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,589
data center grows so the floor for
semiconductor consumptions went up by a

and new computers uh new gaming so all
 

2715
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,589
and new computers uh new gaming so all
of those things came on top of that as

2716
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:25,599
of those things came on top of that as
 

2717
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,750
of those things came on top of that as
the aggravated issue but they're not the

2718
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
the aggravated issue but they're not the
 

2719
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,309
the aggravated issue but they're not the
main issue the main issue is it's

2720
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:30,319
main issue the main issue is it's
 

2721
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,910
main issue the main issue is it's
actually a a long-term growth

2722
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
actually a a long-term growth
 

2723
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,710
actually a a long-term growth
of digital so what i'm hearing you say

2724
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
of digital so what i'm hearing you say
 

2725
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,430
of digital so what i'm hearing you say
is

2726
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
is
 

2727
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,829
is
the pandemic was not the cause it was an

2728
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:39,839
the pandemic was not the cause it was an
 

2729
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,390
the pandemic was not the cause it was an
aggravation it's an aggravation so

2730
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
aggravation it's an aggravation so
 

2731
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,190
aggravation it's an aggravation so
is there a way

2732
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
is there a way
 

2733
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,069
is there a way
we can support as a human civilization

2734
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:48,079
we can support as a human civilization
 

2735
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,309
we can support as a human civilization
in terms of manufacture in terms of

2736
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
in terms of manufacture in terms of
 

2737
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,950
in terms of manufacture in terms of
supply the kind of growth that you're

2738
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960
supply the kind of growth that you're
 

2739
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,589
supply the kind of growth that you're
talking about in devices and so on is

2740
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:55,599
talking about in devices and so on is
 

2741
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,470
talking about in devices and so on is
there

2742
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,480
there
 

2743
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,150
there
high level ideas you can say of what

2744
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:58,160
high level ideas you can say of what
 

2745
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,829
high level ideas you can say of what
that's required there

2746
00:49:59,829 --> 00:49:59,839
that's required there
 

2747
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,750
that's required there
yes and i think that's uh the second

2748
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:01,760
yes and i think that's uh the second
 

2749
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,270
yes and i think that's uh the second
part of the answer so what's happening

2750
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:03,280
part of the answer so what's happening
 

2751
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,430
part of the answer so what's happening
now how are we going to get out of this

2752
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:05,440
now how are we going to get out of this
 

2753
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,309
now how are we going to get out of this
so

2754
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
so
 

2755
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,230
so
we see a lot of capacity investments put

2756
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:10,240
we see a lot of capacity investments put
 

2757
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,390
we see a lot of capacity investments put
into place by the industry

2758
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:12,400
into place by the industry
 

2759
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,470
into place by the industry
you know we had invested a lot with our

2760
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:14,480
you know we had invested a lot with our
 

2761
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,750
you know we had invested a lot with our
suppliers a lot of the suppliers uh had

2762
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:17,760
suppliers a lot of the suppliers uh had
 

2763
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,270
suppliers a lot of the suppliers uh had
made uh plans about you know increasing

2764
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:21,280
made uh plans about you know increasing
 

2765
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,349
made uh plans about you know increasing
the capacity the industry is planning to

2766
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:23,359
the capacity the industry is planning to
 

2767
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,349
the capacity the industry is planning to
double its total semiconductor

2768
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:25,359
double its total semiconductor
 

2769
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,829
double its total semiconductor
manufacturing capacity within the next

2770
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
manufacturing capacity within the next
 

2771
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,390
manufacturing capacity within the next
uh five years an example so that's

2772
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:30,400
uh five years an example so that's
 

2773
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,150
uh five years an example so that's
already happening and then you see

2774
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,160
already happening and then you see
 

2775
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,069
already happening and then you see
things which are actually good they're

2776
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:34,079
things which are actually good they're
 

2777
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:34,870
things which are actually good they're
good

2778
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:34,880
good
 

2779
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,710
good

00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:48,480
you're friends now they're they're
 

2899
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,670
you're friends now they're they're
they're my customers um and and uh as

2900
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:51,680
they're my customers um and and uh as
 

2901
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,910
they're my customers um and and uh as
part of that i think the the licensing

2902
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:53,920
part of that i think the the licensing
 

2903
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,270
part of that i think the the licensing
model got tested in i think in every

2904
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,280
model got tested in i think in every
 

2905
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,549
model got tested in i think in every
geography

2906
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:58,559
geography
 

2907
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,349
geography
and uh we succeeded in every single

2908
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:01,359
and uh we succeeded in every single
 

2909
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,510
and uh we succeeded in every single
geography to validate

2910
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
geography to validate
 

2911
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,430
geography to validate
the

2912
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:04,440
the
 

2913
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,790
the
pro-competitiveness of this model i

2914
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:06,800
pro-competitiveness of this model i
 

2915
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,630
pro-competitiveness of this model i
think the uh the fair reasonable

2916
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:09,640
think the uh the fair reasonable
 

2917
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,069
think the uh the fair reasonable
non-discriminatory aspect of this model

2918
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:12,079
non-discriminatory aspect of this model
 

2919
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,349
non-discriminatory aspect of this model
and i would argue that besides being the

2920
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
and i would argue that besides being the
 

2921
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,750
and i would argue that besides being the
most successful licensing business to

2922
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:17,760
most successful licensing business to
 

2923
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,750
most successful licensing business to
date in the industry

2924
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:19,760
date in the industry
 

2925
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,349
date in the industry
probably the one that's been battle

2926
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:21,359
probably the one that's been battle
 

2927
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,510
probably the one that's been battle
tested and that's most stable because

2928
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:23,520
tested and that's most stable because
 

2929
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,829
tested and that's most stable because
there's not a single jurisdiction that

2930
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
there's not a single jurisdiction that
 

2931
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,430
there's not a single jurisdiction that
we have not

2932
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:27,440
we have not
 

2933
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,910
we have not
had to validate that model so it's part

2934
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:29,920
had to validate that model so it's part
 

2935
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,230
had to validate that model so it's part
of our past and what it creates is

2936
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:32,240
of our past and what it creates is
 

2937
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,150
of our past and what it creates is
probably create a lot of stability in

2938
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
probably create a lot of stability in
 

2939
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,829
probably create a lot of stability in
our licensing business but having said

2940
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:35,839
our licensing business but having said
 

2941
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,630
our licensing business but having said
that the growth of the company is in the

2942
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:38,640
that the growth of the company is in the
 

2943
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,309
that the growth of the company is in the
semiconductor space and the

2944
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
semiconductor space and the
 

2945
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,510
semiconductor space and the
semiconductor so licensing is you come

2946
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,520
semiconductor so licensing is you come
 

2947
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,030
semiconductor so licensing is you come
up with a pretty good idea you have a

2948
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,040
up with a pretty good idea you have a
 

2949
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,630
up with a pretty good idea you have a
bunch of smart people coming up with

2950
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:46,640
bunch of smart people coming up with
 

2951
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,990
bunch of smart people coming up with
cool ideas

2952
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
cool ideas
 

2953
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,829
cool ideas
and then once you come up with that idea

2954
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:49,839
and then once you come up with that idea
 

2955
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,670
and then once you come up with that idea
you sell that idea to others they get to

2956
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
you sell that idea to others they get to
 

2957
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,069
you sell that idea to others they get to
use it that's essentially a license the

00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:54,079
use it that's essentially a license the

them that i'm especially excited about
 

3717
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,549
them that i'm especially excited about
which is snapdragon the whole line of

3718
01:07:22,549 --> 01:07:22,559
which is snapdragon the whole line of
 

3719
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,630
which is snapdragon the whole line of
processors there currently i would say

3720
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:24,640
processors there currently i would say
 

3721
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,589
processors there currently i would say
at about

3722
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599
at about
 

3723
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,430
at about
10 billion transistors

3724
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:27,440
10 billion transistors
 

3725
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,190

3727
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,510
if you think about the human brain it's
about 100 billion neurons

3728
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:31,520
about 100 billion neurons
 

3729
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,150
about 100 billion neurons
so i think uh 11

3730
