sometimes the trolling and the laws

208
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
sometimes the trolling and the laws
 

209
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,910
sometimes the trolling and the laws
reveal a thing we're too embarrassed to

210
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
reveal a thing we're too embarrassed to
 

211
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,770
reveal a thing we're too embarrassed to
admit about the darker aspects of our

212
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:27,780
admit about the darker aspects of our

he describes throughout history how
humans have been really attracted to

222
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:39,900
humans have been really attracted to
 

223
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,710
humans have been really attracted to
watching The Suffering of others so

224
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
watching The Suffering of others so
 

225
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,690
watching The Suffering of others so
um public executions all that kind of

226
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:44,700
um public executions all that kind of
 

227
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,449
um public executions all that kind of
stuff and he believes that's in all of

228
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:47,459
stuff and he believes that's in all of
 

229
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,910
stuff and he believes that's in all of
us that for example if something like a

230
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
us that for example if something like a
 

231
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,690
us that for example if something like a
YouTube or a different platform

232
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:52,700
YouTube or a different platform
 

233
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,390
YouTube or a different platform
stream to public execution or streamed

234
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
stream to public execution or streamed
 

235
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,369
stream to public execution or streamed
the torture of another human being

236
00:03:58,369 --> 00:03:58,379
the torture of another human being
 

237
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,589
the torture of another human being
a lot of people would uh say that's

238
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
a lot of people would uh say that's
 

239
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,570
a lot of people would uh say that's
deeply unethical but they will still

240
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:02,580
deeply unethical but they will still
 

241
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,809
deeply unethical but they will still
tune in and watch and that where we're

242
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:05,819
tune in and watch and that where we're
 

243
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,390
tune in and watch and that where we're
attracted to that drama and especially

244
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
attracted to that drama and especially
 

245
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,070
attracted to that drama and especially
the most extreme versions of that drama

246
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
the most extreme versions of that drama
 

247
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,130
the most extreme versions of that drama
and so I think part of the laws

248
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,140
and so I think part of the laws
 

249
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,869
and so I think part of the laws
reveals something that's actually true

250
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
reveals something that's actually true
 

251
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,750
reveals something that's actually true
in that poll that like your answer is so

252
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:17,760
in that poll that like your answer is so
 

253
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,210
in that poll that like your answer is so
much better than mine do you think about

254
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:20,220
much better than mine do you think about
 

255
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,150
much better than mine do you think about
that maybe even with the squid game like

256
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,160
that maybe even with the squid game like
 

257
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,270
that maybe even with the squid game like
so I think how many how many views does

258
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,280
so I think how many how many views does
 

259
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,070
so I think how many how many views does
this game currently have 300 million

260
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
this game currently have 300 million
 

261
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,810
this game currently have 300 million
yeah something like this

262
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:29,820
yeah something like this
 

263
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,450
yeah something like this
so

264
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,460
so
 

265
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,550
so
just imagine

266
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
just imagine
 

267
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,710
just imagine
a thought experiment how many views that

268
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
a thought experiment how many views that
 

269
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,830
a thought experiment how many views that
video would get if it was like real yes

270
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
video would get if it was like real yes
 

271
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,510
video would get if it was like real yes
because I mean YouTube was like We'll

272
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
because I mean YouTube was like We'll
 

273
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,950
because I mean YouTube was like We'll
turn the blind out we won't take it down

274
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
turn the blind out we won't take it down
 

275
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,950
turn the blind out we won't take it down
yeah I mean it I've obviously I probably

276
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:45,960
yeah I mean it I've obviously I probably
 

277
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,510
yeah I mean it I've obviously I probably
have billions of views how do you think

278
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
have billions of views how do you think
 

279
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,830
have billions of views how do you think
you will die and do you think you'll be

280
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:48,840
you will die and do you think you'll be
 

281
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,870
you will die and do you think you'll be
during a video probably doing something

282
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
during a video probably doing something
 

283
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,969
during a video probably doing something
dumb like going to space when I'm in the

284
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:52,979
dumb like going to space when I'm in the
 

285
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,469
dumb like going to space when I'm in the
older like trying to go to Mars or

286
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
older like trying to go to Mars or
 

287
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,390
older like trying to go to Mars or
something like that I know for a fact it

288
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
something like that I know for a fact it
 

289
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,189
something like that I know for a fact it
won't be on a video every video we do

290
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:58,199
won't be on a video every video we do
 

291
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,689
won't be on a video every video we do
with safety experts and stuff like that

292
00:04:59,689 --> 00:04:59,699
with safety experts and stuff like that
 

293
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,390
with safety experts and stuff like that
so it's not really risk but

294
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
so it's not really risk but
 

295
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,550
so it's not really risk but
um yeah I could see myself like you know

296
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
um yeah I could see myself like you know
 

297
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,050
um yeah I could see myself like you know
after a million people go to Mars or

298
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:06,060
after a million people go to Mars or
 

299
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,950
after a million people go to Mars or
something like that I'd probably be like

300
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
something like that I'd probably be like
 

301
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,050
something like that I'd probably be like
you know what let's go and and something

302
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,060
you know what let's go and and something
 

303
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,909
you know what let's go and and something
like that maybe so not in the name of a

304
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:10,919
like that maybe so not in the name of a

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,590
yourself in the line a little bit right
of course but you know we we've had that

316
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
of course but you know we we've had that
 

317
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,790
of course but you know we we've had that
video in the works for three years and

318
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
video in the works for three years and
 

319
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,350
video in the works for three years and
then we consult with tons of experts

320
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,360
then we consult with tons of experts
 

321

beforehand to see if there's crevasses
 

325
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,870
beforehand to see if there's crevasses
so we know there's no crevasses we do

try to predict 10 years later how many
Subs I'd have that's what he's referring

430
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:06,660
Subs I'd have that's what he's referring
 

431
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,170
Subs I'd have that's what he's referring
to and yes there there are some that are

432
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,180
to and yes there there are some that are
 

433

00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
dreamed about that a lot like I don't
 

485
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,890
dreamed about that a lot like I don't
know if if I only had 30 days to live

486
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:00,900
know if if I only had 30 days to live
 

487
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,510
know if if I only had 30 days to live
what would I do and for me I would try

488
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,520
what would I do and for me I would try
 

489
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,189
what would I do and for me I would try
to make like a decades worth of content

490
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:04,199
to make like a decades worth of content
 

491

and so it's just like I never died I'm
 

497
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,070
and so it's just like I never died I'm
just there

498
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
just there
 

499
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,409
just there
yeah it's a kind of immortality but it's

500
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:12,419
yeah it's a kind of immortality but it's
 

501
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,050
yeah it's a kind of immortality but it's
also kind of troll on the concept of

502
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,060
also kind of troll on the concept of
 

503
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,270
also kind of troll on the concept of
time yeah that you can die in the

504
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
time yeah that you can die in the
 

505
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,710
time yeah that you can die in the
physical space but persist in the

506
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
physical space but persist in the
 

507
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,050
physical space but persist in the
digital space I actually I recorded a

508
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,060
digital space I actually I recorded a
 

509
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,510
digital space I actually I recorded a
video like that because I had some

510
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
video like that because I had some
 

511
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,570
video like that because I had some
concerns and I just thought it's also a

512
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:26,580
concerns and I just thought it's also a
 

513
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,670
concerns and I just thought it's also a
good exercise to do a video would like

514
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:28,680
good exercise to do a video would like
 

515
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,010
good exercise to do a video would like
to be released if I die

516
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,020
to be released if I die
 

517
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,750
to be released if I die
and it was actually a really interesting

where we can slow down aging get it

704
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
where we can slow down aging get it
 

705
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,810

years old and just like set their sights
 

709
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,069
years old and just like set their sights
on that and then just kind of save us so

710
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:37,079
on that and then just kind of save us so
 

711
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,050
on that and then just kind of save us so
it'd be really nice like it's it's

712
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,060
it'd be really nice like it's it's
 

713
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,690
it'd be really nice like it's it's
almost absurd to think that in our

714
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:41,700
almost absurd to think that in our
 

715
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,949
almost absurd to think that in our
lifetime they won't figure out a way to

716
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
lifetime they won't figure out a way to
 

717
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,509
lifetime they won't figure out a way to
just even slightly slow down aging where

718
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:44,519
just even slightly slow down aging where
 

719
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,670
just even slightly slow down aging where
we could live to be like 120 or 130 and

720
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:46,680
we could live to be like 120 or 130 and
 

721
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,990
we could live to be like 120 or 130 and
then that extra time they won't figure

722
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
then that extra time they won't figure
 

723
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,550
then that extra time they won't figure
out somewhere we could live to be 200.

724
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:49,560
out somewhere we could live to be 200.
 

725
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,069
out somewhere we could live to be 200.

the simplest stuff and they're very

1004
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:29,940
the simplest stuff and they're very
 

1005
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,370
the simplest stuff and they're very
bureaucratic and

1006
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:31,380
bureaucratic and
 

1007
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,530
bureaucratic and

just solve a lot of problems yeah but

1070
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:38,220
just solve a lot of problems yeah but
 

1071
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,710
just solve a lot of problems yeah but
then the two companies that have to

1072
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:39,720
then the two companies that have to
 

1073
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,210
then the two companies that have to
agree to integrate each other's content

1074
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:41,220
agree to integrate each other's content
 

1075
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,130
agree to integrate each other's content
I don't know but it seems like a win-win

1076
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,140
I don't know but it seems like a win-win
 

1077
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,990
I don't know but it seems like a win-win
I mean well it's more of a win for

1078
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,000
I mean well it's more of a win for
 

1079
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,130
I mean well it's more of a win for
Twitter because then people don't have

1080
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,140
Twitter because then people don't have
 

1081
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,930
Twitter because then people don't have
to leave the platform I mean that would

1082
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:47,940
to leave the platform I mean that would
 

1083
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,270
to leave the platform I mean that would
be the the easiest but who gets like

1084
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,280
be the the easiest but who gets like
 

1085
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,830
be the the easiest but who gets like

1803
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,130
like traditional which is the only way
to really do it because there's not that

1804
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,140
to really do it because there's not that

up so it's not like there's a huge
 

1809
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,090
up so it's not like there's a huge
talent pool of people who've worked on

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
completely different ways of going about
 

1905
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,450
completely different ways of going about
things you know like our videos aren't

1906
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:05,460
things you know like our videos aren't
 

1907
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,549
things you know like our videos aren't
scripted and you know it's a lot more

1908
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:07,559
scripted and you know it's a lot more
 

1909
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,830
scripted and you know it's a lot more
Run and Gun and when we if we

1910
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
Run and Gun and when we if we
 

1911
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,529
Run and Gun and when we if we
hypothetically blow up a giant car or

1912
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:12,539
hypothetically blow up a giant car or
 

1913
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,570
hypothetically blow up a giant car or
whatever like you only have one take you

know I mean so
um and it's not scripted and so you have

1918
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:17,520
um and it's not scripted and so you have
 

1919
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,610

compensate for like the dumb way of
 

1923
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,909
compensate for like the dumb way of
going about it a lot of traditional

screams in my head like this is what
this is what should change based on the

1968
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:03,899
this is what should change based on the
 

1969
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,110
this is what should change based on the
you know million videos I've watched and

1970
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,120
you know million videos I've watched and
 

1971
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,669
you know million videos I've watched and
all these viral videos are consumed like

1972
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
all these viral videos are consumed like
 

1973
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,590
all these viral videos are consumed like
this is blah blah what's optimal and

1974
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
this is blah blah what's optimal and
 

1975
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,810
this is blah blah what's optimal and
things like that it's almost like your

things like that it's almost like your
 

1977
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,070
things like that it's almost like your
brain's like a

1978
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,080
brain's like a
 

1979
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,049
brain's like a
you know like a neural net like if you

1980
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:15,059
you know like a neural net like if you
 

1981
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,990
you know like a neural net like if you
consume enough viral videos and enough

1982
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,000
consume enough viral videos and enough
 

1983
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,610
consume enough viral videos and enough
good content that you just kind of start

1984
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:19,620

00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,409
good content that you just kind of start
to like train your brain to like see it

1986

to like train your brain to like see it
 

1987
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:22,909
to like train your brain to like see it
and see these patterns that happen in

1988
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:22,919
and see these patterns that happen in
 

1989
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,769
and see these patterns that happen in
all these viral videos and so that

1990
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:24,779
all these viral videos and so that
 

1991
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,570
all these viral videos and so that
anytime I watch a video or a movie or

1992
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:26,580
anytime I watch a video or a movie or
 

1993
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,710
anytime I watch a video or a movie or
anything I just can't stop thinking

1994
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:27,720
anything I just can't stop thinking
 

1995
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,870
anything I just can't stop thinking
about what is optimal and so it's like

1996
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:29,880
about what is optimal and so it's like
 

1997
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,549
about what is optimal and so it's like
it gives me a headache sometimes when I

1998
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:31,559
it gives me a headache sometimes when I
 

1999
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,810
it gives me a headache sometimes when I
watch something too slow or I don't

2000
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:32,820
watch something too slow or I don't
 

2001
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,549
watch something too slow or I don't
think it's optimal obviously my taste

2002
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:34,559
think it's optimal obviously my taste
 

2003
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,470
think it's optimal obviously my taste
isn't the end-all feel

2004
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:36,480
isn't the end-all feel
 

2005
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,909
isn't the end-all feel
um but that's something that kind of

2006
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
um but that's something that kind of
 

2007
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,830
um but that's something that kind of
torments me if that makes any sense

2008
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:39,840
torments me if that makes any sense
 

2009
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,350
torments me if that makes any sense
oh you can't enjoy a slow moving no I

2010
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,360
oh you can't enjoy a slow moving no I
 

2011
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,029
oh you can't enjoy a slow moving no I
can't movie and and that's not to say

2012
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:44,039
can't movie and and that's not to say
 

2013
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,649
can't movie and and that's not to say
there's attention on The Godfather is

2014
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:45,659
there's attention on The Godfather is
 

2015
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,389
there's attention on The Godfather is
horrible yeah no exactly I've tried to

2016
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:47,399
horrible yeah no exactly I've tried to
 

2017
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,649
horrible yeah no exactly I've tried to
watch that movie like three times but

2018
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:48,659
watch that movie like three times but
 

2019
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,269
watch that movie like three times but
and that's not to say slow movies are

2020
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:50,279
and that's not to say slow movies are
 

2021
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,889
and that's not to say slow movies are
bad like there's an audience for it it's

2022
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:51,899
bad like there's an audience for it it's
 

2023
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,750
bad like there's an audience for it it's
just obviously not what I've trained my

2024
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
just obviously not what I've trained my
 

2025
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,450
just obviously not what I've trained my
brain to like and and social media and

2026
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:56,460
brain to like and and social media and
 

2027
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,310
brain to like and and social media and
YouTube right now like that's just not

2028
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
YouTube right now like that's just not
 

2029
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,110
YouTube right now like that's just not
the meta and in general like you said in

2030
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,120
the meta and in general like you said in
 

2031
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,909
the meta and in general like you said in
neural network you're training your

2032
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
neural network you're training your
 

2033
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:02,990
neural network you're training your
brain

2034
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,000
brain
 

2035
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,210
brain
in part on actual data

2036
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:05,220
in part on actual data
 

2037
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,070
in part on actual data
right so you're actually it's data

2038
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,080
right so you're actually it's data
 

2039
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,630
right so you're actually it's data
driven so you're looking at like in

2040
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:08,640
driven so you're looking at like in
 

2041
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,789
driven so you're looking at like in
terms of thumbnails and titles and

2042
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
terms of thumbnails and titles and
 

2043
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,710
terms of thumbnails and titles and
different aspects of the first five ten

2044
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
different aspects of the first five ten
 

2045
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,570
different aspects of the first five ten
seconds and then throw out the video the

2046
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:14,580
seconds and then throw out the video the
 

2047
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,190
seconds and then throw out the video the
retention all that you're looking at all

2048
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,200
retention all that you're looking at all
 

2049
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,350
retention all that you're looking at all
that

2050
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,360
that
 

2051
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,269
that
uh for your own videos to understand how

2052
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:20,279
uh for your own videos to understand how
 

2053
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,590
uh for your own videos to understand how
to do it better so that's where the

2054
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,600
to do it better so that's where the
 

2055
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,049
to do it better so that's where the
neural network is training yeah

2056
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:23,059
neural network is training yeah
 

2057
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:25,789
neural network is training yeah
basically there are ways you can kind of

2058
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:25,799
basically there are ways you can kind of
 

2059
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,230
basically there are ways you can kind of
see like the most view videos on YouTube

2060
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,240
see like the most view videos on YouTube
 

2061
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,970
see like the most view videos on YouTube
every day and stuff like that and I just

2062
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:28,980
every day and stuff like that and I just
 

2063
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,289
every day and stuff like that and I just
kind of consume those every single day

2064
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:30,299
kind of consume those every single day
 

2065
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,850
kind of consume those every single day
and I've been doing that for way too

2066
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:31,860
and I've been doing that for way too
 

2067
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,470
and I've been doing that for way too
many years and then you just start to

2068
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:33,480
many years and then you just start to
 

2069
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,630
many years and then you just start to
notice patterns like the thumbnails on

2070
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:35,640
notice patterns like the thumbnails on
 

2071
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,549
notice patterns like the thumbnails on
the most view videos or videos that go

2072
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:37,559
the most view videos or videos that go
 

2073
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,830
the most view videos or videos that go
super viral tend to be clear tend to not

2074
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
super viral tend to be clear tend to not
 

2075
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,210
super viral tend to be clear tend to not
have much clutter tend to be pretty

2076
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,220
have much clutter tend to be pretty
 

2077
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,950
have much clutter tend to be pretty
simple titles tend to be less than 50

2078
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:42,960
simple titles tend to be less than 50
 

2079
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,269
simple titles tend to be less than 50
characters intros tend to be this

2080
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:44,279
characters intros tend to be this
 

2081
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,310
characters intros tend to be this
stories tend to be this and you just

2082
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
stories tend to be this and you just
 

2083
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,690
stories tend to be this and you just
kind of like after you see those

2084
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:47,700
kind of like after you see those
 

2085
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,130
kind of like after you see those
thousands and then tens of thousands of

2086
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:49,140
thousands and then tens of thousands of
 

2087
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,690
thousands and then tens of thousands of
time it just starts to click in your

2088
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:50,700
time it just starts to click in your
 

2089
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,370
time it just starts to click in your
head like this is what it looks like you

2090
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:52,380
head like this is what it looks like you
 

2091
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,549
head like this is what it looks like you
know so how are you able to transfer

2092
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:55,559
know so how are you able to transfer
 

2093
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,710
know so how are you able to transfer
that taste that you've developed to the

2094
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:57,720
that taste that you've developed to the
 

2095
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,810
that taste that you've developed to the
team so for like because you said like

2096
00:33:59,810 --> 00:33:59,820
team so for like because you said like
 

2097
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,190
team so for like because you said like
broad things but I'm sure there's a

2098
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,200
broad things but I'm sure there's a
 

2099
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,470
broad things but I'm sure there's a
million detailed things like what Zoom

2100
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:03,480
million detailed things like what Zoom
 

2101
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,789
million detailed things like what Zoom
to use on the face to use in the

2102
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:04,799
to use on the face to use in the
 

2103
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,470
to use on the face to use in the
thumbnail right like the answer is

2104
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480
thumbnail right like the answer is
 

2105
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,750
thumbnail right like the answer is
whatever makes the best video because

2106
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:08,760
whatever makes the best video because
 

2107
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,369
whatever makes the best video because
the problem is the more

2108
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:10,379
the problem is the more
 

2109
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,050
the problem is the more
which I have so many friends who are

2110
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,060
which I have so many friends who are
 

2111
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,310
which I have so many friends who are
like this they'll make like checklists

2112
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:13,320
like this they'll make like checklists
 

2113
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,750
like this they'll make like checklists
for their editor or something like you

2114
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:14,760
for their editor or something like you
 

2115
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,490
for their editor or something like you
know uh this be in this beat and you

2116
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:16,500
know uh this be in this beat and you
 

2117
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,990
know uh this be in this beat and you
need to have like a three part Arc and

2118
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
need to have like a three part Arc and
 

2119
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,970
need to have like a three part Arc and
then this but the the problem is that's

2120
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:19,980
then this but the the problem is that's
 

2121
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,669
then this but the the problem is that's
how you the the more constraints you put

2122
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:22,679
how you the the more constraints you put
 

2123
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,849
how you the the more constraints you put
on the team the more repetitive and less

2124
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:25,859
on the team the more repetitive and less
 

2125
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,190
on the team the more repetitive and less
Innovation you get and the more like you

2126
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,200
Innovation you get and the more like you
 

2127
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,570
Innovation you get and the more like you
know after 10 videos people are gonna be

2128
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:29,580
know after 10 videos people are gonna be
 

2129
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,770
know after 10 videos people are gonna be
like all right I've already seen this so

2130
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:30,780
like all right I've already seen this so
 

2131
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,589
like all right I've already seen this so
to me and I'm 24 and you know I'm

2132
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:33,599
to me and I'm 24 and you know I'm
 

2133
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,270
to me and I'm 24 and you know I'm
probably my mindset will change over the

2134
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:35,280
probably my mindset will change over the
 

2135
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,829
probably my mindset will change over the
next 10 years I just haven't been in

2136
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:36,839
next 10 years I just haven't been in
 

2137
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,450
next 10 years I just haven't been in
this industry too long but the only way

2138
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:38,460
this industry too long but the only way
 

2139
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,490
this industry too long but the only way
to like really make Innovative content

2140
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:40,500
to like really make Innovative content
 

2141
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,109
to like really make Innovative content
and keep things fresh is to not put

2142
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:42,119
and keep things fresh is to not put
 

2143
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,970
and keep things fresh is to not put
constraints on or put as little as

2144
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:43,980
constraints on or put as little as
 

2145
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,889
constraints on or put as little as
possible and so that's why I'm very

2146
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:45,899
possible and so that's why I'm very
 

2147
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:47,990
possible and so that's why I'm very
hesitant on all that stuff because the

2148
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
hesitant on all that stuff because the
 

2149
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,669
hesitant on all that stuff because the
more I say the more they're gonna be

2150
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:49,679
more I say the more they're gonna be
 

2151
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,050
more I say the more they're gonna be
like oh then that's what we do and then

2152
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,060

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:20,520
and then I'll freeze up it's very weird
 

2241
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,490
and then I'll freeze up it's very weird
when I'm filming and then for people who

00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:22,500
when I'm filming and then for people who
 

2243
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,990
when I'm filming and then for people who
haven't worked with me too much they'll

00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
haven't worked with me too much they'll
 

2245
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,030
haven't worked with me too much they'll
think like I don't know it's very weird

2263
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,970
because I it's weird I can perfectly
picture what I'm filming by just looking

2264
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:40,980
picture what I'm filming by just looking
 

2265
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,230
picture what I'm filming by just looking
at the camera and then putting myself

2266
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,240
at the camera and then putting myself
 

2267
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,630
at the camera and then putting myself
through the lens of the camera while

2268
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640
through the lens of the camera while
 

2269
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,970
through the lens of the camera while
making content and I can do it at the

2270
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:46,980
making content and I can do it at the
 

2271
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,530
making content and I can do it at the
same time so you're like real time

2272
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:48,540
same time so you're like real time
 

2273
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,569
same time so you're like real time
editing in my video yeah that's

2274
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:50,579
editing in my video yeah that's
 

2275
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,730
editing in my video yeah that's
something that didn't at the start come

2276
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:52,740
something that didn't at the start come
 

2277
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,410
something that didn't at the start come
natural to me but in the last probably

2278
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:54,420
natural to me but in the last probably
 

2279
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,170
natural to me but in the last probably
like five years it's happened and so I

2280
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:57,180
like five years it's happened and so I
 

2281
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,010
like five years it's happened and so I
would say it's one of my greatest

2282
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:58,020
would say it's one of my greatest
 

2283
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,030
would say it's one of my greatest
strengths but I don't know how I

2284
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
strengths but I don't know how I
 

2285
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,829
strengths but I don't know how I
developed it but anytime I'm filming

2286
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:00,839
developed it but anytime I'm filming
 

2287
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,290
developed it but anytime I'm filming
anything like it's almost like the like

2288
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:03,300
anything like it's almost like the like
 

2289
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,849
anything like it's almost like the like
right side of my brain I just can just

2290
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:04,859
right side of my brain I just can just
 

2291
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,230
right side of my brain I just can just
look at it and I see exactly what I'm

2292
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240

filming and I can just picture it well
 

2295
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,890
filming and I can just picture it well
there's probably recording the video

2296
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:09,900
there's probably recording the video
 

2297
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,630
there's probably recording the video
being the talent for the video and then

2298

being the talent for the video and then
 

2299
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,730
being the talent for the video and then

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,010
you careful and do that over and over
again you'll do that over and over you

2304
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,020
again you'll do that over and over you
 

2305
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,810
again you'll do that over and over you
ten thousand times yeah you do the

2306
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:17,820
ten thousand times yeah you do the
 

2307
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,609
ten thousand times yeah you do the
editing more than the being in front of

2308
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:19,619
editing more than the being in front of
 

2309
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,790
editing more than the being in front of
the camera so like you

2310
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
the camera so like you
 

2311
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,230
the camera so like you
you start to see yourself from that

2312
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,240
you start to see yourself from that
 

2313
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,970
you start to see yourself from that
third person perspective exactly then

2314
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:25,980
third person perspective exactly then
 

2315
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,230
third person perspective exactly then
maybe that actually helps with the

2316
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,240
maybe that actually helps with the
 

2317
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,810
maybe that actually helps with the
nerves of it too like you see it as

2318
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:29,820
nerves of it too like you see it as
 

2319
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,630
nerves of it too like you see it as
creating a video versus performing uh

2320
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:32,640
creating a video versus performing uh
 

2321
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,849
creating a video versus performing uh
right yeah yeah I think so you know I

2322
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:34,859
right yeah yeah I think so you know I
 

2323
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,589
right yeah yeah I think so you know I
it's weird I've never

been nervous talking to a camera it's
 

2327
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,370
been nervous talking to a camera it's
it's harder for me to talk to a person

2328
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:40,380
it's harder for me to talk to a person
 

2329
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,290
it's harder for me to talk to a person
that doesn't talk to a camera which I

2330
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:42,300
that doesn't talk to a camera which I
 

2331
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,730
that doesn't talk to a camera which I
feel like a lot of people say that

2332
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:43,740
feel like a lot of people say that
 

2333
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,589
feel like a lot of people say that
though that are whatever make content

2334
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:45,599
though that are whatever make content

it's I mean both are terrifying but
 

2345
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,310
it's I mean both are terrifying but
being in front of the camera by yourself

2346
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:55,320
being in front of the camera by yourself
 

2347
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,430
being in front of the camera by yourself
is so much easier really yeah so much

it's just that's why it's interesting

2356
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:05,099
it's just that's why it's interesting
 

2357
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,290
it's just that's why it's interesting
like you've spent more of your time

00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,270
and I talk to
a piece of plastic oh yeah I guess

2364
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,280
a piece of plastic oh yeah I guess
 

2365
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,410
a piece of plastic oh yeah I guess
you're talking to a person too they're

you're talking to a person too they're
just then on the other side of the

2368
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:13,740
just then on the other side of the
 

2369
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,230
just then on the other side of the
camera yeah there's just a pixel on the

2370
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,240
camera yeah there's just a pixel on the
 

2371
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,050
camera yeah there's just a pixel on the
screen so so cloning how do you how do

2372
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,060
screen so so cloning how do you how do
 

2373
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,010
screen so so cloning how do you how do
you achieve this oh yeah that's right

2374
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,020
you achieve this oh yeah that's right
 

2375
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,290
you achieve this oh yeah that's right
that's all right so I was showing him

2376
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:21,300
that's all right so I was showing him
 

2377
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,609
that's all right so I was showing him
that I have a lot of people in the

2378
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:22,619
that I have a lot of people in the
 

2379
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,170
that I have a lot of people in the
company who are able to think like me

2380
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:24,180
company who are able to think like me
 

2381
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,890
company who are able to think like me
and uh basically make decisions like I

2382
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:27,900
and uh basically make decisions like I
 

2383
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,349
and uh basically make decisions like I
would make if I was like if you were

2384
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:30,359
would make if I was like if you were
 

2385
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,510
would make if I was like if you were
asked hey in this video should we climb

2386
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:32,520
asked hey in this video should we climb
 

2387
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,370
asked hey in this video should we climb
a mountain or should we dig a hole right

2388
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:34,380
a mountain or should we dig a hole right
 

2389
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,170
a mountain or should we dig a hole right
and like you know they would pick the

2390
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:36,180
and like you know they would pick the
 

2391
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,849
and like you know they would pick the
same answer I'd pick 90 plus percent of

2392
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:37,859
same answer I'd pick 90 plus percent of
 

2393
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,130
same answer I'd pick 90 plus percent of
the times and so one example is Tyler

2394
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,140
the times and so one example is Tyler
 

2395
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,870
the times and so one example is Tyler
who I was showing you and he was

2396
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:41,880
who I was showing you and he was
 

2397
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,790
who I was showing you and he was
pitching some content and you could see

2398
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:43,800
pitching some content and you could see
 

2399
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,310
pitching some content and you could see
it like this he was on point and uh

2400
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,320
it like this he was on point and uh
 

2401
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,069
it like this he was on point and uh
basically for just four or five years we

um he could just do things without my
 

2455
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,390
um he could just do things without my
input without me having to constantly

2456
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:41,400
input without me having to constantly
 

2457
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,130
input without me having to constantly
watch over him or give him advice and

2458
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,140
watch over him or give him advice and
 

2459
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,930
watch over him or give him advice and
and that's where we've gotten like so

2460
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:44,940
and that's where we've gotten like so
 

2461
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,010
and that's where we've gotten like so
for the first six months he didn't do

2462
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,020
for the first six months he didn't do
 

2463
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,690
for the first six months he didn't do
anything he just studied me and studied

2464
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:47,700
anything he just studied me and studied
 

2465
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,430
anything he just studied me and studied
everything I cared about and how I spoke

2466
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
everything I cared about and how I spoke
 

2467
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,990
everything I cared about and how I spoke
and blah blah and then the next six

2468
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,000
and blah blah and then the next six
 

2469
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,550
and blah blah and then the next six
months he started taking on some

2470
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
months he started taking on some
 

2471
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,710
months he started taking on some
responsibilities and now he can just run

2472
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:54,720
responsibilities and now he can just run
 

2473
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,930
responsibilities and now he can just run
the company and you know I don't ever

2474
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:56,940
the company and you know I don't ever
 

2475
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,430
the company and you know I don't ever
really have to check in on him like I

2476
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:58,440
really have to check in on him like I
 

2477
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,230
really have to check in on him like I
most the decisions he makes are exactly

2478
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,240
most the decisions he makes are exactly
 

2479
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,609
most the decisions he makes are exactly
what I would do

2480
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:01,619
what I would do
 

2481
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,250
what I would do
um and so I I call that cloning I don't

2482
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:04,260
um and so I I call that cloning I don't
 

2483
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,390
um and so I I call that cloning I don't
know what other people would but it's

2484
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:05,400
know what other people would but it's
 

2485
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,010
know what other people would but it's
just like finding people that are really

2486
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,020
just like finding people that are really
 

2487
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,990
just like finding people that are really
obsessed and they just kind of really

2488
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,000
obsessed and they just kind of really
 

2489
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,730
obsessed and they just kind of really
want it and just being like giving them

2490
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:10,740
want it and just being like giving them
 

2491
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,069
want it and just being like giving them
an Avenue to like get it if that makes

2492
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:13,079
an Avenue to like get it if that makes
 

2493
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,990
an Avenue to like get it if that makes
any sense another way to see it is

2494
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,000
any sense another way to see it is
 

2495
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,490
any sense another way to see it is
you're converging towards a common

2496
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:16,500
you're converging towards a common
 

2497
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,370
you're converging towards a common
vision and that makes like brainstorming

2498
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:19,380
vision and that makes like brainstorming
 

2499
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,470
vision and that makes like brainstorming
much more productive yeah it just makes

2500
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:21,480
much more productive yeah it just makes
 

2501
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,630
much more productive yeah it just makes
it where I don't have to be so involved

2502
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:23,640
it where I don't have to be so involved
 

2503
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,130
it where I don't have to be so involved
in everything because I just have these

2504
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,140
in everything because I just have these
 

2505
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,829
in everything because I just have these
people I know will think like I will uh

2506
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
people I know will think like I will uh
 

2507
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,650
people I know will think like I will uh
at least relatively close to it so I can

2508
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:30,660
at least relatively close to it so I can
 

2509
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,329
at least relatively close to it so I can
kind of almost be in multiple places at

2510
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:32,339
kind of almost be in multiple places at
 

2511
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,730
kind of almost be in multiple places at
once per se and so these things that you

2512
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:34,740
once per se and so these things that you
 

2513
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,010
once per se and so these things that you
know I still approve every idea we film

2514
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:37,020
know I still approve every idea we film
 

2515
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,810
know I still approve every idea we film
and you know everything before we film

2516
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:38,820
and you know everything before we film
 

2517
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,849
and you know everything before we film
it all the creative I approve it but I

2518
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:40,859
it all the creative I approve it but I
 

2519
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,890
it all the creative I approve it but I
don't have to like be in the weeds and

2520
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:42,900
don't have to like be in the weeds and
 

2521
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,230
don't have to like be in the weeds and
nuances and do all this minor stuff I

2522
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,240
nuances and do all this minor stuff I
 

2523
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,370
nuances and do all this minor stuff I
can just let them handle it I can just

2524
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:46,380
can just let them handle it I can just
 

2525
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,170
can just let them handle it I can just
do the more macro things I got a chance

2526
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:48,180
do the more macro things I got a chance
 

2527
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,170
do the more macro things I got a chance
to sit in to a lengthy brainstorming

2528
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:51,180
to sit in to a lengthy brainstorming
 

2529
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,810
to sit in to a lengthy brainstorming
session with Tyler and others that was

2530
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:53,820
session with Tyler and others that was
 

2531
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,950
session with Tyler and others that was
really cool

2532
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:54,960
really cool
 

2533
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,290
really cool
can you talk about the process of that

2534
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:57,300
can you talk about the process of that
 

2535
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,630
can you talk about the process of that
of uh

2536
00:40:59,630 --> 00:40:59,640
of uh
 

2537
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,730
of uh
people pitching ideas

2538
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:01,740
people pitching ideas
 

2539
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,190
people pitching ideas
and you pitching Alternatives or

2540
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,200
and you pitching Alternatives or
 

2541
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,810
and you pitching Alternatives or
shutting down ideas and it's just going

2542
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:05,820
shutting down ideas and it's just going
 

2543
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,670
shutting down ideas and it's just going
like plowing through ideas very good I

2544
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
like plowing through ideas very good I
 

2545
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,190
like plowing through ideas very good I
mean you kind of just describe exactly

2546
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,200
mean you kind of just describe exactly
 

2547
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,230
mean you kind of just describe exactly
what we did yeah I mean but the ideas

2548
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,240
what we did yeah I mean but the ideas
 

2549
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,390
what we did yeah I mean but the ideas
are really really good it's just tossing

2550
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
are really really good it's just tossing
 

2551
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,770
are really really good it's just tossing
out

2552
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:15,780
out
 

2553
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,950
out
like different categories of ideas and

2554
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:18,960
like different categories of ideas and
 

2555
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,750
like different categories of ideas and
then also fine-tuning them to see like

2556
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:20,760
then also fine-tuning them to see like
 

2557
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,490
then also fine-tuning them to see like
you know I changed like thinking about

2558
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:22,500
you know I changed like thinking about
 

2559
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,990
you know I changed like thinking about
the titles and the stuff I worked so

2560
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
the titles and the stuff I worked so
 

2561
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,450
the titles and the stuff I worked so
well off of inspiration it's like that's

2562
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:26,460
well off of inspiration it's like that's
 

2563
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,609
well off of inspiration it's like that's
a something

2564
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:28,619
a something
 

2565
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,790
a something
like give give me anywhere I don't know

2566
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:30,800
like give give me anywhere I don't know
 

2567
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,950
like give give me anywhere I don't know
space yeah like I went to space you know

2568
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:33,960
space yeah like I went to space you know
 

2569
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,630
space yeah like I went to space you know
what happens if you love a nuke in space

2570
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:35,640
what happens if you love a nuke in space
 

2571
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,310
what happens if you love a nuke in space
or I went to the moon I went to Mars

2572
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:37,320
or I went to the moon I went to Mars
 

2573
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,770
or I went to the moon I went to Mars
right because you said that one word it

2574
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:39,780
right because you said that one word it
 

2575
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,569
right because you said that one word it
was able to inspire me to come up with

2576
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:41,579
was able to inspire me to come up with
 

2577
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:44,450
was able to inspire me to come up with
four ideas and so that's just it's for

2578
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:44,460
four ideas and so that's just it's for
 

2579
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,290
four ideas and so that's just it's for
me

2580
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:45,300
me
 

2581
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,810
me
if you the way to get 100 million views

2582
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:47,820
if you the way to get 100 million views
 

2583
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,890
if you the way to get 100 million views
on videos you need something original

2584
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:48,900
on videos you need something original
 

2585
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,990
on videos you need something original
creative something people really need to

2586
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,000
creative something people really need to
 

2587
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,849
creative something people really need to
see ideally never been done before all

2588
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:52,859
see ideally never been done before all
 

2589
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,010
see ideally never been done before all
these like things and so you need like

2590
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:55,020
these like things and so you need like
 

2591
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,210
these like things and so you need like
if you want to consistently go

2592
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:56,220
if you want to consistently go
 

2593
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,530
if you want to consistently go
supervisor you need just a constant

2594
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:57,540
supervisor you need just a constant
 

2595
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,270
supervisor you need just a constant
stream of ideas and the only way I've

2596
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,280
stream of ideas and the only way I've
 

2597
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,430
stream of ideas and the only way I've
really found that I can consistently

2598
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
really found that I can consistently
 

2599
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,650
really found that I can consistently
come up with 100 million view videos is

2600
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:03,660
come up with 100 million view videos is
 

2601
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,569
come up with 100 million view videos is
to intake inspiration and then see what

2602
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:05,579
to intake inspiration and then see what
 

2603
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,510
to intake inspiration and then see what
my brain outputs and so that's kind of

2604
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:08,520
my brain outputs and so that's kind of
 

2605
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,190
my brain outputs and so that's kind of
at its core Foundation what I'm doing

2606
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,200
at its core Foundation what I'm doing
 

2607
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,930
at its core Foundation what I'm doing
there is just like in taking a lot of

2608
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:11,940
there is just like in taking a lot of
 

2609
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,390
there is just like in taking a lot of
random inspiration to see what spawns in

2610
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
random inspiration to see what spawns in
 

2611
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,430
random inspiration to see what spawns in

00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:17,640
neural network of your brain is
 

2615
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,089
neural network of your brain is

the video the title the thumbnail all

2618
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,200
the video the title the thumbnail all
 

2619
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,530
the video the title the thumbnail all
that jointly exactly and that only comes

00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:24,540

because I spent 10 years of my life just

2622
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:26,579
because I spent 10 years of my life just
 

2623
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:28,250
because I spent 10 years of my life just
obsessively studying all that stuff

2624
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:28,260
obsessively studying all that stuff
 

2625
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,710
obsessively studying all that stuff
because you I mean it seems like you

2626
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
because you I mean it seems like you
 

2627
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,930
because you I mean it seems like you
would literally potentially shut down a

2628
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:32,940
would literally potentially shut down a
 

2629
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,069
would literally potentially shut down a
video just because you can't come up

2630
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:34,079
video just because you can't come up
 

2631
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,410
video just because you can't come up
with a good title yeah or a thumbnail

2632
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:36,420
with a good title yeah or a thumbnail
 

2633
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,970
with a good title yeah or a thumbnail
yeah I mean that's what happened to 70

2634
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:37,980
yeah I mean that's what happened to 70
 

2635
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,530
yeah I mean that's what happened to 70
of those in that pitch session I was

2636
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:39,540
of those in that pitch session I was
 

2637
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,390
of those in that pitch session I was
just like oh what was one of them genius

2638
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:41,400
just like oh what was one of them genius
 

2639
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,550
just like oh what was one of them genius
versus 100 people or yeah like maybe

2640
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:43,560
versus 100 people or yeah like maybe
 

2641
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,470
versus 100 people or yeah like maybe
average intelligence versus genius yeah

2642
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:45,480
average intelligence versus genius yeah
 

2643
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,630
average intelligence versus genius yeah
I was like what the heck is the

2644
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:47,640
I was like what the heck is the
 

2645
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,950
I was like what the heck is the
thumbnail even if the title was good

2646
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:48,960
thumbnail even if the title was good
 

2647
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,109
thumbnail even if the title was good
yeah yeah I mean there's so many but

2648
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
yeah yeah I mean there's so many but
 

2649
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,450
yeah yeah I mean there's so many but
yeah people don't click they don't watch

2650
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:53,460
yeah people don't click they don't watch
 

2651
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,310
yeah people don't click they don't watch
that's so interesting but you developed

2652
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:55,320
that's so interesting but you developed
 

2653
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,829
that's so interesting but you developed
over time the ability to kind of give it

2654
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:57,839
over time the ability to kind of give it
 

2655
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,990
over time the ability to kind of give it
what what makes for a good title short

2656
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,000
what what makes for a good title short
 

2657
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,010
what what makes for a good title short
not just short it's also I mean

2658
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,020
not just short it's also I mean
 

2659
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,770
not just short it's also I mean
if someone reads it are they like do

2660
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:06,780
if someone reads it are they like do
 

2661
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,870
if someone reads it are they like do
they have to watch it is it just so

2662
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:08,880
they have to watch it is it just so
 

2663
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,609
they have to watch it is it just so
intrinsically interesting that it's just

2664
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:10,619
intrinsically interesting that it's just
 

2665
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,530
intrinsically interesting that it's just
gonna [\h__\h] with them if they don't click

2666
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:12,540
gonna [\h__\h] with them if they don't click
 

2667
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,210
gonna [\h__\h] with them if they don't click
on it you know what I mean so it doesn't

2668
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:14,220
on it you know what I mean so it doesn't
 

2669
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,730
on it you know what I mean so it doesn't
have to be short but it has to be

2670
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:16,740
have to be short but it has to be
 

2671
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,430
have to be short but it has to be
like you almost want to have a retention

2672
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:19,440
like you almost want to have a retention
 

2673
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,849
like you almost want to have a retention
to word by word reading ideally it's a

2674
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:22,859
to word by word reading ideally it's a
 

2675
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:24,470
to word by word reading ideally it's a
title also that

2676
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
title also that
 

2677
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,849
title also that
um you know because the titles don't

2678
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:25,859
um you know because the titles don't
 

2679
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,890
um you know because the titles don't
live in a vacuum right so it has to lead

2680
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:27,900
live in a vacuum right so it has to lead
 

2681
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,870
live in a vacuum right so it has to lead
into the content so ideally the title

2682
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:29,880
into the content so ideally the title
 

2683
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,030
into the content so ideally the title
represents content that you would want

2684
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,040
represents content that you would want
 

2685
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,410
represents content that you would want
to watch for 20 minutes so if it's a 20

2686
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:33,420
to watch for 20 minutes so if it's a 20
 

2687
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,450
to watch for 20 minutes so if it's a 20
minute video and the title is I stepped

2688
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:35,460
minute video and the title is I stepped
 

2689
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,730
minute video and the title is I stepped
on a bug it's not gonna because it's all

2690
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:37,740
on a bug it's not gonna because it's all
 

2691
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,530
on a bug it's not gonna because it's all
of it combined it's the click-through

2692
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:39,540
of it combined it's the click-through
 

2693
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,030
of it combined it's the click-through
rate is going to be much lower and then

2694
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,040
rate is going to be much lower and then
 

2695
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,050
rate is going to be much lower and then
if it was like a five second video

2696
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,060
if it was like a five second video
 

2697
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,970
if it was like a five second video
people might click it so you gotta like

2698
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:43,980
people might click it so you gotta like
 

2699
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,829
people might click it so you gotta like
even nuances of the length of the video

2700
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:45,839
even nuances of the length of the video
 

2701
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,510
even nuances of the length of the video
based against the title will affect

2702
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
based against the title will affect
 

2703
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,650
based against the title will affect
whether people want to click it because

2704
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:48,660
whether people want to click it because
 

2705
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,390
whether people want to click it because
sometimes they just all add up I mean

2706
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
sometimes they just all add up I mean
 

2707
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,490
sometimes they just all add up I mean
it's that yes ideally you want it below

2708
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:52,500
it's that yes ideally you want it below
 

2709
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,870
it's that yes ideally you want it below
50 characters because above 50

2710
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:53,880
50 characters because above 50
 

2711
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,370
50 characters because above 50
characters on certain devices you run

2712
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:55,380
characters on certain devices you run
 

2713
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,349
characters on certain devices you run
the chance of it going dot dot dot so

2714
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:57,359
the chance of it going dot dot dot so
 

2715
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,410
the chance of it going dot dot dot so
like I took a light pole and I saw how

2716
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:00,420
like I took a light pole and I saw how
 

2717
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,450
like I took a light pole and I saw how
many dollar bills I could stack on top

2718
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:02,460
many dollar bills I could stack on top
 

2719
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,950
many dollar bills I could stack on top
and they would just go dot dot because

2720
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:03,960
and they would just go dot dot because
 

2721
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,630
and they would just go dot dot because
it's too long and it can't finish it and

2722
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:05,640
it's too long and it can't finish it and
 

2723
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,770
it's too long and it can't finish it and
that's the worst thing because then

2724
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:06,780
that's the worst thing because then
 

2725
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,550
that's the worst thing because then
people don't even know what they're

2726
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:07,560
people don't even know what they're
 

2727
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,930
people don't even know what they're
clicking on and so it's going to do even

2728
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:08,940
clicking on and so it's going to do even
 

2729
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,130
clicking on and so it's going to do even
worse

2730
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,140
worse
 

2731
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,950
worse
um short simple ideally and just so

2732
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
um short simple ideally and just so
 

2733
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,270
um short simple ideally and just so
freaking interesting they have to click

2734
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:14,280
freaking interesting they have to click
 

2735
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,490
freaking interesting they have to click
and it is a good segue into the content

2736
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:16,500
and it is a good segue into the content
 

2737
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,230
and it is a good segue into the content
and represents the length of the content

2738
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:18,240
and represents the length of the content
 

2739
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,849
and represents the length of the content
and there's probably stuff it's hard to

2740
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:19,859
and there's probably stuff it's hard to
 

2741
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,010
and there's probably stuff it's hard to
kind of convert into words for you like

2742
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,020
kind of convert into words for you like
 

2743
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,010
kind of convert into words for you like
I stepped on a bug versus stepping in a

2744
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,020
I stepped on a bug versus stepping in a
 

2745
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,530
I stepped on a bug versus stepping in a
bug versus Mr B stepped on the bus well

2746
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:27,540
bug versus Mr B stepped on the bus well
 

2747
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,290
bug versus Mr B stepped on the bus well
I mean that bug stepping that up so it's

2748
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:30,300
I mean that bug stepping that up so it's
 

2749
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,690
I mean that bug stepping that up so it's
like yes the more extreme the opinion

2750
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:32,700
like yes the more extreme the opinion
 

2751
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,770
like yes the more extreme the opinion
typically the higher the click-through

2752
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:33,780
typically the higher the click-through
 

2753
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,290
typically the higher the click-through
rate if you can like uh

2754
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:36,300
rate if you can like uh
 

2755
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,569
rate if you can like uh
pay it off in the content then it just

2756
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:38,579
pay it off in the content then it just
 

2757
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,550
pay it off in the content then it just
supercharges it so like oh so you have a

2758
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:40,560
supercharges it so like oh so you have a
 

2759
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,770
supercharges it so like oh so you have a
kind of estimate of the experience this

2760
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:42,780
kind of estimate of the experience this
 

2761
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,829
kind of estimate of the experience this
water right if you're like

2762
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:44,839
water right if you're like
 

2763
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:47,569
water right if you're like

00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,390
have to deliver because the more extreme
you are the more extreme you have to be

2778
00:44:59,390 --> 00:44:59,400
you are the more extreme you have to be
 

2779
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,190
you are the more extreme you have to be
in the video yeah that's almost

2780
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,200
in the video yeah that's almost
 

2781
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,130
in the video yeah that's almost
inspiration for you to step up yeah but

2782
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:04,140
inspiration for you to step up yeah but
 

2783
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,690
inspiration for you to step up yeah but
you can you can be more extreme in a

2784
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:05,700
you can you can be more extreme in a
 

2785
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,609
you can you can be more extreme in a
positive way a lot of people it's easier

2786
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:07,619
positive way a lot of people it's easier
 

2787
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:08,390
positive way a lot of people it's easier
though

2788
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
though
 

2789
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,829
though
pause it

2790
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:09,839
pause it
 

2791
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,650
pause it
uh negative clickbait is much easier

2792
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:12,660
uh negative clickbait is much easier
 

2793
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,750
uh negative clickbait is much easier
than positive Cliff it just is it's so

2794
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:14,760
than positive Cliff it just is it's so
 

2795
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,849
than positive Cliff it just is it's so
much easier to get Negative clicks and

2796
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:16,859
much easier to get Negative clicks and
 

2797
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:18,770
much easier to get Negative clicks and
so a lot of people are just in my

2798
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:18,780
so a lot of people are just in my
 

2799
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,569
so a lot of people are just in my
opinion you know a little bit lazier and

2800
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:20,579
opinion you know a little bit lazier and
 

2801
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:22,309
opinion you know a little bit lazier and
they just take the route like oh well

2802
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:22,319
they just take the route like oh well
 

2803
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,690
they just take the route like oh well
this one gets the same amount of clicks

2804
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:23,700
this one gets the same amount of clicks
 

2805
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,089
this one gets the same amount of clicks
and it's easier less effort the positive

2806
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:26,099
and it's easier less effort the positive
 

2807
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,790
and it's easier less effort the positive
one is doing a large number of numbers

2808
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:28,800
one is doing a large number of numbers
 

2809
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,190
one is doing a large number of numbers
of something like I I spent this number

2810
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
of something like I I spent this number
 

2811
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,870
of something like I I spent this number
of hours doing this or whatever if you

2812
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:32,880
of hours doing this or whatever if you
 

2813

of hours doing this or whatever if you
just wanted to help people or right it's

just wanted to help people or right it's
 

2815
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,190
just wanted to help people or right it's
just harder to get 10 million views on a

2816
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
just harder to get 10 million views on a
 

2817
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,569
just harder to get 10 million views on a
video helping people than it is to get

2818
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:38,579
video helping people than it is to get
 

2819
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:39,890
video helping people than it is to get
10 million views on a video tearing down

2820
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:39,900
10 million views on a video tearing down

hard some of that is giving away money

2834
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
hard some of that is giving away money
 

2835
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,490
hard some of that is giving away money
right yeah um what's the secret to that

2836
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:55,500
right yeah um what's the secret to that
 

2837
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,430
right yeah um what's the secret to that
what's how do you do do that right yeah

2838
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:58,440
what's how do you do do that right yeah
 

2839
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,069
what's how do you do do that right yeah
like give away money or in a video that

2840
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:01,079
like give away money or in a video that
 

2841
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,770
like give away money or in a video that
made to make it compelling

2842
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:03,780
made to make it compelling
 

2843
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,170
made to make it compelling
um is it so there's a number that is

2844
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:06,180
um is it so there's a number that is
 

2845
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,730
um is it so there's a number that is
better than another number right the

2846
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:07,740
better than another number right the
 

2847
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,990
better than another number right the
higher number is always better than the

2848
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:09,000
higher number is always better than the
 

2849
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,910
higher number is always better than the
other number yeah for the most part and

2850
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:10,920
other number yeah for the most part and
 

2851
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,190
other number yeah for the most part and
you know it's interesting like some

2852
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,200
you know it's interesting like some
 

2853
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,270
you know it's interesting like some
videos will give away a million dollars

2854
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:14,280
videos will give away a million dollars
 

2855
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,410
videos will give away a million dollars
some videos will give away half a

2856
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:15,420
some videos will give away half a
 

2857
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,390
some videos will give away half a
million there's not really I guess so

2858
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:17,400
million there's not really I guess so
 

2859
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,770
million there's not really I guess so
I'm retracting what I just said I was

2860
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:18,780
I'm retracting what I just said I was
 

2861
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,390
I'm retracting what I just said I was
more joking with that but there's no

2862
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,400
more joking with that but there's no
 

2863
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,190
more joking with that but there's no
difference whether I put 500k or a

2864
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:22,200
difference whether I put 500k or a
 

2865
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,510
difference whether I put 500k or a
million it's probably not even really a

2866
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
million it's probably not even really a
 

2867
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,770
million it's probably not even really a
difference between 100K a million I

2868
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:24,780
difference between 100K a million I
 

2869
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,630
difference between 100K a million I
haven't really looked into it like some

2870
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640
haven't really looked into it like some
 

2871
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,490
haven't really looked into it like some
of our mostly videos are not us giving

2872
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:28,500
of our mostly videos are not us giving
 

2873
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,750
of our mostly videos are not us giving
away a million dollars and sometimes the

2874
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
away a million dollars and sometimes the
 

2875
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,069
away a million dollars and sometimes the
million dollar videos just don't do as

2876
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:31,079
million dollar videos just don't do as
 

2877
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,870
million dollar videos just don't do as
well as the other ones so there there's

2878
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
well as the other ones so there there's
 

2879
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,030
well as the other ones so there there's
a certain point where a dollar amount is

2880
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
a certain point where a dollar amount is
 

2881
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,829
a certain point where a dollar amount is
just a large dollar amount to an average

2882
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:36,839
just a large dollar amount to an average
 

2883
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,650
just a large dollar amount to an average
human and so I think that point is 100k

2884
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:39,660
human and so I think that point is 100k
 

2885
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,809
human and so I think that point is 100k
like anything above 100K the average

2886
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:41,819
like anything above 100K the average
 

2887
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:43,370
like anything above 100K the average
human's just like that's a lot of money

2888
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:43,380
human's just like that's a lot of money
 

2889
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,470
human's just like that's a lot of money
you know it doesn't it doesn't 100K a

2890
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:45,480
you know it doesn't it doesn't 100K a
 

2891
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,210
you know it doesn't it doesn't 100K a
million like it doesn't really move the

2892
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:47,220
million like it doesn't really move the
 

2893
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,490
million like it doesn't really move the
needle if that makes sense which that's

2894
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:49,500
needle if that makes sense which that's
 

2895
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,589
needle if that makes sense which that's
a very nuanced piece of information that

2896
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
a very nuanced piece of information that
 

2897
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,050
a very nuanced piece of information that
applies to very few people but yeah well

2898
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:54,060
applies to very few people but yeah well
 

2899
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,609
applies to very few people but yeah well
no I think it applies it's fascinating

2900
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:55,619
no I think it applies it's fascinating
 

2901
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,490
no I think it applies it's fascinating
it's fascinating human our relationship

2902
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:58,500
it's fascinating human our relationship
 

2903
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,470
it's fascinating human our relationship

00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:14,700
what exactly is so joyful about that I
 

2917
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,190
what exactly is so joyful about that I
mean it depends where you are in life

2918
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:16,200
mean it depends where you are in life
 

2919
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,589
mean it depends where you are in life
what the situation is yeah I don't know

2920
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:18,599
what the situation is yeah I don't know
 

2921
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,569
what the situation is yeah I don't know
there's also a gamified aspect to it

2922
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:20,579
there's also a gamified aspect to it
 

2923
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:23,329
there's also a gamified aspect to it
it's exciting yes no I get it like why

2924
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:23,339
it's exciting yes no I get it like why
 

2925
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,010
it's exciting yes no I get it like why
people want to see people win money it's

2926
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:25,020
people want to see people win money it's
 

2927
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,690
people want to see people win money it's
just interesting that past 100 Grand

2928
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:26,700
just interesting that past 100 Grand
 

2929
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,309
just interesting that past 100 Grand
it's it doesn't really seem to make a

2930
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
it's it doesn't really seem to make a
 

2931
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,710
it's it doesn't really seem to make a
difference like it's the same basically

2932
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
difference like it's the same basically
 

2933
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,270
difference like it's the same basically
so you found that to be true with all

2934
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:32,280
so you found that to be true with all
 

2935
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,710
so you found that to be true with all
the money you've given away that I just

2936
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:33,720
the money you've given away that I just
 

2937
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,210
the money you've given away that I just
didn't click through it like obviously

2938
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:35,220
didn't click through it like obviously
 

2939
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,069
didn't click through it like obviously
in terms of someone receiving it yeah a

2940
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:37,079
in terms of someone receiving it yeah a
 

2941
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:38,329
in terms of someone receiving it yeah a
million dollars changes their life

2942
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:38,339
million dollars changes their life
 

2943
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:39,530
million dollars changes their life
drastically more

2944
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:39,540
drastically more
 

2945
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,150
drastically more
like that's the difference like oh you

2946
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:41,160
like that's the difference like oh you
 

2947
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,410
like that's the difference like oh you
if you wanted to you could really quit

2948
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:42,420
if you wanted to you could really quit
 

2949
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,569
if you wanted to you could really quit
your job as opposed to 100K is like not

2950
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:44,579
your job as opposed to 100K is like not
 

2951
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:47,089
your job as opposed to 100K is like not
really you probably do like a scientific

2952
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:47,099
really you probably do like a scientific
 

2953
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:50,150
really you probably do like a scientific
study like a formula giving away money

2954
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,160
study like a formula giving away money
 

2955
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,309
study like a formula giving away money
to click-through rate yeah there could

2956
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:52,319
to click-through rate yeah there could
 

2957
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,630
to click-through rate yeah there could
be some kind of digestion return it

2958
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:53,640
be some kind of digestion return it
 

2959
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,849
be some kind of digestion return it
definitely the the returns level off

2960
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:55,859
definitely the the returns level off
 

2961
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,890
definitely the the returns level off
dramatically after 100K that's basically

2962
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:57,900
dramatically after 100K that's basically
 

2963
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,170
dramatically after 100K that's basically
the premise what about ten thousand uh

2964
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:00,180
the premise what about ten thousand uh
 

2965
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,569
the premise what about ten thousand uh
no there's ten a hundred thousand is

2966
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:02,579
no there's ten a hundred thousand is
 

2967
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,309
no there's ten a hundred thousand is
that it's funny because this is such a

2968
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
that it's funny because this is such a
 

2969
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,609
that it's funny because this is such a
small Niche thing but yeah 100 000 does

2970
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:07,619
small Niche thing but yeah 100 000 does
 

2971
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,349
small Niche thing but yeah 100 000 does
it from what I see in our videos get

2972
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
it from what I see in our videos get
 

2973
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,450
it from what I see in our videos get
more clicks than ten thousand but the

2974
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:11,460
more clicks than ten thousand but the
 

2975
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,290
more clicks than ten thousand but the
difference between a hundred thousand

2976
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:12,300
difference between a hundred thousand
 

2977
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,329
difference between a hundred thousand
million is just so little I just I think

2978
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:14,339
million is just so little I just I think
 

2979
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:16,130
million is just so little I just I think
big number big number to a lot of people

2980
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:16,140
big number big number to a lot of people
 

2981
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,190
big number big number to a lot of people
past that point yeah so for 100 000 you

2982
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
past that point yeah so for 100 000 you
 

2983
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,290
past that point yeah so for 100 000 you
can like give an average salary you

2984
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:21,300
can like give an average salary you
 

2985
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,150
can like give an average salary you
could probably live for a year given

2986
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:23,160
could probably live for a year given
 

2987
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,650
could probably live for a year given
give them a day out average salaries in

2988
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:24,660
give them a day out average salaries in
 

2989
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,510
give them a day out average salaries in
America so that's like a big that feels

2990
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:26,520
America so that's like a big that feels
 

2991
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,890
America so that's like a big that feels
yeah I think it's also just more when

2992
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:27,900
yeah I think it's also just more when
 

2993
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,270
yeah I think it's also just more when
they read the title it's just like it's

2994
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
they read the title it's just like it's
 

2995
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,849
they read the title it's just like it's
a lot of zeros [\h__\h] loads of zeros Okay

2996
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:31,859
a lot of zeros [\h__\h] loads of zeros Okay
 

2997
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:34,150
a lot of zeros [\h__\h] loads of zeros Okay
click yeah

2998
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,160
click yeah
 

2999
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,349
click yeah
oh man that's fascinating so on the

3000
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:36,359
oh man that's fascinating so on the
 

3001
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,630
oh man that's fascinating so on the
thumbnail side again that's going to be

3002
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
thumbnail side again that's going to be
 

3003
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,150
thumbnail side again that's going to be
much harder to say probably

3004
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:41,160
much harder to say probably
 

3005
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,309
much harder to say probably
um but you know offline you know I got a

3006
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:43,319
um but you know offline you know I got a
 

3007
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:44,990
um but you know offline you know I got a
chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails

3008
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:45,000
chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails
 

3009
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,730
chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails
and it's fascinating which ones do well

3010
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:46,740
and it's fascinating which ones do well
 

3011
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,710
and it's fascinating which ones do well
and which ones don't is there something

3012
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:48,720
and which ones don't is there something
 

3013
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,390
and which ones don't is there something
you could say about what are the

3014
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
you could say about what are the
 

3015
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,010
you could say about what are the
elements of a thumbnail that work well

3016
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:52,020
elements of a thumbnail that work well
 

3017
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,349
elements of a thumbnail that work well
is this also deeply well that's where

3018
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:54,359
is this also deeply well that's where
 

3019
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:56,089
is this also deeply well that's where
yeah it's the same thing like how do you

3020
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:56,099
yeah it's the same thing like how do you
 

3021
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,670
yeah it's the same thing like how do you
cook good food but um it's easier if you

3022
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:58,680
cook good food but um it's easier if you
 

3023
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,930
cook good food but um it's easier if you
pull up a thumbnail I could be like

3024
00:48:59,930 --> 00:48:59,940
pull up a thumbnail I could be like
 

3025
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,309
pull up a thumbnail I could be like
that's why that's good that's why that's

3026
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:01,319
that's why that's good that's why that's
 

3027
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:03,170
that's why that's good that's why that's
bad that's uh like an example would be

3028
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:03,180
bad that's uh like an example would be
 

3029
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,150
bad that's uh like an example would be
like one of my friends I was he just

3030
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,160
like one of my friends I was he just
 

3031
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,010
like one of my friends I was he just
uploaded a video recently and I called

3032
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:07,020
uploaded a video recently and I called
 

3033
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,630
uploaded a video recently and I called
him I was like what is this because he's

3034
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:08,640
him I was like what is this because he's
 

3035
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,430
him I was like what is this because he's
a very very smart guy and then the

3036
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:10,440
a very very smart guy and then the
 

3037
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,470
a very very smart guy and then the
thumbnail he's he's getting chased by

3038
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:12,480
thumbnail he's he's getting chased by
 

3039
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,750
thumbnail he's he's getting chased by
cops but the cops are wearing yellow

3040
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:14,760
cops but the cops are wearing yellow
 

3041
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,609
cops but the cops are wearing yellow
vests so they didn't look at cops I was

3042
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:16,619
vests so they didn't look at cops I was
 

3043
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,770
vests so they didn't look at cops I was
like whoa why are the cops in your

3044
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:18,780
like whoa why are the cops in your
 

3045
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,329
like whoa why are the cops in your
thumbnail wearing yellow vests it's like

3046
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:20,339
thumbnail wearing yellow vests it's like
 

3047
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,670
thumbnail wearing yellow vests it's like
that makes it so much more boring and he

3048
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:22,680
that makes it so much more boring and he
 

3049
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,130
that makes it so much more boring and he
was like carrying a flag but the poll

3050
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:25,140
was like carrying a flag but the poll
 

3051
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,390
was like carrying a flag but the poll
and the color of the flag were the same

3052
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:26,400
and the color of the flag were the same
 

3053
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,950
and the color of the flag were the same
color so it's like it's a lot harder to

3054
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:27,960
color so it's like it's a lot harder to
 

3055
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,510
color so it's like it's a lot harder to
see the flag I was like also you're

3056
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:29,520
see the flag I was like also you're
 

3057
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,710
see the flag I was like also you're
wearing like a shirt with like five

3058
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
wearing like a shirt with like five
 

3059
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,930
wearing like a shirt with like five
different colors like so it's like it's

3060
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:32,940
different colors like so it's like it's
 

3061
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,930
different colors like so it's like it's
hard to tell what even what your outline

3062
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:35,940
hard to tell what even what your outline
 

3063
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,609
hard to tell what even what your outline
is and then in the background there were

3064
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:37,619
is and then in the background there were
 

3065
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:38,990
is and then in the background there were

how much iteration because I also got a

3078
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:51,660
how much iteration because I also got a
 

3079
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,329
how much iteration because I also got a
chance to see the number of iterations

3080
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:53,339
chance to see the number of iterations
 

3081
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:56,950
chance to see the number of iterations
you do on a on just it's a problem now

3082
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
you do on a on just it's a problem now

something you have to click like so you
 

3125
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,290
something you have to click like so you
were saying like how would you describe

3126
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:36,300

3133
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,530
I noticed first that was good where you
were very small in it relative to the

3134
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:45,540
were very small in it relative to the
 

3135
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,210

3143
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,730
yeah so they photo manipulating created
my legs Photoshop and that's why I said

3144
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:55,740
my legs Photoshop and that's why I said
 

3145
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,170
my legs Photoshop and that's why I said
I didn't like it because my right leg

3240
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:28,980
away a lot of the secrets basically
 

3241
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,010

for it you know how do you think about
 

3247
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,390
for it you know how do you think about
that because that's also that's pretty

3248
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:35,400
that because that's also that's pretty
 

3249
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,910
that because that's also that's pretty
rare I think and this is a definitely

3250
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:37,920
rare I think and this is a definitely
 

3251
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,089
rare I think and this is a definitely
not uh most people in my stance I don't

remember most subscribed to YouTube
channel world and the most followed Tick

3270
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:55,140
channel world and the most followed Tick
 

3271
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,450

3273
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,849

um but uh in general I just see everyone
 

3275
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,950
um but uh in general I just see everyone
else as uh collaborators not competitors

3276
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:00,960
else as uh collaborators not competitors
 

3277
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,069
else as uh collaborators not competitors
I I don't think giving advice and

3278
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
I I don't think giving advice and
 

3279
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,809
I I don't think giving advice and
helping other creators do well in any

3280
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:05,819
helping other creators do well in any
 

3281
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:07,430
helping other creators do well in any
way harms me and I think it only brings

3282
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,440
way harms me and I think it only brings
 

3283
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,490
way harms me and I think it only brings
more value to my life how is it jumping

3284
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:10,500
more value to my life how is it jumping
 

3285
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,809
more value to my life how is it jumping
on Tick Tock and trying to understand

3286
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:11,819
on Tick Tock and trying to understand
 

3287
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,630
on Tick Tock and trying to understand
that platform from scratch yeah so from

3288
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
that platform from scratch yeah so from
 

3289
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,770
that platform from scratch yeah so from
being a successful YouTuber to

3290
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:15,780
being a successful YouTuber to
 

3291
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,329
being a successful YouTuber to
understand a totally different algorithm

3292
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:17,339
understand a totally different algorithm
 

3293
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,250
understand a totally different algorithm
fundamentally different algorithm it's

3294
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:19,260
fundamentally different algorithm it's
 

3295
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,510
fundamentally different algorithm it's
interesting well not even just the

3296
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:20,520
interesting well not even just the
 

3297
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,950
interesting well not even just the
algorithm just the content like I'm

3298
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:21,960
algorithm just the content like I'm
 

3299
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,470
algorithm just the content like I'm
going from basically 15 minute short

3300
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:24,480
going from basically 15 minute short
 

3301
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,470
going from basically 15 minute short
films to one sub one minute vertical

3302
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:27,480
films to one sub one minute vertical
 

3303
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,750
films to one sub one minute vertical
content at least a whole different just

3304
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
content at least a whole different just
 

3305
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,190
content at least a whole different just
ballpark

3306
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
ballpark
 

3307
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,349
ballpark
um and so the first little while is

3308
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
um and so the first little while is
 

3309
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,030
um and so the first little while is
doing Tick Tock it was just kind of

3310
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
doing Tick Tock it was just kind of
 

3311
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,910
doing Tick Tock it was just kind of
figuring out how what does Mr Beast look

3312
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
figuring out how what does Mr Beast look
 

3313
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,410
figuring out how what does Mr Beast look
like in this short form content but

3314
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:39,420
like in this short form content but
 

3315
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,150
like in this short form content but
recently we've really started to catch

3316
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:41,160
recently we've really started to catch
 

3317
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,349
recently we've really started to catch
our stride and come up with some

3318
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:42,359
our stride and come up with some
 

3319
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:44,450
our stride and come up with some
original Concepts and figure out how to

3320
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:44,460
original Concepts and figure out how to
 

3321
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,650
original Concepts and figure out how to
innovate over there just like we did on

3322
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:45,660
innovate over there just like we did on
 

3323
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,809
innovate over there just like we did on
YouTube because I don't want it I didn't

3324
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:47,819
YouTube because I don't want it I didn't
 

3325
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:49,910
YouTube because I don't want it I didn't
want it to just be shitty YouTube videos

3326
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:49,920
want it to just be shitty YouTube videos
 

3327
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,790
want it to just be shitty YouTube videos
yeah you know and so like an example is

3328
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
yeah you know and so like an example is
 

3329
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,309
yeah you know and so like an example is
um we played the rock for 100k and rock

3330
00:53:55,309 --> 00:53:55,319
um we played the rock for 100k and rock
 

3331
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,170
um we played the rock for 100k and rock
paper scissors and the loser had to

3332
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:57,180
paper scissors and the loser had to
 

3333
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,049
paper scissors and the loser had to
donate 100K to charity we did um we went

3334
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:00,059
donate 100K to charity we did um we went
 

3335
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:01,609
donate 100K to charity we did um we went
to random people on a campus and we

3336
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:01,619
to random people on a campus and we
 

3337
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:04,130
to random people on a campus and we
offered them so I said I'll give you a

3338
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:04,140
offered them so I said I'll give you a
 

3339
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,569
offered them so I said I'll give you a
hundred dollars if you fly to Paris to

3340
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:05,579
hundred dollars if you fly to Paris to
 

3341
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,309
hundred dollars if you fly to Paris to
give me a baguette and then they said no

3342
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:07,319
give me a baguette and then they said no
 

3343
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:09,410

and I was like I'll give you 300 if a
 

3345
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,549
and I was like I'll give you 300 if a
lot of hairs and give me a big hat and I

3346
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
lot of hairs and give me a big hat and I
 

3347
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,049
lot of hairs and give me a big hat and I
was expecting this person to say no and

3348
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:12,059
was expecting this person to say no and
 

3349
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:13,790
was expecting this person to say no and
it go up to like 10 grand he's like yes

3350
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:13,800
it go up to like 10 grand he's like yes
 

3351
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,309
it go up to like 10 grand he's like yes
and so he flew to Paris got a baguette

3352
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
and so he flew to Paris got a baguette
 

3353
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,390
and so he flew to Paris got a baguette
and brought it back and gave it to me

3354
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:17,400
and brought it back and gave it to me
 

3355
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,910
and brought it back and gave it to me
and that across everything got like 450

3356
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:19,920
and that across everything got like 450
 

3357
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,530
and that across everything got like 450
million views and because it's just

3358
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:21,540
million views and because it's just
 

3359
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,390
million views and because it's just
really cool just to see this random guy

3360
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:23,400
really cool just to see this random guy
 

3361
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,609
really cool just to see this random guy
get on a plane spend a day in Paris and

3362
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:25,619
get on a plane spend a day in Paris and
 

3363
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:27,290
get on a plane spend a day in Paris and
we cut it up real nicely and bring it

3364
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:27,300
we cut it up real nicely and bring it
 

3365
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,210
we cut it up real nicely and bring it
back and so we're starting to find just

3366
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:29,220
back and so we're starting to find just
 

3367
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,430
back and so we're starting to find just
tons of original content over there but

3368
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,440

so if you knew everything you know now

3986
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:11,700
so if you knew everything you know now
 

3987
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,329
so if you knew everything you know now
but no money step one would I just

3988
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:14,339
but no money step one would I just
 

3989
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:16,309
but no money step one would I just
brainstorm like okay I don't have money

3990
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:16,319
brainstorm like okay I don't have money
 

3991
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,829
brainstorm like okay I don't have money
what are some viral things like I mean

3992
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:18,839
what are some viral things like I mean
 

3993
01:04:18,839 --> 01:04:20,690
what are some viral things like I mean
the first thing that comes to my mind is

3994
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:20,700
the first thing that comes to my mind is
 

3995
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,890
the first thing that comes to my mind is
something as simple as when I count to a

3996
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:21,900
something as simple as when I count to a
 

3997
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,150
something as simple as when I count to a
hundred thousand which is what I did do

3998
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:23,160
hundred thousand which is what I did do
 

3999
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,010
hundred thousand which is what I did do
and I I was poor

4000
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:25,020
and I I was poor
 

4001
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,630
and I I was poor
um and like that worked but like what's

4002
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
um and like that worked but like what's
 

4003
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,010
um and like that worked but like what's
something like that I could do that

4004
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:28,020
something like that I could do that
 

4005
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,770
something like that I could do that
would be even more attention yeah you

4006
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:30,780
would be even more attention yeah you
 

4007
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,049
would be even more attention yeah you
were as part of the brainstorm

4008
01:04:33,049 --> 01:04:33,059
were as part of the brainstorm
 

4009
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:35,030
were as part of the brainstorm
you would throw out a lot of ideas and

4010
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:35,040
you would throw out a lot of ideas and
 

4011
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,710
you would throw out a lot of ideas and
people throw out a bunch of ideas and

4012
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,720
people throw out a bunch of ideas and
 

4013
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,329
people throw out a bunch of ideas and
one of the questions is is this even

4014
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:38,339
one of the questions is is this even
 

4015
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:40,849
one of the questions is is this even
doable right yeah first off come up with

4016
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:40,859
doable right yeah first off come up with
 

4017
01:04:40,859 --> 01:04:42,530
doable right yeah first off come up with
ideas you think would do well and then

4018
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:42,540
ideas you think would do well and then
 

4019
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,789
ideas you think would do well and then
ask yourself later if they're doable

4020
01:04:43,789 --> 01:04:43,799
ask yourself later if they're doable
 

4021
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:45,049
ask yourself later if they're doable
yeah because there's there's different

4022
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:45,059
yeah because there's there's different
 

4023
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:47,030
yeah because there's there's different
ways you can accomplish something don't

4024
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:47,040
ways you can accomplish something don't
 

4025
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,010
ways you can accomplish something don't
be cynical about the doability of stuff

4026
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,020
be cynical about the doability of stuff
 

4027
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,930
be cynical about the doability of stuff
yeah because there really are so many

4028
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:50,940
yeah because there really are so many
 

4029
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,450
yeah because there really are so many
different ways you can accomplish a goal

4030
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:53,460
different ways you can accomplish a goal
 

4031
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,470
different ways you can accomplish a goal
like

4032
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
like
 

4033
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,190
like
um

4034
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
um
 

4035
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,930
um
when we give away an island like we give

4036
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:56,940
when we give away an island like we give
 

4037
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,370
when we give away an island like we give
our 100 million subscribers Island yeah

4038
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:58,380
our 100 million subscribers Island yeah
 

4039
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,530
our 100 million subscribers Island yeah
you know you can't find private islands

4040
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:00,540
you know you can't find private islands
 

4041
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,329
you know you can't find private islands
that you know don't look like [\h__\h] for

4042
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:02,339
that you know don't look like [\h__\h] for
 

4043
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:03,710
that you know don't look like [\h__\h] for
less than 10 million dollars so this

4044
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:03,720
less than 10 million dollars so this
 

4045
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,390
less than 10 million dollars so this
isn't doable right all right the idea

4046
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:05,400
isn't doable right all right the idea
 

4047
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,390
isn't doable right all right the idea
doesn't exist not doable exit off but

4048
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
doesn't exist not doable exit off but
 

4049
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,609
doesn't exist not doable exit off but
then you know you dig into it and you

4050
01:05:10,609 --> 01:05:10,619
then you know you dig into it and you
 

4051
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:12,109
then you know you dig into it and you
you know find different Alternatives and

4052
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:12,119
you know find different Alternatives and
 

4053
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:14,030
you know find different Alternatives and
you find okay what if we just buy a two

4054
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:14,040
you find okay what if we just buy a two
 

4055
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,650
you find okay what if we just buy a two
million dollar Island that sucks and

4056
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:15,660
million dollar Island that sucks and
 

4057
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,510
million dollar Island that sucks and
then spend a million dollars you know

4058
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,520
then spend a million dollars you know
 

4059
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,190
then spend a million dollars you know
importing some sand let's build a beach

4060
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:19,200
importing some sand let's build a beach
 

4061
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,930
importing some sand let's build a beach
let's import 300 trees let's put a

4062
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:20,940
let's import 300 trees let's put a
 

4063
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,970
let's import 300 trees let's put a
little bit of canals cut some pass boom

4064
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:22,980
little bit of canals cut some pass boom
 

4065
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,210
little bit of canals cut some pass boom
now it's a really nice Island but it's

4066
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:26,220
now it's a really nice Island but it's
 

4067
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,349
now it's a really nice Island but it's
actually affordable because we don't

4068
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:27,359
actually affordable because we don't
 

4069
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:28,309
actually affordable because we don't
have 10 million dollars to spend on

4070
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:28,319
have 10 million dollars to spend on
 

4071
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,930
have 10 million dollars to spend on
video but we can afford to spend three

4072
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:29,940
video but we can afford to spend three
 

4073
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,789
video but we can afford to spend three
and a half and lose whatever a million

4074
01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:31,799
and a half and lose whatever a million
 

4075
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:33,410
and a half and lose whatever a million
dollars on that video so like that's an

4076
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:33,420
dollars on that video so like that's an
 

4077
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,150
dollars on that video so like that's an
example of like yeah if you just went

4078
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:35,160
example of like yeah if you just went
 

4079
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,470
example of like yeah if you just went
off the gut test you're like this isn't

4080
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
off the gut test you're like this isn't
 

4081
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,970
off the gut test you're like this isn't
doable you know every island is 10

4082
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:37,980
doable you know every island is 10
 

4083
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,470
doable you know every island is 10
million dollars we're screwed like if we

4084
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:39,480
million dollars we're screwed like if we
 

4085
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,030
million dollars we're screwed like if we
go cheaper it's just a terrible Island

4086
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:41,040
go cheaper it's just a terrible Island
 

4087
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,510
go cheaper it's just a terrible Island
no and so if you like there are so many

4088
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:44,520
no and so if you like there are so many
 

4089
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,829
no and so if you like there are so many
different ways you can achieve what you

4090
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
different ways you can achieve what you
 

4091
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:46,970
different ways you can achieve what you
want you've really got to push through

want you've really got to push through
 

4093
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,770
want you've really got to push through
notes which not a lot of people do you

4094
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:48,780
notes which not a lot of people do you
 

4095
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,690
notes which not a lot of people do you
have to have like a more of a dominant

4096
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:50,700
have to have like a more of a dominant
 

4097
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,569
have to have like a more of a dominant
personality and just a willingness to

01:05:53,569 --> 01:05:53,579
personality and just a willingness to
 

4099
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:54,589
personality and just a willingness to
um when people tell you it's not

4100
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:54,599
um when people tell you it's not
 

4101
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:56,930
um when people tell you it's not
possible just actually go through all

4102
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:56,940
possible just actually go through all
 

4103
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,190
possible just actually go through all
the variables and eliminate them all

4104
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:58,200
the variables and eliminate them all
 

4105
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,569
the variables and eliminate them all
yourself

4106
01:05:59,569 --> 01:05:59,579
yourself
 

4107
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:01,430
yourself
have a stubbornness

4108
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,440
have a stubbornness
 

4109
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,890
have a stubbornness
and uh resilience to failure maybe for

01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:03,900
and uh resilience to failure maybe for
 

4111
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,049
and uh resilience to failure maybe for
what we do and creators online it's very

4112
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:06,059
what we do and creators online it's very
 

4113
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:08,030
what we do and creators online it's very
imperative that you have

4114
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:08,040
imperative that you have
 

4115
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,609
imperative that you have
that a no isn't a no deal that you

4116
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:10,619
that a no isn't a no deal that you
 

4117
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:13,130
that a no isn't a no deal that you
really have to like think and um and

4118
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:13,140
really have to like think and um and
 

4119
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,349
really have to like think and um and
just like we we take a personality test

4120
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
just like we we take a personality test
 

4121
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,789
just like we we take a personality test
and like just having a dominant

4122
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:16,799
and like just having a dominant
 

4123
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,650
and like just having a dominant
personality is a better indicator that

4124
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:18,660
personality is a better indicator that
 

4125
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,270
personality is a better indicator that
when someone tells you oh there's no way

4126

when someone tells you oh there's no way
you're going to build a brick wall for

4128
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:21,180
you're going to build a brick wall for
 

4129
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,970
you're going to build a brick wall for
under 100 Grand you know you'll be like

4130
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:22,980

[\h__\h] about 10x thing it's even harder
 

4177
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,809
[\h__\h] about 10x thing it's even harder
for 10x

4178
01:07:11,809 --> 01:07:11,819
for 10x
 

4179
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,549

4186
01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:18,599
data it's so funny with him because it's
 

4187
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,029
data it's so funny with him because it's
like you know you could do this to get

4188
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:20,039
like you know you could do this to get
 

4189
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,529
like you know you could do this to get
more views and he'll just be like blank

4190
01:07:21,529 --> 01:07:21,539
more views and he'll just be like blank
 

4191
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:22,910
more views and he'll just be like blank
I'll be like that doesn't register

4192
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:22,920
I'll be like that doesn't register
 

4193
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,470
I'll be like that doesn't register
anything he's just like doesn't care

4194
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,480
anything he's just like doesn't care
 

4195
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,270
anything he's just like doesn't care
which is it's really I'm really nervous

4196
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:26,280
which is it's really I'm really nervous
 

4197
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,890
which is it's really I'm really nervous
about that I'm really nervous about the

4198
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:27,900
about that I'm really nervous about the
 

4199
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,710
about that I'm really nervous about the
numbers affecting because it's so fun oh

4200
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
numbers affecting because it's so fun oh
 

4201
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,450
numbers affecting because it's so fun oh
yeah it's so fun to focus on the numbers

4202
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:32,460
yeah it's so fun to focus on the numbers
 

4203
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,370
yeah it's so fun to focus on the numbers
and I'm I'm really worried about that

4204
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:34,380
and I'm I'm really worried about that
 

4205
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,829
and I'm I'm really worried about that
but at the same time you should be

4206
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:35,839
but at the same time you should be
 

4207
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,630
but at the same time you should be
cognizant of that because you've created

4208
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:38,640
cognizant of that because you've created
 

4209
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,730
cognizant of that because you've created
not just some of the most watched videos

4210
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:40,740
not just some of the most watched videos
 

4211
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,890
not just some of the most watched videos
but some of the most amazing videos ever

4212
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:42,900
but some of the most amazing videos ever
 

4213
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,529
but some of the most amazing videos ever
so it's there's a strong correlation

4214
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:45,539
so it's there's a strong correlation
 

4215
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,210
so it's there's a strong correlation
there it's not like you're selling your

4216
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:47,220
there it's not like you're selling your
 

4217
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:49,490
there it's not like you're selling your
soul to make a highly viewed video it's

4218
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:49,500
soul to make a highly viewed video it's
 

4219
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,710
soul to make a highly viewed video it's
actually if you look at the metrics

4220
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:51,720
actually if you look at the metrics
 

4221
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,690
actually if you look at the metrics
it helps you understand what is

4222
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:53,700
it helps you understand what is
 

4223
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,630
it helps you understand what is
compelling and not and so I feel like I

4224
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,640
compelling and not and so I feel like I
 

4225
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,010
compelling and not and so I feel like I
am

4226
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:58,020
am
 

4227
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,510
am
uh

4228
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
uh
 

4229
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,809
uh
I feel like there's some value to

4230
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:01,819
I feel like there's some value to
 

4231
01:08:01,819 --> 01:08:04,670
I feel like there's some value to
investigate what work when people tune

4232
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:04,680
investigate what work when people tune
 

4233
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,309
investigate what work when people tune
on and when not to be more data driven

4234
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:07,319
on and when not to be more data driven
 

4235
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:09,470
on and when not to be more data driven
even on podcasts but I'm really afraid

4236
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:09,480
even on podcasts but I'm really afraid
 

4237
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,910
even on podcasts but I'm really afraid
on the flip side I think part of the

4238
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:10,920
on the flip side I think part of the
 

4239
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,049
on the flip side I think part of the
appeal is that you don't care about that

4240
01:08:12,049 --> 01:08:12,059
appeal is that you don't care about that
 

4241
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:13,010
appeal is that you don't care about that
kind of stuff

4242
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:13,020
kind of stuff
 

4243
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,630
kind of stuff
but there there could be stuff that

4244
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:14,640
but there there could be stuff that
 

4245
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,729
but there there could be stuff that
doesn't have to do anything with that it

4246
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:16,739
doesn't have to do anything with that it
 

4247
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:18,470
doesn't have to do anything with that it
has to do with stylistic choices of

4248
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
has to do with stylistic choices of
 

4249
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,970
has to do with stylistic choices of
lighting and cameras or maybe with uh

4250
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:22,980
lighting and cameras or maybe with uh
 

4251
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:26,870
lighting and cameras or maybe with uh
um for example topics yeah you know like

4252
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
um for example topics yeah you know like
 

4253
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,610
um for example topics yeah you know like
even what you've asked me here is like

4254
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:28,620
even what you've asked me here is like
 

4255
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,930
even what you've asked me here is like
different than what most people ask me

4256
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:29,940
different than what most people ask me
 

4257
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,849
different than what most people ask me
yeah so it could be I mean and it'd be

4258
01:08:31,849 --> 01:08:31,859
yeah so it could be I mean and it'd be
 

4259
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:33,169
yeah so it could be I mean and it'd be
nice to understand that but yeah again

4260
01:08:33,169 --> 01:08:33,179
nice to understand that but yeah again
 

4261
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:35,390
nice to understand that but yeah again
I'm worried about polluting at the end

4262
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:35,400
I'm worried about polluting at the end
 

4263
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,309
I'm worried about polluting at the end
of the day it's it's this is a true case

4289
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:01,490
watched every second of all 350 of them
probably that's just that's just not no

4290
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:01,500
probably that's just that's just not no

one of those moments where you're an
intelligent guy and you just have to

4302
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:12,600
intelligent guy and you just have to
 

4303
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,530
intelligent guy and you just have to
trust your like instincts like just

trust your like instincts like just
think what is the typical X viewer and

4306
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,000
think what is the typical X viewer and
 

4307
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,550
think what is the typical X viewer and
what do they want I don't think like

4308
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:19,560
what do they want I don't think like
 

4309
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,050
what do they want I don't think like
that my tip but that's all you would

4310
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:21,060
that my tip but that's all you would
 

4311
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,430
that my tip but that's all you would
have to do and whatever your gut tells

4312
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:22,440
have to do and whatever your gut tells
 

4313
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,829
have to do and whatever your gut tells
you that would be the best guess you

4314
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:24,839
you that would be the best guess you
 

4315
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:26,749
you that would be the best guess you
don't know what the typical viewer is

4316
01:09:26,749 --> 01:09:26,759
don't know what the typical viewer is
 

4317
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:29,090
don't know what the typical viewer is
though I don't I know because to

4318
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:29,100
though I don't I know because to
 

4319
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,289
though I don't I know because to
investigate that would be very very

4320
01:09:30,289 --> 01:09:30,299
investigate that would be very very
 

4321
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,370
investigate that would be very very
difficult and then you have to start

4322
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:31,380
difficult and then you have to start
 

4323
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,749
difficult and then you have to start
looking at the numbers you have to start

4324
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:32,759
looking at the numbers you have to start
 

4325
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:34,789
looking at the numbers you have to start
to like consider demographics the only

4326
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799
to like consider demographics the only
 

4327
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,130
to like consider demographics the only
way I know that anybody even watches it

4328
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:37,140
way I know that anybody even watches it
 

4329
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,689
way I know that anybody even watches it
is because I'll sometimes run into

4330
01:09:38,689 --> 01:09:38,699
is because I'll sometimes run into
 

4331
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:40,490
is because I'll sometimes run into
people like when I run along the river

4332
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:40,500
people like when I run along the river
 

4333
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,709
people like when I run along the river
and they'd be like I love you Lex it's

4334
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
and they'd be like I love you Lex it's
 

4335
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,870
and they'd be like I love you Lex it's
like okay well that that's that's the

4336
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
like okay well that that's that's the
 

4337
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,550
like okay well that that's that's the
data point and they're like cool people

4338
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,560
data point and they're like cool people
 

4339
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,590
data point and they're like cool people
but you know I don't know any like I

4340
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:48,600
but you know I don't know any like I
 

4341
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,329
but you know I don't know any like I
don't have any other

4342
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:50,339
don't have any other
 

4343
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:52,309
don't have any other
it's difficult man it's difficult to

4344
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:52,319
it's difficult man it's difficult to
 

4345
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,329
it's difficult man it's difficult to
know

4346
01:09:53,329 --> 01:09:53,339
know
 

4347
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:54,770
know
it's difficult to know who listens to

4348
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:54,780
it's difficult to know who listens to
 

4349
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:56,630
it's difficult to know who listens to
boxes the difficult do you have a sense

4350
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,640
boxes the difficult do you have a sense
 

4351
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,090
boxes the difficult do you have a sense
of who's I mean like you're so huge that

4352
01:09:59,090 --> 01:09:59,100
of who's I mean like you're so huge that
 

4353
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,729
of who's I mean like you're so huge that
everybody watches yeah uh but no I still

4354
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:01,739
everybody watches yeah uh but no I still
 

4355
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:04,130
everybody watches yeah uh but no I still
do I would say if you were to just put a

4356
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:04,140
do I would say if you were to just put a
 

4357
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,390
do I would say if you were to just put a
gun to my head and you're you're like

4358
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:05,400
gun to my head and you're you're like
 

4359
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,530
gun to my head and you're you're like
all right we're gonna pick a random

4360
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:06,540
all right we're gonna pick a random
 

4361
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,330
all right we're gonna pick a random
person that watched your last video and

4362
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:08,340
person that watched your last video and
 

4363
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,890
person that watched your last video and
you have to like roughly guess what they

4364
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:09,900
you have to like roughly guess what they
 

4365
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,330
you have to like roughly guess what they
are and if you're not close we'll kill

4366
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:11,340
are and if you're not close we'll kill
 

4367
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,030
are and if you're not close we'll kill
you I would say probably like a teenager

4368
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:14,040
you I would say probably like a teenager
 

4369
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,830
you I would say probably like a teenager
that plays video games like some

4370
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:15,840
that plays video games like some
 

4371
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,630
that plays video games like some
something like that would be probably

4372
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:17,640
something like that would be probably
 

4373
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,850
something like that would be probably
the typical one and then there are

4374
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:19,860
the typical one and then there are
 

4375
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:20,930
the typical one and then there are
people that are maybe a little bit

4376
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:20,940
people that are maybe a little bit
 

4377
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,910
people that are maybe a little bit
younger a lot of people are are older as

4378
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:22,920
younger a lot of people are are older as
 

4379
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,250
younger a lot of people are are older as
well but in a ramble random sample size

4380
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:25,260
well but in a ramble random sample size
 

4381
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,169
well but in a ramble random sample size
yeah it's probably like I'm a male boy

4382
01:10:27,169 --> 01:10:27,179
yeah it's probably like I'm a male boy
 

4383
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:28,490
yeah it's probably like I'm a male boy
that plays video games like that's the

4384
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:28,500
that plays video games like that's the
 

4385
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,930
that plays video games like that's the
best way I would describing it but I

4386
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:29,940
best way I would describing it but I
 

4387
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,370
best way I would describing it but I
don't try to pertain to them I just make

4388
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:31,380
don't try to pertain to them I just make
 

4389
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,050
don't try to pertain to them I just make
whatever I think is interesting and good

4390
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:33,060
whatever I think is interesting and good
 

4391
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:33,950
whatever I think is interesting and good
content

4392
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:33,960
content
 

4393
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,149
content
um and this is what we were talking

4394
01:10:35,149 --> 01:10:35,159
um and this is what we were talking
 

4395
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:37,130
um and this is what we were talking
about before even though hypothetically

4396
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:37,140
about before even though hypothetically
 

4397
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,770
about before even though hypothetically
35 to 40 of my audience is uh women

4398
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:39,780
35 to 40 of my audience is uh women
 

4399
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,810
35 to 40 of my audience is uh women
which is you know less than a majority

4400
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:41,820
which is you know less than a majority
 

4401
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,370
which is you know less than a majority
if we get 100 million views of video

4402
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:43,380
if we get 100 million views of video
 

4403
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,990
if we get 100 million views of video
that's still 30 to 40 million females

4404
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:45,000
that's still 30 to 40 million females
 

4405
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,850
that's still 30 to 40 million females
that watch every video which is probably

4406
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:46,860
that watch every video which is probably
 

4407
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,610
that watch every video which is probably
the largest uh you know views per video

4408
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:49,620
the largest uh you know views per video
 

4409
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,130
the largest uh you know views per video
for women on the whole platform which

4410
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:52,140
for women on the whole platform which
 

4411
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,050
for women on the whole platform which
you wouldn't think that you know uh like

4412
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:54,060
you wouldn't think that you know uh like
 

4413
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,910
you wouldn't think that you know uh like
I can't think of a single other creator

4414
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:55,920
I can't think of a single other creator
 

4415
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,410
I can't think of a single other creator
that gets more women to watch their

4416
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:57,420
that gets more women to watch their
 

4417
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,850
that gets more women to watch their
videos than that

4418
01:10:58,850 --> 01:10:58,860
videos than that
 

4419
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,669
videos than that
um and so it's just anything even like

4420
01:11:01,669 --> 01:11:01,679
um and so it's just anything even like
 

4421
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,470
um and so it's just anything even like
people above the age of 30 even if it's

4422
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:03,480
people above the age of 30 even if it's
 

4423
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,209
people above the age of 30 even if it's
only like three or four percent that's

4424
01:11:05,209 --> 01:11:05,219
only like three or four percent that's
 

4425
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,530
only like three or four percent that's
still three to four percent of 100

4426
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:06,540
still three to four percent of 100
 

4427
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,790
still three to four percent of 100
million views there's a lot of people

4428
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:07,800
million views there's a lot of people
 

4429
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,450
million views there's a lot of people
that age so we we hit a large group of

4430
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:11,460
that age so we we hit a large group of
 

4431
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:14,810
that age so we we hit a large group of
uh of kind of every demographic if that

4432
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:14,820
uh of kind of every demographic if that
 

4433
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,669
uh of kind of every demographic if that
makes any sense so what if we look at

4434
01:11:16,669 --> 01:11:16,679
makes any sense so what if we look at
 

4435
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:18,590
makes any sense so what if we look at
other maybe more challenging kinds of

4436
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:18,600
other maybe more challenging kinds of
 

4437
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,870
other maybe more challenging kinds of
channels or not but if we look at

4438
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:20,880
channels or not but if we look at
 

4439
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,910
channels or not but if we look at
educational for example like lectures or

4440
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:22,920
educational for example like lectures or
 

4441
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,430
educational for example like lectures or
if we look yeah educational it could be

4442
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:25,440
if we look yeah educational it could be
 

4443
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,590
if we look yeah educational it could be
short videos like how would you

4444
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:27,600
short videos like how would you
 

4445
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,370
short videos like how would you
10x that like uh something on Robotics

4446
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:31,380
10x that like uh something on Robotics
 

4447
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,950
10x that like uh something on Robotics
and biology on science on engineering on

4448
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:33,960
and biology on science on engineering on
 

4449
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,350
and biology on science on engineering on
all of that that's more educational

4450
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:36,360
all of that that's more educational
 

4451
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,390
all of that that's more educational
focused we would honestly just have to

4452
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,400
focused we would honestly just have to
 

4453
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,890
focused we would honestly just have to
pull the because it's the same way if

4454
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:39,900
pull the because it's the same way if
 

4455
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,510
pull the because it's the same way if

which is what a lot of people do and
 

4519
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,430
which is what a lot of people do and
things from your perspective it's very

4520
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:37,440
things from your perspective it's very
 

4521
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,290
things from your perspective it's very
biased and it's just not going to work

4522
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:39,300
biased and it's just not going to work
 

4523
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,850
biased and it's just not going to work
for everyone and that's actually how you

4524
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:40,860
for everyone and that's actually how you
 

4525
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:41,990
for everyone and that's actually how you
do more harm than good which is

4526
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,000
do more harm than good which is
 

4527
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,030
do more harm than good which is
something I'm very careful of yeah but

4528
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:44,040
something I'm very careful of yeah but
 

4529
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,350
something I'm very careful of yeah but
at the same time just generating a lot

4530
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
at the same time just generating a lot
 

4531
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,790
at the same time just generating a lot
of ideas I think the first time I've

4532
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:46,800
of ideas I think the first time I've
 

4533
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,410
of ideas I think the first time I've
talked to you was on clubhouse actually

4534
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:48,420
talked to you was on clubhouse actually
 

4535
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,390
talked to you was on clubhouse actually
yeah I mentioned something about robots

4536
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
yeah I mentioned something about robots
 

4537
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,370
yeah I mentioned something about robots
and like almost immediately went to

4538
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:52,380
and like almost immediately went to
 

4539
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,630
and like almost immediately went to
generating a bunch of ideas around

4540
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:53,640
generating a bunch of ideas around
 

4541
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,030
generating a bunch of ideas around
audiobooks uh it's just 100 Robots

4542
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:56,040
audiobooks uh it's just 100 Robots
 

4543
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,010
audiobooks uh it's just 100 Robots
versus a hundred humans yeah how far can

4544
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:58,020
versus a hundred humans yeah how far can
 

4545
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,110
versus a hundred humans yeah how far can
a robot throw a potato I think your idea

4546
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,120
a robot throw a potato I think your idea
 

4547
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,550
a robot throw a potato I think your idea
like I think the first idea was because

4548
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:01,560
like I think the first idea was because
 

4549
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,169
like I think the first idea was because
you just said so many ideas I never even

4550
01:13:03,169 --> 01:13:03,179
you just said so many ideas I never even
 

4551
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,310
you just said so many ideas I never even
thought of

4552
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:04,320
thought of
 

4553
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,610
thought of
but it's it's it shows the value of uh

4554
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:07,620
but it's it's it shows the value of uh
 

4555
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,290
but it's it's it shows the value of uh
basically brainstorming with people that

4556
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:09,300
basically brainstorming with people that
 

4557
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,490
basically brainstorming with people that
think differently but at the end of the

4558
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:10,500
think differently but at the end of the
 

4559
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,770
think differently but at the end of the
day my ideas are probably you know might

4560
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:12,780
day my ideas are probably you know might
 

4561
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,810
day my ideas are probably you know might
lean towards some people a little bit

4562
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:14,820
lean towards some people a little bit
 

4563
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,010
lean towards some people a little bit
younger than your audience like some of

4564
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:16,020
younger than your audience like some of
 

4565
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,390
younger than your audience like some of
the stuff yeah but there's still the

4566
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:17,400
the stuff yeah but there's still the
 

4567
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,590
the stuff yeah but there's still the
ideas like I think the first one you

4568
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:18,600
ideas like I think the first one you
 

4569
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,970
ideas like I think the first one you
said because we're talking about uh

4570
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:19,980
said because we're talking about uh
 

4571
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,090
said because we're talking about uh
quadruped like a robot dogs you said to

4572
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:23,100
quadruped like a robot dogs you said to
 

4573
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,090
quadruped like a robot dogs you said to
replace a biological dog with a robot

4574
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:26,100
replace a biological dog with a robot
 

4575
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,350
replace a biological dog with a robot
dog and see if the owner notices

4576
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:27,360
dog and see if the owner notices
 

4577
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,669
dog and see if the owner notices
something you're just quickly

4578
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:28,679
something you're just quickly
 

4579
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:30,169
something you're just quickly
brainstorming different ideas of like

4580
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:30,179
brainstorming different ideas of like
 

4581
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:31,910
brainstorming different ideas of like
how this was years ago I remember that

4582
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:31,920
how this was years ago I remember that
 

4583
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,250
how this was years ago I remember that
yeah which is just I mean it's like oh

biological systems that we the
biological creatures that we that we

4596
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:45,840
biological creatures that we that we
 

4597
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,530
biological creatures that we that we
love in our lives yeah and but like that

like a million or two get 10 million
 

4729
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,470
like a million or two get 10 million
subscribers and then keep the other 8

shouldn't take the 10 million
 

4741
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:11,810
shouldn't take the 10 million
subscribers because you're just gonna

4742
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:11,820
subscribers because you're just gonna
 

4743
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:14,090
subscribers because you're just gonna
kill the channel so the 10 million is

4744
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:14,100
kill the channel so the 10 million is
 

4745
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,590
kill the channel so the 10 million is
definitely a better question would be

4746
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:15,600
definitely a better question would be
 

4747
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,149
definitely a better question would be
would you rather have a million dollars

4748
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:17,159
would you rather have a million dollars
 

4749
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:18,530
would you rather have a million dollars
or 10 million subscribers that's where

4750
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:18,540
or 10 million subscribers that's where
 

4751
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,209
or 10 million subscribers that's where
it gets a little tricky because now it's

4752
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:20,219
it gets a little tricky because now it's
 

4753
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:22,250
it gets a little tricky because now it's
like hmm you know a million dollars

4754
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:22,260
like hmm you know a million dollars
 

4755
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:25,070
like hmm you know a million dollars
life-changing amount of money uh but you

4756
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:25,080
life-changing amount of money uh but you
 

4757
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,390
life-changing amount of money uh but you
know if you Sim I know what you're doing

4758
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
know if you Sim I know what you're doing
 

4759
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,770
know if you Sim I know what you're doing
you probably make a million dollars off

4760
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:27,780
you probably make a million dollars off
 

4761
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,870
you probably make a million dollars off
a 10 million subscriber Channel but it

4762
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:29,880
a 10 million subscriber Channel but it
 

4763
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,669
a 10 million subscriber Channel but it
is a little bit a million dollars might

4764
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:31,679
is a little bit a million dollars might
 

4765
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,649
is a little bit a million dollars might
not be enough to to build a strong team

4766
01:16:33,649 --> 01:16:33,659
not be enough to to build a strong team
 

4767
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:35,209
not be enough to to build a strong team
because you don't know how to do it so

4768
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:35,219
because you don't know how to do it so
 

4769
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:36,709
because you don't know how to do it so
you might waste all that money yeah or

4770
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:36,719
you might waste all that money yeah or
 

4771
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,689
you might waste all that money yeah or
they just keep it and retire yeah okay

4772
01:16:38,689 --> 01:16:38,699
they just keep it and retire yeah okay
 

4773
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:40,310
they just keep it and retire yeah okay
that's true yeah because 10 million's

4774
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
that's true yeah because 10 million's
 

4775
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,870
that's true yeah because 10 million's
just so high it's like just never work

4776
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:41,880
just so high it's like just never work
 

4777
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,370
just so high it's like just never work
again who cares for the average human

4778
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:43,380
again who cares for the average human
 

4779
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,350
again who cares for the average human
that's so much money it's interesting to

4780
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,360
that's so much money it's interesting to
 

4781
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,910
that's so much money it's interesting to
me also do the value of the subscriber

4782
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:46,920
me also do the value of the subscriber
 

4783
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,790
me also do the value of the subscriber
versus the value of the dollar

4784
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:49,800
versus the value of the dollar
 

4785
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,709
versus the value of the dollar
um I suppose how valuable is a

4786
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:51,719
um I suppose how valuable is a
 

4787
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:53,870
um I suppose how valuable is a
subscriber for

4788
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:53,880
subscriber for
 

4789
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,550
subscriber for
uh like what percentage of the videos

4790
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:55,560
uh like what percentage of the videos
 

4791
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,290
uh like what percentage of the videos
like how active are the subscribers and

4792
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:57,300
like how active are the subscribers and
 

4793
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,669
like how active are the subscribers and
watching the video

4794
01:16:58,669 --> 01:16:58,679
watching the video
 

4795
01:16:58,679 --> 01:16:59,330
watching the video
um

4796
01:16:59,330 --> 01:16:59,340
um
 

4797
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,729
um
for you that's hard I don't know I was

4798
01:17:01,729 --> 01:17:01,739
for you that's hard I don't know I was
 

4799
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:02,810
for you that's hard I don't know I was
actually thinking more about the

4800
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:02,820
actually thinking more about the
 

4801
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,550
actually thinking more about the
subscriber to Dollar like if someone has

4802
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:04,560
subscriber to Dollar like if someone has
 

4803
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,050
subscriber to Dollar like if someone has
10 million subscribers have they made 10

4804
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:06,060
10 million subscribers have they made 10
 

4805
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,030
10 million subscribers have they made 10
million dollars I don't know why that

4806
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:08,040
million dollars I don't know why that
 

4807
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,130
million dollars I don't know why that
that kind of popped in my head it's an

4808
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,140
that kind of popped in my head it's an
 

4809
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,770
that kind of popped in my head it's an
interesting thought

4810
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:12,780
interesting thought
 

4811
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:15,709
interesting thought
uh do you ever when you analyze uh

4812
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:15,719
uh do you ever when you analyze uh
 

4813
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:17,390
uh do you ever when you analyze uh
videos do you ever analyze videos like

4814
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:17,400
videos do you ever analyze videos like
 

4815
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,090
videos do you ever analyze videos like
we've talked about offline of other

of other ones but I think we're getting
 

4861
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,510
of other ones but I think we're getting
to the point now where only analytics

4862
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:08,520
to the point now where only analytics
 

4863
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,370
to the point now where only analytics
junkies would want to keep hearing more

4864
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:10,380
junkies would want to keep hearing more
 

4865

4881
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,630
don't at all I actually I just follow
the threat of curiosity and I think

4882
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:29,640
the threat of curiosity and I think
 

4883
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,310
the threat of curiosity and I think
there's just a lot of curious humans in

4884
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:31,320
there's just a lot of curious humans in
 

4885
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,669
there's just a lot of curious humans in
the world and and to me it's like

4886
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:34,679
the world and and to me it's like
 

4887
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:37,130
the world and and to me it's like
so the question about analytics is the

4888
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:37,140
so the question about analytics is the
 

4889
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:40,310
so the question about analytics is the
question of basically stepping away

4890
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:40,320
question of basically stepping away
 

4891
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,350
question of basically stepping away
stepping outside of yourself and

4892
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:42,360
stepping outside of yourself and
 

4893
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,729
stepping outside of yourself and
thinking why the hell do I like Tick

4894
01:18:43,729 --> 01:18:43,739
thinking why the hell do I like Tick

content that means exactly you should be
publicly discussing it because if not

5052
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:20,520
publicly discussing it because if not
 

5053
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,550
publicly discussing it because if not
and if it's not known then it's just

5054
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
and if it's not known then it's just
 

5055
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,990
and if it's not known then it's just
kind of like well then who's pulling the

5056
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,000
kind of like well then who's pulling the
 

5057
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,970
kind of like well then who's pulling the
strings and like how do we know they're

5058
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:25,980
strings and like how do we know they're
 

5059
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,470
strings and like how do we know they're
not just manipulating things to get

5060
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:27,480
not just manipulating things to get
 

5061
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,330
not just manipulating things to get
whatever message they want out there and

5062
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:29,340
whatever message they want out there and
 

5063
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,010
whatever message they want out there and
silence other ones yeah and there could

5064
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:31,020
silence other ones yeah and there could
 

5065
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,450
silence other ones yeah and there could
be sort of in the background government

5066
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:32,460
be sort of in the background government
 

5067
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,550
be sort of in the background government
influence which is where actual freedom

5068
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:34,560
influence which is where actual freedom
 

5069
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,830
influence which is where actual freedom
of speech comes into play that the

5070
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:36,840
of speech comes into play that the
 

5071
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,090
of speech comes into play that the
government should not have any control

5072
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:38,100
government should not have any control
 

5073
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,050
government should not have any control
or be able to put pressure on censorship

5074
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:41,060
or be able to put pressure on censorship
 

5075
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:44,270
or be able to put pressure on censorship
of speech and it gets weird if none of

5076
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:44,280
of speech and it gets weird if none of
 

5077
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,709
of speech and it gets weird if none of
that is being there's no transparency

5078
01:21:45,709 --> 01:21:45,719
that is being there's no transparency
 

5079
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:48,410
that is being there's no transparency
around it yeah let's see but to be fair

5080
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:48,420
around it yeah let's see but to be fair
 

5081
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:51,350
around it yeah let's see but to be fair
that's a huge responsibility the amount

5082
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:51,360
that's a huge responsibility the amount
 

5083
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,350
that's a huge responsibility the amount
of content that YouTube is uploaded on

5084
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:54,360
of content that YouTube is uploaded on
 

5085
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,930
of content that YouTube is uploaded on
YouTube that is shared by YouTube viewed

5086
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:56,940
YouTube that is shared by YouTube viewed
 

5087
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,370
YouTube that is shared by YouTube viewed
by you but even more of a reason why it

5088
01:21:58,370 --> 01:21:58,380
by you but even more of a reason why it
 

5089
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,350
by you but even more of a reason why it
it would probably makes sense to be

5090
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:00,360
it would probably makes sense to be
 

5091
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,390
it would probably makes sense to be
transparent yeah because then people can

5092
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:02,400
transparent yeah because then people can
 

5093
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,970
transparent yeah because then people can
help fact check it that's right but that

5094
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:04,980
help fact check it that's right but that
 

5095
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,410
help fact check it that's right but that
that requires building a platform that

5096
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:06,420
that requires building a platform that
 

5097
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,950
that requires building a platform that
makes that easy right like uh

5098
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:09,960
makes that easy right like uh
 

5099
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,169
makes that easy right like uh
to to make fact checking easy to make

5100
01:22:12,169 --> 01:22:12,179
to to make fact checking easy to make
 

5101
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:14,570
to to make fact checking easy to make
the like Twitter now has like being able

5102
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:14,580
the like Twitter now has like being able
 

5103
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,070
the like Twitter now has like being able
to share context and all that kind of

5104
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
to share context and all that kind of
 

5105
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,350
to share context and all that kind of
stuff that crowdsource it crowdsources

5106
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:18,360
stuff that crowdsource it crowdsources
 

5107
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,149
stuff that crowdsource it crowdsources
the way Wikipedia crowdsource it I mean

5108
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:20,159
the way Wikipedia crowdsource it I mean
 

5109
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:20,870
the way Wikipedia crowdsource it I mean
there's

5110
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:20,880
there's
 

5111
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,209
there's
it's right and then you open a random

5112
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:23,219
it's right and then you open a random
 

5113
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:24,850
it's right and then you open a random
Wikipedia article

5114
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:24,860
Wikipedia article
 

5115
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,070
Wikipedia article
but like you know people criticize

5116
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:27,080
but like you know people criticize
 

5117
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,990
but like you know people criticize
Wikipedia because there is a political

01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
Wikipedia because there is a political
 

5119
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,729

lean to the editors of Wikipedia and

5120
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:31,739
lean to the editors of Wikipedia and
 

5121
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:33,229
lean to the editors of Wikipedia and
then they get

5122
01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:33,239
then they get
 

5123
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,790
then they get
there's some articles that definitely

5124
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:34,800
there's some articles that definitely
 

5125
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,530
there's some articles that definitely
have a bias to them and all that kind of

5126
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:36,540
have a bias to them and all that kind of
 

5127
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,330
have a bias to them and all that kind of
stuff it's a difficult problem it's a

01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:38,340
stuff it's a difficult problem it's a
 

5129
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:39,470
stuff it's a difficult problem it's a
difficult problem to solve that

5130
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:39,480
difficult problem to solve that
 

5131
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,110
difficult problem to solve that
ultimately as much as possible it would

5132
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:42,120
ultimately as much as possible it would
 

5133
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,610
ultimately as much as possible it would
be nice for the viewer to have control

5134
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:43,620
be nice for the viewer to have control
 

5135
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,530
be nice for the viewer to have control
of that versus the

5136
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:45,540
of that versus the
 

5137
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,870

what was the hardest part of making that
 

5161
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:11,270
what was the hardest part of making that
video the hardest part was just getting

5162
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280
video the hardest part was just getting

out there it's just so remote and you

5164
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:14,640
out there it's just so remote and you
 

5165
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,209
out there it's just so remote and you
know you land the plane on just this ice

5166
01:23:17,209 --> 01:23:17,219
know you land the plane on just this ice
 

5167
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:19,970
know you land the plane on just this ice
Runway and it's so sketchy and then once

5168
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:19,980
Runway and it's so sketchy and then once
 

5169
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,649
Runway and it's so sketchy and then once
the plane takes off you're just there

5170
01:23:21,649 --> 01:23:21,659
the plane takes off you're just there
 

5171
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:23,630
the plane takes off you're just there
and you're the most remote place in the

5172
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:23,640
and you're the most remote place in the
 

5173
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,169
and you're the most remote place in the
planet and it's it's just it's very

5174
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:27,179
planet and it's it's just it's very
 

5175
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:29,689
planet and it's it's just it's very
breathtaking I don't if you have the

5176
01:23:29,689 --> 01:23:29,699
breathtaking I don't if you have the
 

5177
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:31,430
breathtaking I don't if you have the
chance to ever go to Antarctica I would

5178
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
chance to ever go to Antarctica I would
 

5179
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,890
chance to ever go to Antarctica I would
recommend it it was probably like the in

5180
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:33,900
recommend it it was probably like the in
 

5181
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,450
recommend it it was probably like the in
the video we climbed a mountain

5182
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:35,460
the video we climbed a mountain
 

5183
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,950
the video we climbed a mountain
um that wasn't named so we can name it

5184
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:36,960
um that wasn't named so we can name it
 

5185
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,510
um that wasn't named so we can name it
and like standing on top of that

5186
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:38,520
and like standing on top of that
 

5187
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,250
and like standing on top of that
mountain and just seeing kindling

5188
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:40,260
mountain and just seeing kindling
 

5189
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,470
mountain and just seeing kindling
nothing and because once you get outside

5190
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:42,480
nothing and because once you get outside
 

5191
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,090
nothing and because once you get outside
the outskirts and you get deep in

5192
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:44,100
the outskirts and you get deep in
 

5193
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,709
the outskirts and you get deep in
Antarctica there's no Penguins nothing

5194
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:45,719
Antarctica there's no Penguins nothing
 

5195
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:47,330
Antarctica there's no Penguins nothing
lives there at all

5196
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:47,340
lives there at all
 

5197
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,130
lives there at all
um and so there's just nothing in every

5198
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:49,140
um and so there's just nothing in every
 

5199
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:51,169
um and so there's just nothing in every
direction it's just snow and these crazy

5200
01:23:51,169 --> 01:23:51,179
direction it's just snow and these crazy
 

5201
01:23:51,179 --> 01:23:53,030
direction it's just snow and these crazy
beautiful mountains and some of them

5202
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
beautiful mountains and some of them
 

5203
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,669
beautiful mountains and some of them
sticking to the clouds and it was in the

5204
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:55,679
sticking to the clouds and it was in the
 

5205
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,410
sticking to the clouds and it was in the
um if you go during summer time the Sun

5206
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:57,420

5209
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,310
never goes down so the Sun's Up 24 7 and
it's just like spinning in circles at

5210
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:01,320
it's just like spinning in circles at
 

5211
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,810
it's just like spinning in circles at
the top of the planet or whatever it

5212
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:02,820
the top of the planet or whatever it
 

5213
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,130
the top of the planet or whatever it
looks like the top

5214
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:04,140
looks like the top
 

5215
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,450
looks like the top
um yeah you guys come with it several

5216
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:05,460
um yeah you guys come with it several
 

5217
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,189
um yeah you guys come with it several
times how beautiful yes and so it's just

5218
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:07,199
times how beautiful yes and so it's just
 

5219
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,530
times how beautiful yes and so it's just
yeah it's just very beautiful what about

5220
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:09,540
yeah it's just very beautiful what about
 

5221
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,790
yeah it's just very beautiful what about
shooting itself like the technical

5222
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
shooting itself like the technical
 

5223
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,490
shooting itself like the technical
aspects of shooting it oh I mean well so

5224
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:13,500
aspects of shooting it oh I mean well so
 

5225
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,649
aspects of shooting it oh I mean well so
somehow we lucked out one of the days it

5226
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:15,659
somehow we lucked out one of the days it
 

5227
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:17,870
somehow we lucked out one of the days it
was like the warmest day in like forever

5228
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:17,880
was like the warmest day in like forever
 

5229
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,850
was like the warmest day in like forever
that's been in Antarctica it's like it

5230
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:19,860
that's been in Antarctica it's like it
 

5231
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:22,010
that's been in Antarctica it's like it
was positive uh degrees but at certain

5232
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,020
was positive uh degrees but at certain
 

5233
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,149
was positive uh degrees but at certain
parts there's also like negative 20

5234
01:24:23,149 --> 01:24:23,159
parts there's also like negative 20
 

5235
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:25,669
parts there's also like negative 20
negative 30 and that's where the cameras

5236
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:25,679
negative 30 and that's where the cameras
 

5237
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:26,930
negative 30 and that's where the cameras
you constantly have to be switching out

5238
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:26,940
you constantly have to be switching out
 

5239
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,610
you constantly have to be switching out
the batteries and heating them up and

5240
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:28,620
the batteries and heating them up and
 

5241
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,290
the batteries and heating them up and
like putting them basically in like your

5242
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:30,300
like putting them basically in like your
 

5243
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,090
like putting them basically in like your
pants or they'll just get way too cold

5244
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:32,100
pants or they'll just get way too cold
 

5245
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,970
pants or they'll just get way too cold
and uh we were prepared for much worse

5246
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:34,980
and uh we were prepared for much worse
 

5247
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,830
and uh we were prepared for much worse
but it ended up being much better than

5248
01:24:36,830 --> 01:24:36,840
but it ended up being much better than
 

5249
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,450
but it ended up being much better than
we thought so for that video but in

5250
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:38,460
we thought so for that video but in
 

5251
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:39,709
we thought so for that video but in
general maybe some other challenging

5252
01:24:39,709 --> 01:24:39,719
general maybe some other challenging
 

5253
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:41,330
general maybe some other challenging
videos how does how do you go from the

5254
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:41,340
videos how does how do you go from the
 

5255
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,550
videos how does how do you go from the
idea stage to the actual execution to

5256
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:43,560
idea stage to the actual execution to
 

5257
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,169
idea stage to the actual execution to
the final video what's can you take me

5258
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:45,179
the final video what's can you take me
 

5259
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,090
the final video what's can you take me
through like a full process of like

5260
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:47,100
through like a full process of like
 

5261
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,010
through like a full process of like
we're talking about some crazy wild

5262
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:49,020
we're talking about some crazy wild
 

5263
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,709
we're talking about some crazy wild
ideas today how do you go from that to a

5264
01:24:51,709 --> 01:24:51,719
ideas today how do you go from that to a
 

5265
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:53,689
ideas today how do you go from that to a
final video where you click publish well

5266
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:53,699
final video where you click publish well
 

5267
01:24:53,699 --> 01:24:55,550
final video where you click publish well
I mean obviously first things first you

5268
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:55,560
I mean obviously first things first you
 

5269
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,050
I mean obviously first things first you
gotta figure out the idea and then it

5270
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:57,060
gotta figure out the idea and then it
 

5271
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,090
gotta figure out the idea and then it
just depends I mean pick any video you

5272
01:24:59,090 --> 01:24:59,100
just depends I mean pick any video you
 

5273
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,290
just depends I mean pick any video you
can think of on my channel I can take

5274
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:00,300
can think of on my channel I can take
 

5275
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,669
can think of on my channel I can take
you through it

5276
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:01,679
you through it
 

5277
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,290
you through it
uh

5278
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:03,300
uh
 

5279
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,709
uh
uh well what about the in a circle you

5280
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:06,719
uh well what about the in a circle you
 

5281
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,169
uh well what about the in a circle you
have to stay in a circle for uh 400 Days

5282
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:09,179
have to stay in a circle for uh 400 Days
 

5283
01:25:09,179 --> 01:25:11,870
have to stay in a circle for uh 400 Days
yeah so for that one step one one of the

5284
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:11,880
yeah so for that one step one one of the
 

5285
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,790
yeah so for that one step one one of the
most popular yeah that video did really

5286
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:13,800
most popular yeah that video did really
 

5287
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,950
most popular yeah that video did really
well yeah so we

5288
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:15,960
well yeah so we
 

5289
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,709
well yeah so we
um problem is uh we have to this is

5290
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:18,719
um problem is uh we have to this is
 

5291
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,510
um problem is uh we have to this is
where you get really into the nuances of

5292
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:20,520
where you get really into the nuances of
 

5293
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,430
where you get really into the nuances of
the company because we have a lot of

5294
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:22,440
the company because we have a lot of
 

5295
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,050
the company because we have a lot of
videos going out you can't just in a

5296
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:24,060
videos going out you can't just in a
 

5297
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,310
videos going out you can't just in a
vacuum be like all right we're not doing

5298
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:25,320
vacuum be like all right we're not doing
 

5299
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,689
vacuum be like all right we're not doing
anything for 100 days we're only filming

5300
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:26,699
anything for 100 days we're only filming
 

5301
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:28,729
anything for 100 days we're only filming
this so Step One is we had to build an

5302
01:25:28,729 --> 01:25:28,739
this so Step One is we had to build an
 

5303
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:30,169
this so Step One is we had to build an
independent crew that could actually do

5304
01:25:30,169 --> 01:25:30,179
independent crew that could actually do
 

5305
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:31,910
independent crew that could actually do
that for 100 days that way everyone else

5306
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:31,920
that for 100 days that way everyone else
 

5307
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,050
that for 100 days that way everyone else
could keep working on the normal videos

5308
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:33,060
could keep working on the normal videos
 

5309
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,270
could keep working on the normal videos
and not just screw everything up yeah

5310
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,280
and not just screw everything up yeah
 

5311
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,790
and not just screw everything up yeah
um so step one you build that team okay

5312
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:37,800
um so step one you build that team okay
 

5313
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,070
um so step one you build that team okay
we got the team now what do we need well

5314
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
we got the team now what do we need well
 

5315
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,950
we got the team now what do we need well
to do this we need probably like 10

5316
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:42,960
to do this we need probably like 10
 

5317
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,169
to do this we need probably like 10
cameras at least rolling at all times so

5318
01:25:45,169 --> 01:25:45,179
cameras at least rolling at all times so
 

5319
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:46,850
cameras at least rolling at all times so
uh we're probably gonna need to get a

5320
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:46,860
uh we're probably gonna need to get a
 

5321
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:48,470
uh we're probably gonna need to get a
trailer and hook up a bunch of storage

5322
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:48,480
trailer and hook up a bunch of storage
 

5323
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,110
trailer and hook up a bunch of storage
and stuff so to just carry the sheer

5324
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
and stuff so to just carry the sheer
 

5325
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,550
and stuff so to just carry the sheer
volume of footage we're gonna have and

5326
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
volume of footage we're gonna have and
 

5327
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,430
volume of footage we're gonna have and
so get a trailer set up the cameras go

5328
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:55,440
so get a trailer set up the cameras go
 

5329
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,050
so get a trailer set up the cameras go
on the field paint a circle now we need

5330
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:57,060
on the field paint a circle now we need
 

5331
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,149
on the field paint a circle now we need
a house go buy a house bring it out

5332
01:25:59,149 --> 01:25:59,159
a house go buy a house bring it out
 

5333
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,310
a house go buy a house bring it out
there uh and then it's like oh wait I

5334
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:01,320
there uh and then it's like oh wait I
 

5335
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,450
there uh and then it's like oh wait I
think it'd be funny if I brought the

5336
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:02,460
think it'd be funny if I brought the
 

5337
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,250
think it'd be funny if I brought the
house in on the intro for yeah you know

5338
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:04,260
house in on the intro for yeah you know
 

5339
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,990
house in on the intro for yeah you know
find a crane that can lift up a house so

5340
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:06,000
find a crane that can lift up a house so
 

5341
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,310
find a crane that can lift up a house so
I can drive it in and drop it in the

5342
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:07,320
I can drive it in and drop it in the
 

5343
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,750
I can drive it in and drop it in the
intro and that's like an iterative

5344
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:08,760
intro and that's like an iterative
 

5345
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:10,129
intro and that's like an iterative
process where you're like okay this

5346
01:26:10,129 --> 01:26:10,139
process where you're like okay this
 

5347
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:11,629
process where you're like okay this
would be funnier so this is not all up

5348
01:26:11,629 --> 01:26:11,639
would be funnier so this is not all up
 

5349
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:13,729
would be funnier so this is not all up
front yeah it's like your ideally it

5350
01:26:13,729 --> 01:26:13,739
front yeah it's like your ideally it
 

5351
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:15,350
front yeah it's like your ideally it
would be but as you kind of see things

5352
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,360
would be but as you kind of see things
 

5353
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,910
would be but as you kind of see things
you get inspired and then you think of

5354
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:16,920
you get inspired and then you think of
 

5355
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,770
you get inspired and then you think of
more and more uh and then this would be

5356
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:18,780
more and more uh and then this would be
 

5357
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,689
more and more uh and then this would be

one because we shot over 100 days we

5388
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:51,600
one because we shot over 100 days we
 

5389
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,990
one because we shot over 100 days we
didn't a lot of it was just Sean and the

5390
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:54,000
didn't a lot of it was just Sean and the
 

5391
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,490
didn't a lot of it was just Sean and the
guy who was in The Circle just vlogging

5392
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:55,500
guy who was in The Circle just vlogging
 

5393
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,290
guy who was in The Circle just vlogging
I'm just gave him a camera yeah and he

5394
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:57,300
I'm just gave him a camera yeah and he
 

5395
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,729
I'm just gave him a camera yeah and he
figured it out and then we'd have like

5396
01:26:58,729 --> 01:26:58,739
figured it out and then we'd have like
 

5397
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:00,950
figured it out and then we'd have like
for him just set hours each day that I

5398
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:00,960
for him just set hours each day that I
 

5399
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,149
for him just set hours each day that I
can't remember would come so if he had

5400
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159
can't remember would come so if he had
 

5401
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:03,950
can't remember would come so if he had
any content he needed extra hands

5402
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:03,960
any content he needed extra hands
 

5403
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,090
any content he needed extra hands
instead of just having someone on

5404
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:05,100
instead of just having someone on
 

5405
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,310
instead of just having someone on
standby 24 7. it made more sense to do

5406
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:07,320
standby 24 7. it made more sense to do
 

5407
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,930
standby 24 7. it made more sense to do
set hours nice

5408
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:08,940
set hours nice
 

5409
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:12,530
set hours nice
um and uh yeah it was it was hard but

5410
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:12,540
um and uh yeah it was it was hard but
 

5411
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:14,330
um and uh yeah it was it was hard but
you know it's funny and hindsight it

5412
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:14,340
you know it's funny and hindsight it
 

5413
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,910
you know it's funny and hindsight it
sounds so simple you know and I I guess

5414
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:16,920
sounds so simple you know and I I guess
 

5415
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,770
sounds so simple you know and I I guess
like the more because that one is

5416
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:18,780
like the more because that one is
 

5417
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,930
like the more because that one is
relatively simple I guess because it's a

5418
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:20,940
relatively simple I guess because it's a
 

5419
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,490
relatively simple I guess because it's a
low number of people yeah the hard part

5420
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:22,500
low number of people yeah the hard part
 

5421
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,169
low number of people yeah the hard part
about that is just the time right like

5422
01:27:24,169 --> 01:27:24,179
about that is just the time right like
 

5423
01:27:24,179 --> 01:27:25,669
about that is just the time right like
you know I checked in on them so many

5424
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:25,679
you know I checked in on them so many
 

5425
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,649
you know I checked in on them so many
different days and it's like an hour

5426
01:27:27,649 --> 01:27:27,659
different days and it's like an hour
 

5427
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,110
different days and it's like an hour
here two hours or two hours there over a

5428
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:30,120
here two hours or two hours there over a
 

5429
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,090
here two hours or two hours there over a
hundred days adds up to be a ton of time

5430
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:32,100
hundred days adds up to be a ton of time
 

5431
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,490
hundred days adds up to be a ton of time
and and even then like you know if you

5432
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:34,500
and and even then like you know if you
 

5433
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,950
and and even then like you know if you
have a 10 person crew you know paying

5434
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:36,960
have a 10 person crew you know paying

them daily rates for 100 days it just
all that adds up what about like the 100

5438
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:40,980
all that adds up what about like the 100
 

5439

so we're like okay this time I want to
do it outside that's why the cubes are

5508
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
do it outside that's why the cubes are
 

5509
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,430
do it outside that's why the cubes are
outside

5510
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:46,440
outside
 

5511
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,050
outside
um and instead of doing circles we want

5512
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:48,060
um and instead of doing circles we want
 

5513
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,450
um and instead of doing circles we want
to make them cubes and then you know as

5514
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:50,460
to make them cubes and then you know as
 

5515
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:52,310
to make them cubes and then you know as
figuring out do we want that yeah

5516
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:52,320
figuring out do we want that yeah
 

5517
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,050
figuring out do we want that yeah
there's just those videos came up at

5518
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:54,060
there's just those videos came up at
 

5519
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,090
there's just those videos came up at
least today as ones that are like really

5520
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:56,100
least today as ones that are like really
 

5521
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,470
least today as ones that are like really
complicated in terms of the audio in

5522
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:57,480
complicated in terms of the audio in
 

5523
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,270
complicated in terms of the audio in
terms of how yeah film it yeah that's

5524
01:28:59,270 --> 01:28:59,280
terms of how yeah film it yeah that's
 

5525
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,010
terms of how yeah film it yeah that's
the problem we had a lot of audio issues

5526
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:01,020
the problem we had a lot of audio issues
 

5527
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,810
the problem we had a lot of audio issues
because uh in the first one we didn't

5528
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:02,820
because uh in the first one we didn't
 

5529
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:04,729
because uh in the first one we didn't
have a roof on it the second one there

5530
01:29:04,729 --> 01:29:04,739
have a roof on it the second one there
 

5531
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,350
have a roof on it the second one there
was a roof so there's a lot of Reverb

5532
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:06,360
was a roof so there's a lot of Reverb
 

5533
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,570
was a roof so there's a lot of Reverb
which then in editing made it brutal

5534
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:08,580
which then in editing made it brutal
 

5535
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,790
which then in editing made it brutal
like half the shots weren't usable and

5536
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:10,800
like half the shots weren't usable and
 

5537
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,470
like half the shots weren't usable and
it really screwed us over so we had to

5538
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:12,480
it really screwed us over so we had to
 

5539
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,669
it really screwed us over so we had to
do a lot of frankensteining in the

5540
01:29:13,669 --> 01:29:13,679
do a lot of frankensteining in the
 

5541
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,290
do a lot of frankensteining in the
editing to make up for basically my

5542
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:15,300
editing to make up for basically my
 

5543
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,390
editing to make up for basically my
ignorance so you mentioned that you were

5544
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:17,400
ignorance so you mentioned that you were
 

5545
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,450
ignorance so you mentioned that you were
surprised how well that that one did a

5546
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:20,460
surprised how well that that one did a
 

5547
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,610
surprised how well that that one did a
lot of creators talk about getting

5548
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:22,620
lot of creators talk about getting
 

5549
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:23,990
lot of creators talk about getting
depressed

5550
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
depressed
 

5551
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,729
depressed
when um

5552
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:25,739
when um
 

5553

when um
the videos don't do as well as they kind

the videos don't do as well as they kind
of expect it there's the kind of feeling

5556
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:29,760
of expect it there's the kind of feeling
 

5557

um yeah it's weird because I am a
 

5569
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:44,169
um yeah it's weird because I am a
numbers guy but also it it used to it

5570
01:29:44,169 --> 01:29:44,179
numbers guy but also it it used to it
 

5571
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:46,490
numbers guy but also it it used to it
used to very much especially when I was

5572
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:46,500
used to very much especially when I was
 

5573
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,410
used to very much especially when I was
like betting everything I had on a video

5574
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:48,420
like betting everything I had on a video
 

5575
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,229
like betting everything I had on a video
when it did bad I was devastating I'd

5576
01:29:51,229 --> 01:29:51,239
when it did bad I was devastating I'd
 

5577
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:53,510
when it did bad I was devastating I'd
cry and I'd be depressed for days and it

5578
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:53,520
cry and I'd be depressed for days and it
 

5579
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,129
cry and I'd be depressed for days and it
really would have a severe impact on my

5580
01:29:55,129 --> 01:29:55,139
really would have a severe impact on my
 

5581
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,810
really would have a severe impact on my
mood but I don't know now it doesn't

5582
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:56,820
mood but I don't know now it doesn't
 

5583
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,090
mood but I don't know now it doesn't
really matter it's uh if a video that's

5584
01:29:59,090 --> 01:29:59,100
really matter it's uh if a video that's
 

5585
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,890
really matter it's uh if a video that's
bad I just look at it and I'm like oh

5586
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:00,900
bad I just look at it and I'm like oh
 

5587
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,410
bad I just look at it and I'm like oh
why'd this video do bad uh probably oh

5588
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:03,420
why'd this video do bad uh probably oh
 

5589
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,450
why'd this video do bad uh probably oh
there's a little retention dip there I

5590
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:05,460
there's a little retention dip there I
 

5591
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,590
there's a little retention dip there I
don't think people like the thumbnail

5592
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:06,600
don't think people like the thumbnail
 

5593
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,209
don't think people like the thumbnail
maybe we should switch it I just look at

5594
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:08,219
maybe we should switch it I just look at
 

5595
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:10,370
maybe we should switch it I just look at
it objectively unemotional and then just

5596
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:10,380
it objectively unemotional and then just
 

5597
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,810
it objectively unemotional and then just
move on and I feel like that's a much

5598
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:11,820
move on and I feel like that's a much
 

5599
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:14,149
move on and I feel like that's a much
healthier way of going about it so if a

5600
01:30:14,149 --> 01:30:14,159
healthier way of going about it so if a
 

5601
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,709
healthier way of going about it so if a
Creator is listening like that is the

5602
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:15,719
Creator is listening like that is the
 

5603
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:17,870
Creator is listening like that is the
ideal way to

5604
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:17,880
ideal way to
 

5605
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,729
ideal way to
um respond to a video that's doing bad

5606
01:30:19,729 --> 01:30:19,739
um respond to a video that's doing bad
 

5607
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:21,709
um respond to a video that's doing bad
just remove emotion from the equation

5608
01:30:21,709 --> 01:30:21,719
just remove emotion from the equation
 

5609
01:30:21,719 --> 01:30:23,330
just remove emotion from the equation
and just look at it and figure out how

5610
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:23,340
and just look at it and figure out how
 

5611
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,649
and just look at it and figure out how
you can search the next one is there

5612
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:24,659
you can search the next one is there
 

5613
01:30:24,659 --> 01:30:26,629
you can search the next one is there
tricks to detect being able to detach

5614
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:26,639
tricks to detect being able to detach
 

5615
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,729
tricks to detect being able to detach
yourself from the from that because

5616
01:30:28,729 --> 01:30:28,739
yourself from the from that because
 

5617
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:31,129
yourself from the from that because
because I in your case I mean that's

5618
01:30:31,129 --> 01:30:31,139
because I in your case I mean that's
 

5619
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:33,229
because I in your case I mean that's
true for creators but in your case

5620
01:30:33,229 --> 01:30:33,239
true for creators but in your case
 

5621
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:35,330
true for creators but in your case
there's like a lot of money on the line

5622
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,340
there's like a lot of money on the line
 

5623
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:38,090
there's like a lot of money on the line
yeah well there's videos yeah so much

5624
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:38,100
yeah well there's videos yeah so much
 

5625
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,090
yeah well there's videos yeah so much
time but no I mean you just I mean I

5626
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:41,100
time but no I mean you just I mean I
 

5627
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,350
time but no I mean you just I mean I
don't know the only real answer is it's

5628
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:42,360
don't know the only real answer is it's
 

5629
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,669
don't know the only real answer is it's
just the conscious effort you just have

5630
01:30:43,669 --> 01:30:43,679
just the conscious effort you just have
 

5631
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,470
just the conscious effort you just have
to unemotionally look at the video

5632
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:45,480
to unemotionally look at the video
 

5633
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,270
to unemotionally look at the video
determine the problems and then move on

5634
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280
determine the problems and then move on
 

5635
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,370
determine the problems and then move on
like there's there is no secret you know

5636
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:49,380
like there's there is no secret you know
 

5637
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,990
like there's there is no secret you know
what I mean it's just that's it's that

5638
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:51,000
what I mean it's just that's it's that
 

5639
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,250
what I mean it's just that's it's that
and if you really can't bring yourself

5640
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:52,260
and if you really can't bring yourself
 

5641
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:53,390
and if you really can't bring yourself
to do it then you're just screwed

5642
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:53,400
to do it then you're just screwed
 

5643
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,129
to do it then you're just screwed
honestly maybe you're not meant for this

5644
01:30:55,129 --> 01:30:55,139
honestly maybe you're not meant for this
 

5645
01:30:55,139 --> 01:30:56,510
honestly maybe you're not meant for this
game

5646
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:56,520
game
 

5647
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,189
game
okay so that's part of the development

5648
01:30:58,189 --> 01:30:58,199
okay so that's part of the development
 

5649
01:30:58,199 --> 01:30:59,930
okay so that's part of the development
as the Creator is like being able to be

5650
01:30:59,930 --> 01:30:59,940
as the Creator is like being able to be
 

5651
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:01,850
as the Creator is like being able to be
a different longevity yes yeah you have

5652
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:01,860
a different longevity yes yeah you have
 

5653
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:03,709
a different longevity yes yeah you have
to unemotionally be able to look at

5654
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:03,719
to unemotionally be able to look at
 

5655
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:05,810
to unemotionally be able to look at
videos that flop and figure it out uh

5656
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:05,820
videos that flop and figure it out uh
 

5657
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,090
videos that flop and figure it out uh
because if not just getting you can not

5658
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,100
because if not just getting you can not
 

5659
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,470
because if not just getting you can not
every video can be a one out of ten and

5660
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:09,480
every video can be a one out of ten and
 

5661
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:11,810
every video can be a one out of ten and
so when a video does bad you know that

5662
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:11,820
so when a video does bad you know that
 

5663
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,850
so when a video does bad you know that
that just stress and depression it's

5664
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:13,860
that just stress and depression it's
 

5665
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:15,050
that just stress and depression it's
just gonna eventually get to you in the

5666
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:15,060
just gonna eventually get to you in the
 

5667
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,450
just gonna eventually get to you in the
long run so you said you've uh failed in

5668
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:17,460
long run so you said you've uh failed in
 

5669
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:18,830
long run so you said you've uh failed in
a bunch of videos

5670
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:18,840
a bunch of videos
 

5671
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,070
a bunch of videos
uh sort of taking them to completion so

5672
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:22,080
uh sort of taking them to completion so
 

5673
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,649
uh sort of taking them to completion so
what are some of the biggest fails yeah

5674
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:24,659
what are some of the biggest fails yeah
 

5675
01:31:24,659 --> 01:31:26,510
what are some of the biggest fails yeah
weirdly enough as we've matured and

5676
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:26,520
weirdly enough as we've matured and
 

5677
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,709
weirdly enough as we've matured and
we've done this more we don't have that

5678
01:31:27,709 --> 01:31:27,719
we've done this more we don't have that
 

5679
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:29,270
we've done this more we don't have that
problem as much especially that we're

5680
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:29,280
problem as much especially that we're
 

5681
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,229
problem as much especially that we're
getting into the multi-million dollar

5682
01:31:30,229 --> 01:31:30,239
getting into the multi-million dollar
 

5683
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:32,870
getting into the multi-million dollar
budgets per video it's like failure is

5684
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:32,880
budgets per video it's like failure is
 

5685
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,030
budgets per video it's like failure is
not really an option anymore so I'm a

5686
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:35,040
not really an option anymore so I'm a
 

5687
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,350
not really an option anymore so I'm a
little more particular about what I do

5688
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:36,360
little more particular about what I do
 

5689
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,629
little more particular about what I do
but back in the day yeah like we would

5690
01:31:38,629 --> 01:31:38,639
but back in the day yeah like we would
 

5691
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,790
but back in the day yeah like we would
do a video where we spent 24 hours on a

5692
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:40,800
do a video where we spent 24 hours on a
 

5693
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,669
do a video where we spent 24 hours on a
desert island and uh we filmed it did it

5694
01:31:43,669 --> 01:31:43,679
desert island and uh we filmed it did it
 

5695
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,950
desert island and uh we filmed it did it
all and I just I didn't like it after

5696
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:45,960
all and I just I didn't like it after
 

5697
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,990
all and I just I didn't like it after
the edit so I just grabbed the voice and

5698
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:48,000
the edit so I just grabbed the voice and
 

5699
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,490
the edit so I just grabbed the voice and
we went back to the deserted island and

5700
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:49,500
we went back to the deserted island and
 

5701
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,930
we went back to the deserted island and
spent another 24 hours there and

5702
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:50,940
spent another 24 hours there and
 

5703
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,250
spent another 24 hours there and
refilmed it

5704
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:52,260
refilmed it
 

5705
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:55,370
refilmed it
um or uh could that have been caught and

5706
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:55,380
um or uh could that have been caught and
 

5707
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,410
um or uh could that have been caught and
prevented at the idea stage like where

5708
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:57,420
prevented at the idea stage like where
 

5709
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,090
prevented at the idea stage like where
like no it's a good idea it was just

5710
01:31:59,090 --> 01:31:59,100
like no it's a good idea it was just
 

5711
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,470
like no it's a good idea it was just
poor execution to be honest when we were

5712
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:00,480
poor execution to be honest when we were
 

5713
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,330
poor execution to be honest when we were
out there it was hot we were we're just

5714
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:02,340
out there it was hot we were we're just
 

5715
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:04,070
out there it was hot we were we're just
like we all at one point just kind of

5716
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,080
like we all at one point just kind of
 

5717
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,629
like we all at one point just kind of
wanted to die it was just miserable so

5718
01:32:05,629 --> 01:32:05,639
wanted to die it was just miserable so
 

5719
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:07,189
wanted to die it was just miserable so
how do we how do you avoid that these

5720
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:07,199
how do we how do you avoid that these
 

5721
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,410
how do we how do you avoid that these
days uh well I just thought it was a

5722
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:09,420
days uh well I just thought it was a
 

5723
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:10,970
days uh well I just thought it was a
little cooler to be honest and then we

5724
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:10,980
little cooler to be honest and then we
 

5725
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,530
little cooler to be honest and then we
had literally the amount of fun we had

5726
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:12,540
had literally the amount of fun we had
 

5727
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:14,390
had literally the amount of fun we had
in the video was like 10 times higher oh

5728
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:14,400
in the video was like 10 times higher oh
 

5729
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,250
in the video was like 10 times higher oh
interesting so you like there's some

5730
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:16,260
interesting so you like there's some
 

5731
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:17,570
interesting so you like there's some
practical details that you just learned

5732
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:17,580
practical details that you just learned
 

5733
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:18,770
practical details that you just learned
yeah I don't know what it takes videos

just some videos that require me to be
 

5765
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,890
just some videos that require me to be
on a boat so I just suck it up

5766
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:54,900
on a boat so I just suck it up
 

5767
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,930
on a boat so I just suck it up
um so when you spend months in creating

5768
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:56,940
um so when you spend months in creating
 

5769
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,550
um so when you spend months in creating
a video I know this is probably

5770

a video I know this is probably
 

5771
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,370
a video I know this is probably
stressful to some creators

5772
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:00,380
stressful to some creators

to the point where I'm almost about to
 

5787
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,610
to the point where I'm almost about to
puke I'm like I really hope people like

it's a little bit easier to attach

5812
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:41,940
it's a little bit easier to attach
 

5813
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:44,629
it's a little bit easier to attach
yourself I guess and that's I it's a

5814
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
yourself I guess and that's I it's a
 

5815
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:45,890
yourself I guess and that's I it's a
much healthier place to be you can't do

5816
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:45,900
much healthier place to be you can't do
 

5817
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,990
much healthier place to be you can't do
this for 10 years if every little thing

just causes these huge emotional
reactions it's like that's why a lot of

5822
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:52,500
reactions it's like that's why a lot of
 

5823
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,470
reactions it's like that's why a lot of
creators go a little you know mentally

5824
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:54,480
creators go a little you know mentally
 

5825
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,629
creators go a little you know mentally
insane you know you have to get out of

messes with you we've talked about this
a little bit but how do you define and

5832
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:02,820
a little bit but how do you define and
 

5833
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:07,570
a little bit but how do you define and
how do you suggest others define success

5834
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:07,580

 

5835
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:10,250

some people success is retiring their

5836
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:10,260
some people success is retiring their
 

5837
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,010
some people success is retiring their
mom

5838
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:12,020
mom
 

5839
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:14,990
mom
is inspiring people and educating them

5840
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:15,000
is inspiring people and educating them
 

5841
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,550
is inspiring people and educating them
and you know whatever they're peaking

5842
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:16,560
and you know whatever they're peaking
 

5843
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,290
and you know whatever they're peaking
their curiosity

5844
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:18,300
their curiosity
 

5845
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,090
their curiosity
um for other people it's just quitting

5846
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:20,100
um for other people it's just quitting
 

5847
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,770
um for other people it's just quitting
their job so you have to self-reflect on

5848
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:21,780
their job so you have to self-reflect on
 

5849
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:23,149
their job so you have to self-reflect on
what your definition of success is

5850
01:34:23,149 --> 01:34:23,159
what your definition of success is
 

5851
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:24,709
what your definition of success is
because I think a lot of creators kind

5852
01:34:24,709 --> 01:34:24,719
because I think a lot of creators kind
 

5853
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,930
because I think a lot of creators kind
of don't really think don't introspect

5854
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:28,940
of don't really think don't introspect
 

5855
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:31,430
of don't really think don't introspect
like they kind of want to keep getting

5856
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:31,440
like they kind of want to keep getting
 

5857
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,050
like they kind of want to keep getting

and yeah but subscribers is just a
 

5861
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:37,729
and yeah but subscribers is just a
vanity metric you know it doesn't

5862
01:34:37,729 --> 01:34:37,739
vanity metric you know it doesn't
 

5863
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:40,790
vanity metric you know it doesn't
subscribers don't correlate to views

5864
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:40,800
subscribers don't correlate to views
 

5865
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,070
subscribers don't correlate to views

five years ago it used to be a thing

5892
01:35:05,629 --> 01:35:05,639
five years ago it used to be a thing
 

5893
01:35:05,639 --> 01:35:07,490
five years ago it used to be a thing
it's not anymore no one does

5894
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:07,500
it's not anymore no one does
 

5895
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,689
it's not anymore no one does
um and it's getting harder and harder to

5896
01:35:08,689 --> 01:35:08,699
um and it's getting harder and harder to
 

5897
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:10,550
um and it's getting harder and harder to
find I subscribe to way too many

5898
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:10,560
find I subscribe to way too many
 

5899
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,290
find I subscribe to way too many
channels I think yeah that's what

5900
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:12,300
channels I think yeah that's what
 

5901
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,850
channels I think yeah that's what
everyone does and you subscribe to 10

5902
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:13,860
everyone does and you subscribe to 10
 

5903
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:15,110
everyone does and you subscribe to 10
channels they're great but two years

5904
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:15,120
channels they're great but two years
 

5905
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,850
channels they're great but two years
later your taste evolves and it's like

5906
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:16,860
later your taste evolves and it's like
 

5907
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:18,590
later your taste evolves and it's like
it's a mess and so

5908
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:18,600
it's a mess and so
 

5909
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,750
it's a mess and so
um subscribers don't really matter

5910
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:20,760
um subscribers don't really matter
 

5911
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,550
um subscribers don't really matter
followers on Tick Tock don't really

5912
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:22,560
followers on Tick Tock don't really
 

5913
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,510
followers on Tick Tock don't really
matter

5914
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:23,520
matter
 

5915
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,290
matter
um so anyways it really they really are

5916
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:27,300
um so anyways it really they really are
 

5917
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,030
um so anyways it really they really are
the definition of a vanity metric and

5918
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
the definition of a vanity metric and
 

5919
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,490
the definition of a vanity metric and
but what about views they do obviously

5920
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:31,500
but what about views they do obviously
 

5921
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,629
but what about views they do obviously
because if people are showing up time

5922
01:35:32,629 --> 01:35:32,639
because if people are showing up time
 

5923
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:34,490
because if people are showing up time
and time again that's what matters okay

5924
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:34,500
and time again that's what matters okay
 

5925
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,709
and time again that's what matters okay
so that

5926
01:35:36,709 --> 01:35:36,719
so that
 

5927
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,510
so that
that's a good thing to uh Define a

5928
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:38,520
that's a good thing to uh Define a
 

5929
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,930
that's a good thing to uh Define a
success I just feel like um that too can

5930
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:41,940
success I just feel like um that too can
 

5931
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,129
success I just feel like um that too can
be a problem

5932
01:35:43,129 --> 01:35:43,139
be a problem
 

5933
01:35:43,139 --> 01:35:45,770
be a problem
because uh

5934
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:45,780
because uh
 

5935
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:48,530
because uh
I would say you know if I wanted to be

5936
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:48,540

if it doesn't recharge you you're
 

6107
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:42,590
if it doesn't recharge you you're
screwed you're just a ticking time but

6120
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:56,760
crucial to my success which takes a lot
 

6121
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,970
crucial to my success which takes a lot
of maturing to come to that conclusion

6122
01:38:58,970 --> 01:38:58,980
of maturing to come to that conclusion
 

6123
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,410
of maturing to come to that conclusion
because I used to be the kind of guy

6124
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:00,420
because I used to be the kind of guy
 

6125

because I used to be the kind of guy
that wanted to work every hour of the

6127
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,669
that wanted to work every hour of the

day and I would try to train myself to
 

6129
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:07,250
day and I would try to train myself to
not need that stuff and I you know and I

6130
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:07,260
not need that stuff and I you know and I
 

6131
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:10,310
not need that stuff and I you know and I
almost resented like that I I have to do

6132
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:10,320
almost resented like that I I have to do
 

6133
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,450
almost resented like that I I have to do
these kinds of things and it would piss

6134
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:11,460
these kinds of things and it would piss
 

6135
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:13,310
these kinds of things and it would piss
me off because it's not optimal and you

6136
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:13,320
me off because it's not optimal and you
 

6137
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,510

know I just really want to make content

6138
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:14,520
know I just really want to make content
 

6139
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,570
know I just really want to make content
and entertain people but yeah as someone

6140
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:17,580
and entertain people but yeah as someone
 

6141
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:19,250
and entertain people but yeah as someone
who's gone down that road and you know

6142
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:19,260
who's gone down that road and you know
 

6143
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:21,229
who's gone down that road and you know
you just work every day for two three

6144
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:21,239
you just work every day for two three
 

6145
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:22,669
you just work every day for two three
months straight and you know every hour

6146
01:39:22,669 --> 01:39:22,679
months straight and you know every hour
 

6147
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:24,649
months straight and you know every hour
of the day and then you just a bomb

6148
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:24,659
of the day and then you just a bomb
 

6149
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:26,270
of the day and then you just a bomb
waiting to explode and lose your mind

6150
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:26,280
waiting to explode and lose your mind
 

6151
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,669
waiting to explode and lose your mind
and the only real sustainable thing is

6152
01:39:28,669 --> 01:39:28,679
and the only real sustainable thing is
 

6153
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:30,770
and the only real sustainable thing is
to just like give yourself time to

6154
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:30,780
to just like give yourself time to
 

6155
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:32,450
to just like give yourself time to
recharge in between working

6156
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:32,460
recharge in between working
 

6157
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,669
recharge in between working
so there's a kind of balance you have to

6158
01:39:34,669 --> 01:39:34,679
so there's a kind of balance you have to
 

6159
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:37,430
so there's a kind of balance you have to
find you have to even and I hate it more

6160
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:37,440
find you have to even and I hate it more
 

6161
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,770
find you have to even and I hate it more
than anyone else because I you know you

6162
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:39,780
than anyone else because I you know you
 

6163
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:42,229
than anyone else because I you know you
hate not working yes because it's just

6164
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
hate not working yes because it's just
 

6165

hate not working yes because it's just
not optimal for time like it's it's it's

01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:28,800
needs and we're like that one looks like
 

6273
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,169
needs and we're like that one looks like
the most important we'll do that and

6274
01:41:30,169 --> 01:41:30,179
the most important we'll do that and
 

6275
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:32,990
the most important we'll do that and
then so it's just kind of like you know

6276
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:33,000
then so it's just kind of like you know
 

6277
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,790
then so it's just kind of like you know
if I just did that for every company in

6278
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:34,800
if I just did that for every company in
 

6279
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,950
if I just did that for every company in
a day then that's optimal if I just kind

6280
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:36,960
a day then that's optimal if I just kind
 

6281
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,510
a day then that's optimal if I just kind
of like an optimal day for me would be

6282
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:38,520
of like an optimal day for me would be
 

6283
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,950
of like an optimal day for me would be
going down the eight companies and just

6284
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:39,960
going down the eight companies and just
 

6285
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:41,750
going down the eight companies and just
whatever they're like two to three

6286
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:41,760
whatever they're like two to three
 

6287
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,189
whatever they're like two to three
biggest pain points or things to need

6288
01:41:43,189 --> 01:41:43,199
biggest pain points or things to need
 

6289
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:44,930
biggest pain points or things to need
from me and just doing those based on

6290
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:44,940
from me and just doing those based on
 

6291
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,209
from me and just doing those based on
priority and then trying to keep it as

6292
01:41:47,209 --> 01:41:47,219
priority and then trying to keep it as
 

6293
01:41:47,219 --> 01:41:48,890
priority and then trying to keep it as
short as possible yeah to just the

6294
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:48,900
short as possible yeah to just the
 

6295
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,450
short as possible yeah to just the
things that you're needed on it doesn't

6296
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:50,460
things that you're needed on it doesn't
 

6297
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:51,770
things that you're needed on it doesn't
get more optimal than that if I clear

6298
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:51,780
get more optimal than that if I clear
 

6299
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,629
get more optimal than that if I clear
the bottlenecks or some bottlenecks for

6300
01:41:53,629 --> 01:41:53,639
the bottlenecks or some bottlenecks for

the lessons with the lucrative thing you
know what I mean yeah because you you

6406
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:33,060
know what I mean yeah because you you

should be online and and so then it's
 

6461
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:31,189
should be online and and so then it's
like okay and now I'm not trying to

6462
01:44:31,189 --> 01:44:31,199
like okay and now I'm not trying to

or value or or see the difference and I
 

6477
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,570
or value or or see the difference and I
I tried basically for building this

6478
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:47,580
I tried basically for building this
 

6479
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:48,830
I tried basically for building this
company with like four or five different

6480
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:48,840
company with like four or five different
 

6481
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:51,169
company with like four or five different
people who worked in different veins of

6482
01:44:51,169 --> 01:44:51,179
people who worked in different veins of
 

6483
01:44:51,179 --> 01:44:54,950
people who worked in different veins of
media and you know every single time it

6484
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:54,960
media and you know every single time it
 

6485
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,270
media and you know every single time it
just like they just don't get it and

6486
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:56,280
just like they just don't get it and

they like they don't understand my world
 

6489
01:44:57,780 --> 01:45:00,470
they like they don't understand my world
and the the eventual solution was just

01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
and the the eventual solution was just
 

6491
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:01,850

to build this company we got to figure

6502
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:10,080
to build this company we got to figure
 

6503
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,570
to build this company we got to figure
the [\h__\h] out ourselves and you have to

6504
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:11,580
the [\h__\h] out ourselves and you have to
 

6505
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:12,770
the [\h__\h] out ourselves and you have to
kind of build up people from scratch

6506
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:12,780
kind of build up people from scratch
 

6507
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:14,450
kind of build up people from scratch
then yeah exactly all the stuff I was

6508
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:14,460
then yeah exactly all the stuff I was
 

6509
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,950
then yeah exactly all the stuff I was
talking about earlier and all the the

6510
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:15,960
talking about earlier and all the the
 

6511
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:17,870
talking about earlier and all the the
lessons I learned along the way

6512
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:17,880
lessons I learned along the way
 

6513
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,310
lessons I learned along the way
um and Sophie for me that was a big part

6514
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:19,320
um and Sophie for me that was a big part
 

6515
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:22,310
um and Sophie for me that was a big part
of like and try to stop trying to have

like my whole life studying YouTube

6522
01:45:27,649 --> 01:45:27,659
like my whole life studying YouTube
 

6523
01:45:27,659 --> 01:45:29,450
like my whole life studying YouTube
videos of virality not business building

6524
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:29,460
videos of virality not business building
 

6525
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,850
videos of virality not business building
but [\h__\h] I was like I guess we just got

6526
01:45:31,850 --> 01:45:31,860
but [\h__\h] I was like I guess we just got
 

6527
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:33,590
but [\h__\h] I was like I guess we just got
to do it ourselves and

6528
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:33,600
to do it ourselves and
 

6529
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,790
to do it ourselves and
um and that's where things really start

6530
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:34,800
um and that's where things really start
 

6531
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,470
um and that's where things really start
to click and we got the exponential

6532
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:36,480
to click and we got the exponential
 

6533
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,430
to click and we got the exponential
growth we started getting the right

6534
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:37,440
growth we started getting the right
 

6535
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,570
growth we started getting the right
people and training them the right way

6536
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:38,580
people and training them the right way
 

6537
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:41,030
people and training them the right way
and you know just throwing conventional

6538
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:41,040
and you know just throwing conventional
 

6539
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,410
and you know just throwing conventional
stuff out the door and focusing on

6540
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:42,420
stuff out the door and focusing on
 

6541
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:44,390
stuff out the door and focusing on
what's actually practical for YouTube

6542
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:44,400
what's actually practical for YouTube
 

6543
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,850
what's actually practical for YouTube
which is just completely different than

6544
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:46,860
which is just completely different than
 

6545
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:48,649
which is just completely different than
traditional media

6546
01:45:48,649 --> 01:45:48,659
traditional media
 

6547
01:45:48,659 --> 01:45:50,629
traditional media
so you train people and then those

6548
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639
so you train people and then those
 

6549
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,270
so you train people and then those
people train people and and so on yeah I

6550
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:53,280
people train people and and so on yeah I
 

6551
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,129
people train people and and so on yeah I
mean it's just even like you know how

6552
01:45:55,129 --> 01:45:55,139
mean it's just even like you know how
 

6553
01:45:55,139 --> 01:45:57,169
mean it's just even like you know how
you do the lighting on sets or like how

6554
01:45:57,169 --> 01:45:57,179
you do the lighting on sets or like how
 

6555
01:45:57,179 --> 01:46:00,290
you do the lighting on sets or like how
you do the audio or or um you know not

6556
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:00,300
you do the audio or or um you know not
 

6557
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:02,629
you do the audio or or um you know not
writing scripts so you know we're just

6558
01:46:02,629 --> 01:46:02,639
writing scripts so you know we're just
 

6559
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,070
writing scripts so you know we're just
not as efficient with our filming like

6560
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:04,080
not as efficient with our filming like
 

6561
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,570
not as efficient with our filming like
sometimes I have to have 30 cameras

6562
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:05,580
sometimes I have to have 30 cameras
 

6563
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:07,669
sometimes I have to have 30 cameras
running why because it's not scripted I

6564
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
running why because it's not scripted I
 

6565
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:08,810
running why because it's not scripted I
don't I don't know what Chris is gonna

6566
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:08,820
don't I don't know what Chris is gonna
 

6567
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,330
don't I don't know what Chris is gonna
do when we start filming he might run

6568
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:11,340
do when we start filming he might run
 

6569
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:13,010
do when we start filming he might run
over there but guess what we got to have

6570
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:13,020
over there but guess what we got to have
 

6571
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:14,209
over there but guess what we got to have
it planned because there's only one shot

6572
01:46:14,209 --> 01:46:14,219
it planned because there's only one shot
 

6573
01:46:14,219 --> 01:46:15,830
it planned because there's only one shot
I can't you know tell them not to do

6574
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:15,840
I can't you know tell them not to do
 

6575
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,629
I can't you know tell them not to do
that yeah that's the shooting but then

6576
01:46:17,629 --> 01:46:17,639
that yeah that's the shooting but then
 

6577
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:19,129
that yeah that's the shooting but then
there's also the editing yeah and then

6578
01:46:19,129 --> 01:46:19,139
there's also the editing yeah and then
 

6579
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:20,330
there's also the editing yeah and then
the editing as well and not having

6580
01:46:20,330 --> 01:46:20,340
the editing as well and not having
 

6581
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:23,570
the editing as well and not having
guardrails and kind of you know I at the

6582
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:23,580
guardrails and kind of you know I at the
 

6583
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:24,950
guardrails and kind of you know I at the
end of the day it's whatever I want the

6584
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960
end of the day it's whatever I want the
 

6585
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,109
end of the day it's whatever I want the
video their job is to make a video that

6586
01:46:27,109 --> 01:46:27,119
video their job is to make a video that
 

6587
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:28,430
video their job is to make a video that
they think I'll like because it's my

6588
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:28,440
they think I'll like because it's my
 

6589
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,290
they think I'll like because it's my
channel but you know you can achieve

6590
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:30,300
channel but you know you can achieve
 

6591
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,390
channel but you know you can achieve
that kind of however and

6592
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:32,400
that kind of however and
 

6593
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,709
that kind of however and
um and so it's just everything's just

6594
01:46:33,709 --> 01:46:33,719
um and so it's just everything's just
 

6595
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,330
um and so it's just everything's just
different you know it's much more I

6596
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:35,340
different you know it's much more I
 

6597
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:37,850
different you know it's much more I
guess like a startup as opposed to

6598
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:37,860
guess like a startup as opposed to
 

6599
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:39,830
guess like a startup as opposed to
um are you often surprised like with the

6600
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:39,840
um are you often surprised like with the
 

6601
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,030
um are you often surprised like with the
result like

6602
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
result like
 

6603
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,310
result like
you think a certain like we watched the

6604
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:43,320
you think a certain like we watched the
 

6605
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,990
you think a certain like we watched the
video today that was really nice those

6606
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:45,000
video today that was really nice those
 

6607
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,189
video today that was really nice those
different than you would have

6608
01:46:46,189 --> 01:46:46,199
different than you would have
 

6609
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:48,050
different than you would have
potentially edited yeah are you

6610
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:48,060
potentially edited yeah are you
 

6611
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,270
potentially edited yeah are you
sometimes surprised by like a decision

6612
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:50,280
sometimes surprised by like a decision
 

6613
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,370
sometimes surprised by like a decision
editor makes it's like okay that's not

6614
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:52,380
editor makes it's like okay that's not
 

6615
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:53,629
editor makes it's like okay that's not
the way I would have done it but it's

6616
01:46:53,629 --> 01:46:53,639
the way I would have done it but it's
 

6617
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:55,550
the way I would have done it but it's
actually this is a cool idea yeah of

6618
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:55,560
actually this is a cool idea yeah of
 

6619
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:58,370
actually this is a cool idea yeah of
course yeah now um the thing my biggest

6620
01:46:58,370 --> 01:46:58,380
course yeah now um the thing my biggest
 

6621
01:46:58,380 --> 01:46:59,930
course yeah now um the thing my biggest
fear is I don't ever want to get trapped

6622
01:46:59,930 --> 01:46:59,940
fear is I don't ever want to get trapped
 

6623
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:02,270
fear is I don't ever want to get trapped
in like a bubble of you know because we

6624
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:02,280
in like a bubble of you know because we
 

6625
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:03,709
in like a bubble of you know because we
are getting 100 million views of video

6626
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:03,719
are getting 100 million views of video
 

6627
01:47:03,719 --> 01:47:05,390
are getting 100 million views of video
on the main Channel like but I don't

6628
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:05,400
on the main Channel like but I don't
 

6629
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,129
on the main Channel like but I don't
want to get in this feedback loop of

6630
01:47:07,129 --> 01:47:07,139
want to get in this feedback loop of
 

6631
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:10,070
want to get in this feedback loop of
just my ideas are great or or not

6632
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
just my ideas are great or or not
 

6633
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,629
just my ideas are great or or not
feedback loop but stop learning and

6634
01:47:11,629 --> 01:47:11,639
feedback loop but stop learning and
 

6635
01:47:11,639 --> 01:47:14,689
feedback loop but stop learning and
improving because it is easy sometimes

6636
01:47:14,689 --> 01:47:14,699
improving because it is easy sometimes
 

6637
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:15,770
improving because it is easy sometimes
to be like what we're doing is working

6638
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:15,780
to be like what we're doing is working
 

6639
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,510
to be like what we're doing is working
we need to just keep doing it I want to

6640
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:17,520
we need to just keep doing it I want to
 

6641
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,149
we need to just keep doing it I want to
keep learning and trying new things and

6642
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:20,159
keep learning and trying new things and
 

6643
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:22,850
keep learning and trying new things and
I guess one way I'd put is like you

6644
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:22,860
I guess one way I'd put is like you
 

6645
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,850
I guess one way I'd put is like you
don't when when you're on a a come up or

6646
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:25,860
don't when when you're on a a come up or
 

6647
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:28,430
don't when when you're on a a come up or
you're growing you don't want to uh Test

6648
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,440
you're growing you don't want to uh Test
 

6649
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:31,250
you're growing you don't want to uh Test
new things once uh you start to Plateau

6650
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:31,260
new things once uh you start to Plateau
 

6651
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,590
new things once uh you start to Plateau
or have a downtrend because if you're

6652
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:33,600
or have a downtrend because if you're
 

6653
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,510
or have a downtrend because if you're
like you know you you're skyrocketing

6654
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
like you know you you're skyrocketing
 

6655
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,430
like you know you you're skyrocketing
right you're up up and then you level

6656
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:37,440
right you're up up and then you level
 

6657
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,990
right you're up up and then you level
off you start to go down and you're like

6658
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:39,000
off you start to go down and you're like
 

6659
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,250
off you start to go down and you're like
oh this isn't working anymore let's

6660
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:40,260
oh this isn't working anymore let's
 

6661
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,689
oh this isn't working anymore let's
start experimenting well if you have a

6662
01:47:41,689 --> 01:47:41,699
start experimenting well if you have a
 

6663
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:43,669
start experimenting well if you have a
bad experiment now you're in like a

6664
01:47:43,669 --> 01:47:43,679
bad experiment now you're in like a
 

6665
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:45,590
bad experiment now you're in like a
tailspin you're nose diving and you have

6666
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,600
tailspin you're nose diving and you have
 

6667
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,850
tailspin you're nose diving and you have
one more bad experiment you're like

6668
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:46,860
one more bad experiment you're like
 

6669
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:49,070
one more bad experiment you're like
screwed kind of I'm oversimplify you

6670
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:49,080
screwed kind of I'm oversimplify you
 

6671
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,570
screwed kind of I'm oversimplify you
want to test things while you're still

6672
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:50,580
want to test things while you're still
 

6673
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,669
want to test things while you're still
growing to keep the growing from

6674
01:47:52,669 --> 01:47:52,679
growing to keep the growing from
 

6675
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:55,370
growing to keep the growing from
happening because once you like have you

6676
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:55,380
happening because once you like have you
 

6677
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:57,050
happening because once you like have you
know again very oversimplifying that

6678
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:57,060
know again very oversimplifying that
 

6679
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:59,510
know again very oversimplifying that
like you know kind of level off you do a

6680
01:47:59,510 --> 01:47:59,520
like you know kind of level off you do a
 

6681
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,310
like you know kind of level off you do a
couple tests that go wrong am I you're

6682
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:01,320
couple tests that go wrong am I you're
 

6683
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,750
couple tests that go wrong am I you're
like screwed you know you're already out

6684
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:02,760
like screwed you know you're already out
 

6685
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,950
like screwed you know you're already out
the door now you're just confirming that

6686
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:03,960
the door now you're just confirming that
 

6687
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,510
the door now you're just confirming that
you're out the door an online

6688
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:05,520
you're out the door an online
 

6689
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,550
you're out the door an online
entertainment so that's kind of how I

6690
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:07,560
entertainment so that's kind of how I
 

6691
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,229
entertainment so that's kind of how I
see it so I think it's very imperative

6692
01:48:09,229 --> 01:48:09,239
see it so I think it's very imperative
 

6693
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:10,189
see it so I think it's very imperative
that you're constantly always

6694
01:48:10,189 --> 01:48:10,199
that you're constantly always
 

6695
01:48:10,199 --> 01:48:11,750
that you're constantly always
experimenting and trying things even if

6696
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:11,760
experimenting and trying things even if
 

6697
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,390
experimenting and trying things even if
you're getting crazy unheard of growth

6698
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,400
you're getting crazy unheard of growth
 

6699
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,390
you're getting crazy unheard of growth
and so that outside of the thing

6700

them and we we spent probably over two
 

6787
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:43,790
them and we we spent probably over two
and a half years before we even launched

6788
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:43,800
and a half years before we even launched
 

6789

it's
 

6799
01:49:52,739 --> 01:49:54,950
it's
it's very interesting uh this is

6800
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:54,960
it's very interesting uh this is
 

6801
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:55,729
it's very interesting uh this is
something I've never talked about

01:50:06,649 --> 01:50:06,659
brand you'd have to buy it online and
 

6813
01:50:06,659 --> 01:50:09,350

you know because our first product

6816
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:10,980
you know because our first product
 

6817
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,649
you know because our first product
chocolate bars we started putting that

6818
01:50:12,649 --> 01:50:12,659
chocolate bars we started putting that
 

6819
01:50:12,659 --> 01:50:14,870
chocolate bars we started putting that
in retail locations so like for example

6820
01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:14,880
in retail locations so like for example

Walmart it's it's crazy like it's just
 

6823
01:50:18,179 --> 01:50:20,570
Walmart it's it's crazy like it's just
it doesn't make sense how if you're

6824
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:20,580
it doesn't make sense how if you're
 

6825
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:23,090
it doesn't make sense how if you're
which I guess it does for because we get

6826
01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:23,100
which I guess it does for because we get
 

6827
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:24,229
which I guess it does for because we get
100 million views of videos so a lot of

6828
01:50:24,229 --> 01:50:24,239
100 million views of videos so a lot of
 

6829
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:25,729
100 million views of videos so a lot of
people know us if I go stand in Walmart

6830
01:50:25,729 --> 01:50:25,739
people know us if I go stand in Walmart
 

6831
01:50:25,739 --> 01:50:27,709
people know us if I go stand in Walmart
those people recognize me and ask for

6832
01:50:27,709 --> 01:50:27,719
those people recognize me and ask for
 

6833
01:50:27,719 --> 01:50:29,270
those people recognize me and ask for
photos like if I still don't enough I

6834
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:29,280
photos like if I still don't enough I
 

6835
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,070
photos like if I still don't enough I
could take 150 photos today in Walmart

6836
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:31,080
could take 150 photos today in Walmart
 

6837
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,530
could take 150 photos today in Walmart
200 whatever it is so obviously it makes

6838
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:33,540
200 whatever it is so obviously it makes
 

6839
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,270
200 whatever it is so obviously it makes
sense those people go find feastfuls but

6840
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:35,280
sense those people go find feastfuls but
 

6841
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:37,129
sense those people go find feastfuls but
then you just multiply that by every

6842
01:50:37,129 --> 01:50:37,139
then you just multiply that by every
 

6843
01:50:37,139 --> 01:50:38,870
then you just multiply that by every
Walmart in America and it just gets so

01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,090
Walmart in America and it just gets so
crazy and I didn't think we'd be doing

and Walmart stock to be honest like it
would have to supply it was supply chain

6874
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:08,880
would have to supply it was supply chain
 

6875
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,370
would have to supply it was supply chain
it was brutal well even then sometimes

6876
01:51:10,370 --> 01:51:10,380
it was brutal well even then sometimes
 

6877
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:12,590
it was brutal well even then sometimes
like you know you get them the stuff and

6878
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:12,600
like you know you get them the stuff and
 

6879

location and I I had to stop promoting
 

6885
01:51:19,619 --> 01:51:21,109
location and I I had to stop promoting
it because every time I'd mention it

6886
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:21,119
it because every time I'd mention it
 

6887
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,390
it because every time I'd mention it
like 40 of people would just be like

can't buy it and so there's like a

6892
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:28,260
can't buy it and so there's like a
 

6893
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:31,070
can't buy it and so there's like a
three ish month period where I just

three ish month period where I just
didn't promote festivals because I was

6896
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:33,300
didn't promote festivals because I was
 

6897
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,149
didn't promote festivals because I was
scared that someone would go by and this

6898
01:51:35,149 --> 01:51:35,159

7314
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:27,900
that going and then we build these
 

7315
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,870
that going and then we build these
businesses it's like it's honestly

pretty scary to see what will happen you

7318
01:58:32,330 --> 01:58:32,340
pretty scary to see what will happen you
 

7319
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:33,770
pretty scary to see what will happen you
know uh over the years because

7320
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:33,780
know uh over the years because
 

7321
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:36,229
know uh over the years because
feastables launched you know last year

7322
01:58:36,229 --> 01:58:36,239
feastables launched you know last year
 

7323
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:38,390
feastables launched you know last year
2022 so it's a relatively new thing and

7324
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:38,400
2022 so it's a relatively new thing and
 

7325
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,830
2022 so it's a relatively new thing and
Beast Burger we just started scaling up

7326
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:39,840
Beast Burger we just started scaling up
 

7327
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:40,669
Beast Burger we just started scaling up
the physical side and we haven't

7328
01:58:40,669 --> 01:58:40,679
the physical side and we haven't
 

7329
01:58:40,679 --> 01:58:42,109
the physical side and we haven't
obviously even launched any mobile games

7330
01:58:42,109 --> 01:58:42,119
obviously even launched any mobile games
 

7331
01:58:42,119 --> 01:58:44,209
obviously even launched any mobile games
yet so I think I'm at the antithesis of

7332
01:58:44,209 --> 01:58:44,219
yet so I think I'm at the antithesis of
 

7333
01:58:44,219 --> 01:58:46,250
yet so I think I'm at the antithesis of
it I don't see a world where my YouTube

7334
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:46,260
it I don't see a world where my YouTube
 

7335
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:47,570

7725
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,430
[\h__\h] motivational video to go work I
just do it it's programmed in me at this

7726
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:07,440
just do it it's programmed in me at this
 

7727
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,990
just do it it's programmed in me at this
point and I couldn't imagine a world

7728
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:09,000
point and I couldn't imagine a world
 

7729
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,250
point and I couldn't imagine a world
where I don't wake up and do it every

7730
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:10,260
where I don't wake up and do it every

day
 

7733
02:05:11,219 --> 02:05:14,629
day
um but I think that a little bit of it

7734
02:05:14,629 --> 02:05:14,639
um but I think that a little bit of it
 

7735
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:16,129
um but I think that a little bit of it
is genetics

7736
02:05:16,129 --> 02:05:16,139
is genetics
 

7737
02:05:16,139 --> 02:05:18,410
is genetics
um and just how you're hardwired uh not

7738
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:18,420
um and just how you're hardwired uh not
 

7739
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:20,089
um and just how you're hardwired uh not
that it can't be trained or taught and

7740
02:05:20,089 --> 02:05:20,099
that it can't be trained or taught and
 

7741
02:05:20,099 --> 02:05:21,410
that it can't be trained or taught and
not that you know and obviously the

7742
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:21,420
not that you know and obviously the
 

7743
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:22,970
not that you know and obviously the
friend group you're in influences these

7744
02:05:22,970 --> 02:05:22,980
friend group you're in influences these
 

7745
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:24,290
friend group you're in influences these
things and over time I think can change

7746
02:05:24,290 --> 02:05:24,300
things and over time I think can change
 

7747
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:26,689
things and over time I think can change
it but someone's just not gonna be able

7748
02:05:26,689 --> 02:05:26,699
it but someone's just not gonna be able
 

7749
02:05:26,699 --> 02:05:28,490
it but someone's just not gonna be able
to flip a switch and then just start

7750
02:05:28,490 --> 02:05:28,500
to flip a switch and then just start
 

7751
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:30,109
to flip a switch and then just start
doing a kamikaze approach to building a

7752
02:05:30,109 --> 02:05:30,119
doing a kamikaze approach to building a
 

7753
02:05:30,119 --> 02:05:31,850
doing a kamikaze approach to building a
business just like a lot of people try

7754
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:31,860
business just like a lot of people try
 

7755
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,290
business just like a lot of people try
to flip a switch and start bodybuilding

7756
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:33,300
to flip a switch and start bodybuilding
 

7757
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:35,149
to flip a switch and start bodybuilding
and quit majority of the time you know

7758
02:05:35,149 --> 02:05:35,159
and quit majority of the time you know
 

7759
02:05:35,159 --> 02:05:37,790
and quit majority of the time you know
that's just not innate to them but I

7760
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:37,800
that's just not innate to them but I
 

7761
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,169
that's just not innate to them but I
think a lot of us have the capacity to

7762
02:05:39,169 --> 02:05:39,179
think a lot of us have the capacity to
 

7763
02:05:39,179 --> 02:05:41,330
think a lot of us have the capacity to
do that in some domain yeah I think if

7764
02:05:41,330 --> 02:05:41,340
do that in some domain yeah I think if
 

7765
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:42,530
do that in some domain yeah I think if
you went about strategically if you

7766
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:42,540
you went about strategically if you
 

7767
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:44,030
you went about strategically if you
surrounded yourself with fellow

7768
02:05:44,030 --> 02:05:44,040
surrounded yourself with fellow
 

7769
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:46,430
surrounded yourself with fellow
like-minded people and you know slowly

7770
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:46,440
like-minded people and you know slowly
 

7771
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,649
like-minded people and you know slowly
over time switched it uh but if you just

7772
02:05:48,649 --> 02:05:48,659
over time switched it uh but if you just
 

7773
02:05:48,659 --> 02:05:50,149
over time switched it uh but if you just
try to like hardcore do it you're just

7774
02:05:50,149 --> 02:05:50,159
try to like hardcore do it you're just
 

7775
02:05:50,159 --> 02:05:51,950
try to like hardcore do it you're just
going to lose your mind

7776
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:51,960
going to lose your mind
 

7777
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,990
going to lose your mind
