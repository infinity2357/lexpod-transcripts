first let me say that that i became a
 

2395
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,150
first let me say that that i became a
social engineer as a child

2396
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,160
social engineer as a child
 

2397
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,190
social engineer as a child
all right because the adults in my in my

2398
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,200
all right because the adults in my in my
 

2399
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,589
all right because the adults in my in my
environment as a child i had to know

2400
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
environment as a child i had to know
 

2401
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,750
environment as a child i had to know
exactly what they were thinking and be

2402
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
exactly what they were thinking and be
 

2403
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,910
exactly what they were thinking and be
able to try to manipulate that for

2404
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
able to try to manipulate that for
 

2405
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,750
able to try to manipulate that for
survival so i became a social engineer

2406
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,760
survival so i became a social engineer
 

2407
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,870
survival so i became a social engineer
as

2408
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:28,880
as
 

2409
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,589
as
for for survival initially all right and

2410
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:31,599
for for survival initially all right and
 

2411
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,870
for for survival initially all right and
one of the things that i've seen with a

2412
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:32,880
one of the things that i've seen with a
 

2413
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,870
one of the things that i've seen with a
lot of cyber criminals is the exact same

2414
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:34,880
lot of cyber criminals is the exact same
 

2415
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,510
lot of cyber criminals is the exact same
thing they're really expert ones they

2416
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
thing they're really expert ones they
 

2417
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,270
thing they're really expert ones they
become a social engineer as a child then

2418
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
become a social engineer as a child then
 

2419
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,510
become a social engineer as a child then
later on they use those tools to

2420
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
later on they use those tools to
 

2421
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,349
later on they use those tools to
victimize others all right which is

2422
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,359
victimize others all right which is
 

2423
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,589
victimize others all right which is
fascinating because you're in order to

2424
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
fascinating because you're in order to
 

2425
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,950
fascinating because you're in order to
understand what others are thinking you

2426
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:46,960
understand what others are thinking you
 

2427
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,270
understand what others are thinking you
have to be extremely good at empathy so

2428
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
have to be extremely good at empathy so
 

2429
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,710
have to be extremely good at empathy so
you have to like

2430
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
you have to like
 

2431
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,230
you have to like
really put yourself in the shoes of the

2432
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
really put yourself in the shoes of the
 

2433
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,349
really put yourself in the shoes of the
other person

2434
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:53,359
other person
 

2435
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,710
other person
and yet

2436
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
and yet
 

2437
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,270
and yet
in order to do cybercrime you have to

2438
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:57,280
in order to do cybercrime you have to
 

2439
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,109
in order to do cybercrime you have to
not care

2440
00:41:59,109 --> 00:41:59,119
not care
 

2441
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,870
not care
about the pain

2442
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:00,880
about the pain
 

2443
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,550
about the pain
that might cause them once you

2444
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,560
that might cause them once you
 

2445
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,470
that might cause them once you
manipulate them so you have to empathize

2446
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
manipulate them so you have to empathize
 

2447
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,030
manipulate them so you have to empathize
and yet not care

2448
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,040
and yet not care
 

2449
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,190
and yet not care
exactly and i would argue i would argue

2450
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
exactly and i would argue i would argue
 

2451
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,910
exactly and i would argue i would argue
that that is not a sociopath because a

2452
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
that that is not a sociopath because a
 

2453
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,589
that that is not a sociopath because a
cyber criminal and i was no different

2454
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
cyber criminal and i was no different
 

2455
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,670
cyber criminal and i was no different
most cyber criminals justify those

2456
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
most cyber criminals justify those
 

2457
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,829
most cyber criminals justify those
actions so the justification becomes

2458
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
actions so the justification becomes
 

2459
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,109
actions so the justification becomes
what's important with me the

2460
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
what's important with me the
 

2461
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,550
what's important with me the
justification was why i did it for my

2462
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:20,560
justification was why i did it for my
 

2463
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,870
justification was why i did it for my
family did it for my wife did it from a

2464
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:22,880
family did it for my wife did it from a
 

2465
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,630
family did it for my wife did it from a
stripper girlfriend yeah so and i

2466
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:24,640
stripper girlfriend yeah so and i
 

2467
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,510
stripper girlfriend yeah so and i
believed those justices

2468
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,520
believed those justices
 

2469
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,589
believed those justices
because i care about love a lot yeah so

2470
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
because i care about love a lot yeah so
 

2471
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,589
because i care about love a lot yeah so
the the the big

2472
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:31,599
the the the big
 

2473
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,670
the the the big
the big picture of that

2474
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:33,680
the big picture of that
 

2475
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,510
the big picture of that
is trust

2476
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
is trust
 

2477
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,309
is trust
how do you establish trust

2478
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319
how do you establish trust
 

2479
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,470
how do you establish trust
with a potential victim

2480
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:40,480
with a potential victim
 

2481
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,870

all right now i would argue online that

all right now i would argue online that
 

2483
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,470
all right now i would argue online that
that trust is established through a

that trust is established through a

that trust is established through a

conspiracy theories now about

conspiracy theories now about
 

2543

like everything around us it's like i've
 

2547
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,630
like everything around us it's like i've
been listening to uh people who believe

00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:46,640
been listening to uh people who believe

the earth is flat
 

2551
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,030
the earth is flat
and you know that that conspiracy theory

2552
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,040
and you know that that conspiracy theory
 

2553
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,870
and you know that that conspiracy theory
is fascinating to me because it

2554
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:52,880
is fascinating to me because it
 

2555
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,829
is fascinating to me because it
basically says that you can't trust

2556
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:55,839
basically says that you can't trust
 

2557
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,670
basically says that you can't trust
anybody right

2558
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
anybody right
 

2559
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,470
anybody right
like everything you hear is a lie so

2560
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
like everything you hear is a lie so
 

2561
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,470
like everything you hear is a lie so
that's one you know you can live that

2562
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
that's one you know you can live that
 

2563
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,630
that's one you know you can live that
life or you can live a life where you're

2564
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:04,640
life or you can live a life where you're
 

2565
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,950
life or you can live a life where you're
just naively trusting everything and we

2566
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:06,960
just naively trusting everything and we
 

2567
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,349
just naively trusting everything and we
as humans have to because that life is

2568
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
as humans have to because that life is
 

2569
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,990
as humans have to because that life is
kind of full of happiness if nobody

2570
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,000
kind of full of happiness if nobody
 

2571
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,990
kind of full of happiness if nobody
screws you over right because you you

2572
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
screws you over right because you you
 

2573
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,150
screws you over right because you you
know you meet people with the joyful

2574
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160
know you meet people with the joyful
 

2575
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,910

00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:17,920
heart and you get excited and all that
 

2577
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,309
heart and you get excited and all that
kind of stuff but if you do that too

2578
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:20,319
kind of stuff but if you do that too
 

2579
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,069
kind of stuff but if you do that too
much you're gonna get burned so you have

2580
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:22,079
much you're gonna get burned so you have
 

2581
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,150
much you're gonna get burned so you have
to find some kind of balance in terms of

2582
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,160
to find some kind of balance in terms of
 

2583
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,910
to find some kind of balance in terms of
optimizing happiness

2584
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
optimizing happiness
 

2585
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,710
optimizing happiness

so and a lot of the times that social

2616
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,119
so and a lot of the times that social
 

2617
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,990
so and a lot of the times that social
engineering is just feeding into

2618
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:58,000
engineering is just feeding into
 

2619
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,550
engineering is just feeding into
what the victim wants to believe yeah

2620
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:00,560
what the victim wants to believe yeah
 

2621
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,470
what the victim wants to believe yeah
all right it's it's not really coming up

2622
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
all right it's it's not really coming up
 

2623
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,069
all right it's it's not really coming up
with a brand new story at all it's just

2624
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:04,079
with a brand new story at all it's just
 

2625
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,510
with a brand new story at all it's just
knowing what that victim is what the

2626
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
knowing what that victim is what the
 

2627
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,430
knowing what that victim is what the
motivations of that victim is

2628
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:07,440
motivations of that victim is
 

2629
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,109
motivations of that victim is
feeding into it at that point so you

2630
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:09,119
feeding into it at that point so you
 

2631
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,030
feeding into it at that point so you
have to again that social engineer has

2632
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,040
have to again that social engineer has
 

2633
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,910
have to again that social engineer has
to

they're finding them on platforms like
 

2873
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,589
they're finding them on platforms like
linkedin and youtube and so on and they

2874
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
linkedin and youtube and so on and they
 

2875
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,069
linkedin and youtube and so on and they
are figuring out ways to get to those

2876
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:22,079
are figuring out ways to get to those
 

2877
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,030
are figuring out ways to get to those
people by another channel right which i

2878
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
people by another channel right which i
 

2879
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,870
people by another channel right which i
suppose is

2880
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:26,880
suppose is
 

2881
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,430
suppose is
it seems more authentic to those people

2882
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,440
it seems more authentic to those people
 

2883
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,990
it seems more authentic to those people
so they send them an email from

2884
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,000
so they send them an email from
 

2885
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,549
so they send them an email from
what looks like me

2886
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
what looks like me
 

2887
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,190
what looks like me
and with this kind like like loving me

2888
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,200
and with this kind like like loving me
 

2889
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,270
and with this kind like like loving me
it's the the interesting thing the

2890
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,280
it's the the interesting thing the
 

2891
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,870
it's the the interesting thing the
emails sound like something i would

2892
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:40,880
emails sound like something i would
 

2893
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,750
emails sound like something i would
write

2894
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
write
 

2895
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,589
write
so these aren't even at this stage it's

2896
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
so these aren't even at this stage it's
 

2897
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,309
so these aren't even at this stage it's
not even it doesn't feel automated or if

2898
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:46,319
not even it doesn't feel automated or if
 

2899
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,030
not even it doesn't feel automated or if
it's automated it's uh there's a human

2900
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
it's automated it's uh there's a human
 

2901
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,510
it's automated it's uh there's a human
in the loop that's really fine-tuning it

2902
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,520
in the loop that's really fine-tuning it
 

2903
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,109
in the loop that's really fine-tuning it
to specific or maybe i'm very

2904
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,119
to specific or maybe i'm very
 

2905
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,030
to specific or maybe i'm very
predictable but it's very loving in the

2906
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,040
predictable but it's very loving in the
 

2907
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,430
predictable but it's very loving in the
way i would write a message

2908
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,440
way i would write a message
 

2909
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,270
way i would write a message
and so so so think about that all right

2910
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,280
and so so so think about that all right
 

2911
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,910
and so so so think about that all right
so so when phishing first comes out

2912
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
so so when phishing first comes out
 

2913
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,510
so so when phishing first comes out
you could look at the language of the

2914
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,520
you could look at the language of the
 

2915
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,670
you could look at the language of the
text or the website and say yeah if you

2916
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:05,680
text or the website and say yeah if you
 

2917
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,190
text or the website and say yeah if you
if you were paying attention that that's

2918
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:07,200
if you were paying attention that that's
 

2919
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,270
if you were paying attention that that's
so okay so that's not an english speaker

2920
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,280
so okay so that's not an english speaker
 

2921
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,349
so okay so that's not an english speaker
who wrote that typically all right

2922
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:11,359
who wrote that typically all right
 

2923
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,750
who wrote that typically all right
but as as time has went on as as the

2924
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:13,760
but as as time has went on as as the
 

2925
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,349
but as as time has went on as as the
awareness of what a phishing attack

2926
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:15,359
awareness of what a phishing attack
 

2927
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,630
awareness of what a phishing attack
looks like

2928
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
looks like
 

2929
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,390
looks like
we have people that are sitting down now

2930
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:18,400
we have people that are sitting down now
 

2931
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,790
we have people that are sitting down now
and making sure that language is proper

2932
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:20,800
and making sure that language is proper
 

2933
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,069
and making sure that language is proper
it gets worse than that though if you

2934
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:22,079
it gets worse than that though if you
 

2935
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,910
it gets worse than that though if you
look at business email compromise all

2936
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:23,920
look at business email compromise all
 

2937
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,510
look at business email compromise all
right so the way a business email

2938
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:25,520
right so the way a business email
 

2939
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,190
right so the way a business email
compromise typically works is the

2940
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,200
compromise typically works is the
 

2941
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,630
compromise typically works is the
attacker

2942
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
attacker
 

2943
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,430
attacker
will find a payroll person find a ceo

2944
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:31,440
will find a payroll person find a ceo
 

2945
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,589
will find a payroll person find a ceo
he will he will fashion a spear phishing

2946
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
he will he will fashion a spear phishing
 

2947
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,670
he will he will fashion a spear phishing
email which is that's a phishing attack

2948
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:35,680
email which is that's a phishing attack
 

2949
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,829
email which is that's a phishing attack
that's targeting one specific individual

2950
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:37,839
that's targeting one specific individual
 

2951
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:38,870
that's targeting one specific individual
all right

2952
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
all right
 

2953
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,630
all right
so he'll fashion a spearfishing email

2954
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:40,640
so he'll fashion a spearfishing email
 

2955
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,190
so he'll fashion a spearfishing email
the way he does that is he pulls all the

2956
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,200
the way he does that is he pulls all the
 

2957
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,430
the way he does that is he pulls all the
information he possibly can

2958
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:45,440
information he possibly can
 

2959
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,270
information he possibly can
on that person all right that ceo

00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:49,280
on that person all right that ceo
 

2961
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,230
on that person all right that ceo
maybe

2962
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
maybe
 

2963
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,549
maybe
he'll

2964
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:52,559
he'll
 

2965
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,270
he'll
spear that ceo just to get their login

so then he decides well i'm going to go

2990
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:16,800
so then he decides well i'm going to go
 

2991
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,309
so then he decides well i'm going to go
ahead and spearfish this the payroll

2992
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
ahead and spearfish this the payroll

department is good
 

2995
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,510
department is good
so then he spearfishes them gets those

2996
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:21,520
so then he spearfishes them gets those
 

2997
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,470
so then he spearfishes them gets those
credentials

they've set up a new account send all
payments over here now and that is

business email compromise in a nutshell
all right works great

3038
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:04,400
all right works great
 

3039
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,630
all right works great
probably the larger the organization the

3040
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640
probably the larger the organization the
 

3041
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,349
probably the larger the organization the
more uh susceptible to that kind of

3042
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
more uh susceptible to that kind of
 

3043
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,470
more uh susceptible to that kind of
attack because there's a um

3044

to this
so that that's business email compromise

3058
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839
so that that's business email compromise
 

3059
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,430
so that that's business email compromise
and it's it those crimes and it's one

you know exception to that
 

3193
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,910
you know exception to that
no monetary loss there's not really

3194
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:53,920
no monetary loss there's not really
 

3195
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,589
no monetary loss there's not really
standard like fines probably that's not

3196
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
standard like fines probably that's not
 

3197
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,150
standard like fines probably that's not
going to happen right right right so

3198
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:58,160
going to happen right right right so
 

3199
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,750
going to happen right right right so
i mean that that's kind of interesting

3200
00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
i mean that that's kind of interesting
 

3201
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,589
i mean that that's kind of interesting
because it's

3202
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:01,599
because it's
 

3203
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,549
because it's
so when i got the ransomware um when i

3204
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:04,559
so when i got the ransomware um when i
 

3205
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,549
so when i got the ransomware um when i
got uh with the zero day attack on the

3206
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:06,559
got uh with the zero day attack on the
 

3207
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,470
got uh with the zero day attack on the
qnap mass

qnap mass
 

3209
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,829
qnap mass
you know

3210
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839

is
 

3215
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,589
is
qnap the company

3216
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
qnap the company
 

3217
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,270
qnap the company
for having so many security

3218
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:19,280
for having so many security
 

3219
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,630
for having so many security
vulnerabilities

3220
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
vulnerabilities
 

3221
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,510
vulnerabilities
they're

3222
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:21,520
they're
 

3223
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,190
they're
uh like you are the victim of qnap's

3224
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
uh like you are the victim of qnap's
 

3225
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,190
uh like you are the victim of qnap's
incompetence that's the way they kind of

3226
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:27,200
incompetence that's the way they kind of
 

3227
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,710
incompetence that's the way they kind of
phrase it and see i don't agree with

so
 

3235
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,180
so
solarwinds

3236
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:35,190
solarwinds
 

3237
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:37,829
solarwinds

3239
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,309
[Laughter]
let's so i've got a 130 page class

3240
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:40,319
let's so i've got a 130 page class
 

3241
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,990
let's so i've got a 130 page class
action lawsuit printed out at the house

3242
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
action lawsuit printed out at the house
 

3243
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,630
action lawsuit printed out at the house
i've been going through it that catalogs

3244
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
i've been going through it that catalogs
 

3245
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,270
i've been going through it that catalogs
how solarwinds lied for years about

3246
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,280
how solarwinds lied for years about
 

3247
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,789
how solarwinds lied for years about
their vulnerabilities and they lied to

3248
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:48,799
their vulnerabilities and they lied to
 

3249
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,190
their vulnerabilities and they lied to
investors the the people who came in the

investors the the people who came in the
 

3251

would you know they would uh
 

3255
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,349
would you know they would uh
not pay attention to them when they said

not pay attention to them when they said
you know you've got these issues they

3258
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
you know you've got these issues they
 

3259
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,230
you know you've got these issues they
would say go away

3260
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:00,240
would say go away
 

3261
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,829
would say go away
[\h__\h] like that for years until

3262
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:01,839
[\h__\h] like that for years until
 

3263
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,069
[\h__\h] like that for years until
solarwinds you know the attacks become

3264
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,079
solarwinds you know the attacks become
 

3265
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,190
solarwinds you know the attacks become
apparent um

3266
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
apparent um
 

3267
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,870
apparent um
my view on that is that the only person

3268
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:10,880
my view on that is that the only person
 

3269
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,109
my view on that is that the only person
responsible for the crime

3270
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
responsible for the crime
 

3271
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,270
responsible for the crime
are the criminals who did the attacking

3272
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,280
are the criminals who did the attacking
 

3273
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,829
are the criminals who did the attacking
the actual criminals not not solarwinds

3274
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:17,839
the actual criminals not not solarwinds
 

3275
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,910
the actual criminals not not solarwinds
now does that mean the solarwinds isn't

3276
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
now does that mean the solarwinds isn't
 

3277
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,470
now does that mean the solarwinds isn't
isn't all [\h__\h] up they are and there

3278
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,480
isn't all [\h__\h] up they are and there
 

3279
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,589
isn't all [\h__\h] up they are and there
needs to be some accounting in place

3280
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:25,599
needs to be some accounting in place
 

3281
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,309
needs to be some accounting in place
but the the the only individual the only

3282
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:28,319
but the the the only individual the only
 

3283
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,549
but the the the only individual the only
people responsible for crime

3284
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
people responsible for crime
 

3285
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,549
people responsible for crime
are the criminals and that's either

3286
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
are the criminals and that's either
 

3287
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,870
are the criminals and that's either
online in the physical world what have

00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
online in the physical world what have
 

3289
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,390
online in the physical world what have
you could be it's

3290
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,400
you could be it's
 

3291
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,150
you could be it's
being an idiot

3292
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:38,160
being an idiot
 

3293
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,789
being an idiot
is not a crime

3294
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:40,799
is not a crime

being
being criminally negligent is yeah and i

3300
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:45,280
being criminally negligent is yeah and i
 

3301
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,190
being criminally negligent is yeah and i
think that that solarwinds is certainly

3302
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:47,200
think that that solarwinds is certainly
 

3303
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,549
think that that solarwinds is certainly
responsible

3304
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:48,559
responsible
 

3305
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,349
responsible
not not responsible they're culpable

3306
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
not not responsible they're culpable
 

3307
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,829
not not responsible they're culpable
for what happened can you actually uh

3308
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:53,839
for what happened can you actually uh
 

3309
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,470
for what happened can you actually uh
tell folks about solarwinds what is it

3310
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
tell folks about solarwinds what is it
 

3311
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,349
tell folks about solarwinds what is it
um

3312
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
um
 

3313
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,870
um
what what what was what are some

3314
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,880
what what what was what are some
 

3315
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,470
what what what was what are some
interesting things that you're aware of

3316
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,480
interesting things that you're aware of
 

3317
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,470
interesting things that you're aware of
solarwinds was very it was

3318
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,480
solarwinds was very it was
 

3319
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,030
solarwinds was very it was
it provided a background a backbone of

3320
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
it provided a background a backbone of
 

3321
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,990
it provided a background a backbone of
security for

3322
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,000
security for
 

3323
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,230
security for
hundreds thousands of different

3324
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
hundreds thousands of different
 

3325
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,589
hundreds thousands of different
companies um if you looked at a lot of

3326
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
companies um if you looked at a lot of
 

3327
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,109
companies um if you looked at a lot of
security companies were using solar

3328
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
security companies were using solar
 

3329
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,309
security companies were using solar
winds that would that would allow you to

3330
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:16,319
winds that would that would allow you to
 

3331
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,870
winds that would that would allow you to
get a snapshot of the entire system

3332
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:18,880
get a snapshot of the entire system
 

3333
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,710
get a snapshot of the entire system
that they were working on so what

3334
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:20,720
that they were working on so what
 

3335
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,030
that they were working on so what
happens is you get a russian group that

3336
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
happens is you get a russian group that
 

3337
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,309
happens is you get a russian group that
comes in

3338
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:24,319
comes in
 

3339
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,950
comes in
and they

3340
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:26,960
and they
 

3341
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,589
and they
basically they hack into solarwinds and

3342
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:29,599
basically they hack into solarwinds and
 

3343
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,789
basically they hack into solarwinds and
get access to it and it allows them to

3344
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,799
get access to it and it allows them to
 

3345
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,270
get access to it and it allows them to
view every single thing

3346
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
view every single thing
 

3347
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,190
view every single thing
i mean every single thing

3348
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:37,200
i mean every single thing
 

3349
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,430
i mean every single thing
about every single client

3350
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:39,440
about every single client
 

3351
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,470
about every single client
that

3352
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
that
 

3353
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,670
that
solarwinds had at that point so entire

3354
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:43,680
solarwinds had at that point so entire
 

3355
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,990
solarwinds had at that point so entire
snapshots of all the iep that weren't

3356
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,000
snapshots of all the iep that weren't
 

3357
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,670
snapshots of all the iep that weren't
that was going on all the emails all the

3358
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
that was going on all the emails all the
 

3359
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,990
that was going on all the emails all the
communications every single secret that

3360
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,000
communications every single secret that
 

3361
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,829
communications every single secret that
was going on with those companies if

3362
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:51,839
was going on with those companies if
 

3363
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,470
was going on with those companies if
company had software like microsoft it

3364
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
company had software like microsoft it
 

3365
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,390
company had software like microsoft it
allowed them to look at the source code

3366
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:56,400
allowed them to look at the source code
 

3367
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,150
allowed them to look at the source code
of everything that was going on i mean

3368
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
of everything that was going on i mean
 

3369
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,270
of everything that was going on i mean
it's just a complete and total nightmare

3370
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
it's just a complete and total nightmare
 

3371
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,990
it's just a complete and total nightmare
all right and something that you are not

3372
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:04,000
all right and something that you are not
 

3373
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,630
all right and something that you are not
going to recover from

3374
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:06,640
going to recover from
 

3375
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,190
going to recover from
you're not i mean it's done at that

3376
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,200
you're not i mean it's done at that
 

3377
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,630
you're not i mean it's done at that
point um

3378
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:10,640
point um
 

3379
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,990
point um
you know there's not been a lot of news

3380
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,000
you know there's not been a lot of news
 

3381
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,150
you know there's not been a lot of news
lately about it but the fact of the

3382
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
lately about it but the fact of the
 

3383
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,910
lately about it but the fact of the
matter is is that's the type of attack

3384
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
matter is is that's the type of attack
 

3385
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,470
matter is is that's the type of attack
that's a catastrophic attack so there's

3386
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
that's a catastrophic attack so there's
 

3387
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,789
that's a catastrophic attack so there's
a huge amount of information

3388
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:20,799
a huge amount of information
 

3389
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,510
a huge amount of information
that was read saved elsewhere probably

3390
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:23,520
that was read saved elsewhere probably
 

3391
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,910
that was read saved elsewhere probably
oh yeah and so now there's people

3392
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:25,920
oh yeah and so now there's people
 

3393
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,069
oh yeah and so now there's people
sitting on information absolutely so

3394
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
sitting on information absolutely so
 

3395
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,589
sitting on information absolutely so
think about one of the attack vectors

3396
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:29,599
think about one of the attack vectors
 

3397
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:30,630
think about one of the attack vectors
has been

3398
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:30,640
has been
 

3399
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,670
has been
microsoft outlook 365 things like that

3400
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
microsoft outlook 365 things like that
 

3401
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,270
microsoft outlook 365 things like that
this allowed the attackers to look at

3402
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:35,280
this allowed the attackers to look at
 

3403
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,270
this allowed the attackers to look at
the source codes of that

3404
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
the source codes of that
 

3405
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,430
the source codes of that
so they have the source code now so they

3406
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,440
so they have the source code now so they
 

3407
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,349
so they have the source code now so they
go through it line by line

3408
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:41,359
go through it line by line
 

3409
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,789
go through it line by line
what are the vulnerabilities let's find

3410
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:42,799
what are the vulnerabilities let's find
 

3411
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,630
what are the vulnerabilities let's find
new vulnerabilities new zero days you

3412
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:44,640
new vulnerabilities new zero days you
 

3413
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,549
new vulnerabilities new zero days you
know i said zero days aren't common but

3414
00:58:46,549 --> 00:58:46,559
know i said zero days aren't common but
 

3415
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,549
know i said zero days aren't common but
this opens up an entire new threat

3416
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:48,559
this opens up an entire new threat
 

3417
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,630
this opens up an entire new threat
surface all of a sudden so it's a it's a

3418
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:50,640
surface all of a sudden so it's a it's a
 

3419
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,789
surface all of a sudden so it's a it's a
completely catastrophic attack once all

3420
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:52,799
completely catastrophic attack once all
 

3421
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,309
completely catastrophic attack once all
the chips are down everything's tallied

3422
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
the chips are down everything's tallied
 

3423
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,069
the chips are down everything's tallied
up people are going to be like yeah

3424
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
up people are going to be like yeah
 

3425
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,430
up people are going to be like yeah
we're done we're done

3426
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:01,440

 

3427
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,630

all right this whole computer thing

3428
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:02,640
all right this whole computer thing
 

3429
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,710
all right this whole computer thing
we're trying we're walking away wait

3430
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
we're trying we're walking away wait
 

3431
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,910
we're trying we're walking away wait
what's that

3432
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:05,920
what's that
 

3433
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,829
what's that
that's terrifying because so you're

3434
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:07,839
that's terrifying because so you're
 

3435
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,069
that's terrifying because so you're
saying that there's not been

3436
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:10,079
saying that there's not been
 

3437
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,630
saying that there's not been
obvious uh big

3438
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,640
obvious uh big
 

3439
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,950
obvious uh big
negative impact from that yet so but

3440
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:14,960
negative impact from that yet so but
 

3441
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,390
negative impact from that yet so but
like there's been a lot of negative

3442
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,400
like there's been a lot of negative
 

3443
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,630
like there's been a lot of negative
impact but we're just starting right so

3444
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:18,640
impact but we're just starting right so
 

3445
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,630
impact but we're just starting right so
that's starting the capacity for

3446
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,640
that's starting the capacity for
 

3447
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,710
that's starting the capacity for
destruction is huge here how much

3448
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:22,720
destruction is huge here how much
 

3449
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,470
destruction is huge here how much
involve involvement from nation states

3450
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:24,480
involve involvement from nation states
 

3451
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,069
involve involvement from nation states
do you think there is

3452
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:26,079
do you think there is
 

3453
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,870
do you think there is
on this you know it's interesting um

3454
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:28,880
on this you know it's interesting um
 

3455
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,109
on this you know it's interesting um
so you've got iran you've got north

3456
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
so you've got iran you've got north
 

3457
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,190
so you've got iran you've got north
korea china russia you got the big four

00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:33,200
korea china russia you got the big four
 

3459
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,430
korea china russia you got the big four
you also got brazil

3460
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,440
you also got brazil
 

3461
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,549
you also got brazil
you've got all these other countries

3462
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:36,559
you've got all these other countries
 

3463
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,069
you've got all these other countries
that are interested in the united states

3464
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:38,079
that are interested in the united states
 

3465
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,549
that are interested in the united states
as well um

3466
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:40,559
as well um
 

3467
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,390
as well um
nation states are interesting depending

3468
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:42,400
nation states are interesting depending
 

3469
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,309
nation states are interesting depending
on who the nation state is

3470
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:44,319
on who the nation state is
 

3471
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,829
on who the nation state is
all right so russia is very good about

3472
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:45,839
all right so russia is very good about
 

3473
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,270
all right so russia is very good about
working with the type of criminal i used

3474
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:47,280
working with the type of criminal i used
 

3475
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,829
working with the type of criminal i used
to be you know they'll enlist these guys

3476
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:49,839
to be you know they'll enlist these guys
 

3477
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,750
to be you know they'll enlist these guys
and steal information and what have you

3478
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,760
and steal information and what have you
 

3479
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,950
and steal information and what have you
then russia will take the information

3480
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:52,960
then russia will take the information
 

3481
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,270
then russia will take the information
they want to and they'll basically go

3482
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:55,280
they want to and they'll basically go
 

3483
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,710
they want to and they'll basically go
off and sell whatever you want to make

3484
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:56,720
off and sell whatever you want to make
 

3485
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,230
off and sell whatever you want to make
some money

3486
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
some money
 

3487
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,470
some money
china's all about ip

3488
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:00,480
china's all about ip
 

3489
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,390
china's all about ip
uh north korea is about stealing money

3490
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
uh north korea is about stealing money
 

3491
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,670
uh north korea is about stealing money
because they really don't know what what

3492
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:03,680
because they really don't know what what
 

3493
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,750
because they really don't know what what
the hell else to do right now

3494
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:05,760
the hell else to do right now
 

3495
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,030
the hell else to do right now
but uh

3496
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,040
but uh
 

3497
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,789
but uh
so north korea is actively involved in

3498
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:08,799
so north korea is actively involved in
 

3499
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,789
so north korea is actively involved in
cybercrime absolutely they've stolen a

3500
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
cybercrime absolutely they've stolen a
 

3501
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,190
cybercrime absolutely they've stolen a
shitload of bitcoin and everything else

3502
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,200
shitload of bitcoin and everything else
 

3503
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,710
shitload of bitcoin and everything else
so absolutely they're actively involved

3504
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:14,720
so absolutely they're actively involved
 

3505
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,630
so absolutely they're actively involved
with that

3506
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
with that
 

3507
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,950
with that
very very skilled attackers very skilled

3508
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:18,960
very very skilled attackers very skilled
 

3509
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,390
very very skilled attackers very skilled
but even if you look at you know i told

3510
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
but even if you look at you know i told
 

3511
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,390
but even if you look at you know i told
you that stat about 90

3512
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:22,400
you that stat about 90
 

3513
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,430
you that stat about 90
all right

3514
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:23,440
all right
 

3515
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,829
all right
so even though solarwinds is going to

3516
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:26,839
so even though solarwinds is going to
 

3517
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:30,390
so even though solarwinds is going to
be the number one attack

3518
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,400
be the number one attack
 

3519
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,230
be the number one attack
the the follow-up to that is this not

3520
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:32,240
the the follow-up to that is this not
 

3521
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,789
the the follow-up to that is this not
pedia attack that happened and so that

3522
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:34,799
pedia attack that happened and so that
 

3523
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,470
pedia attack that happened and so that
was the most sophisticated attack

3524
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:36,480
was the most sophisticated attack
 

3525
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,950
was the most sophisticated attack
launched by the russian sand worm group

3526
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
launched by the russian sand worm group
 

3527
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,670
launched by the russian sand worm group
using all known exploits throughout so

3528
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:41,680
using all known exploits throughout so
 

3529
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,549
using all known exploits throughout so
it's not again it's not

3530
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:44,559
it's not again it's not
 

3531
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,150
it's not again it's not
your right in the sophistication is

3532
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,160
your right in the sophistication is
 

3533
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,470
your right in the sophistication is
typically not technical sophistication

3534
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,480
typically not technical sophistication
 

3535
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,750
typically not technical sophistication
but it's that social engineering

3536
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:49,760
but it's that social engineering
 

3537
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,510
but it's that social engineering
sophistication how do you get these

3538
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:51,520
sophistication how do you get these
 

3539
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,069
sophistication how do you get these
things put together in line to attack

3540
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
things put together in line to attack
 

3541
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:54,829
things put together in line to attack
and

3542
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:54,839
and
 

3543
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,349
and
succeed but when you get access to the

3544
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
succeed but when you get access to the
 

3545
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,789
succeed but when you get access to the
source code that's where technical

3546
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
source code that's where technical
 

3547
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,549
source code that's where technical
sophistication could really do a lot of

3548
01:01:00,549 --> 01:01:00,559
sophistication could really do a lot of
 

3549
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,309
sophistication could really do a lot of
damage and that's when you find out real

3550
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:02,319
damage and that's when you find out real
 

3551
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,270
damage and that's when you find out real
quick

3552
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:03,280
quick
 

3553
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,710
quick
that's what separates the men from the

3554
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:04,720
that's what separates the men from the
 

3555
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,630
that's what separates the men from the
boys in this game all right because all

3556
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:06,640
boys in this game all right because all
 

3557
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,230
boys in this game all right because all
of a sudden it's not i don't have to

3558
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:08,240
of a sudden it's not i don't have to
 

3559
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,710
of a sudden it's not i don't have to
worry about social engineering i've got

3560
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
worry about social engineering i've got
 

3561
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,309
worry about social engineering i've got
source codes and i've got professionals

3562
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
source codes and i've got professionals
 

3563
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,750
source codes and i've got professionals
that are looking at that

3564
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:13,760
that are looking at that
 

3565
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,069
that are looking at that
and that's your ass

3566
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
and that's your ass
 

3567
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,230
and that's your ass
which then enables probably even more

3568
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
which then enables probably even more
 

3569
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,710
which then enables probably even more
powerful social engineering methods too

3570
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:20,720
powerful social engineering methods too
 

3571
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,829
powerful social engineering methods too
i mean it's just cascade of

3572
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:22,839
i mean it's just cascade of
 

3573
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,030
i mean it's just cascade of
i um

3574
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:25,040
i um
 

3575
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,950
i um
is this terrifying to you by the way

3576
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:26,960
is this terrifying to you by the way
 

3577
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,109
is this terrifying to you by the way
this that this world that we're living

3578
01:01:29,109 --> 01:01:29,119
this that this world that we're living
 

3579
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,230
this that this world that we're living
in

3580
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:30,240
in
 

3581
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,789
in
as we put more and more of ourselves on

3582
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:32,799
as we put more and more of ourselves on
 

3583
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,470
as we put more and more of ourselves on
the

3584
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,480
the
 

3585
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,589
the
the internet into the metaverse

3586
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:37,599
the internet into the metaverse
 

3587
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,309
the internet into the metaverse
there is so many more attack vectors on

3588
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:40,319
there is so many more attack vectors on
 

3589
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,030
there is so many more attack vectors on
our well-being what's terrifying to me

3590
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,040
our well-being what's terrifying to me
 

3591
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,750
our well-being what's terrifying to me
uh i used to preach it on shadow crew

3592
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:45,760
uh i used to preach it on shadow crew
 

3593
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,910
uh i used to preach it on shadow crew
is the idea

3594
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
is the idea
 

3595
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,789
is the idea
that the perception of truth is more

3596
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
that the perception of truth is more
 

3597
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,950
that the perception of truth is more
important than the truth itself it

3598
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:52,960
important than the truth itself it
 

3599
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,390
important than the truth itself it
doesn't matter what the facts are it

3600
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:54,400
doesn't matter what the facts are it
 

3601
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,630
doesn't matter what the facts are it
matters what i can convince you of

3602
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
matters what i can convince you of
 

3603
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,190
matters what i can convince you of
yeah that's what's terrifying to me so

3604
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
yeah that's what's terrifying to me so
 

3605
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,430
yeah that's what's terrifying to me so
you look at deep fakes you look at fake

3606
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:01,440
you look at deep fakes you look at fake
 

3607
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,390
you look at deep fakes you look at fake
news

3608
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
news
 

3609
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,390
news
all the stuff that's going out

3610
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:04,400
all the stuff that's going out
 

3611
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,870
all the stuff that's going out
that becomes truly terrifying

3612
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:08,880

 

3613
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,510

um maybe there's an angle where it's

3614
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520
um maybe there's an angle where it's
 

3615
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,710
um maybe there's an angle where it's
freeing if nothing is true

3616
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:14,720
freeing if nothing is true
 

3617
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,069
freeing if nothing is true
and you can't trust anything

3618
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:18,079

 

3619
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,670

but you see we as human beings we want

3620
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:19,680
but you see we as human beings we want
 

3621
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,029
but you see we as human beings we want
to trust

3622
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:21,039
to trust
 

3623
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,430
to trust
we do we we need human interaction and

3624
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:23,440
we do we we need human interaction and
 

3625
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,829
we do we we need human interaction and
and for that human interaction you have

3626
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:25,839
and for that human interaction you have
 

3627
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,150
and for that human interaction you have
to have a degree of trust but it's more

3628
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,160
to have a degree of trust but it's more
 

3629
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,670
to have a degree of trust but it's more
like

3630
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
like
 

3631
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,230
like
you let go of an idea of absolute truth

3632
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
you let go of an idea of absolute truth
 

3633
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,470
you let go of an idea of absolute truth
and it more becomes like a blockchain

3634
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
and it more becomes like a blockchain
 

3635
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,910
and it more becomes like a blockchain
style consensus so you let go of like

3636
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
style consensus so you let go of like
 

3637
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,510
style consensus so you let go of like
you know what

3638
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:39,520
you know what
 

3639
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,309
you know what
uh there's this human dream you get this

3640
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:42,319
uh there's this human dream you get this
 

3641
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:43,750
uh there's this human dream you get this
on the internet

3642
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760
on the internet
 

3643
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,309
on the internet
you get like facts as if there's at the

3644
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:46,319
you get like facts as if there's at the
 

3645
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,430
you get like facts as if there's at the
bottom

3646
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
bottom
 

3647
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,270
bottom
at the bottom there's one turtle that's

3648
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
at the bottom there's one turtle that's
 

3649
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,589
at the bottom there's one turtle that's
holding this like scroll

3650
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:51,599
holding this like scroll
 

3651
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,670
holding this like scroll
that says these are the truths of the

3652
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:53,680
that says these are the truths of the
 

3653
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,029
that says these are the truths of the
world the the problem is i mean maybe

3654
01:02:57,029 --> 01:02:57,039
world the the problem is i mean maybe
 

3655
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,349
world the the problem is i mean maybe
believing that is counterproductive

3656
01:02:59,349 --> 01:02:59,359
believing that is counterproductive
 

3657
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,109
believing that is counterproductive
maybe human civilization is an ongoing

3658
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:03,119
maybe human civilization is an ongoing
 

3659
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,309
maybe human civilization is an ongoing
process of consensus and so it's always

3660
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319
process of consensus and so it's always
 

3661
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,870
process of consensus and so it's always
going to be everything is shrouded and

3662
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:08,880
going to be everything is shrouded and
 

3663
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,390
going to be everything is shrouded and
you can call them lies or you can call

3664
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:10,400
you can call them lies or you can call
 

3665
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,710
you can call them lies or you can call
them inaccuracies or you can call them

3666
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:12,720
them inaccuracies or you can call them
 

3667
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,069
them inaccuracies or you can call them
delusions

3668
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:14,079
delusions
 

3669
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,589
delusions
it's constantly going to be it's going

3670
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:15,599
it's constantly going to be it's going
 

3671
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,670
it's constantly going to be it's going
to be a sea of lies and

3672
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
to be a sea of lies and

4462
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:10,560
that led him to installing mod chips
 

4463
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,470
that led him to installing mod chips
into cable television boxes so you could

4464
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:12,480
into cable television boxes so you could
 

4465
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,110
into cable television boxes so you could
watch all the pay-per-view which in turn

4466
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:15,120
watch all the pay-per-view which in turn
 

4467
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,990
watch all the pay-per-view which in turn
led into programming satellite dss cards

4468
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,000
led into programming satellite dss cards
 

4469
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,870
led into programming satellite dss cards
those 18-inch rca satellite systems pull

4470
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
those 18-inch rca satellite systems pull
 

4471
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,030
those 18-inch rca satellite systems pull
the card out of it program it turns on

4472
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
the card out of it program it turns on
 

4473
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,470
the card out of it program it turns on
all the channels

4474
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:24,480
all the channels
 

4475
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,910
all the channels
started doing that

4476
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:25,920
started doing that
 

4477
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,229
started doing that
can we just pause

4478
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
can we just pause
 

4479
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,709
can we just pause
that is

4480
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:30,719
that is
 

4481
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,590
that is
very

4482
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:32,600
very
 

4483
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,550
very
entrepreneurial so

4484
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
entrepreneurial so
 

4485
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,149
entrepreneurial so
just technically

4486
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:38,159

 

4487
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:38,950

so

4488
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
so
 

4489
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,430
so
there's laws and rules that you're

4490
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
there's laws and rules that you're
 

4491
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,110
there's laws and rules that you're
breaking nonstop

4492
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,120
breaking nonstop
 

4493
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,070
breaking nonstop
so there's also legitimate

4494
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:46,080
so there's also legitimate
 

4495
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,990
so there's also legitimate
ways of doing that which is break the

4496
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
ways of doing that which is break the
 

4497
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,750
ways of doing that which is break the
rules of the conventions of the past

4498
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:49,760
rules of the conventions of the past
 

4499
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,430
rules of the conventions of the past
that's the first principles thing that's

4500
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440
that's the first principles thing that's
 

4501
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,149
that's the first principles thing that's
what elon musk and his ilk do all the

4502
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159
what elon musk and his ilk do all the
 

4503
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,350
what elon musk and his ilk do all the
time right

4504
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:55,360
time right
 

4505
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,110
time right
that is

4506
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
that is
 

4507
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,350
that is
guts and brilliance

4508
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,360
guts and brilliance
 

4509
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,590
guts and brilliance
but when it's crossing the lines of the

4510
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
but when it's crossing the lines of the
 

4511
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,950
but when it's crossing the lines of the
law

actually sometimes the law
 

4515
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,550
actually sometimes the law
is outdated the the thing is as a human

01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
is outdated the the thing is as a human
 

4517

that you're breaking is you're you're

4528
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:18,960
that you're breaking is you're you're
 

4529
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,510
that you're breaking is you're you're
adding to the suffering in the world in

4530
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
adding to the suffering in the world in
 

4531
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,870
adding to the suffering in the world in
one way way or another and you're

one way way or another and you're
 

4533
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,830
one way way or another and you're
justifying it but in terms of me sort of

4534
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:25,840
justifying it but in terms of me sort of
 

4535
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,669
justifying it but in terms of me sort of
as an engineer

4536
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:27,679
as an engineer
 

4537
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,310
as an engineer
that is some gutsy thinking that's how

4538
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:30,320
that is some gutsy thinking that's how
 

4539
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,830
that is some gutsy thinking that's how
waz and steve jobs thought sure it

4540
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
waz and steve jobs thought sure it
 

4541
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,270
waz and steve jobs thought sure it
that's that's innovation and maybe just

that's that's innovation and maybe just
 

4543

uh
 

4557
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,830
uh
like what this is a totally new thing to

4558
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:49,840
like what this is a totally new thing to
 

4559

you computers is a is a is yet another
 

4561
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,870
you computers is a is a is yet another
domain how are you figuring these

4562
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:54,880
domain how are you figuring these
 

4563
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,149
domain how are you figuring these
puzzles out presumably mostly alone

4564
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
puzzles out presumably mostly alone
 

4565
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,830
puzzles out presumably mostly alone
alone when you were thinking through

4566
01:17:59,830 --> 01:17:59,840
alone when you were thinking through
 

4567
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,270
alone when you were thinking through
these problems

4568
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:01,280
these problems
 

4569
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,950
these problems
is there

4570
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:02,960
is there
 

4571
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,870
is there
this is a strange question to ask but

4572
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:04,880
this is a strange question to ask but
 

4573
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,830
this is a strange question to ask but
you know

4574
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
you know
 

4575
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,030
you know
what

4576
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,040
what
 

4577
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,790
what
uh what is your thinking process what is

4578
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
uh what is your thinking process what is
 

4579
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,709
uh what is your thinking process what is
your approach to solving these problems

4580
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
your approach to solving these problems
 

4581
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,030
your approach to solving these problems
so so the approach is is is you do

4582
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
so so the approach is is is you do
 

4583
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,070
so so the approach is is is you do
something

4584
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
something
 

4585
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,590
something
and you [\h__\h] it up

4586
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
and you [\h__\h] it up
 

4587
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,430
and you [\h__\h] it up
and you're like you think back okay how

4588
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:17,440
and you're like you think back okay how
 

4589
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,750
and you're like you think back okay how
do i fix that

4590
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:19,760
do i fix that
 

4591
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,550
do i fix that
so you fix that aspect you commit the

4592
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:22,560
so you fix that aspect you commit the
 

4593
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,750
so you fix that aspect you commit the
crime again

4594
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:23,760
crime again
 

4595
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,990
crime again
and it goes a little bit further and it

4596
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
and it goes a little bit further and it
 

4597
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,470
and it goes a little bit further and it
screws up okay how do i fix that

4598
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:28,480
screws up okay how do i fix that
 

4599
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,990
screws up okay how do i fix that
what's the issue on that how do i fix

4600
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,000
what's the issue on that how do i fix
 

4601
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,590
what's the issue on that how do i fix
that so there's not a deep design

4602
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
that so there's not a deep design
 

4603
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,669
that so there's not a deep design
thinking like like later on it becomes

4604
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
thinking like like later on it becomes
 

4605
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,030
thinking like like later on it becomes
that once once you once you lay that

4606
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,040
that once once you once you lay that
 

4607
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,350
that once once you once you lay that
groundwork of the way these schemes are

4608
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:37,360
groundwork of the way these schemes are
 

4609
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,189
groundwork of the way these schemes are
working all right it becomes that and

4610
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:39,199
working all right it becomes that and
 

4611
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:42,229
working all right it becomes that and
you can apply that to other things in in

4612
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
you can apply that to other things in in
 

4613
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,709
you can apply that to other things in in
cyber crime as a whole all right but

4614
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
cyber crime as a whole all right but
 

4615
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,270
cyber crime as a whole all right but
initially it's basically trial and error

4616
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:47,280
initially it's basically trial and error
 

4617
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,790
initially it's basically trial and error
you know you've got a problem how do you

4618
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:48,800
you know you've got a problem how do you
 

4619
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,430
you know you've got a problem how do you
solve that problem all right so how do i

4620
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:51,440
solve that problem all right so how do i
 

4621
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,950
solve that problem all right so how do i
i'm committing these crimes under my

4622
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:52,960
i'm committing these crimes under my
 

4623
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,229
i'm committing these crimes under my

5569
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,709
data from hell i mean we were we were
doing a lot of fishing a lot we were

5570
01:34:58,709 --> 01:34:58,719
doing a lot of fishing a lot we were
 

5571
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,550
doing a lot of fishing a lot we were
getting pins we were getting card

5572
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:00,560
getting pins we were getting card
 

5573
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,510
getting pins we were getting card
numbers but you can't get that algorithm

5574
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:03,520
numbers but you can't get that algorithm
 

5575
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,790
numbers but you can't get that algorithm
so ukrainians start testing stuff

5576
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:06,800
so ukrainians start testing stuff
 

5577
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,790
so ukrainians start testing stuff
what they found out was

5578
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:08,800
what they found out was
 

5579
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,070
what they found out was
no bank

5580
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:10,080
no bank
 

5581
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,590
no bank
had implemented the hash on track two

5582
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:13,600
had implemented the hash on track two
 

5583
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,109
had implemented the hash on track two
so you take the card number forward

5584
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:15,119
so you take the card number forward
 

5585
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:19,189
so you take the card number forward
slash any 16 digits it would encode

5586
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199
slash any 16 digits it would encode
 

5587
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,750
slash any 16 digits it would encode
take it to the atm pull cash out because

5588
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:21,760
take it to the atm pull cash out because
 

5589
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,149
take it to the atm pull cash out because
you got the pin all right

5590
01:35:24,149 --> 01:35:24,159
you got the pin all right
 

5591
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:26,149
you got the pin all right
started doing that

5592
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:26,159
started doing that
 

5593
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,070
started doing that
well wait uh sorry i'm trying to

5594
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,080
well wait uh sorry i'm trying to
 

5595
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,910
well wait uh sorry i'm trying to
understand so

5596
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:29,920
understand so
 

5597
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,149
understand so
that means so if there's no

5598
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
that means so if there's no
 

5599
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:32,950
that means so if there's no
ha

5600
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:32,960
ha
 

5601
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,790
ha
are they generating random numbers or do

5602
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:34,800
are they generating random numbers or do
 

5603
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,189
are they generating random numbers or do
they have valid numbers for track two no

5604
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:37,199
they have valid numbers for track two no
 

5605
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:38,950
they have valid numbers for track two no
numbers needed at all as long as just

5606
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:38,960
numbers needed at all as long as just
 

5607
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,669
numbers needed at all as long as just
the track two was a complete track too

5608
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:41,679
the track two was a complete track too
 

5609
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,990
the track two was a complete track too
so it's a valid track too

5610
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:44,000
so it's a valid track too
 

5611
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,189
so it's a valid track too
that doesn't

5612
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:45,199
that doesn't
 

5613
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:46,870
that doesn't
matter so the pin

5614
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:46,880
matter so the pin
 

5615
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,550
matter so the pin
is the thing that gets you in right so

5616
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:48,560
is the thing that gets you in right so
 

5617
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,310
is the thing that gets you in right so
back then all right back then what we're

5618
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:50,320
back then all right back then what we're
 

5619
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,629
back then all right back then what we're
talking about is you need to typically

5620
01:35:52,629 --> 01:35:52,639
talking about is you need to typically
 

5621
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:54,229
talking about is you need to typically
today you need a whole track too you

5622
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:54,239
today you need a whole track too you
 

5623
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,990
today you need a whole track too you
need that valid track too all right you

5624
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:56,000
need that valid track too all right you
 

5625
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,990
need that valid track too all right you
need the you need the 16 digit card

5626
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:58,000
need the you need the 16 digit card
 

5627
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,950
need the you need the 16 digit card
number

5628
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:58,960
number
 

5629
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,629
number
forward slash and then whatever that

5630
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:00,639
forward slash and then whatever that
 

5631
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,310
forward slash and then whatever that
algorithm is out of the side of it all

5632
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:02,320
algorithm is out of the side of it all
 

5633
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,030
algorithm is out of the side of it all
right

5634
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:03,040
right
 

5635
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,950
right
back then none of the banks had

5636
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:04,960
back then none of the banks had
 

5637
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,629
back then none of the banks had
implemented that algorithm

5638
01:36:06,629 --> 01:36:06,639
implemented that algorithm
 

5639
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:08,790
implemented that algorithm
so while the algorithm was there

5640
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:08,800
so while the algorithm was there
 

5641
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,510
so while the algorithm was there
you didn't need it to encode

5642
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:13,520

 

5643
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,669

interesting interesting

5644
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:15,679
interesting interesting
 

5645
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:17,750
interesting interesting
so you can't make a lot of money

5646
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:17,760
so you can't make a lot of money
 

5647
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,590
so you can't make a lot of money
uh with uh physical of

5648
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:21,600
uh with uh physical of
 

5649
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:22,790
uh with uh physical of
that

5650
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:22,800
that
 

5651
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,830
that
debit

5652
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:23,840
debit
 

5653
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,270
debit
card not present fraud remember i told

5654
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:25,280
card not present fraud remember i told
 

5655
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,510
card not present fraud remember i told
you it was 30 to 40 000 a month all

5656
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:27,520
you it was 30 to 40 000 a month all
 

5657
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,109
you it was 30 to 40 000 a month all
right that turned into 30 to 40 000 a

5658
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:31,119
right that turned into 30 to 40 000 a
 

5659
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,550
right that turned into 30 to 40 000 a
day yeah the ukrainians again they can't

5660
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
day yeah the ukrainians again they can't
 

5661
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,550
day yeah the ukrainians again they can't
cash it out

5662
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,560
cash it out
 

5663
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,070
cash it out
they've got all the data on the planet

5664
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,080
they've got all the data on the planet
 

5665
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,430
they've got all the data on the planet
but they can't cash it out those three

5666
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:39,440
but they can't cash it out those three
 

5667
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,830
but they can't cash it out those three
necessities of cybercrime so the deal

5668
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:41,840
necessities of cybercrime so the deal
 

5669
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,390
necessities of cybercrime so the deal
became you have to rely on the americans

5670
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,400
became you have to rely on the americans
 

5671
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,390
became you have to rely on the americans
tell you what we'll give you 40

tell you what we'll give you 40
so you had all these cashiers that were

5674
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:49,119
so you had all these cashiers that were
 

5675
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:52,070
so you had all these cashiers that were
40 of 40 000 a day yeah we'll take that

5676
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,080
40 of 40 000 a day yeah we'll take that
 

5677
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,189
40 of 40 000 a day yeah we'll take that
all right

5678
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:53,199
all right
 

5679
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,030
all right
send the rest of it over to by western

came into play now you had a couple of

5686
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:00,320
came into play now you had a couple of
 

5687
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,470
came into play now you had a couple of
forerunners with e-gold and liberty

5688
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:02,480
forerunners with e-gold and liberty
 

5689
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,229
forerunners with e-gold and liberty
reserve things like that

5690
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,239
reserve things like that
 

5691
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,709
reserve things like that
but back then it starts out with western

5692
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
but back then it starts out with western
 

5693
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:09,189
but back then it starts out with western
union then it becomes prepaid cards

5694
01:37:09,189 --> 01:37:09,199
union then it becomes prepaid cards
 

5695
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,270
union then it becomes prepaid cards
sending track information over loading

5696
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:11,280
sending track information over loading
 

5697
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,709
sending track information over loading
the card up like that and then finally

5698
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
the card up like that and then finally
 

5699
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,629
the card up like that and then finally
you get to e-gold liberty reserve and

5700
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:14,639
you get to e-gold liberty reserve and
 

5701
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,709
you get to e-gold liberty reserve and
today it's with crypto that's that's

5702
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:16,719
today it's with crypto that's that's
 

5703
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:19,750
today it's with crypto that's that's
used um

5704
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:19,760

 

5705
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,149

started stealing a lot of money

5706
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:22,159
started stealing a lot of money
 

5707
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,950
started stealing a lot of money
a lot and that got law enforcement

5708
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:24,960
a lot and that got law enforcement
 

5709
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,470
a lot and that got law enforcement
attention

5710
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:26,480
attention
 

5711
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,550
attention
so we started to see

5712
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:28,560
so we started to see
 

5713
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,390
so we started to see
i mean this it's a crazy-ass story we

5714
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:30,400
i mean this it's a crazy-ass story we
 

5715
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,070
i mean this it's a crazy-ass story we
started to see uh

5716
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
started to see uh
 

5717
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,149
started to see uh
ips coming in from law enforcement

5718
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:34,159
ips coming in from law enforcement
 

5719
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:35,750

agencies government agencies because

5720
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:35,760
agencies government agencies because
 

5721
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,030
agencies government agencies because
back then they didn't know how to shield

5722
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
back then they didn't know how to shield
 

5723
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,830
back then they didn't know how to shield
their identity either so you saw you saw

5724
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:39,840
their identity either so you saw you saw
 

5725
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,390
their identity either so you saw you saw
secret service you saw dod you saw all

5726
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400

and then you can multiply that by five
 

6007
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,189
and then you can multiply that by five
for hundreds

03:30:26,150 --> 03:30:26,160
about it so the way to defend against
 

12361
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:28,550
about it so the way to defend against
cybercrime is like there's a lot of

12362
03:30:28,550 --> 03:30:28,560
cybercrime is like there's a lot of
 

12363
03:30:28,560 --> 03:30:30,469
cybercrime is like there's a lot of
low-hanging fruit that you should fix a

12364
03:30:30,469 --> 03:30:30,479
low-hanging fruit that you should fix a
 

12365
03:30:30,479 --> 03:30:32,389
low-hanging fruit that you should fix a
lot of that a lot of that so a lot of

12366
03:30:32,389 --> 03:30:32,399
lot of that a lot of that so a lot of
 

12367
03:30:32,399 --> 03:30:33,510
lot of that a lot of that so a lot of
basic stuff that's already

12368
03:30:33,510 --> 03:30:33,520
basic stuff that's already
 

12369
03:30:33,520 --> 03:30:35,269
basic stuff that's already
vulnerabilities update the system

12370
03:30:35,269 --> 03:30:35,279
vulnerabilities update the system
 

12371

security now that doesn't take care of

12372

solar winds right or cnap or anything

12374
03:30:39,510 --> 03:30:39,520
solar winds right or cnap or anything
 

12375
03:30:39,520 --> 03:30:41,670
solar winds right or cnap or anything
like that it doesn't

12376
03:30:41,670 --> 03:30:41,680
like that it doesn't
 

12377
03:30:41,680 --> 03:30:44,710
like that it doesn't
but those instances i mean okay that's a

12378
03:30:44,710 --> 03:30:44,720
but those instances i mean okay that's a
 

12379
03:30:44,720 --> 03:30:45,830
but those instances i mean okay that's a
big instance

12380
03:30:45,830 --> 03:30:45,840
big instance
 

12381
03:30:45,840 --> 03:30:49,429
big instance
but i mean it is but in the full

uh
 

12387
03:30:54,640 --> 03:30:56,309
uh
because there's more and more companies

and those vulnerabilities in terms of
 

12395
03:31:02,960 --> 03:31:05,429
and those vulnerabilities in terms of
human nature so for social engineering

human nature so for social engineering
 

12397

and the actual outdated systems
 

12399
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:09,910

all of it and some of it i guess is the

and i've talked about that before of

as a person and as a business so you
 

12453
03:31:59,920 --> 03:32:01,670
as a person and as a business so you
have to understand that design security

12454
03:32:01,670 --> 03:32:01,680
have to understand that design security
 

12455
03:32:01,680 --> 03:32:03,590
have to understand that design security
around that you know we've got 7 500

12456
03:32:03,590 --> 03:32:03,600
around that you know we've got 7 500
 

12457
03:32:03,600 --> 03:32:05,590
around that you know we've got 7 500
security companies out there a whole lot

12458
03:32:05,590 --> 03:32:05,600
security companies out there a whole lot
 

12459
03:32:05,600 --> 03:32:07,910
security companies out there a whole lot
of them are snake oil salesmen a lot of

12460
03:32:07,910 --> 03:32:07,920
of them are snake oil salesmen a lot of
 

12461
03:32:07,920 --> 03:32:09,190
of them are snake oil salesmen a lot of
them is going to tell you that we're the

12462
03:32:09,190 --> 03:32:09,200
them is going to tell you that we're the
 

12463
03:32:09,200 --> 03:32:12,630
them is going to tell you that we're the
one stop solution but you're not you're

12464
03:32:12,630 --> 03:32:12,640
one stop solution but you're not you're
 

12465
03:32:12,640 --> 03:32:14,710
one stop solution but you're not you're
not you're a tool

12466
03:32:14,710 --> 03:32:14,720
not you're a tool
 

12467
03:32:14,720 --> 03:32:16,469
not you're a tool
all right and you may have a very good

12468
03:32:16,469 --> 03:32:16,479
all right and you may have a very good
 

12469
03:32:16,479 --> 03:32:18,950
all right and you may have a very good
tool but it's not the only tool that's

12470
03:32:18,950 --> 03:32:18,960
tool but it's not the only tool that's
 

12471
03:32:18,960 --> 03:32:21,190
tool but it's not the only tool that's
needed to protect against the attacks

12472
03:32:21,190 --> 03:32:21,200
needed to protect against the attacks
 

12473
03:32:21,200 --> 03:32:22,870
needed to protect against the attacks
that are out there and we have we have

12474
03:32:22,870 --> 03:32:22,880
that are out there and we have we have
 

12475
03:32:22,880 --> 03:32:24,469
that are out there and we have we have
to be open and honest about that kind of

12476
03:32:24,469 --> 03:32:24,479
to be open and honest about that kind of
 

12477
03:32:24,479 --> 03:32:25,429
to be open and honest about that kind of
stuff

12478
03:32:25,429 --> 03:32:25,439
stuff
 

12479
03:32:25,439 --> 03:32:28,070
stuff
so i guess defending defense is not just

12480
03:32:28,070 --> 03:32:28,080
so i guess defending defense is not just
 

12481
03:32:28,080 --> 03:32:29,670
so i guess defending defense is not just
like one tool

12482
03:32:29,670 --> 03:32:29,680
like one tool
 

12483
03:32:29,680 --> 03:32:32,469
like one tool
it's it's a process of just uh like a

12484
03:32:32,469 --> 03:32:32,479
it's it's a process of just uh like a
 

12485
03:32:32,479 --> 03:32:34,950
it's it's a process of just uh like a
diversity and just constantly educating

12486
03:32:34,950 --> 03:32:34,960
diversity and just constantly educating
 

12487
03:32:34,960 --> 03:32:37,349
diversity and just constantly educating
uh people absolutely so it's the social

12488
03:32:37,349 --> 03:32:37,359
uh people absolutely so it's the social
 

12489
03:32:37,359 --> 03:32:39,990
uh people absolutely so it's the social
side it's constantly

12490
03:32:39,990 --> 03:32:40,000
side it's constantly
 

12491
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:41,510
side it's constantly
because there's so many probably attack

12492
03:32:41,510 --> 03:32:41,520
because there's so many probably attack
 

12493
03:32:41,520 --> 03:32:43,429
because there's so many probably attack
vectors oh this is the software that you

12494
03:32:43,429 --> 03:32:43,439
vectors oh this is the software that you
 

12495
03:32:43,439 --> 03:32:45,030
vectors oh this is the software that you
have if you look at it that's that

12496
03:32:45,030 --> 03:32:45,040
have if you look at it that's that
 

12497
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:47,269
have if you look at it that's that
attack surface you can't plug everything

12498
03:32:47,269 --> 03:32:47,279
attack surface you can't plug everything
 

12499
03:32:47,279 --> 03:32:50,070
attack surface you can't plug everything
it's too damn large to plug everything

12500
03:32:50,070 --> 03:32:50,080
it's too damn large to plug everything
 

12501
03:32:50,080 --> 03:32:51,510
it's too damn large to plug everything
but you can do the best job you can

12502
03:32:51,510 --> 03:32:51,520
but you can do the best job you can
 

12503
03:32:51,520 --> 03:32:53,590
but you can do the best job you can
possibly do but it takes a variety of

12504
03:32:53,590 --> 03:32:53,600
possibly do but it takes a variety of
 

12505
03:32:53,600 --> 03:32:56,950
possibly do but it takes a variety of
tools to do that all right the idea

12506
03:32:56,950 --> 03:32:56,960
tools to do that all right the idea
 

12507
03:32:56,960 --> 03:32:59,590
tools to do that all right the idea
and arcos is big about that but the the

12508
03:32:59,590 --> 03:32:59,600
and arcos is big about that but the the
 

12509
03:32:59,600 --> 03:33:02,389
and arcos is big about that but the the
idea is to

12510
03:33:02,389 --> 03:33:02,399
idea is to
 

12511
03:33:02,399 --> 03:33:04,790
idea is to
take the cost of fraud to the fraudsters

12512
03:33:04,790 --> 03:33:04,800
