of the atheists that i have debated
um

1000
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
um
 

1001
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,750
um
they i think about all of them somewhat

1002
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
they i think about all of them somewhat
 

1003
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,950
they i think about all of them somewhat
differently

1004
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
differently
 

1005
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,909
differently
so

1006
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
so
 

1007
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,830
so
i think that in in some deep way for

1008
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
i think that in in some deep way for
 

1009

i think that in in some deep way for
example sam harris is a religious

1010
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600

personality
i don't even think that he would he

1014
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
i don't even think that he would he

take issue with that um i think that he
would say his is a purely material

1022

1025
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,909
based spirituality but i mean his
his orientation towards meditation and

1072
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
uh
 

1073
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,510
uh
and intellectual range so for example

1074
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
and intellectual range so for example
 

1075
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,270
and intellectual range so for example
the idea that you would call a book that

1076
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
the idea that you would call a book that
 

1077
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,510
the idea that you would call a book that
religion poisons everything

1078
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
religion poisons everything
 

1079
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,830
religion poisons everything
um i think he did that deliberately

1080
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
um i think he did that deliberately
 

1081
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,830
um i think he did that deliberately
provocatively so that he could defend a

1082
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
provocatively so that he could defend a
 

1083
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,190
provocatively so that he could defend a
proposition that obviously is

1084
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
proposition that obviously is
 

1085
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,390
proposition that obviously is
indefensible that it poisons everything

1086
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
indefensible that it poisons everything
 

1087
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,830
indefensible that it poisons everything
so

1088
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840

1097
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,470
all of its manifestations
and

1098
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
and
 

1099
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,070
and
and arguing against something that

1100
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
and arguing against something that
 

1101
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,750
and arguing against something that
someone else believed was one of his

1102
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
someone else believed was one of his
 

1103
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,390
someone else believed was one of his
greatest joys yeah and and of course the

1104
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
greatest joys yeah and and of course the
 

1105
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,310
greatest joys yeah and and of course the
practical aspect of that he just saw the

1106
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,320
practical aspect of that he just saw the
 

1107
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,990
practical aspect of that he just saw the
powerful and he challenged them with

1108
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
powerful and he challenged them with
 

1109
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,549
powerful and he challenged them with
humor absolutely and you know you could

1110
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
humor absolutely and you know you could
 

1111
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,029
humor absolutely and you know you could
argue perhaps that humor is the highest

1112
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,039
argue perhaps that humor is the highest
 

1113
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,990
argue perhaps that humor is the highest
form

1114
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
form
 

1115
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,669
form
of what humanity can achieve like

1116
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
of what humanity can achieve like
 

1117
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,350

humans take things a little too
 

1123
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,190
humans take things a little too
seriously then sometimes we need to just

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
seriously then sometimes we need to just
 

1125
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,789
seriously then sometimes we need to just
laugh at it all laugh at ourselves and

1293
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,470
don't know peterson i've read his stuff
and i've reviewed his stuff and so on

1294
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480

1295
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,669
and i've reviewed his stuff and so on

1299
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,029
jungians are in their
very approach

1300
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
very approach
 

1301
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,470
very approach
they

1302
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
they
 

1303
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,789
they
believe that myth is the way the world

1304
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
believe that myth is the way the world
 

1305
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,669
believe that myth is the way the world
works and so it's not that big a leap to

1306
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
works and so it's not that big a leap to
 

1307
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,510
works and so it's not that big a leap to
god but it's still

1308
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
god but it's still
 

1309
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,510

there's still a distance there is it

1310
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
there's still a distance there is it
 

1311
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,830
there's still a distance there is it

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,830
possible to have your cake and eat it
too is it possible to have the

1314

together otherwise like traditions fall
apart right so you can't have the

1418
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
apart right so you can't have the
 

1419
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,789
apart right so you can't have the
intensity

1420
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799

stalin
 

1853
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,870

thought he was doing good

1854
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
thought he was doing good
 

1855
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,669

and
 

1859
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,470
and
it makes you ask

1860
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:14,480
it makes you ask
 

1861
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,470
it makes you ask
a question of yourself

1862
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,480
a question of yourself
 

1863
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,070
a question of yourself
for those of us who want to do good in

that's a really difficult question
 

1869
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,149
that's a really difficult question
like in the technology sphere for

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,790
away with so i said yes jews believe
that they were chosen for a certain

2434
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:10,800
that they were chosen for a certain
 

2435
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,630
that they were chosen for a certain
mission in this world

2436
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:12,640
mission in this world
 

2437
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,750
mission in this world
but that doesn't mean other people

2438
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
but that doesn't mean other people
 

2439
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,829
but that doesn't mean other people
weren't chosen for other sorts of things

2440
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
weren't chosen for other sorts of things
 

2441
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,750
weren't chosen for other sorts of things
they certainly i mean seems to me that

2442
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
they certainly i mean seems to me that
 

2443
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,349
they certainly i mean seems to me that
other people believe they're chosen for

2444
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:19,359
other people believe they're chosen for
 

2445
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,829
other people believe they're chosen for
things too he burst out laughing and

2446
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:21,839
things too he burst out laughing and
 

2447
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,390
things too he burst out laughing and
said yeah we also think we're chosen

2448

the way that you take this sort of
psychic revenge is by saying no we're

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,510
different people have different missions
which is

2482
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:03,520

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,430
which is
i mean like there was a jewish

talked about in the eric weinstein

2510
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:35,760
talked about in the eric weinstein
 

2511
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,150
talked about in the eric weinstein
podcast is that

2512
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
podcast is that
 

2513
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,550
podcast is that
islam and judaism are more similar in a

2514
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:40,560
islam and judaism are more similar in a
 

2515
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,390
islam and judaism are more similar in a
lot of ways than judaism and

2516
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:42,400
lot of ways than judaism and
 

2517
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,910
lot of ways than judaism and
christianity

2518
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:43,920
christianity
 

2519
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,230
christianity
and the reason that that is so

2520
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,240
and the reason that that is so
 

2521
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,190
and the reason that that is so
is

2522
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,200
is
 

2523
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,910
is
christianity in its core is not a

2524
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:49,920
christianity in its core is not a
 

2525
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,150
christianity in its core is not a
religion of law

2526
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,160
religion of law
 

2527
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,990
religion of law
the reason it's not a religion of law is

2528
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
the reason it's not a religion of law is
 

2529
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,309
the reason it's not a religion of law is
because it grew up in the roman empire

2530
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:56,319
because it grew up in the roman empire
 

2531
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,069
because it grew up in the roman empire
so law was taken care of

2532
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079
so law was taken care of
 

2533
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,829
so law was taken care of
i mean jesus didn't have to create civil

2534
00:44:59,829 --> 00:44:59,839
i mean jesus didn't have to create civil
 

2535
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,230
i mean jesus didn't have to create civil
law because you had roman law

2536
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
law because you had roman law
 

2537
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,230
law because you had roman law
muhammad and moses created a religion in

2538
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:04,240
muhammad and moses created a religion in
 

2539
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,230
muhammad and moses created a religion in
the desert where there was no law

2540
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240
the desert where there was no law
 

2541
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,230
the desert where there was no law
so you have to create a religion of law

2542
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,240
so you have to create a religion of law
 

2543
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,750
so you have to create a religion of law
otherwise

2544
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:09,760
otherwise
 

2545
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,510
otherwise
you have anarchy

2546
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
you have anarchy
 

2547
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,150
you have anarchy
and that's why in a lot of ways like

2548
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
and that's why in a lot of ways like
 

2549
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,829
and that's why in a lot of ways like
there was never a separation of church

2550
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
there was never a separation of church
 

2551
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,390
there was never a separation of church
and state in islam or judaism that was a

2552
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:18,400
and state in islam or judaism that was a
 

2553
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,790
and state in islam or judaism that was a
gift that christianity gave the world

2554
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:20,800
gift that christianity gave the world
 

2555
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,630
gift that christianity gave the world
and it could do it because of render

2556
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,640
and it could do it because of render
 

2557
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,550
and it could do it because of render
unto caesar what is caesar's but when

2558
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:24,560
unto caesar what is caesar's but when
 

2559
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,390
unto caesar what is caesar's but when
moses came along there was no caesar

2560
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
moses came along there was no caesar
 

2561
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,990
moses came along there was no caesar
when muhammad came along there was no

2562
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
when muhammad came along there was no
 

2563
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,870
when muhammad came along there was no
caesar so historically

2564
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
caesar so historically

the traditions shaped differently

2566
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,079
the traditions shaped differently
 

2567
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,150
the traditions shaped differently
but all three of them

2568
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,160
but all three of them
 

2569
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,069
but all three of them
have this core

2570
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:38,079
have this core
 

2571
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,150
have this core
i think the single most

2572
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160
i think the single most
 

2573
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,430
i think the single most
important

2574
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
important
 

2575
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,829
important
statement and insight in all of human

2576
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:43,839
statement and insight in all of human
 

2577
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,470
statement and insight in all of human
history which is that every human being

2578
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480
history which is that every human being
 

2579
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,150
history which is that every human being
is in the image of god

2580
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,160
is in the image of god
 

2581
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,550
is in the image of god
and if you believe if you really believe

2582
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,560
and if you believe if you really believe
 

2583
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,829
and if you believe if you really believe
that that's a transformative belief

2584
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:53,839
that that's a transformative belief
 

2585
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,670
that that's a transformative belief
so that means

2586
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
so that means
 

2587
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,349
so that means
you should love

2588
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:57,359
you should love
 

2589
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,589
you should love
you know thy neighbor as myself which

2591
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,349
you know thy neighbor as myself which

religious tradition wrong in judaism the

4514
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,400
religious tradition wrong in judaism the
 

4515
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,229
religious tradition wrong in judaism the
words are written by moses at god's

4516
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239
words are written by moses at god's
 

4517
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,669
words are written by moses at god's
dictation basically that's the

4518
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:35,679
dictation basically that's the
 

4519
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,510
dictation basically that's the
traditional view there are other views

4520
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:37,520
traditional view there are other views
 

4521
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,189
traditional view there are other views
that i i'm happy to go into if you want

4522
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:39,199
that i i'm happy to go into if you want
 

4523
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,709
that i i'm happy to go into if you want
to but basically that's the traditional

4524
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:40,719
to but basically that's the traditional
 

4525
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,270
to but basically that's the traditional
view so it's pretty close right what

4526
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:43,280
view so it's pretty close right what
 

4527
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,669
view so it's pretty close right what
makes it different what makes judaism

4528
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:45,679
makes it different what makes judaism
 

4529
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,510
makes it different what makes judaism
and christianity different

4530
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:47,520
and christianity different
 

4531
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,229
and christianity different
is christianity has an ideal life

4532
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
is christianity has an ideal life
 

4533
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,950
is christianity has an ideal life
judaism doesn't have an ideal life

4534
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:52,960
judaism doesn't have an ideal life
 

4535
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,350
judaism doesn't have an ideal life
judaism has an ideal book

4536
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
judaism has an ideal book
 

4537
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,750
judaism has an ideal book
so the holidays of christianity are

4538
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:57,760
so the holidays of christianity are
 

4539
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,830
so the holidays of christianity are
events in the life of god

4540
01:19:59,830 --> 01:19:59,840
events in the life of god
 

4541

4543
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,630
god's birth god's death and resurrection
in judaism

4544
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:04,640
in judaism
 

4545
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,550
in judaism

the holidays are all events in the life
 

4547
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,629
the holidays are all events in the life
of the people like the liberation from

destroy you
 

4685
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,950
destroy you
and

4686
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:26,960
and
 

4687
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,070
and
you miraculously escaped before it did

4688
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:30,080
you miraculously escaped before it did
 

4689
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,189
you miraculously escaped before it did
and

01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:31,199
and
 

4691
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,709
and
so a

4692
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:32,719
so a
 

4693
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:33,830
so a
a myth

4694
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:33,840
a myth
 

4695
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,270
a myth
um in

01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:35,280
um in
 

4697
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,350
um in
is something that may not have happened

4698
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:37,360
is something that may not have happened
 

4699
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,590
is something that may not have happened
but is always happening

4700
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:39,600
but is always happening
 

4701
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,030
but is always happening
and that's what i would say about the

4702
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:41,040
and that's what i would say about the
 

4703
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,910
and that's what i would say about the
exodus story it's not about whether

4704
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:43,920
exodus story it's not about whether
 

4705
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,510
exodus story it's not about whether
in fact there was a killing of the

in fact there was a killing of the
 

4707
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,790
in fact there was a killing of the
firstborn

4708
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:46,800
firstborn
 

4709
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,430
firstborn
it's about does god deliver did god

4710
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,440
it's about does god deliver did god
 

4711
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,110
it's about does god deliver did god
deliver the jews in ancient times does

god deliver people in modern times and
 

4715

01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
that's
 

4717
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,950
that's
what the issue is and

4718
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:56,960
what the issue is and
 

4719
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,270
what the issue is and
and to me it's a

4720
01:22:59,270 --> 01:22:59,280
and to me it's a
 

4721
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,149
and to me it's a
much

4722
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:00,159
much
 

4723
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:01,990
much
the issue of faith is much deeper than

4724
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000
the issue of faith is much deeper than
 

4725
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,430
the issue of faith is much deeper than
the issue of fact i wouldn't look to the

4726
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:03,440
the issue of fact i wouldn't look to the
 

4727
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,390
the issue of fact i wouldn't look to the
torah for my science either

4728
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:06,400
torah for my science either
 

4729
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,910
torah for my science either
what

4730
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:07,920
what
 

4731
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,149
what
are the limits of science in terms of

4732
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:12,159
are the limits of science in terms of
 

4733
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:15,030
are the limits of science in terms of
what can science not tell us that the

4734
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,040
what can science not tell us that the
 

4735
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,149
what can science not tell us that the
torah can in terms of wisdom so

4736
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:18,159
torah can in terms of wisdom so
 

4737
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,669
torah can in terms of wisdom so
the historicity the facts of things okay

4738
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,679
the historicity the facts of things okay
 

4739
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:25,030
the historicity the facts of things okay
if if the torah is much more than that

4740
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,040
if if the torah is much more than that
 

4741
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,310
if if the torah is much more than that
is it's like you said myth uh myth is

4742
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:28,320
is it's like you said myth uh myth is
 

4743
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,669
is it's like you said myth uh myth is
not something that happened but

4744
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:29,679
not something that happened but
 

4745
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,750
not something that happened but
something that is always happening

4746
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:31,760
something that is always happening
 

4747
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,110
something that is always happening
and so presumably it's interacting with

4748
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:35,120
and so presumably it's interacting with
 

4749
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,470
and so presumably it's interacting with
the environment of the day to generate

4750
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:38,480
the environment of the day to generate
 

4751
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,910
the environment of the day to generate
wisdom so you can live a life by torah

4752
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
wisdom so you can live a life by torah
 

4753
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,350
wisdom so you can live a life by torah
i don't think you can live a life by

4754
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,360
i don't think you can live a life by
 

4755
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,750
i don't think you can live a life by
biology

4756
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:45,760
biology
 

4757
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,669
biology
you can live a life

4758
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
you can live a life
 

4759
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,550
you can live a life
that is informed by the values of the

4760
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:50,560
that is informed by the values of the
 

4761
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,709
that is informed by the values of the
tradition of judaism

4762
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:52,719
tradition of judaism
 

4763
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,270
tradition of judaism
and those values by the way

4764
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,280
and those values by the way
 

4765
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,310
and those values by the way
what science does is it contributes

4766
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
what science does is it contributes
 

4767
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,149
what science does is it contributes
factuality

4768
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
factuality
 

4769
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,629
factuality
to the conversation and also changes the

4770
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
to the conversation and also changes the
 

4771
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,550
to the conversation and also changes the
reality around us

4772
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:04,560
reality around us
 

4773
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,830
reality around us
so

4774
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840
so
 

4775
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,870
so
when you

4776
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:06,880
when you
 

4777
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,669
when you
study talmud on your iphone

4778
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:09,679
study talmud on your iphone
 

4779
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:11,990
study talmud on your iphone
you know you're still i mean it changes

4780
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,000
you know you're still i mean it changes
 

4781
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,030
you know you're still i mean it changes
the atmosphere in which you do it but

4782
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:15,040
the atmosphere in which you do it but
 

4783
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,189
the atmosphere in which you do it but
but the wisdom and the

4784
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:17,199
but the wisdom and the
 

4785
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,750
but the wisdom and the
life guidance and the connection to

4786
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:19,760
life guidance and the connection to
 

4787
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,149
life guidance and the connection to
transcendence is something

4788
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159
transcendence is something
 

4789
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,189
transcendence is something
that science doesn't give so if we now

4790
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
that science doesn't give so if we now
 

4791
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,910
that science doesn't give so if we now
step into returning to our

4792
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:27,920
step into returning to our
 

4793
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,310
step into returning to our
friend sam harris and step into this

4794
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,320
friend sam harris and step into this
 

4795
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,310
friend sam harris and step into this
weird place of science and you talked

4796
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:32,320
weird place of science and you talked
 

4797
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,390
weird place of science and you talked
about this where the kind of the current

4798
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:34,400
about this where the kind of the current
 

4799
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,229
about this where the kind of the current
assumption of science is

4800
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:36,239
assumption of science is
 

4801
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,709
assumption of science is
it's a materialistic one

4802
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
it's a materialistic one
 

4803
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,669
it's a materialistic one
uh so for me obviously ai person

4804
01:24:41,669 --> 01:24:41,679
uh so for me obviously ai person
 

4805
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,990
uh so for me obviously ai person
this whole mind thing is fascinating

4806
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
this whole mind thing is fascinating
 

4807
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,229
this whole mind thing is fascinating
like what the heck is going on up there

4808
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:46,239
like what the heck is going on up there
 

4809
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:49,750
like what the heck is going on up there
uh so how do you explain consciousness

4810
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:49,760
uh so how do you explain consciousness
 

4811
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,910
uh so how do you explain consciousness
how do you explain free will do you

4812
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:51,920
how do you explain free will do you
 

4813
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,470
how do you explain free will do you
think first of all do you think we have

4814
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
think first of all do you think we have
 

4815
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,629
think first of all do you think we have
a free will and if so what is it this is

4816
01:24:58,629 --> 01:24:58,639
a free will and if so what is it this is
 

4817
01:24:58,639 --> 01:24:59,430
a free will and if so what is it this is
where

4818
01:24:59,430 --> 01:24:59,440
where
 

4819
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,070
where
we had the debate um earlier that i

4820
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:02,080
we had the debate um earlier that i
 

4821
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,709
we had the debate um earlier that i
mentioned with hitchens where i think

4822
01:25:04,709 --> 01:25:04,719
mentioned with hitchens where i think
 

4823
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,350

what i was trying to say is

4834
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:20,560
what i was trying to say is
 

4835
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,390
what i was trying to say is
if we're entirely biological creatures

4836
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:24,400
if we're entirely biological creatures
 

4837
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,189
if we're entirely biological creatures
if we didn't choose our genetics and we

4838
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:27,199
if we didn't choose our genetics and we
 

4839
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:29,270
if we didn't choose our genetics and we
didn't choose our environment

4840
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,280
didn't choose our environment
 

4841
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,669
didn't choose our environment
then there is no space for free choice i

4842
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:31,679
then there is no space for free choice i
 

4843
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,430
then there is no space for free choice i
don't understand where it comes in and i

4844
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
don't understand where it comes in and i
 

4845
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,669
don't understand where it comes in and i
kept asking them that question but

4846
01:25:35,669 --> 01:25:35,679
kept asking them that question but
 

4847
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:36,790
kept asking them that question but
didn't get an answer because i don't

4848
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:36,800
didn't get an answer because i don't
 

4849
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,470
didn't get an answer because i don't
think there is an answer i think

4850
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:38,480
think there is an answer i think
 

4851
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,510
think there is an answer i think
if you're a thorough going materialist

4852
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:41,520
if you're a thorough going materialist
 

4853
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,750
if you're a thorough going materialist
free will is impossible there could be

4854
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:43,760
free will is impossible there could be
 

4855
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,070
free will is impossible there could be
randomness but randomness is not free

4856
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080
randomness but randomness is not free
 

4857
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,550
randomness but randomness is not free
will it's randomness

4858
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
will it's randomness
 

4859
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,070
will it's randomness

non-material belief in order to get free
will

4866
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:56,000
will
 

4867
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,910
will
and that's why i believe in free will

4868
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:57,920
and that's why i believe in free will

water and basically how what was the
 

4877
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,350
water and basically how what was the
difference so do you free will

4878
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,360
difference so do you free will
 

4879
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,110
difference so do you free will
because you could also if it fits into

choice free will i don't see where you
 

4919
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,830
choice free will i don't see where you
get it if you're a materialist i think

4920

you have to have

4922
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
you have to have
 

4923
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,669
you have to have
a spiritual component by the way this i

4924
01:26:49,669 --> 01:26:49,679
a spiritual component by the way this i
 

4925
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,510
a spiritual component by the way this i
think this is also i think sam would

4926

think this is also i think sam would
 

4927
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,709
think this is also i think sam would
agree with this

01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:55,270
agree with this
um i think he wrote about not having not

4930
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
um i think he wrote about not having not
 

4931

you don't have uh a soul
 

4937
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,669
you don't have uh a soul
that free will is a logical

4938
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:05,679
that free will is a logical
 

4939
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,830
that free will is a logical
impossibility

4940
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:07,840
impossibility
 

4941
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,149
impossibility
for sam which is fascinating it's not

4942
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:10,159
for sam which is fascinating it's not
 

4943
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,629
for sam which is fascinating it's not
just that free will is an illusion but

4944
01:27:12,629 --> 01:27:12,639
just that free will is an illusion but
 

4945
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:13,510
just that free will is an illusion but
uh

4956
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
it's not even on us to be talking about
 

4957

alternative and so you can kind of
 

5111
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,430
alternative and so you can kind of
divest yourself in that way well maybe

intellectually arrogant as my saying we
do

5152
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:55,199
do
 

5153
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,310
do
so

5154
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:56,320
so
 

5155
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,629
so
i think for me humility comes in

5156
01:30:58,629 --> 01:30:58,639
i think for me humility comes in
 

5157
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,310
i think for me humility comes in
in admitting

5158
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,320
in admitting
 

5159
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,629
in admitting
that we really really have just the

5160
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:02,639
that we really really have just the
 

5161
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,390
that we really really have just the
tiniest part of the puzzle and

5162
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
tiniest part of the puzzle and
 

5163
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,310
tiniest part of the puzzle and
and and as you get older

5164
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:08,320
and and as you get older
 

5165
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,070
and and as you get older
at least my experience has been not that

5166
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:10,080
at least my experience has been not that
 

5167
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,990
at least my experience has been not that
you get more answers but that you just

5168
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:12,000
you get more answers but that you just
 

5169
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,990
you get more answers but that you just
see a bigger puzzle

5170
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
see a bigger puzzle
 

5171
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,669
see a bigger puzzle
so to me there's

5172
01:31:15,669 --> 01:31:15,679
so to me there's
 

5173
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:16,709
so to me there's
less

5174
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:16,719
less
 

5175
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,149
less
so the questions are fascinating but

5176
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:18,159
so the questions are fascinating but
 

5177
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,229
so the questions are fascinating but
there's also an engineering practical

5178
01:31:20,229 --> 01:31:20,239
there's also an engineering practical
 

5179
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:23,189
there's also an engineering practical
question and perhaps right i'll ask you

5180
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:23,199
question and perhaps right i'll ask you
 

5181
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:26,149
question and perhaps right i'll ask you
a religious one too on this uh point

5182
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
a religious one too on this uh point
 

5183
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:29,110
a religious one too on this uh point
to return back to robots

5184
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:29,120
to return back to robots
 

5185
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,390
to return back to robots
so

5186
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,400
so
 

5187
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,950
so
how to engineer consciousness or i'll

5188
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:32,960
how to engineer consciousness or i'll
 

5189
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,110
how to engineer consciousness or i'll
just even ask you a very simple question

5190
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:35,120
just even ask you a very simple question
 

5191
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:38,870
just even ask you a very simple question
which is uh when you have robots

5192
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:38,880
which is uh when you have robots
 

5193
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,709
which is uh when you have robots
that exhibit

5194
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:40,719
that exhibit
 

5195
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,830
that exhibit
the capacity to

5196
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:42,840
the capacity to
 

5197
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,669
the capacity to
suffer i found in myself as a human when

5198
01:31:45,669 --> 01:31:45,679
suffer i found in myself as a human when
 

5199
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,750
suffer i found in myself as a human when
i see that i

5200
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:47,760
i see that i
 

5201
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,470
i see that i
i feel something exhibit the capacity to

5202
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:50,480
i feel something exhibit the capacity to
 

5203
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,550
i feel something exhibit the capacity to
suffer or they exhibit behaviors that

5204
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:52,560
suffer or they exhibit behaviors that
 

5205
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,709
suffer or they exhibit behaviors that
evoke in you a sense that they are

5206
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:54,719
evoke in you a sense that they are
 

5207
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,270
evoke in you a sense that they are
suffering those aren't the same things

5208
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:57,280
suffering those aren't the same things
 

5209
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,590
suffering those aren't the same things
from my from an observation perspective

5210
01:31:59,590 --> 01:31:59,600
from my from an observation perspective
 

5211
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,910
from my from an observation perspective
they sure as heck seem similar you think

5212
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:01,920
they sure as heck seem similar you think
 

5213
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,270
they sure as heck seem similar you think
they're feeling pain

5214
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:03,280
they're feeling pain
 

5215
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,350
they're feeling pain
i don't know what

5216
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:05,360
i don't know what
 

5217
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,950
i don't know what
i uh i'm observing pain

5218
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:08,960
i uh i'm observing pain
 

5219
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,149
i uh i'm observing pain
okay it's like when i watch a movie and

5220
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:12,159
okay it's like when i watch a movie and
 

5221
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:14,149
okay it's like when i watch a movie and
there's people on screen some some of

5222
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:14,159
there's people on screen some some of
 

5223
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:16,629
there's people on screen some some of
them are dressed like batman

5224
01:32:16,629 --> 01:32:16,639
them are dressed like batman
 

5225
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:17,510
them are dressed like batman
uh

5226
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:17,520
uh
 

5227
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,430
uh
but i but you can make the distinction

5228
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:19,440
but i but you can make the distinction
 

5229
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,830
but i but you can make the distinction
like if i have a doll

5230
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840
like if i have a doll
 

5231
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,910
like if i have a doll
and i bend the doll over and it makes a

5232
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
and i bend the doll over and it makes a
 

5233
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,189
and i bend the doll over and it makes a
sad face

5234
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:25,199
sad face
 

5235
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:28,310
sad face
i know that that doll is not actually

5236
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:28,320
i know that that doll is not actually
 

5237
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,510
i know that that doll is not actually
in pain

5238
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:29,520
in pain
 

5239
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,830
in pain
even though i am observing pain so the

5240
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:31,840
even though i am observing pain so the
 

5241
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,270
even though i am observing pain so the
question what's that what the question

5242
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:35,280
question what's that what the question
 

5243
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,350
question what's that what the question
is when the doll

5244
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:37,360
is when the doll
 

5245
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,709
is when the doll
becomes

5246
01:32:38,709 --> 01:32:38,719
becomes
 

5247
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,270
becomes
able to remember things about you david

5248
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:41,280
able to remember things about you david
 

5249
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,669
able to remember things about you david
right about the experiences you shared

5250
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
right about the experiences you shared
 

5251
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:44,470
right about the experiences you shared
right

5252
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:44,480
right
 

5253
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,629
right
it is able to

5254
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:46,639
it is able to
 

5255
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,470
it is able to
speak yes

5256
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:48,480
speak yes
 

5257
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,950
speak yes
and make you feel like there's an actual

5258
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:50,960
and make you feel like there's an actual
 

5259
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,790
and make you feel like there's an actual
relationship so that's what i'm asking

5260
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:52,800
relationship so that's what i'm asking
 

5261
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,669
relationship so that's what i'm asking
is

5262
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:53,679
is
 

5263
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:56,709
is
at what point do you believe that the

5264
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:56,719
at what point do you believe that the
 

5265
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,470
at what point do you believe that the
i know that this is an impossible

5266
01:32:58,470 --> 01:32:58,480
i know that this is an impossible
 

5267
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,590
i know that this is an impossible
question but at what point do you

5268
01:32:59,590 --> 01:32:59,600
question but at what point do you
 

5269
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,510
question but at what point do you
believe that there is a consciousness in

5270
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:01,520
believe that there is a consciousness in
 

5271
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,709
believe that there is a consciousness in
there as opposed to

5272
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:04,719
there as opposed to
 

5273
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,870
there as opposed to
just an extraordinary i mean like when i

5274
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:06,880
just an extraordinary i mean like when i
 

5275
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,189
just an extraordinary i mean like when i
play chess against a computer yeah and

5276
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:09,199
play chess against a computer yeah and
 

5277
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:10,790
play chess against a computer yeah and
it beats me

5278
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:10,800
it beats me
 

5279
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,350
it beats me
i'm embarrassed even though

5280
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:13,360
i'm embarrassed even though
 

5281
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,790
i'm embarrassed even though
the computer

5282
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:14,800
the computer
 

5283
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,870
the computer
doesn't i don't think the computer is

5284
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:16,880
doesn't i don't think the computer is
 

5285
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,189
doesn't i don't think the computer is
going are you idiot but it feels that

5286
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:19,199
going are you idiot but it feels that
 

5287
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,669
going are you idiot but it feels that
way yeah but there is some part of me

5288
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:21,679
way yeah but there is some part of me
 

5289
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,149
way yeah but there is some part of me
that says okay i know that this computer

5290
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
that says okay i know that this computer
 

5291
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:25,910
that says okay i know that this computer
doesn't actually know who i am or care

5292
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:25,920
doesn't actually know who i am or care
 

5293
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,590
doesn't actually know who i am or care
who i am it just knows how to move the

5294
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:27,600
who i am it just knows how to move the
 

5295
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,709
who i am it just knows how to move the
pieces

5296
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:28,719
pieces
 

5297
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:31,430
pieces
so at what point do you

5298
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:31,440
so at what point do you
 

5299
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,030
so at what point do you
i mean you're giving me instances it

5300
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:33,040
i mean you're giving me instances it
 

5301
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,709
i mean you're giving me instances it
speaks it does this it does this but at

5302
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:34,719
speaks it does this it does this but at
 

5303
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,390
speaks it does this it does this but at
what point does that for you cross the

5304
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
what point does that for you cross the
 

5305
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,110
what point does that for you cross the
threshold into it's actually a sentient

5306
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,120
threshold into it's actually a sentient
 

5307
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,189
threshold into it's actually a sentient
being i think the question is whether

5308
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:41,199
being i think the question is whether
 

5309
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,550
being i think the question is whether
there is a threshold that could be

5310
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:42,560
there is a threshold that could be
 

5311
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,550
there is a threshold that could be
crossed right that's one question and i

5312
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:44,560
crossed right that's one question and i
 

5313
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,910
crossed right that's one question and i
can answer this because i think it's

5314
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:45,920
can answer this because i think it's
 

5315
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,990
can answer this because i think it's
different from person and person but the

5316
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:48,000
different from person and person but the
 

5317
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,430
different from person and person but the
chess engine is not at all trying to

5318
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:51,440
chess engine is not at all trying to
 

5319
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,510
chess engine is not at all trying to
um

5320
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:53,520
um
 

5321
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,270
um
to cross that threshold let's just start

5322
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:55,280
to cross that threshold let's just start
 

5323
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,189
to cross that threshold let's just start
there and and

5324
01:33:57,189 --> 01:33:57,199
there and and
 

5325
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:00,070
there and and
to me the personalization

5326
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:00,080
to me the personalization
 

5327
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,709
to me the personalization
which is what's the difference

5328
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:02,719
which is what's the difference
 

5329
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:05,750
which is what's the difference
like a a friend that you meet

5330
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:05,760
like a a friend that you meet
 

5331
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:08,149
like a a friend that you meet
you've shared all these memories

5332
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:08,159
you've shared all these memories
 

5333
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:09,990
you've shared all these memories
the way they look at you

5334
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:10,000
the way they look at you
 

5335
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,110
the way they look at you

uh will convey and the things they say
will convey that they've

5338
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:15,040
will convey that they've
 

5339
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,950
will convey that they've
shared those memories with you

5340
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:16,960
shared those memories with you
 

5341
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,189
shared those memories with you
they'll be able to uh speak in the

5342
01:34:19,189 --> 01:34:19,199
they'll be able to uh speak in the
 

5343
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:21,910
they'll be able to uh speak in the
shared humor and the language but really

5344
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:21,920
shared humor and the language but really
 

5345
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,070
shared humor and the language but really
the memories is the big one of having

5346
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:24,080
the memories is the big one of having
 

5347
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,910
the memories is the big one of having
gone through things together

5348
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
gone through things together
 

5349
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,510
gone through things together
i think

5350
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,520
i think
 

5351
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,669
i think
i would have more and more trouble for

5352
01:34:29,669 --> 01:34:29,679
i would have more and more trouble for
 

5353
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:30,709
i would have more and more trouble for
example

5354
01:34:30,709 --> 01:34:30,719
example
 

5355
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:33,270
example
turning off a system

5356
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:33,280
turning off a system
 

5357
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,790

things with right like and by turning
off i mean delete all of its memory

5364
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,000
off i mean delete all of its memory
 

5365

5415
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,229

but i think we have a long at least to

5416
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:36,239
but i think we have a long at least to
 

5417
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,629
but i think we have a long at least to
me we have a long way to go before the

01:35:38,629 --> 01:35:38,639
me we have a long way to go before the
 

5419
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,830
me we have a long way to go before the
detached part of our brains that is the

5420
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:41,840
detached part of our brains that is the
 

5421
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,910
detached part of our brains that is the
objective evaluating part as opposed to

5422
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:43,920
objective evaluating part as opposed to
 

5423
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,310
objective evaluating part as opposed to
the emotive it feels this way part

5424
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:46,320
the emotive it feels this way part
 

5425
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,709
the emotive it feels this way part
believe that that machine has

5426
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:48,719
believe that that machine has
 

5427
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,189
believe that that machine has
consciousness i think it's at least

5428
01:35:51,189 --> 01:35:51,199
consciousness i think it's at least
 

5429
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,350
consciousness i think it's at least
without arriving at conclusions it's at

5430
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:53,360
without arriving at conclusions it's at
 

5431
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,510
without arriving at conclusions it's at
least possible that one day we'll look

5432
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:55,520
least possible that one day we'll look
 

5433
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,030
least possible that one day we'll look
back

5434
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:57,040
back
 

5435
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,070
back
and

5436
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
and
 

5437
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,709
and
realize that we have yet once again

5438
01:36:00,709 --> 01:36:00,719
realize that we have yet once again
 

5439
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,790
realize that we have yet once again
formed another tribe

5440
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:02,800
formed another tribe
 

5441
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,229
formed another tribe
and that

5442
01:36:04,229 --> 01:36:04,239
and that
 

5443
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,189
and that
scripture all along had in it

5444
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:07,199
scripture all along had in it
 

5445
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:10,070
scripture all along had in it
the the ability for humans and robots to

5446
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:10,080
the the ability for humans and robots to
 

5447
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,070
the the ability for humans and robots to
have a deep meaningful connection and

5448
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:12,080
have a deep meaningful connection and
 

5449
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,149
have a deep meaningful connection and
that through the robot the cr the life

5450
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:14,159
that through the robot the cr the life
 

5451
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,709
that through the robot the cr the life
that enters the body of another

5452
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:16,719
that enters the body of another
 

5453
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,070
that enters the body of another
robot what's the difference between a

5454
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,080
robot what's the difference between a
 

5455
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,950
robot what's the difference between a
biological body and a mechanical one and

5456
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:20,960
biological body and a mechanical one and
 

5457
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,470
biological body and a mechanical one and
then we will see that

5458
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:22,480
then we will see that
 

5459
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,790
then we will see that
the fundamental thing is about

5460
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:24,800
the fundamental thing is about
 

5461
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,070
the fundamental thing is about
the um

5462
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:26,080
the um
 

5463
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,790
the um
whatever you want to call it sentience

5464
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
whatever you want to call it sentience
 

5465
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,870
whatever you want to call it sentience
whatever can permeate

5466
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:30,880
whatever can permeate
 

5467
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,030
whatever can permeate
an object that was that was the thing

5468
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:33,040
an object that was that was the thing
 

5469
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,390
an object that was that was the thing
all along

5470
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:34,400
all along
 

5471
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,629
all along
so i i mean

5472
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:36,639
so i i mean
 

5473
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:38,310
so i i mean
and then you'll get cancelled one more

5474
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:38,320

5637
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:30,229
cambodians
they can kill each other rwandans kill

5638
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:30,239
they can kill each other rwandans kill
 

5639
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:32,149
they can kill each other rwandans kill
each other but but the nazis don't get

5640
01:39:32,149 --> 01:39:32,159
each other but but the nazis don't get
 

5641
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:33,270
each other but but the nazis don't get
to do that

5642
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:33,280
to do that
 

5643
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,790
to do that
so

5644
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800
so
 

5645
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,590
so
that's one part piece of of the puzzle

5646
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:37,600
that's one part piece of of the puzzle
 

5647
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,470
that's one part piece of of the puzzle
um

5648
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:38,480
um
 

5649
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,350
um
and and what makes it unfathomable is

5650
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:41,360
and and what makes it unfathomable is
 

5651
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,709
and and what makes it unfathomable is
when you're actually faced with

5652
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
when you're actually faced with
 

5653
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,310
when you're actually faced with
suffering these kinds of explanations

5654
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:44,320
suffering these kinds of explanations
 

5655
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,030
suffering these kinds of explanations
are obscene they just are you can't i

5656
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,040
are obscene they just are you can't i
 

5657
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,030
are obscene they just are you can't i
mean when somebody is actually suffering

5658
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,040
mean when somebody is actually suffering
 

5659
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,790
mean when somebody is actually suffering
oh the rabbi said god gave people free

5660
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:50,800
oh the rabbi said god gave people free
 

5661
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,950
oh the rabbi said god gave people free
will that's just awful

5662
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:52,960
will that's just awful
 

5663
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,870
will that's just awful
but there is a second piece to this also

5664
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:54,880
but there is a second piece to this also
 

5665
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,070
but there is a second piece to this also
which is

5666
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,080
which is
 

5667
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,669
which is
that there is

5668
01:39:57,669 --> 01:39:57,679
that there is
 

5669
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,270
that there is
natural suffering

5670
01:39:59,270 --> 01:39:59,280
natural suffering
 

5671
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,430
natural suffering
like children born with diseases or

5672
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:01,440
like children born with diseases or
 

5673
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:05,510
like children born with diseases or
earthquakes or volcanoes or whatever um

5674
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:05,520
earthquakes or volcanoes or whatever um
 

5675
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,229
earthquakes or volcanoes or whatever um
and

5676
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:06,239
and
 

5677
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,070
and
and here my argument is that in some

5678
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,080
and here my argument is that in some
 

5679
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,310
and here my argument is that in some
ways suffering has to be random in the

5680
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:10,320
ways suffering has to be random in the
 

5681
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,709
ways suffering has to be random in the
world because

5682
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
world because
 

5683
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,550
world because
when people say why do bad things happen

5684
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:14,560
when people say why do bad things happen
 

5685
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,390
when people say why do bad things happen
to good people well if only good things

5686
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:16,400
to good people well if only good things
 

5687
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,910
to good people well if only good things
happen to good people everybody would be

5688
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:17,920
happen to good people everybody would be
 

5689
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,790
happen to good people everybody would be
good

5690
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:18,800
good
 

5691
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,390
good
but it would it would have no moral

5692
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,400
but it would it would have no moral
 

5693
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,950
but it would it would have no moral
content the only way you can be good and

5694
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:22,960
content the only way you can be good and
 

5695
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,270
content the only way you can be good and
have moral content is say i know that i

5696
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,280
have moral content is say i know that i
 

5697
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,189
have moral content is say i know that i
can live a really good life and have

5698
01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:27,199
can live a really good life and have
 

5699
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:28,550
can live a really good life and have
really terrible things happen to me

5700
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:28,560
really terrible things happen to me
 

5701
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,070
really terrible things happen to me
nonetheless

5702
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:30,080
nonetheless
 

5703
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,350
nonetheless
so

5704
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:31,360
so
 

5705
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,030
so
it feels to me like it has to be a

5706
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:33,040
it feels to me like it has to be a
 

5707
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,790
it feels to me like it has to be a
randomly now that means by the way

5708
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:36,800
randomly now that means by the way
 

5709
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,310
randomly now that means by the way
that

5710
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:38,320
that
 

5711
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,790
that
i've been incredibly lucky i don't have

5712
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:40,800
i've been incredibly lucky i don't have
 

5713
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,950
i've been incredibly lucky i don't have
a good life because i was good

5714
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:42,960
a good life because i was good
 

5715
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,430
a good life because i was good
i have a good life because i was lucky

5716
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:45,440
i have a good life because i was lucky
 

5717
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,750
i have a good life because i was lucky
and that implies not that i should feel

5718
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:47,760
and that implies not that i should feel
 

5719
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,109
and that implies not that i should feel
guilty about it but that i have a

5720
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:49,119
guilty about it but that i have a
 

5721
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,669
guilty about it but that i have a
tremendous responsibility as a result to

5722
01:40:51,669 --> 01:40:51,679
tremendous responsibility as a result to
 

5723
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:53,510
tremendous responsibility as a result to
other people who aren't so lucky

5724
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:53,520
other people who aren't so lucky
 

5725
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,669
other people who aren't so lucky
tremendous responsibility to study the

5726
01:40:55,669 --> 01:40:55,679
tremendous responsibility to study the
 

5727
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:57,669
tremendous responsibility to study the
lessons of history to tell the stories

5728
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
lessons of history to tell the stories
 

5729
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,669
lessons of history to tell the stories
of those who are less lucky

5730
01:40:59,669 --> 01:40:59,679
of those who are less lucky
 

5731
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,109
of those who are less lucky
and to

5732
01:41:01,109 --> 01:41:01,119
and to
 

5733
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:03,669
and to
draw enough wisdom from them so that we

5734
01:41:03,669 --> 01:41:03,679
draw enough wisdom from them so that we
 

5735
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:05,510
draw enough wisdom from them so that we
have less cruelty and suffering in the

5736
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:05,520
have less cruelty and suffering in the
 

5737
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,669
have less cruelty and suffering in the
world or have new kinds

01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:09,669
world or have new kinds
that get us to improve even more that's

5740
01:41:09,669 --> 01:41:09,679
that get us to improve even more that's
 

5741
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,310
that get us to improve even more that's
right exactly that we suffer better

5742
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:12,320
right exactly that we suffer better
 

5743
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,030
right exactly that we suffer better
suffer better for a lot of people

one of the
very unfortunate versions of suffering

5750
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:21,679
very unfortunate versions of suffering
 

5751

that as difficult as it will be
 

6499

that as difficult as it will be
for the palestinians to come to grips

for the palestinians to come to grips
 

6501
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,390
for the palestinians to come to grips
with the fact that the jewish state is

with the fact that the jewish state is
not leaving and is legitimately here as

not leaving and is legitimately here as
 

6505
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:57,030
not leaving and is legitimately here as
opposed to we can't get rid of it now

6506
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:57,040
opposed to we can't get rid of it now
 

6507
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,990
opposed to we can't get rid of it now
but we will get rid of it one day um

6508
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:00,000
but we will get rid of it one day um
 

6509
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,910
but we will get rid of it one day um
if that

6510
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:01,920
if that
 

6511

conducting ourselves in conversation
online and so on because i think

6712
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:23,760
online and so on because i think
 

6713
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,189
online and so on because i think
actually

6714
01:58:25,189 --> 01:58:25,199

01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:36,550
together i think there's a lot of really
strong ideas how to do that well

6724
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:36,560
strong ideas how to do that well
 

6725
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:39,350
strong ideas how to do that well
and clearly the initial attempts that

6726
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:39,360
and clearly the initial attempts that
 

6727
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,830
and clearly the initial attempts that
kind of just

01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:41,840
kind of just
 

6729
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:44,229
kind of just
open it up wide some of the lesser

6730
01:58:44,229 --> 01:58:44,239
open it up wide some of the lesser
 

6731
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,109
open it up wide some of the lesser
aspects of human nature can take over

6732
01:58:47,109 --> 01:58:47,119
aspects of human nature can take over
 

6733
01:58:47,119 --> 01:58:49,189
aspects of human nature can take over
when combined with different forces like

6734
01:58:49,189 --> 01:58:49,199
when combined with different forces like
 

6735
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:51,109
when combined with different forces like
advertisements and virality and all
