00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,030
it's a mathematical abstraction of
the brain I would say that's how it was

58
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
the brain I would say that's how it was

at the end of the day it's a
 

63
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:14,990
at the end of the day it's a
mathematical expression and it's a

64
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
mathematical expression and it's a
 

65
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,130
mathematical expression and it's a
fairly simple mathematical expression

66
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,140
fairly simple mathematical expression
 

67
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,950
fairly simple mathematical expression
when you get down to it it's basically a

68
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
when you get down to it it's basically a
 

69
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,649
when you get down to it it's basically a
sequence of Matrix multiplies which are

70
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,659
sequence of Matrix multiplies which are
 

71
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,870
sequence of Matrix multiplies which are
really dot products mathematically and

72
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:23,880
really dot products mathematically and
 

73
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,789
really dot products mathematically and
some nonlinearities thrown in and so

74
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:25,799
some nonlinearities thrown in and so
 

75
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,810
some nonlinearities thrown in and so
it's a very simple mathematical

76
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:26,820
it's a very simple mathematical
 

77
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,570
it's a very simple mathematical
expression and it's got knobs in it many

78
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:29,580
expression and it's got knobs in it many
 

79
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,789
expression and it's got knobs in it many
knobs many knobs and these knobs are

80
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:31,799
knobs many knobs and these knobs are
 

81
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,350
knobs many knobs and these knobs are
Loosely related to basically the

82
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
Loosely related to basically the
 

83
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,789
Loosely related to basically the
synapses in your brain they're trainable

84
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
synapses in your brain they're trainable
 

85
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,649
synapses in your brain they're trainable
they're modifiable and so the idea is

86
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:36,659
they're modifiable and so the idea is
 

87
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,090
they're modifiable and so the idea is
like we need to find the setting of The

88
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,100
like we need to find the setting of The
 

89
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,609
like we need to find the setting of The
Knobs that makes the neural nut do

00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:40,619
Knobs that makes the neural nut do
 

91
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,170
Knobs that makes the neural nut do
whatever you want it to do like classify

92
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,180
whatever you want it to do like classify
 

93
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,749
whatever you want it to do like classify
images and so on and so there's not too

94
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:44,759
images and so on and so there's not too
 

95
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,910
images and so on and so there's not too
much mystery I would say in it like

96
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:46,920
much mystery I would say in it like
 

97
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,130
much mystery I would say in it like
um you might think that basically don't

98
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,140
um you might think that basically don't
 

99
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,270
um you might think that basically don't
want to endow it with too much meaning

100
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,280
want to endow it with too much meaning
 

101
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,310
want to endow it with too much meaning
with respect to the brain and how it

102
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
with respect to the brain and how it
 

103
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,109
with respect to the brain and how it
works it's really just a complicated

104
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:54,119
works it's really just a complicated
 

105
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,730
works it's really just a complicated
mathematical expression with knobs and

106
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:55,740
mathematical expression with knobs and
 

107
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,830
mathematical expression with knobs and
those knobs need a proper setting for it

108
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
those knobs need a proper setting for it
 

109
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,749
those knobs need a proper setting for it
to do something uh desirable yeah but

110
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
to do something uh desirable yeah but
 

111
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,149
to do something uh desirable yeah but
poetry is just the collection of letters

112
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
poetry is just the collection of letters
 

113
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,670
poetry is just the collection of letters
with spaces but it can make us feel a

114
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:04,680
with spaces but it can make us feel a
 

115
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,410
with spaces but it can make us feel a
certain way and in that same way when

116
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,420
certain way and in that same way when
 

117
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,150
certain way and in that same way when
you get a large number of knobs together

118
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
you get a large number of knobs together
 

119
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,150
you get a large number of knobs together
whether it's in a inside the brain or

120
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,160
whether it's in a inside the brain or
 

121
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,910
whether it's in a inside the brain or
inside a computer they seem to they seem

122
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
inside a computer they seem to they seem
 

123
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,830
inside a computer they seem to they seem
to surprise us with the with their power

124
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
to surprise us with the with their power
 

125
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,050
to surprise us with the with their power
yeah I think that's fair so basically

126
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,060
yeah I think that's fair so basically
 

127
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,990
yeah I think that's fair so basically
I'm underselling it by a lot because you

128
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm underselling it by a lot because you
 

129
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,030
I'm underselling it by a lot because you
definitely do get very surprising

130
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
definitely do get very surprising
 

131
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,130
definitely do get very surprising
emergent behaviors out of these neurons

132
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,140
emergent behaviors out of these neurons
 

133
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,869
emergent behaviors out of these neurons
when they're large enough and trained on

134
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
when they're large enough and trained on
 

135
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,390
when they're large enough and trained on
complicated enough problems like say for

136
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,400
complicated enough problems like say for
 

137
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,729
complicated enough problems like say for
example the next uh word prediction in a

138
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:31,739
example the next uh word prediction in a
 

139
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,010
example the next uh word prediction in a
massive data set from the internet and

140
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,020
massive data set from the internet and
 

141
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,869
massive data set from the internet and
then these neurons take on a pretty

142
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:35,879
then these neurons take on a pretty
 

143
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,150
then these neurons take on a pretty
surprising magical properties yeah I

144
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
surprising magical properties yeah I
 

145
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,350
surprising magical properties yeah I
think it's kind of interesting how much

146
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
think it's kind of interesting how much
 

147
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,089
think it's kind of interesting how much
you can get out of even very simple

148
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:41,099
you can get out of even very simple
 

149
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,070
you can get out of even very simple
mathematical formalism when your brain

150
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,080
mathematical formalism when your brain
 

151
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,290
mathematical formalism when your brain
right now I was talking is it doing next

152
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:45,300
right now I was talking is it doing next
 

153
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,089
right now I was talking is it doing next
word prediction

154
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:47,099
word prediction
 

155
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,410
word prediction
or is it doing something more

156
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:48,420
or is it doing something more
 

157
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,210
or is it doing something more
interesting well definitely some kind of

158
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,220
interesting well definitely some kind of
 

159
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,550
interesting well definitely some kind of
a generative model that's a gpt-like and

160
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
a generative model that's a gpt-like and
 

161
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,350
a generative model that's a gpt-like and
prompted by you

162
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:54,360
prompted by you
 

163
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,970
prompted by you
um yeah so you're giving me a prompt and

164
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:55,980
um yeah so you're giving me a prompt and
 

165
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,949
um yeah so you're giving me a prompt and
I'm kind of like responding to it in a

166
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:57,959
I'm kind of like responding to it in a
 

167
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,530
I'm kind of like responding to it in a
generative way and by yourself perhaps a

168
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:00,540
generative way and by yourself perhaps a
 

169
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,110
generative way and by yourself perhaps a
little bit like are you adding extra

170
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
little bit like are you adding extra
 

171
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,390
little bit like are you adding extra
prompts from your own memory inside your

172
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:05,400
prompts from your own memory inside your
 

173
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,369
prompts from your own memory inside your
head

174
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:06,379
head
 

175
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,910
head
automatically feels like you're

176
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
automatically feels like you're
 

177
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,530
automatically feels like you're
referencing some kind of a declarative

178
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:09,540
referencing some kind of a declarative
 

179
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,710
referencing some kind of a declarative
structure of like memory and so on and

180
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
structure of like memory and so on and
 

181
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,630
structure of like memory and so on and
then uh you're putting that together

182
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
then uh you're putting that together
 

183
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,850
then uh you're putting that together
with your prompt and giving away some

184
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:16,860
with your prompt and giving away some
 

185
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,770
with your prompt and giving away some
messages like how much of what you just

186
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:18,780
messages like how much of what you just
 

187
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,710
messages like how much of what you just
said has been said by you before

188
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:21,720
said has been said by you before
 

189
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,130
said has been said by you before
uh nothing basically right no but if you

190
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,140
uh nothing basically right no but if you
 

191
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,330
uh nothing basically right no but if you
actually look at all the words you've

192
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:26,340
actually look at all the words you've
 

193
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,430
actually look at all the words you've
ever said in your life and you do a

194
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,440
ever said in your life and you do a
 

195
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,490
ever said in your life and you do a
search you'll probably said a lot of the

196
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,500
search you'll probably said a lot of the
 

197
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,430
search you'll probably said a lot of the
same words in the same order before yeah

198
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:34,440
same words in the same order before yeah
 

199
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,470
same words in the same order before yeah
it could be I mean I'm using phrases

200
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
it could be I mean I'm using phrases
 

201
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,509
it could be I mean I'm using phrases
that are common Etc but I'm remixing it

202
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:38,519
that are common Etc but I'm remixing it
 

203
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,390
that are common Etc but I'm remixing it
into a pretty uh sort of unique sentence

204
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
into a pretty uh sort of unique sentence
 

205
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,530
into a pretty uh sort of unique sentence
at the end of the day but you're right

206
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:42,540
at the end of the day but you're right
 

207
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,670
at the end of the day but you're right
definitely there's like a ton of

208
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
definitely there's like a ton of
 

209
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,789
definitely there's like a ton of
remixing what you didn't you it's like

210
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
remixing what you didn't you it's like
 

211
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,570
remixing what you didn't you it's like
Magnus Carlsen said uh I'm I'm rated

212
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:49,580
Magnus Carlsen said uh I'm I'm rated
 

213
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,670
Magnus Carlsen said uh I'm I'm rated
2900 whatever which is pretty decent I

214
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
2900 whatever which is pretty decent I
 

215
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,729
2900 whatever which is pretty decent I
think you're talking very uh you're not

216
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:55,739
think you're talking very uh you're not
 

217
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,550
think you're talking very uh you're not
giving enough credit to neural Nets here

218
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:57,560
giving enough credit to neural Nets here

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,649
giving enough credit to neural Nets here
why do they seem to

220
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:00,659
why do they seem to
 

221
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,050
why do they seem to
what's your best intuition

222
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,060
what's your best intuition
 

223
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,990
what's your best intuition
about this emergent Behavior I mean it's

224
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
about this emergent Behavior I mean it's
 

225
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,890
about this emergent Behavior I mean it's
kind of interesting because I'm

226
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:06,900
kind of interesting because I'm
 

227
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,289
kind of interesting because I'm
simultaneously underselling them but I

228
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:09,299
simultaneously underselling them but I
 

229
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,309
simultaneously underselling them but I
also feel like there's an element to

230
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
also feel like there's an element to
 

231
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,289
also feel like there's an element to
which I'm over like it's actually kind

232
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:12,299
which I'm over like it's actually kind
 

233
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,729
which I'm over like it's actually kind
of incredible that you can get so much

234
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:13,739
of incredible that you can get so much
 

235
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,170
of incredible that you can get so much
emergent magical Behavior out of them

236
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,180
emergent magical Behavior out of them
 

237
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,430
emergent magical Behavior out of them
despite them being so simple

238
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:16,440
despite them being so simple
 

239
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,409
despite them being so simple
mathematically so I think those are kind

240
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:18,419
mathematically so I think those are kind
 

241
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,090
mathematically so I think those are kind
of like two surprising statements that

242
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,100
of like two surprising statements that
 

243
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,550
of like two surprising statements that
are kind of just juxtapose together

244
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
are kind of just juxtapose together
 

245
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,350
are kind of just juxtapose together
and I think basically what it is is we

246
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,360
and I think basically what it is is we
 

247
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,909
and I think basically what it is is we
are actually fairly good at optimizing

248
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
are actually fairly good at optimizing
 

249
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,129
are actually fairly good at optimizing
these neural Nets and when you give them

250
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:28,139
these neural Nets and when you give them
 

251
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,770
these neural Nets and when you give them
a hard enough problem they are forced to

252
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:30,780
a hard enough problem they are forced to
 

253
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,110
a hard enough problem they are forced to
learn very interesting Solutions in the

254
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
learn very interesting Solutions in the
 

255
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,210
learn very interesting Solutions in the
optimization and those solution

256
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,220
optimization and those solution
 

257
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,189
optimization and those solution
basically have these immersion

258
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
basically have these immersion
 

259
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,330
basically have these immersion
properties that are very interesting

260
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,340
properties that are very interesting
 

261
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,090
properties that are very interesting
there's wisdom and knowledge

262
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,100
there's wisdom and knowledge
 

263
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,270
there's wisdom and knowledge
in the knobs

264
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
in the knobs
 

265
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,189
in the knobs
and so what's this representation that's

266
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:46,199
and so what's this representation that's
 

267
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,950
and so what's this representation that's
in the knobs does it make sense to you

268
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
in the knobs does it make sense to you
 

269
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,990
in the knobs does it make sense to you
intuitively the large number of knobs

270
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,000
intuitively the large number of knobs
 

271
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,030
intuitively the large number of knobs
can hold the representation that

272
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
can hold the representation that
 

273
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,850
can hold the representation that
captures some deep wisdom about the data

274
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:55,860
captures some deep wisdom about the data
 

275
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,409
captures some deep wisdom about the data
it has looked at

276
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:57,419
it has looked at
 

277
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,689
it has looked at
it's a lot of knobs it's a lot of knobs

278
00:04:59,689 --> 00:04:59,699
it's a lot of knobs it's a lot of knobs
 

279
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,330
it's a lot of knobs it's a lot of knobs
and somehow you know so speaking

280
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,340
and somehow you know so speaking
 

281
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,350
and somehow you know so speaking
concretely

concretely
um one of the neural Nets that people

284
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:04,740
um one of the neural Nets that people
 

285
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,469
um one of the neural Nets that people
are very excited about right now are are

286
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
are very excited about right now are are
 

287
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,930
are very excited about right now are are
gpts which are basically just next word

prediction networks so you consume a

290
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
prediction networks so you consume a
 

291
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,909
prediction networks so you consume a
sequence of words from the internet and

292
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
sequence of words from the internet and
 

293
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,150
sequence of words from the internet and
you try to predict the next word and uh

294
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,160
you try to predict the next word and uh
 

295
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,189
you try to predict the next word and uh
once you train these on a large enough

296
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
once you train these on a large enough
 

297
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,330
once you train these on a large enough
data set

298
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:20,340
data set
 

299
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,510
data set
um they you can basically uh prompt

300
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
um they you can basically uh prompt
 

301
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,830
um they you can basically uh prompt
these neural amounts in arbitrary ways

302
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:24,840
these neural amounts in arbitrary ways
 

303
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,969
these neural amounts in arbitrary ways
and you can ask them to solve problems

304
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:25,979
and you can ask them to solve problems
 

305
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,189
and you can ask them to solve problems
and they will so you can just tell them

306
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:28,199
and they will so you can just tell them
 

307
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,930
and they will so you can just tell them
you can you can make it look like you're

308
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:29,940
you can you can make it look like you're
 

309
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,790
you can you can make it look like you're
trying to um

310
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:31,800
trying to um
 

311
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,170
trying to um
solve some kind of a mathematical

312
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,180
solve some kind of a mathematical
 

313
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,610
solve some kind of a mathematical
problem and they will continue what they

314
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:34,620
problem and they will continue what they
 

315
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,870
problem and they will continue what they
think is the solution based on what

316
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:35,880
think is the solution based on what
 

317
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,550
think is the solution based on what
they've seen on the internet and very

318
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,560
they've seen on the internet and very
 

319
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,110
they've seen on the internet and very
often those Solutions look very

320
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
often those Solutions look very
 

321
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,390
often those Solutions look very
remarkably consistent look correct

322
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400
remarkably consistent look correct
 

323
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,830
remarkably consistent look correct

do you still think about the brain side

326
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
do you still think about the brain side
 

327
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,150
do you still think about the brain side
of it so as neural Nets is an

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
of the brain you still draw wisdom
 

333
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,150
of the brain you still draw wisdom
from from the biological neural networks

334
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
from from the biological neural networks
 

335
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,249
from from the biological neural networks
or even the bigger question so you're a

336
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:58,259
or even the bigger question so you're a
 

337
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,110
or even the bigger question so you're a
big fan of biology and biological

338
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,120
big fan of biology and biological
 

339
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,150

341
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,790

what impressive thing is biology do

342
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
what impressive thing is biology do
 

343
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,730
what impressive thing is biology do
doing to you that computers are not yet

344
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:07,740
doing to you that computers are not yet
 

345
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,610
doing to you that computers are not yet
that Gap I would say I'm definitely on

346
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:10,620
that Gap I would say I'm definitely on
 

347
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,290
that Gap I would say I'm definitely on
I'm much more hesitant with the

348
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,300
I'm much more hesitant with the
 

349
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,029
I'm much more hesitant with the
analogies to the brain than I think you

350
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:14,039
analogies to the brain than I think you
 

351
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,710
analogies to the brain than I think you
would see potentially in the field

352
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:15,720
would see potentially in the field
 

353
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,350
would see potentially in the field
um and I kind of feel like

354
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,360
um and I kind of feel like
 

355
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,749
um and I kind of feel like
certainly the way neural network started

356
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:20,759
certainly the way neural network started
 

357
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,090
certainly the way neural network started
is everything stemmed from inspiration

358
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,100
is everything stemmed from inspiration
 

359
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,070
is everything stemmed from inspiration
by the brain but at the end of the day

360
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,080
by the brain but at the end of the day
 

361
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,510
by the brain but at the end of the day
the artifacts that you get after

362
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520
the artifacts that you get after
 

363
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,909
the artifacts that you get after
training they are arrived at by a very

364
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:28,919
training they are arrived at by a very
 

365
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,290
training they are arrived at by a very
different optimization process than the

366
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:30,300
different optimization process than the
 

367
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,909
different optimization process than the
optimization process that gave rise to

368
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
optimization process that gave rise to
 

369
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,909
optimization process that gave rise to
the brain and so I think uh

370
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:34,919
the brain and so I think uh
 

371
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,770
the brain and so I think uh
I kind of think of it as a very

372
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:36,780
I kind of think of it as a very
 

373
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,749
I kind of think of it as a very
complicated alien artifact

374
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:38,759
complicated alien artifact
 

375
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,249
complicated alien artifact
um it's something different I'm not

376
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:40,259
um it's something different I'm not
 

377
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,570
um it's something different I'm not
sorry the uh the neuralness that we're

378
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:41,580
sorry the uh the neuralness that we're
 

379
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,150
sorry the uh the neuralness that we're
training okay they are complicated uh

380
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
training okay they are complicated uh
 

381
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,430
training okay they are complicated uh
Alien artifact uh I do not make

382
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,440
Alien artifact uh I do not make
 

383
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,870
Alien artifact uh I do not make
analogies to the brain because I think

384
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:47,880
analogies to the brain because I think
 

385
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,610
analogies to the brain because I think
the optimization process that gave rise

386
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,620
the optimization process that gave rise
 

387
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,230
the optimization process that gave rise
to it is very different from the brain

388
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240
to it is very different from the brain
 

389
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,689
to it is very different from the brain
so there was no multi-agent self-play

390
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:53,699
so there was no multi-agent self-play
 

391
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,590
so there was no multi-agent self-play
kind of uh setup uh and evolution it was

392
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,600
kind of uh setup uh and evolution it was
 

393
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,689
kind of uh setup uh and evolution it was
an optimization that is basically a what

394
00:06:59,689 --> 00:06:59,699
an optimization that is basically a what
 

395
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,450
an optimization that is basically a what
amounts to a compression objective on a

396
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:02,460
amounts to a compression objective on a
 

397
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,129
amounts to a compression objective on a
massive amount of data okay so

398
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:04,139
massive amount of data okay so
 

399
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,870
massive amount of data okay so
artificial neural networks are doing

400
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:05,880
artificial neural networks are doing
 

401
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,070
artificial neural networks are doing
compression

402
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,080
compression
 

403
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,249
compression
and biological neural networks

404
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:10,259
and biological neural networks
 

405
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,110
and biological neural networks
are not to survive and they're not

406
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120
are not to survive and they're not
 

407
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,790
are not to survive and they're not
really doing any they're they're an

408
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:13,800
really doing any they're they're an
 

409
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,790
really doing any they're they're an
agent in a multi-agent self-place system

410
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
agent in a multi-agent self-place system
 

411
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,950
agent in a multi-agent self-place system
that's been running for a very very long

412
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
that's been running for a very very long
 

413
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,589
that's been running for a very very long
time that said Evolution has found that

414
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
time that said Evolution has found that
 

415
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,830
time that said Evolution has found that
it is very useful to to predict and have

416
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:24,840
it is very useful to to predict and have
 

417
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,050
it is very useful to to predict and have
a predictive model in the brain and so I

418
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,060
a predictive model in the brain and so I
 

419
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,909
a predictive model in the brain and so I
think our brain utilizes something that

420
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
think our brain utilizes something that
 

421
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,730
think our brain utilizes something that
looks like that as a part of it but it

422
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:31,740
looks like that as a part of it but it
 

423
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,350
looks like that as a part of it but it
has a lot more you know gadgets and

424
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
has a lot more you know gadgets and
 

425
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,110
has a lot more you know gadgets and
gizmos and uh value functions and

426
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
gizmos and uh value functions and
 

427
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,210
gizmos and uh value functions and
ancient nuclei that are all trying to

428
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,220
ancient nuclei that are all trying to
 

429
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,890
ancient nuclei that are all trying to
like make a survive and reproduce and

430
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:39,900
like make a survive and reproduce and
 

431
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,749
like make a survive and reproduce and
everything else and the whole thing

432
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
everything else and the whole thing
 

433
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,909
everything else and the whole thing
through embryogenesis is built from a

434
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
through embryogenesis is built from a
 

435
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,610
through embryogenesis is built from a
single cell I mean it's just the code is

436
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:46,620
single cell I mean it's just the code is
 

437
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,370
single cell I mean it's just the code is
inside the DNA and it just builds it up

438
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,380
inside the DNA and it just builds it up
 

439
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,010
inside the DNA and it just builds it up
like the entire organism

440
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,020

 

441
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,529

yes and like it does it pretty well

442
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:57,539
yes and like it does it pretty well
 

443
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,689
yes and like it does it pretty well
it should not be possible so there's

444
00:07:59,689 --> 00:07:59,699
it should not be possible so there's
 

445
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,249
it should not be possible so there's
some learning going on there's some

446
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:01,259
some learning going on there's some
 

447
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,689
some learning going on there's some
there's some there's some kind of

448
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:02,699
there's some there's some kind of
 

449
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,070
there's some there's some kind of
computation going through that building

450
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
computation going through that building
 

451
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,909
computation going through that building
process I mean I I don't know where

452
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
process I mean I I don't know where
 

453
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,950

if you were just to look at the entirety
 

455
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,749
if you were just to look at the entirety
of history of life on Earth

456
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
of history of life on Earth
 

457
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,850
of history of life on Earth
where do you think is the most

458
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:13,860
where do you think is the most
 

459
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,070
where do you think is the most
interesting invention is it the origin

460
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
interesting invention is it the origin
 

461
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,510
interesting invention is it the origin
of life itself

462
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
of life itself
 

463
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,249
of life itself
is it just jumping to eukaryotes is it

464
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:21,259
is it just jumping to eukaryotes is it
 

465
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,689
is it just jumping to eukaryotes is it
mammals is it humans themselves Homo

466
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:23,699
mammals is it humans themselves Homo
 

467
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,230
mammals is it humans themselves Homo
sapiens the the origin of intelligence

468
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,240
sapiens the the origin of intelligence
 

469
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,909
sapiens the the origin of intelligence
or highly complex intelligence

470
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:30,919
or highly complex intelligence
 

471
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,529
or highly complex intelligence
or or is it all just in continuation the

472
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:33,539
or or is it all just in continuation the
 

473
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,750
or or is it all just in continuation the
same kind of process

474
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
same kind of process
 

475
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,550
same kind of process
certainly I would say it's an extremely

476
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
certainly I would say it's an extremely
 

477
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,829
certainly I would say it's an extremely
remarkable story that I'm only like

478
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
remarkable story that I'm only like
 

479
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,870
remarkable story that I'm only like
briefly learning about recently all the

480
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:41,880
briefly learning about recently all the
 

481
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,829
briefly learning about recently all the
way from

482
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:42,839
way from
 

483
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,810
way from
um actually like you almost have to

484
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:44,820
um actually like you almost have to
 

485
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,730
um actually like you almost have to
start at the formation of Earth and all

486
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:46,740
start at the formation of Earth and all
 

487
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,110
start at the formation of Earth and all
of its conditions and the entire solar

488
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,120
of its conditions and the entire solar
 

489
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,370
of its conditions and the entire solar
system and how everything is arranged

490
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:49,380
system and how everything is arranged
 

491
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,829
system and how everything is arranged
with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable

492
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable
 

493
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,230
with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable
zone and everything and then you have an

494
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
zone and everything and then you have an
 

495
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,430
zone and everything and then you have an
active Earth

496
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
active Earth
 

497
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,410
active Earth
that's turning over material

498
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:57,420
that's turning over material
 

499
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,949
that's turning over material
and um and then you start with a

500
00:08:59,949 --> 00:08:59,959
and um and then you start with a
 

501
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,269
and um and then you start with a
biogenesis and everything and so it's

502
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:02,279
biogenesis and everything and so it's
 

503
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,190
biogenesis and everything and so it's
all like a pretty remarkable story I'm

504
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:04,200
all like a pretty remarkable story I'm
 

505
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,449
all like a pretty remarkable story I'm
not sure that

506
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:05,459
not sure that
 

507
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,690
not sure that
I can pick like a single Unique Piece of

508
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:08,700
I can pick like a single Unique Piece of
 

509
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,090
I can pick like a single Unique Piece of
it that I find most interesting

510
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,100
it that I find most interesting
 

511
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,110
it that I find most interesting
um

512
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,120
um
 

513
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,670
um
I guess for me as an artificial

514
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
I guess for me as an artificial
 

515
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,810
I guess for me as an artificial
intelligence researcher it's probably

516
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:14,820
intelligence researcher it's probably
 

517
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,430
intelligence researcher it's probably
the last piece we have lots of animals

518
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:16,440
the last piece we have lots of animals
 

519
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,550
the last piece we have lots of animals
that uh you know are are not building

520
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:19,560
that uh you know are are not building
 

521
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,150
that uh you know are are not building
technological Society but we do and um

522
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,160
technological Society but we do and um
 

523
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,650
technological Society but we do and um
it seems to have happened very quickly

524
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:24,660
it seems to have happened very quickly
 

525
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,230
it seems to have happened very quickly
it seems to have happened very recently

526
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
it seems to have happened very recently
 

527
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,130
it seems to have happened very recently
and uh

528
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,140
and uh
 

529
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,329
and uh
something very interesting happened

530
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:29,339
something very interesting happened
 

531
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,310
something very interesting happened
there that I don't fully understand I

532
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:31,320
there that I don't fully understand I
 

533
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,750
there that I don't fully understand I
almost understand everything else kind

534
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:32,760
almost understand everything else kind
 

535
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,090
almost understand everything else kind
of I think intuitively uh but I don't

536
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,100
of I think intuitively uh but I don't
 

537
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,070
of I think intuitively uh but I don't
understand exactly that part and how

538
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,080
understand exactly that part and how
 

539
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,710
understand exactly that part and how
quick it was both explanations would be

540
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:39,720
quick it was both explanations would be
 

541
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,690
quick it was both explanations would be
interesting one is that this is just a

542
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:41,700
interesting one is that this is just a
 

543
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,190
interesting one is that this is just a
continuation of the same kind of process

544
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
continuation of the same kind of process
 

545
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,810
continuation of the same kind of process
there's nothing special about humans

546
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:44,820
there's nothing special about humans
 

547
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,690
there's nothing special about humans
that would be deeply understanding that

548
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:47,700
that would be deeply understanding that
 

549
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,730
that would be deeply understanding that
would be very interesting that we think

550
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:49,740
would be very interesting that we think
 

551
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,889
would be very interesting that we think
of ourselves as special but it was

552
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:51,899
of ourselves as special but it was
 

553
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,070
of ourselves as special but it was
obvious all it was already written in

554
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,080
obvious all it was already written in
 

555
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,449
obvious all it was already written in
the in the code that you would have

556
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:58,459
the in the code that you would have
 

557
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,410
the in the code that you would have
greater and greater intelligence

558
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:00,420
greater and greater intelligence
 

559
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,650
greater and greater intelligence
emerging and then the other explanation

560
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:03,660
emerging and then the other explanation
 

561
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,090
emerging and then the other explanation
which is something truly special

562
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,100
which is something truly special
 

563
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,509
which is something truly special
happened something like a rare event

564
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
happened something like a rare event
 

565
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,430
happened something like a rare event
whether it's like crazy rare event like

566
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:10,440
whether it's like crazy rare event like
 

567
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,130
whether it's like crazy rare event like
uh Space Odyssey what would it be see if

568
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,140
uh Space Odyssey what would it be see if
 

569
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,889
uh Space Odyssey what would it be see if
you say like the invention of Fire

570
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:15,899
you say like the invention of Fire
 

571
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,449
you say like the invention of Fire
or

572
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:17,459
or
 

573
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,829
or
the uh as Richard rangham says the beta

574
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
the uh as Richard rangham says the beta
 

575
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,470

males deciding a clever way to kill the

576
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
males deciding a clever way to kill the
 

577
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,230
males deciding a clever way to kill the
alpha males by collaborating so just

578
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,240
alpha males by collaborating so just
 

579
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,509
alpha males by collaborating so just
optimizing the collaborations really the

580
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
optimizing the collaborations really the
 

581
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,430
optimizing the collaborations really the
multi-agent aspect of the multi-agent

582
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
multi-agent aspect of the multi-agent
 

583
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,310
multi-agent aspect of the multi-agent
and that really being constrained on

584
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
and that really being constrained on
 

585
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,710
and that really being constrained on
resources and trying to survive

586
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
resources and trying to survive
 

587
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,050
resources and trying to survive
the collaboration aspect is what created

588
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,060
the collaboration aspect is what created
 

589
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,449
the collaboration aspect is what created
the complex intelligence but it seems

590
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:41,459
the complex intelligence but it seems
 

591
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,250
the complex intelligence but it seems
like it's a natural outgrowth of the

592
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,260
like it's a natural outgrowth of the
 

593
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,050
like it's a natural outgrowth of the
evolution process like what could

594
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,060
evolution process like what could
 

595
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,329
evolution process like what could
possibly be a magical thing that

596
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:47,339
possibly be a magical thing that
 

597
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,790
possibly be a magical thing that
happened like a rare thing that would

598
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:49,800
happened like a rare thing that would
 

599
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,190
happened like a rare thing that would
say that humans are actually human level

600
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,200
say that humans are actually human level
 

601
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,870
say that humans are actually human level
intelligence is actually a really rare

602
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
intelligence is actually a really rare
 

603
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,630
intelligence is actually a really rare
thing in the universe

604
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
thing in the universe
 

605
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,370
thing in the universe
yeah I'm hesitant to say that it is rare

606
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:58,380
yeah I'm hesitant to say that it is rare
 

607
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,829
yeah I'm hesitant to say that it is rare
by the way but it definitely seems like

608
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:00,839
by the way but it definitely seems like
 

609
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:01,970
by the way but it definitely seems like
it's kind of like a punctuated

610
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:01,980
it's kind of like a punctuated
 

611
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,490
it's kind of like a punctuated
equilibrium where you have lots of

612
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:04,500
equilibrium where you have lots of
 

613
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,750
equilibrium where you have lots of
exploration and then you have certain

614
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
exploration and then you have certain
 

615
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,389
exploration and then you have certain
leaps sparse leaps in between so of

616
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
leaps sparse leaps in between so of
 

617
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,370
leaps sparse leaps in between so of
course like origin of life would be one

618
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,380
course like origin of life would be one
 

619
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,850
course like origin of life would be one
um you know DNA sex eukaryotic system

620
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:13,860
um you know DNA sex eukaryotic system
 

621
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,829
um you know DNA sex eukaryotic system
eukaryotic life

622
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
eukaryotic life
 

623
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,750
eukaryotic life
um the endosymbiosis event or the

624
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
um the endosymbiosis event or the
 

625
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,269
um the endosymbiosis event or the
archaeon 8 little bacteria you know just

626
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:20,279
archaeon 8 little bacteria you know just
 

627
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,230
archaeon 8 little bacteria you know just
the whole thing and then of course

628
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,240
the whole thing and then of course
 

629
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,810
the whole thing and then of course
emergence of Consciousness and so on so

630
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:23,820
emergence of Consciousness and so on so
 

631
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,069
emergence of Consciousness and so on so
it seems like definitely there are

632
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:25,079
it seems like definitely there are
 

633
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,630
it seems like definitely there are
sparse events where mass amount of

634
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
sparse events where mass amount of
 

635
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,130
sparse events where mass amount of
progress was made but yeah it's kind of

636
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,140
progress was made but yeah it's kind of
 

637
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,290
progress was made but yeah it's kind of
hard to pick one so you don't think

638
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:30,300
hard to pick one so you don't think
 

639
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,710
hard to pick one so you don't think
humans are unique gotta ask you how many

640
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:33,720
humans are unique gotta ask you how many
 

641
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,569
humans are unique gotta ask you how many
intelligent aliens civilizations do you

642
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:35,579
intelligent aliens civilizations do you
 

643
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,690
intelligent aliens civilizations do you
think are out there and uh is there

644
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:38,700
think are out there and uh is there
 

645
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,550
think are out there and uh is there
intelligence

646
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
intelligence
 

647
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,970
intelligence
different or similar to ours

648
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:43,980
different or similar to ours
 

649
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,329
different or similar to ours
yeah I've been preoccupied with this

650
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:47,339
yeah I've been preoccupied with this
 

651
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,769
yeah I've been preoccupied with this
question quite a bit recently uh

652
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:48,779
question quite a bit recently uh
 

653
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,630
question quite a bit recently uh
basically the for me Paradox and just

654
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,640
basically the for me Paradox and just
 

655
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,310
basically the for me Paradox and just
thinking through and and the reason

656
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
thinking through and and the reason
 

657
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,009
thinking through and and the reason
actually that I am very interested in uh

658
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:55,019
actually that I am very interested in uh
 

659
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,269
actually that I am very interested in uh
the origin of life is fundamentally

660
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:56,279
the origin of life is fundamentally
 

661
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,130
the origin of life is fundamentally
trying to understand how common it is

662
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,140
trying to understand how common it is
 

663
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,449
trying to understand how common it is
that there are technological societies

664
00:11:59,449 --> 00:11:59,459
that there are technological societies
 

665
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,850
that there are technological societies
out there uh

666
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:01,860
out there uh
 

667
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,610
out there uh
um in space and the more I study it the

668
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:04,620
um in space and the more I study it the
 

669
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,310
um in space and the more I study it the
more I think that um

670
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,320
more I think that um
 

671
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,290
more I think that um
uh there should be quite a few quite a

672
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:09,300
uh there should be quite a few quite a
 

673
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,850
uh there should be quite a few quite a
lot why haven't we heard from them

674
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:10,860
lot why haven't we heard from them
 

675
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,790
lot why haven't we heard from them
because I I agree with you it feels like

676
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
because I I agree with you it feels like
 

677
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,769
because I I agree with you it feels like
I just don't see

678
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:15,779
I just don't see
 

679
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,190
I just don't see
why what we did here on Earth is so

680
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
why what we did here on Earth is so
 

681
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,870
why what we did here on Earth is so
difficult to do yeah and especially when

682
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
difficult to do yeah and especially when
 

683
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,370
difficult to do yeah and especially when
you get into the details of it I used to

684
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:22,380
you get into the details of it I used to
 

685
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,650
you get into the details of it I used to
think origin of life was very

686
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:24,660
think origin of life was very
 

687
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,550
think origin of life was very
um

688
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:25,560
um
 

689
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,590
um
it was this magical rare event but then

690
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
it was this magical rare event but then
 

691
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,110
it was this magical rare event but then
you read books like for example McLean

692
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,120
you read books like for example McLean
 

693
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,170
you read books like for example McLean
um uh the vital question a life

694
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,180
um uh the vital question a life
 

695
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,630
um uh the vital question a life

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,260
not that rare basic chemistry you have
 

701
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,269
not that rare basic chemistry you have

an active Earth and you have your
 

703
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,829
an active Earth and you have your
alkaline Vents and you have lots of

704
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:42,839
alkaline Vents and you have lots of
 

705
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,930

pockets of these alkaline vents that
 

713
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,210

pieces you start to understand that
 

719
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,090
pieces you start to understand that
actually this is not that crazy you

720
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,100
actually this is not that crazy you
 

721
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,370
actually this is not that crazy you
could see this happen on other systems

722
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:01,380
could see this happen on other systems

um and he really takes you from just a

724
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,260
um and he really takes you from just a
 

725
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,949
um and he really takes you from just a
geology to primitive life and he makes

726
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
geology to primitive life and he makes
 

727
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,509
geology to primitive life and he makes
it feel like it's actually pretty

728
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:08,519
it feel like it's actually pretty
 

729
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,670
it feel like it's actually pretty
plausible and also like the origin of

730
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:10,680
plausible and also like the origin of
 

731
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,509
plausible and also like the origin of
life

732
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
life
 

733
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,569
life
um didn't uh was actually fairly fast

734
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:14,579
um didn't uh was actually fairly fast
 

735
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,430
um didn't uh was actually fairly fast
after formation of Earth

736
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:16,440
after formation of Earth
 

737
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,170
after formation of Earth
um if I remember correctly just a few

738
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,180
um if I remember correctly just a few
 

739
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,250
um if I remember correctly just a few
hundred million years or something like

740
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,260
hundred million years or something like
 

741
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,569
hundred million years or something like
that after basically when it was

742
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:20,579
that after basically when it was
 

743
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,910
that after basically when it was
possible life actually arose and so that

744
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:22,920
possible life actually arose and so that
 

745
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,350
possible life actually arose and so that
makes me feel like that is not the

746
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,360
makes me feel like that is not the
 

747
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,970
makes me feel like that is not the
constraint that is not the limiting

748
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:25,980
constraint that is not the limiting
 

749
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,110
constraint that is not the limiting
variable and that life should actually

750
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
variable and that life should actually
 

751
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,389
variable and that life should actually
be fairly common

752
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:29,399
be fairly common
 

753
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,190
be fairly common
um and then it you know where the

754
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
um and then it you know where the
 

755
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,590
um and then it you know where the
drop-offs are is very

756
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
drop-offs are is very
 

757
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,750
drop-offs are is very
um is very interesting to think about I

758
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
um is very interesting to think about I
 

759
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,190
um is very interesting to think about I
currently think that there's no major

760
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
currently think that there's no major
 

761
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,990
currently think that there's no major
drop-offs basically and so there should

762
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,000
drop-offs basically and so there should
 

763
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,030
drop-offs basically and so there should
be quite a lot of life and basically

764
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
be quite a lot of life and basically
 

765
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,069
be quite a lot of life and basically
what it where that brings me to then is

766
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:43,079
what it where that brings me to then is
 

767
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,629
what it where that brings me to then is
the only way to reconcile the fact that

768
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
the only way to reconcile the fact that
 

769
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,430
the only way to reconcile the fact that
we haven't found anyone and so on is

770
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:46,440
we haven't found anyone and so on is
 

771
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,370
we haven't found anyone and so on is
that um we just can't we can't see them

772
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:49,380
that um we just can't we can't see them
 

773
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,590
that um we just can't we can't see them
we can't observe them just a quick brief

774
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
we can't observe them just a quick brief
 

775
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,030
we can't observe them just a quick brief
comment Nick Lane and a lot of

776
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
comment Nick Lane and a lot of
 

777
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,610
comment Nick Lane and a lot of
biologists I talked to they really seem

778
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:55,620
biologists I talked to they really seem
 

779
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,490
biologists I talked to they really seem
to think that the jump from bacteria to

780
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:58,500
to think that the jump from bacteria to
 

781
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,470
to think that the jump from bacteria to
more complex organisms is the hardest

782
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
more complex organisms is the hardest
 

783
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,530
more complex organisms is the hardest
jump the eukaryotic glyphosis yeah which

784
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:03,540
jump the eukaryotic glyphosis yeah which
 

785
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,710
jump the eukaryotic glyphosis yeah which
I don't I get it they're much more

786
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
I don't I get it they're much more
 

787
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,410
I don't I get it they're much more
knowledgeable uh than me about like the

788
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:09,420
knowledgeable uh than me about like the
 

789
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,810
knowledgeable uh than me about like the
intricacies of biology but that seems

790
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:11,820
intricacies of biology but that seems
 

791
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,690
intricacies of biology but that seems
like crazy because how much how many

792
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:14,700
like crazy because how much how many
 

793
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,329
like crazy because how much how many
single cell organisms are there like and

794
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:17,339
single cell organisms are there like and
 

795
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,509
single cell organisms are there like and
how much time you have surely it's not

796
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:20,519
how much time you have surely it's not
 

797
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,610
how much time you have surely it's not
that difficult like in a billion years

798
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:22,620
that difficult like in a billion years
 

799
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,410
that difficult like in a billion years
it's not even that long

800
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:24,420
it's not even that long
 

801
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,650
it's not even that long
of a time really just all these bacteria

802
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:27,660
of a time really just all these bacteria
 

803
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,170

under constrained resources battling it
 

805
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,430
under constrained resources battling it
out I'm sure they can invent more

806
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
out I'm sure they can invent more
 

807
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,410
out I'm sure they can invent more
complex again I don't understand it's

808
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:33,420
complex again I don't understand it's
 

809
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,389
complex again I don't understand it's
like how to move from a hello world

810
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:35,399
like how to move from a hello world
 

811
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,269
like how to move from a hello world
program to like like invent a function

812
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,279
program to like like invent a function
 

813
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,990
program to like like invent a function
or something like that I don't yeah I I

814
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,000
or something like that I don't yeah I I
 

815
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,490
or something like that I don't yeah I I
so I don't yeah so I'm with you I just

816
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:43,500
so I don't yeah so I'm with you I just
 

817
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,949
so I don't yeah so I'm with you I just
feel like I don't see any if the origin

818
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:45,959
feel like I don't see any if the origin
 

819
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,870
feel like I don't see any if the origin
of life that would be my intuition

820
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:47,880
of life that would be my intuition
 

821
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,490
of life that would be my intuition
that's the hardest thing but if that's

822
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:49,500
that's the hardest thing but if that's
 

823
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,689
that's the hardest thing but if that's
not the hardest thing because it happens

824
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:50,699
not the hardest thing because it happens
 

825
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,610
not the hardest thing because it happens
so quickly then it's got to be

826
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:52,620
so quickly then it's got to be
 

827
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,530
so quickly then it's got to be
everywhere and yeah maybe we're just too

828
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:54,540
everywhere and yeah maybe we're just too
 

829
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,150
everywhere and yeah maybe we're just too
dumb to see it well it's just we don't

830
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
dumb to see it well it's just we don't
 

831
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,769
dumb to see it well it's just we don't
have really good mechanisms for seeing

832
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:57,779
have really good mechanisms for seeing
 

833
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,110
have really good mechanisms for seeing
this life I mean uh by what

834
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,120
this life I mean uh by what
 

835
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,329
this life I mean uh by what
how um so I'm not an expert just to

836
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:02,339
how um so I'm not an expert just to
 

837
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,930
how um so I'm not an expert just to
preface this but just said it was I want

838
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:05,940
preface this but just said it was I want
 

839
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,329
preface this but just said it was I want
to meet an expert on alien intelligence

840
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:08,339
to meet an expert on alien intelligence
 

841
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,470
to meet an expert on alien intelligence
and how to communicate I'm very

842
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:09,480
and how to communicate I'm very
 

843
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,210
and how to communicate I'm very
suspicious of our ability to to find

844
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,220
suspicious of our ability to to find
 

845
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,769
suspicious of our ability to to find
these intelligences out there and to

846
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:12,779
these intelligences out there and to
 

847
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,810
these intelligences out there and to
find these Earths like radio waves for

848
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:14,820
find these Earths like radio waves for
 

849
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,850
find these Earths like radio waves for
example are are terrible uh their power

850
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:16,860
example are are terrible uh their power
 

851
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,710
example are are terrible uh their power
drops off as basically one over R square

852
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
drops off as basically one over R square
 

853
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,350
drops off as basically one over R square
uh so I remember reading that our

854
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
uh so I remember reading that our
 

855
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,870
uh so I remember reading that our
current radio waves would not be uh the

856
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:23,880
current radio waves would not be uh the
 

857
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,670
current radio waves would not be uh the
ones that we we are broadcasting would

858
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
ones that we we are broadcasting would
 

859
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,069
ones that we we are broadcasting would
not be uh measurable by our devices

860
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
not be uh measurable by our devices
 

861
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,290
not be uh measurable by our devices
today only like was it like one tenth of

862
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,300
today only like was it like one tenth of
 

863
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,550
today only like was it like one tenth of
a light year away like not even

864
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,560
a light year away like not even
 

865
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,310
a light year away like not even
basically tiny distance because you

866
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
basically tiny distance because you
 

867
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,810
basically tiny distance because you
really need like a targeted transmission

868
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:35,820
really need like a targeted transmission
 

869
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,810
really need like a targeted transmission
of massive power directed somewhere for

870
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:38,820
of massive power directed somewhere for
 

871
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,030
of massive power directed somewhere for
this to be picked up on long distances

872
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
this to be picked up on long distances
 

873
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,889
this to be picked up on long distances
and so I just think that our ability to

874
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:42,899
and so I just think that our ability to
 

875
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,350
and so I just think that our ability to
measure is um is not amazing I think

876
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
measure is um is not amazing I think
 

877
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,670
measure is um is not amazing I think
there's probably other civilizations out

878
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:46,680
there's probably other civilizations out
 

879
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,230
there's probably other civilizations out
there and then the big question is why

880
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
there and then the big question is why
 

881
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,730
there and then the big question is why
don't they build binomial probes and why

882
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:49,740
don't they build binomial probes and why
 

883
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,350
don't they build binomial probes and why
don't they Interstellar travel across

884
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
don't they Interstellar travel across
 

885
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,389
don't they Interstellar travel across
the entire galaxy and my current answer

886
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:53,399
the entire galaxy and my current answer
 

887
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,250
the entire galaxy and my current answer
is it's probably Interstellar travel is

888
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,260
is it's probably Interstellar travel is
 

889
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,050
is it's probably Interstellar travel is
like really hard uh you have the

890
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,060
like really hard uh you have the
 

891
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,310
like really hard uh you have the
interstellar medium if you want to move

892
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
interstellar medium if you want to move
 

893
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,930
interstellar medium if you want to move
at closer speed of light you're going to

894
00:15:59,930 --> 00:15:59,940
at closer speed of light you're going to
 

895
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,310
at closer speed of light you're going to
be encountering bullets along the way

896
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,320
be encountering bullets along the way
 

897
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,610
be encountering bullets along the way
because even like tiny hydrogen atoms

898
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:04,620
because even like tiny hydrogen atoms
 

899
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,230
because even like tiny hydrogen atoms
and little particles of dust are

900
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
and little particles of dust are
 

901
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,150
and little particles of dust are
basically have like massive kinetic

902
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
basically have like massive kinetic
 

903
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,009
basically have like massive kinetic
energy at those speeds and so basically

904
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:10,019
energy at those speeds and so basically
 

905
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,810
energy at those speeds and so basically
you need some kind of shielding you need

906
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:11,820
you need some kind of shielding you need
 

907
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,970
you need some kind of shielding you need
you have all the cosmic radiation uh

908
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:13,980
you have all the cosmic radiation uh
 

909
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,230
you have all the cosmic radiation uh
it's just like brutal out there it's

910
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,240
it's just like brutal out there it's
 

911
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,389
it's just like brutal out there it's
really hard and so my thinking is maybe

912
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:17,399
really hard and so my thinking is maybe
 

913
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,889
really hard and so my thinking is maybe
Interstellar travel is just extremely

914
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:18,899
Interstellar travel is just extremely
 

915
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,769
Interstellar travel is just extremely
hard

916
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:20,779
hard
 

917
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,530
hard
to build hard

918
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:23,540
to build hard
 

919
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,930
to build hard
it feels like uh it feels like we're not

920
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:26,940
it feels like uh it feels like we're not
 

921
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,730
it feels like uh it feels like we're not
a billion years away from doing that it

922
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:28,740
a billion years away from doing that it
 

923
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,650
a billion years away from doing that it
just might be that it's very you have to

924
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:30,660
just might be that it's very you have to
 

925
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,629
just might be that it's very you have to
go very slowly potentially as an example

926
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
go very slowly potentially as an example
 

927
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,129
go very slowly potentially as an example
through space

928
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:34,139
through space
 

929
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,350
through space
um right as opposed to close the speed

930
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:36,360
um right as opposed to close the speed
 

931
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,730
um right as opposed to close the speed
of light so I'm suspicious basically of

932
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:37,740
of light so I'm suspicious basically of
 

933
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,110
of light so I'm suspicious basically of
our ability to measure life and I'm

934
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
our ability to measure life and I'm
 

935
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,810
our ability to measure life and I'm
suspicious of the ability to um just

936
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:41,820
suspicious of the ability to um just
 

937
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,430
suspicious of the ability to um just
permeate all of space in the Galaxy or

938
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
permeate all of space in the Galaxy or
 

939
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,350
permeate all of space in the Galaxy or
across galaxies and that's the only way

940
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
across galaxies and that's the only way
 

941
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,030
across galaxies and that's the only way
that I can certainly I can currently see

942
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
that I can certainly I can currently see
 

943
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,949
that I can certainly I can currently see
a way around it yeah it's kind of

944
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
a way around it yeah it's kind of
 

945
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,170
a way around it yeah it's kind of
mind-blowing to think that there's

946
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,180
mind-blowing to think that there's
 

947
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,329
mind-blowing to think that there's
trillions of intelligent alien

948
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:53,339
trillions of intelligent alien
 

949
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,910
trillions of intelligent alien
civilizations out there kind of slowly

950
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
civilizations out there kind of slowly
 

951
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,949
civilizations out there kind of slowly
traveling through space

952
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:57,959
traveling through space
 

953
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,930
traveling through space
to meet each other and some of them meet

954
00:16:59,930 --> 00:16:59,940
to meet each other and some of them meet
 

955
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,970
to meet each other and some of them meet
some of them go to war some of them

956
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:01,980
some of them go to war some of them
 

957
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,510
some of them go to war some of them
collaborate or they're all just uh

958
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
collaborate or they're all just uh
 

959
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,490
collaborate or they're all just uh
independent they are all just like

960
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:07,500
independent they are all just like
 

961
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,289
independent they are all just like
little pockets I don't know well

962
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,299
little pockets I don't know well
 

963
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,809
little pockets I don't know well
statistically if there's like

964
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:11,819
statistically if there's like
 

965
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,850
statistically if there's like
if it's there's trillions of them surely

966
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:13,860
if it's there's trillions of them surely
 

967
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,590
if it's there's trillions of them surely
some of them some of the pockets are

968
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
some of them some of the pockets are
 

969
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,850
some of them some of the pockets are
close enough to get some of them happen

970
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:16,860
close enough to get some of them happen
 

971
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,069
close enough to get some of them happen
to be close yeah in the close enough to

972
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,079
to be close yeah in the close enough to
 

973
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,689
to be close yeah in the close enough to
see each other and then once you see

974
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:20,699
see each other and then once you see
 

975
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,350
see each other and then once you see
once you see something that is

976
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
once you see something that is
 

977
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,809
once you see something that is
definitely complex life like if we see

978
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:26,819
definitely complex life like if we see
 

979
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,090
definitely complex life like if we see
something yeah we're probably going to

980
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,100
something yeah we're probably going to
 

981
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,730
something yeah we're probably going to
be severe like intensely aggressively

982
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:31,740
be severe like intensely aggressively
 

983
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,230
be severe like intensely aggressively
motivated to figure out what the hell

984
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,240
motivated to figure out what the hell
 

985
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,690
motivated to figure out what the hell
that is and try to meet them what would

986
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:35,700
that is and try to meet them what would
 

987
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,990
that is and try to meet them what would
be your first instinct to try to like at

988
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,000
be your first instinct to try to like at
 

989
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,250
be your first instinct to try to like at
a generational level meet them or defend

990
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:43,260
a generational level meet them or defend
 

991
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,370
a generational level meet them or defend
against them or what would be your uh

992
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:46,380
against them or what would be your uh
 

993
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,250
against them or what would be your uh
Instinct as a president of the United

994
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,260
Instinct as a president of the United
 

995
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,630
Instinct as a president of the United
States

996
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
States
 

997
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,549
States
and the scientists

998
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
and the scientists
 

999
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,409
and the scientists
I don't know which hat you prefer in

1000
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:54,419
I don't know which hat you prefer in
 

1001
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,370
I don't know which hat you prefer in
this question

1002
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:55,380
this question
 

1003
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,529
this question
yeah I think the the question it's

1004
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:57,539
yeah I think the the question it's
 

1005
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,029
yeah I think the the question it's
really hard

1006
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
really hard
 

1007
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,690
really hard
um

1008
00:17:59,690 --> 00:17:59,700
um
 

1009
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,330
um
I will say like for example for us

1010
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,340
I will say like for example for us
 

1011
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,130
I will say like for example for us
um we have lots of primitive life forms

1012
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,140
um we have lots of primitive life forms
 

1013
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,210
um we have lots of primitive life forms
on Earth

1014
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:05,220
on Earth
 

1015
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,010
on Earth
um next to us we have all kinds of ants

1016
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,020
um next to us we have all kinds of ants
 

1017
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,570
um next to us we have all kinds of ants
and everything else and we share space

1018
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:08,580
and everything else and we share space
 

1019
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,210
and everything else and we share space
with them and we are hesitant to impact

1020
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:11,220
with them and we are hesitant to impact
 

1021
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,310
with them and we are hesitant to impact
on them and to we are and we're trying

1022
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:13,320
on them and to we are and we're trying
 

1023
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,590
on them and to we are and we're trying
to protect them by default because they

1024
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
to protect them by default because they
 

1025
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,970
to protect them by default because they
are amazing interesting dynamical

1026
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:16,980
are amazing interesting dynamical
 

1027
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,650
are amazing interesting dynamical
systems that took a long time to evolve

1028
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:18,660
systems that took a long time to evolve
 

1029
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,930
systems that took a long time to evolve
and they are interesting and special and

1030
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:20,940
and they are interesting and special and
 

1031
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,570
and they are interesting and special and
I don't know that you want to

1032
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:23,580
I don't know that you want to
 

1033
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,130
I don't know that you want to
um destroy that by default and so I like

1034
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,140
um destroy that by default and so I like
 

1035
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,289
um destroy that by default and so I like
complex dynamical systems that took a

1036
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:30,299
complex dynamical systems that took a
 

1037
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,529
complex dynamical systems that took a
lot of time to evolve I think

1038
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:33,539
lot of time to evolve I think
 

1039
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,990
lot of time to evolve I think
I'd like to I like to preserve it if I

1040
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
I'd like to I like to preserve it if I
 

1041
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,730
I'd like to I like to preserve it if I
can afford to and I'd like to think that

1042
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:37,740
can afford to and I'd like to think that
 

1043
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,289
can afford to and I'd like to think that
the same would be true about uh the

1044
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:39,299
the same would be true about uh the
 

1045
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,750
the same would be true about uh the
galactic resources and that uh they

1046
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
galactic resources and that uh they
 

1047
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,650
galactic resources and that uh they
would think that we're kind of

1048
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:42,660
would think that we're kind of
 

1049
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,630
would think that we're kind of
incredible interesting story that took

1050
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
incredible interesting story that took
 

1051
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,789
incredible interesting story that took
time it took a few billion years to

1052
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
time it took a few billion years to
 

1053
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,409
time it took a few billion years to
unravel and you don't want to just

1054
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:48,419
unravel and you don't want to just
 

1055
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,330
unravel and you don't want to just
destroy it I could see two aliens

1056
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:50,340
destroy it I could see two aliens
 

1057
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,370
destroy it I could see two aliens
talking about Earth right now and saying

1058
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:52,380
talking about Earth right now and saying
 

1059
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,590
talking about Earth right now and saying
uh I'm I'm a big fan of complex

1060
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:54,600
uh I'm I'm a big fan of complex
 

1061
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,010
uh I'm I'm a big fan of complex
dynamical systems so I think it was a

1062
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,020
dynamical systems so I think it was a
 

1063
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,870
dynamical systems so I think it was a
value to preserve these and who

1064
00:18:59,870 --> 00:18:59,880
value to preserve these and who
 

1065
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,850
value to preserve these and who
basically are a video game they watch or

1066
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:01,860
basically are a video game they watch or
 

1067
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,010
basically are a video game they watch or
show a TV show that they watch

1068
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,020
show a TV show that they watch
 

1069
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,930
show a TV show that they watch
yeah I think uh you would need like a

1070
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:05,940
yeah I think uh you would need like a
 

1071
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,490
yeah I think uh you would need like a
very good reason I think to

1072
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:07,500
very good reason I think to
 

1073
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,409
very good reason I think to
to destroy it uh like why don't we

1074
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:09,419
to destroy it uh like why don't we
 

1075
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:10,789
to destroy it uh like why don't we
destroy these ant farms and so on it's

1076
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
destroy these ant farms and so on it's
 

1077
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,870
destroy these ant farms and so on it's
because we're not actually like really

1078
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:11,880
because we're not actually like really
 

1079
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,730
because we're not actually like really
in direct competition with them right

1080
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:13,740
in direct competition with them right
 

1081
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,070
in direct competition with them right
now uh we do it accidentally and so on

1082
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
now uh we do it accidentally and so on
 

1083
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,270
now uh we do it accidentally and so on
but

1084
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
but
 

1085
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,870
but
um

1086
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:17,880
um
 

1087
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,150
um
there's plenty of resources and so why

1088
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
there's plenty of resources and so why
 

1089
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,350
there's plenty of resources and so why
would you destroy something that is so

1090
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
would you destroy something that is so
 

1091
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,090
would you destroy something that is so
interesting and precious well from a

1092
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,100
interesting and precious well from a
 

1093
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,070
interesting and precious well from a
scientific perspective you might probe

1094
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,080
scientific perspective you might probe
 

1095
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,169
scientific perspective you might probe
it yeah you might interact with it later

1096
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:27,179
it yeah you might interact with it later
 

1097
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,730
it yeah you might interact with it later
you might want to learn something from

1098
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:28,740
you might want to learn something from
 

1099
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,250
you might want to learn something from
it right so I wonder there's could be

1100
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:31,260
it right so I wonder there's could be
 

1101
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,110
it right so I wonder there's could be
certain physical phenomena that we think

1102
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
certain physical phenomena that we think
 

1103
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,610
certain physical phenomena that we think
is a physical phenomena but it's

1104
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:34,620
is a physical phenomena but it's
 

1105
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,470
is a physical phenomena but it's
actually interacting with us to like

1106
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
actually interacting with us to like
 

1107
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,630
actually interacting with us to like
poke the finger and see what happens I

1108
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
poke the finger and see what happens I
 

1109
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,710
poke the finger and see what happens I
think it should be very interesting to

1110
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:39,720
think it should be very interesting to
 

1111
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,330
think it should be very interesting to
scientists other alien scientists what

1112
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:41,340
scientists other alien scientists what
 

1113
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,350
scientists other alien scientists what
happened here

1114
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:42,360
happened here
 

1115
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,690
happened here
um and you know it's a what we're seeing

1116
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:44,700
um and you know it's a what we're seeing
 

1117
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,430
um and you know it's a what we're seeing
today is a snapshot basically it's a

1118
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:46,440
today is a snapshot basically it's a
 

1119
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,430
today is a snapshot basically it's a
result of a huge amount of computation

1120
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
result of a huge amount of computation
 

1121
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,710
result of a huge amount of computation
uh of over like billion years or

1122
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:51,720
uh of over like billion years or
 

1123
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,270
uh of over like billion years or
something like that so it could have

1124
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
something like that so it could have
 

1125
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,789
something like that so it could have
been initiated by aliens this could be a

1126
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:55,799
been initiated by aliens this could be a
 

1127
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,890
been initiated by aliens this could be a
computer running a program like when

1128
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:57,900
computer running a program like when
 

1129
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,810
computer running a program like when
okay if you had the power to do this

1130
00:19:59,810 --> 00:19:59,820
okay if you had the power to do this
 

1131
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,750
okay if you had the power to do this
when you okay for sure at least I would

1132
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:02,760
when you okay for sure at least I would
 

1133
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,470
when you okay for sure at least I would
I would pick uh a Earth-like planet that

1134
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
I would pick uh a Earth-like planet that
 

1135
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,610
I would pick uh a Earth-like planet that
has the conditions based my

1136
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:07,620
has the conditions based my
 

1137
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,690
has the conditions based my
understanding of the chemistry

1138
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:08,700
understanding of the chemistry
 

1139
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,430
understanding of the chemistry
prerequisites for life

1140
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:10,440
prerequisites for life
 

1141
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,010
prerequisites for life
and I would see it with life and run it

1142
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,020
and I would see it with life and run it
 

1143
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,370
and I would see it with life and run it
right like yeah wouldn't you 100 do that

1144
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:16,380
right like yeah wouldn't you 100 do that
 

1145
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,010
right like yeah wouldn't you 100 do that
and observe it and then protect

1146
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,020
and observe it and then protect
 

1147
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,169
and observe it and then protect
I mean that that's not just a hell of a

1148
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:21,179
I mean that that's not just a hell of a
 

1149
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,210
I mean that that's not just a hell of a
good TV show it's it's a good scientific

1150
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:23,220
good TV show it's it's a good scientific
 

1151
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,909
good TV show it's it's a good scientific
experiment yeah and

1152
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
experiment yeah and
 

1153
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,490
experiment yeah and
that in his it's physical simulation

1154
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:28,500
that in his it's physical simulation
 

1155
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,990
that in his it's physical simulation
right maybe maybe the evolution is the

1156
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,000
right maybe maybe the evolution is the
 

1157
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,330
right maybe maybe the evolution is the
most like actually running it

1158
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,340
most like actually running it
 

1159
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,210
most like actually running it
uh is the most efficient way to uh

1160
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,220
uh is the most efficient way to uh
 

1161
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,970
uh is the most efficient way to uh
understand computation or to compute

1162
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:40,980
understand computation or to compute
 

1163
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,190
understand computation or to compute
stuff or to understand life or you know

1164
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
stuff or to understand life or you know
 

1165
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,990
stuff or to understand life or you know
what life looks like and uh what

1166
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,000
what life looks like and uh what
 

1167
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,970
what life looks like and uh what
branches it can take it does make me

1168
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:46,980
branches it can take it does make me
 

1169
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,470
branches it can take it does make me
kind of feel weird that we're part of a

1170
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
kind of feel weird that we're part of a
 

1171
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,529
kind of feel weird that we're part of a
science experiment but maybe it's

1172
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:50,539
science experiment but maybe it's
 

1173
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,850
science experiment but maybe it's
everything's a science experiments how

1174
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:52,860
everything's a science experiments how
 

1175
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,430
everything's a science experiments how
to does that change anything for us for

1176
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
to does that change anything for us for
 

1177
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,810
to does that change anything for us for
a science experiment

1178
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:56,820
a science experiment
 

1179
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,630
a science experiment
um I don't know two descendants of Apes

1180
00:20:59,630 --> 00:20:59,640
um I don't know two descendants of Apes
 

1181
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,490
um I don't know two descendants of Apes
talking about being inside of a science

1182
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:01,500
talking about being inside of a science
 

1183
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,110
talking about being inside of a science
experience I'm suspicious of this idea

1184
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
experience I'm suspicious of this idea
 

1185
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,330
experience I'm suspicious of this idea
of like a deliberate Pence Premiere as

1186
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:05,340
of like a deliberate Pence Premiere as
 

1187
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,250
of like a deliberate Pence Premiere as
you described it service and I don't see

1188
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,260
you described it service and I don't see
 

1189
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,409
you described it service and I don't see
a divine intervention in some way in the

1190
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:09,419
a divine intervention in some way in the
 

1191
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,510
a divine intervention in some way in the
in the historical record right now I do

1192
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
in the historical record right now I do
 

1193
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,710
in the historical record right now I do
feel like

1194
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
feel like
 

1195
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,049
feel like
um the story in these in these books

1196
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:15,059
um the story in these in these books
 

1197
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,490
um the story in these in these books
like Nick Lane's books and so on sort of

1198
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:16,500
like Nick Lane's books and so on sort of
 

1199
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,289
like Nick Lane's books and so on sort of
makes sense uh and it makes sense how

1200
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:18,299
makes sense uh and it makes sense how
 

1201
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,770
makes sense uh and it makes sense how
life arose on Earth uniquely and uh yeah

1202
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:21,780
life arose on Earth uniquely and uh yeah
 

1203
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,390
life arose on Earth uniquely and uh yeah
I don't need a I need I don't need to

1204
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:23,400
I don't need a I need I don't need to
 

1205
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,070
I don't need a I need I don't need to
reach for more exotic explanations right

1206
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,080
reach for more exotic explanations right
 

1207
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,529
reach for more exotic explanations right
now sure but NPCs inside a video game

1208
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:27,539
now sure but NPCs inside a video game
 

1209
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:28,549
now sure but NPCs inside a video game
don't

1210
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
don't
 

1211
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,950
don't
don't don't observe any divine

1212
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
don't don't observe any divine
 

1213
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,409
don't don't observe any divine
intervention either and we might just be

1214
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:33,419
intervention either and we might just be
 

1215
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,750
intervention either and we might just be
all NPCs running a kind of code maybe

1216
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
all NPCs running a kind of code maybe
 

1217
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,430
all NPCs running a kind of code maybe
eventually they will currently NPCs are

1218
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
eventually they will currently NPCs are
 

1219
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,570
eventually they will currently NPCs are
really dumb but once they're running

1220
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:38,580
really dumb but once they're running
 

1221
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,270
really dumb but once they're running
gpts um maybe they will be like hey this

1222
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,280
gpts um maybe they will be like hey this
 

1223
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,850
gpts um maybe they will be like hey this
is really suspicious what the hell so

1224
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:43,860
is really suspicious what the hell so
 

1225
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,029
is really suspicious what the hell so
you uh famously tweeted it looks like if

1226
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
you uh famously tweeted it looks like if
 

1227
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,070
you uh famously tweeted it looks like if
you bombard Earth with photons for a

1228
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,080
you bombard Earth with photons for a
 

1229
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,590
you bombard Earth with photons for a
while you can emit A roadster

1230
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
while you can emit A roadster
 

1231
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,350
while you can emit A roadster
so if like an Hitchhiker's Guide to the

1232
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,360
so if like an Hitchhiker's Guide to the
 

1233
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,690
so if like an Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy we would summarize the story of

1234
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:56,700
Galaxy we would summarize the story of
 

1235
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,730
Galaxy we would summarize the story of
Earth so in in that book it's mostly

1236
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:58,740
Earth so in in that book it's mostly
 

1237
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,750
Earth so in in that book it's mostly
harmless

1238
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
harmless
 

1239
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,090
harmless
uh what do you think is all the possible

1240
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:02,100
uh what do you think is all the possible
 

1241
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,430
uh what do you think is all the possible
stories like a paragraph long or a

1242
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:04,440
stories like a paragraph long or a
 

1243
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,630
stories like a paragraph long or a
sentence long

1244
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:05,640
sentence long
 

1245
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,049
sentence long
that Earth could be summarized as once

1246
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:09,059
that Earth could be summarized as once
 

1247
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,049
that Earth could be summarized as once
it's done it's computation so like all

1248
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:12,059
it's done it's computation so like all
 

1249
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,210
it's done it's computation so like all
the Possible full

1250
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,220
the Possible full
 

1251
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,750
the Possible full
if Earth is a book right yeah uh

1252
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
if Earth is a book right yeah uh
 

1253
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,029
if Earth is a book right yeah uh
probably there has to be an ending I

1254
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:20,039
probably there has to be an ending I
 

1255
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,409
probably there has to be an ending I
mean there's going to be an end to Earth

1256
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:21,419
mean there's going to be an end to Earth
 

1257
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,330
mean there's going to be an end to Earth
and it could end in all kinds of ways it

1258
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,340
and it could end in all kinds of ways it
 

1259
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,610
and it could end in all kinds of ways it
could end soon it can end later what do

1260
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:25,620
could end soon it can end later what do
 

1261
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,649
could end soon it can end later what do
you think are the possible stories well

1262
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:27,659
you think are the possible stories well
 

1263
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,690
you think are the possible stories well
definitely there seems to be

1264
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:29,700
definitely there seems to be
 

1265
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,789
definitely there seems to be
yeah you're sort of

1266
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:31,799
yeah you're sort of
 

1267
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,230
yeah you're sort of
it's pretty incredible that these

1268
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,240
it's pretty incredible that these
 

1269
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,570
it's pretty incredible that these
self-replicating systems will basically

1270
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:35,580
self-replicating systems will basically
 

1271
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,909
self-replicating systems will basically
arise from the Dynamics and then they

1272
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
arise from the Dynamics and then they
 

1273
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,169
arise from the Dynamics and then they
perpetuate themselves and become more

1274
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:39,179
perpetuate themselves and become more
 

1275
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,909
perpetuate themselves and become more
complex and eventually become conscious

1276
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:40,919
complex and eventually become conscious
 

1277
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,310
complex and eventually become conscious
and build a society and I kind of feel

1278
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,320
and build a society and I kind of feel
 

1279
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,770
and build a society and I kind of feel
like in some sense it's kind of like a

1280
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:45,780
like in some sense it's kind of like a
 

1281
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,890
like in some sense it's kind of like a
deterministic wave uh that you know that

1282
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:48,900
deterministic wave uh that you know that
 

1283
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,810
deterministic wave uh that you know that
kind of just like happens on any you

1284
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:50,820
kind of just like happens on any you
 

1285
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,430
kind of just like happens on any you
know any sufficiently well arranged

1286
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:52,440
know any sufficiently well arranged
 

1287
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,810
know any sufficiently well arranged
system like Earth

1288
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:53,820
system like Earth
 

1289
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,130
system like Earth
and so I kind of feel like there's a

1290
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,140
and so I kind of feel like there's a
 

1291
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,010
and so I kind of feel like there's a
certain sense of inevitability in it

1292
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,020
certain sense of inevitability in it
 

1293
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,590
certain sense of inevitability in it
um and it's really beautiful and it ends

1294
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:00,600
um and it's really beautiful and it ends
 

1295
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,630
um and it's really beautiful and it ends
somehow right so it's a it's a

1296
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
somehow right so it's a it's a
 

1297
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,149
somehow right so it's a it's a
chemically

1298
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:05,159
chemically
 

1299
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,669
chemically
a diverse environment

1300
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
a diverse environment
 

1301
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,289
a diverse environment
where complex dynamical systems can

1302
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:11,299
where complex dynamical systems can
 

1303
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:14,570
where complex dynamical systems can
evolve and become more more further and

1304
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:14,580
evolve and become more more further and
 

1305
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,789
evolve and become more more further and
further complex but then there's a

1306
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
further complex but then there's a
 

1307
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,529
further complex but then there's a
certain

1308
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:18,539
certain
 

1309
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,430
certain
um

1310
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
um
 

1311
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,649
um
what is it there's certain terminating

1312
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:21,659
what is it there's certain terminating
 

1313
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,350
what is it there's certain terminating
conditions yeah I don't know what the

1314
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,360
conditions yeah I don't know what the
 

1315
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,310
conditions yeah I don't know what the
terminating conditions are but

1316
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,320
terminating conditions are but
 

1317
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,810
terminating conditions are but
definitely there's a trend line of

1318
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:26,820
definitely there's a trend line of
 

1319
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,950
definitely there's a trend line of
something and we're part of that story

1320
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:27,960
something and we're part of that story
 

1321
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,990
something and we're part of that story
and like where does that where does it

1322
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
and like where does that where does it
 

1323
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,210
and like where does that where does it
go so you know we're famously described

1324
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,220
go so you know we're famously described
 

1325
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,730
go so you know we're famously described
often as a biological Bootloader for AIS

1326
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:34,740
often as a biological Bootloader for AIS
 

1327
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,230
often as a biological Bootloader for AIS
and that's because humans I mean you

1328
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
and that's because humans I mean you
 

1329
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,610
and that's because humans I mean you
know we're an incredible

1330
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:37,620
know we're an incredible
 

1331
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,529
know we're an incredible
uh biological system and we're capable

1332
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:39,539
uh biological system and we're capable
 

1333
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,770
uh biological system and we're capable
of computation and uh you know and love

1334
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:42,780
of computation and uh you know and love
 

1335
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,330
of computation and uh you know and love
and so on

1336
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:44,340
and so on
 

1337
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,070
and so on
um but we're extremely inefficient as

1338
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
um but we're extremely inefficient as
 

1339
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,210
um but we're extremely inefficient as
well like we're talking to each other

1340
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:47,220
well like we're talking to each other
 

1341
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,649
well like we're talking to each other
through audio it's just kind of

1342
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:48,659
through audio it's just kind of
 

1343
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,210
through audio it's just kind of
embarrassing honestly they were

1344
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,220
embarrassing honestly they were
 

1345
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,549
embarrassing honestly they were
manipulating like seven symbols uh

1346
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
manipulating like seven symbols uh
 

1347
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,370
manipulating like seven symbols uh
serially we're using vocal chords it's

1348
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:55,380
serially we're using vocal chords it's
 

1349
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,810
serially we're using vocal chords it's
all happening over like multiple seconds

1350
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:56,820
all happening over like multiple seconds
 

1351
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,850
all happening over like multiple seconds
yeah it's just like kind of embarrassing

1352
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:58,860
yeah it's just like kind of embarrassing
 

1353
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,649
yeah it's just like kind of embarrassing
when you step down to the

1354
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:00,659
when you step down to the
 

1355
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,990
when you step down to the
uh frequencies at which computers

1356
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,000
uh frequencies at which computers
 

1357
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,450
uh frequencies at which computers
operate or are able to cooperate on and

1358
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:05,460
operate or are able to cooperate on and
 

1359
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,730
operate or are able to cooperate on and
so basically it does seem like

1360
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:07,740
so basically it does seem like
 

1361
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,250
so basically it does seem like
um synthetic intelligences are kind of

1362
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,260
um synthetic intelligences are kind of
 

1363
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,310
um synthetic intelligences are kind of
like the next stage of development and

1364
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,320
like the next stage of development and
 

1365
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,990
like the next stage of development and
um I don't know where it leads to like

1366
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,000
um I don't know where it leads to like
 

1367
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,289
um I don't know where it leads to like
at some point I suspect uh the universe

1368
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:18,299
at some point I suspect uh the universe
 

1369
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,390
at some point I suspect uh the universe
is some kind of a puzzle

1370
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
is some kind of a puzzle
 

1371
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,390
is some kind of a puzzle
and these synthetic AIS will uncover

1372
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,400
and these synthetic AIS will uncover
 

1373
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,630
and these synthetic AIS will uncover
that puzzle and um solve it

1374
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
that puzzle and um solve it
 

1375
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,909
that puzzle and um solve it
and then what happens after right like

1376
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:28,919
and then what happens after right like
 

1377
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,710
and then what happens after right like
what because if you just like Fast

1378
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
what because if you just like Fast
 

1379
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,750
what because if you just like Fast
Forward Earth many billions of years

1380
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:32,760
Forward Earth many billions of years
 

1381
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,570
Forward Earth many billions of years
it's like uh it's quiet and then it's

1382
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:35,580
it's like uh it's quiet and then it's
 

1383
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,490
it's like uh it's quiet and then it's
like to tourmal you see like city lights

1384
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:37,500
like to tourmal you see like city lights
 

1385
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,110
like to tourmal you see like city lights
and stuff like that and then what

1386
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
and stuff like that and then what
 

1387
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,850
and stuff like that and then what
happens like at the end like is it like

1388
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:40,860
happens like at the end like is it like
 

1389
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,870
happens like at the end like is it like
a

1390
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:41,880
a
 

1391
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,510
a
is it or is it like a calming is it

1392
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:44,520
is it or is it like a calming is it
 

1393
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,669
is it or is it like a calming is it
explosion is it like Earth like open

1394
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:46,679
explosion is it like Earth like open
 

1395
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,730
explosion is it like Earth like open
like a giant because you said emit

1396
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:49,740
like a giant because you said emit
 

1397
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,529
like a giant because you said emit
Roasters like well let's start emitting

1398
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:51,539
Roasters like well let's start emitting
 

1399
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,549
Roasters like well let's start emitting
like like a giant number of Like

1400
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:55,559
like like a giant number of Like
 

1401
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,830
like like a giant number of Like
Satellites yes it's some kind of a crazy

1402
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
Satellites yes it's some kind of a crazy
 

1403
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,810
Satellites yes it's some kind of a crazy
explosion and we're living we're like

1404
00:24:59,810 --> 00:24:59,820
explosion and we're living we're like
 

1405
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,330
explosion and we're living we're like
we're stepping through a explosion and

1406
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:02,340
we're stepping through a explosion and
 

1407
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,590
we're stepping through a explosion and
we're like living day to day and it

1408
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
we're like living day to day and it
 

1409
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,610
we're like living day to day and it
doesn't look like it but it's actually

1410
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:04,620
doesn't look like it but it's actually
 

1411
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,830
doesn't look like it but it's actually
if you I saw a very cool animation of

1412
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:06,840
if you I saw a very cool animation of
 

1413
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,810
if you I saw a very cool animation of
Earth uh and life on Earth and basically

1414
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:08,820
Earth uh and life on Earth and basically
 

1415
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,430
Earth uh and life on Earth and basically
nothing happens for a long time and then

1416
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,440
nothing happens for a long time and then
 

1417
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,169
nothing happens for a long time and then
the last like two seconds like basically

1418
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:12,179
the last like two seconds like basically
 

1419
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,690
the last like two seconds like basically
cities and everything and just in the

1420
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:14,700
cities and everything and just in the
 

1421
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,070
cities and everything and just in the
low earth orbit just gets cluttered and

1422
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
low earth orbit just gets cluttered and
 

1423
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,149
low earth orbit just gets cluttered and
just the whole thing happens in the last

1424
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:17,159
just the whole thing happens in the last
 

1425
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,649
just the whole thing happens in the last
two seconds and you're like this is

1426
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:18,659
two seconds and you're like this is
 

1427
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,630
two seconds and you're like this is
exploding this is a statement explosion

1428
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
exploding this is a statement explosion
 

1429
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,669
exploding this is a statement explosion
so if you play

1430
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:22,679
so if you play
 

1431
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,010
so if you play
yeah yeah if you play it at normal speed

1432
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,020
yeah yeah if you play it at normal speed
 

1433
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,590
yeah yeah if you play it at normal speed
yeah it'll just look like an explosion

1434
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
yeah it'll just look like an explosion
 

1435
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,510
yeah it'll just look like an explosion
it's a firecracker we're living in a

1436
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
it's a firecracker we're living in a
 

1437
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,669
it's a firecracker we're living in a
firecracker where it's going to start

1438
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
firecracker where it's going to start
 

1439
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,230
firecracker where it's going to start
emitting all kinds of interesting things

1440
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,240
emitting all kinds of interesting things
 

1441
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,529
emitting all kinds of interesting things
yeah and then so explosion doesn't it

1442
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:36,539
yeah and then so explosion doesn't it
 

1443
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,610
yeah and then so explosion doesn't it
might actually look like a little

1444
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:37,620
might actually look like a little
 

1445
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,430
might actually look like a little
explosion with with lights and fire and

1446
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,440
explosion with with lights and fire and
 

1447
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,990
explosion with with lights and fire and
energy emitted all that kind of stuff

1448
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
energy emitted all that kind of stuff
 

1449
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,810
energy emitted all that kind of stuff
but when you look inside the details of

1450
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:44,820
but when you look inside the details of
 

1451
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,630
but when you look inside the details of
the explosion there's actual complexity

1452
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
the explosion there's actual complexity
 

1453
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,390
the explosion there's actual complexity
happening where there's like uh yeah

1454
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
happening where there's like uh yeah
 

1455
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,430
happening where there's like uh yeah
human life or some kind of life we hope

1456
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:52,440
human life or some kind of life we hope
 

1457
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,990
human life or some kind of life we hope
it's not destructive firecracker it's

1458
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
it's not destructive firecracker it's
 

1459
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,590
it's not destructive firecracker it's
kind of like a constructive uh

1460
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:56,600
kind of like a constructive uh
 

1461
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,750
kind of like a constructive uh
firecracker all right so given that I

1462
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
firecracker all right so given that I
 

1463
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,610
firecracker all right so given that I
think uh hilarious disgusting it is a

1464
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:01,620
think uh hilarious disgusting it is a
 

1465
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,570
think uh hilarious disgusting it is a
really interesting to think about like

1466
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:02,580
really interesting to think about like
 

1467
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,190
really interesting to think about like
what the puzzle of the universe is that

1468
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,200
what the puzzle of the universe is that
 

1469
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,169
what the puzzle of the universe is that
the creator of the universe uh give us a

1470
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:06,179
the creator of the universe uh give us a
 

1471
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:07,549
the creator of the universe uh give us a
message like for example in the book

1472
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:07,559
message like for example in the book
 

1473
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,330
message like for example in the book
contact

1474
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,340
contact
 

1475
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,610
contact
UM Carl Sagan uh there's a message for

1476
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:10,620
UM Carl Sagan uh there's a message for
 

1477
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,970
UM Carl Sagan uh there's a message for
Humanity for any civilization in uh

1478
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:13,980
Humanity for any civilization in uh
 

1479
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,730
Humanity for any civilization in uh
digits in the expansion of Pi and base

1480
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:16,740
digits in the expansion of Pi and base
 

1481
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,649
digits in the expansion of Pi and base
11 eventually which is kind of

1482
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:18,659
11 eventually which is kind of
 

1483
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,230
11 eventually which is kind of
interesting thought uh maybe maybe we're

1484
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,240
interesting thought uh maybe maybe we're
 

1485
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,370
interesting thought uh maybe maybe we're
supposed to be giving a message to our

1486
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:22,380
supposed to be giving a message to our
 

1487
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,470
supposed to be giving a message to our
creator maybe we're supposed to somehow

1488
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
creator maybe we're supposed to somehow
 

1489
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,390
creator maybe we're supposed to somehow
create some kind of a quantum mechanical

1490
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
create some kind of a quantum mechanical
 

1491
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,789
create some kind of a quantum mechanical
system that alerts them to our

1492
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
system that alerts them to our
 

1493
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,529
system that alerts them to our
intelligent presence here because if you

1494
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:30,539
intelligent presence here because if you
 

1495
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:31,549
intelligent presence here because if you
think about it from their perspective

1496
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:31,559
think about it from their perspective
 

1497
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,649
think about it from their perspective
it's just say like Quantum field Theory

1498
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:33,659
it's just say like Quantum field Theory
 

1499
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,750
it's just say like Quantum field Theory
massive like cellular automaton like

1500
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
massive like cellular automaton like
 

1501
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,789
massive like cellular automaton like
thing and like how do you even notice

1502
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:37,799
thing and like how do you even notice
 

1503
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,950
thing and like how do you even notice
that we exist you might not even be able

1504
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:39,960
that we exist you might not even be able
 

1505
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,529
that we exist you might not even be able
to pick us up in that simulation and so

1506
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:42,539
to pick us up in that simulation and so
 

1507
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,149
to pick us up in that simulation and so
how do you uh how do you prove that you

1508
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
how do you uh how do you prove that you
 

1509
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,890
how do you uh how do you prove that you
exist that you're intelligent and that

1510
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:45,900
exist that you're intelligent and that
 

1511
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,049
exist that you're intelligent and that
you're a part of the universe so this is

1512
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:48,059
you're a part of the universe so this is
 

1513
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,370
you're a part of the universe so this is
like a touring test for intelligence

1514
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:49,380
like a touring test for intelligence
 

1515
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,610
like a touring test for intelligence
from Earth yeah the Creator is uh I mean

1516
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:52,620
from Earth yeah the Creator is uh I mean
 

1517
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,649
from Earth yeah the Creator is uh I mean
maybe this is uh like trying to complete

1518
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:54,659
maybe this is uh like trying to complete
 

1519
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,330
maybe this is uh like trying to complete
the next word in a sentence this is a

1520
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:56,340
the next word in a sentence this is a
 

1521
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,130
the next word in a sentence this is a
complicated way of that like Earth is

1522
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,140
complicated way of that like Earth is
 

1523
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,710
complicated way of that like Earth is
just is basically sending a message back

1524
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
just is basically sending a message back
 

1525
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,330
just is basically sending a message back
yeah the puzzle is basically like

1526
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:02,340
yeah the puzzle is basically like
 

1527
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,850
yeah the puzzle is basically like
alerting the Creator that we exist or

1528
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:04,860
alerting the Creator that we exist or
 

1529
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,470
alerting the Creator that we exist or
maybe the puzzle is just to just break

1530
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
maybe the puzzle is just to just break
 

1531
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,330
maybe the puzzle is just to just break
out of the system and just uh you know

1532
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:08,340
out of the system and just uh you know
 

1533
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,549
out of the system and just uh you know
stick it to the Creator in some way uh

1534
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
stick it to the Creator in some way uh
 

1535
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,049
stick it to the Creator in some way uh
basically like if you're playing a video

1536
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:12,059
basically like if you're playing a video
 

1537
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,909
basically like if you're playing a video
game you can um

1538
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
game you can um
 

1539
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,130
game you can um
you can somehow find an exploit and find

1540
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,140
you can somehow find an exploit and find
 

1541
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,590
you can somehow find an exploit and find
a way to execute on the host machine in

1542
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:18,600
a way to execute on the host machine in
 

1543
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,110
a way to execute on the host machine in
the arbitrary code there's some for

1544
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
the arbitrary code there's some for
 

1545
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,149
the arbitrary code there's some for
example I believe someone got Mario a

1546
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:23,159
example I believe someone got Mario a
 

1547
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,430
example I believe someone got Mario a
game of Mario to play Pong just by uh

1548
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
game of Mario to play Pong just by uh
 

1549
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,470
game of Mario to play Pong just by uh
exploiting it and then

1550
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:27,480
exploiting it and then
 

1551
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,350
exploiting it and then
um creating a basically writing writing

1552
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,360
um creating a basically writing writing
 

1553
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,210
um creating a basically writing writing
code and being able to execute arbitrary

1554
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:32,220
code and being able to execute arbitrary
 

1555
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,370
code and being able to execute arbitrary
code in the game and so maybe we should

1556
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:34,380
code in the game and so maybe we should
 

1557
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,169
code in the game and so maybe we should
be maybe that's the puzzle is that we

1558
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:36,179
be maybe that's the puzzle is that we
 

1559
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,789
be maybe that's the puzzle is that we
should be um

1560
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:37,799
should be um
 

1561
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,070
should be um
uh find a way to exploit it so so I

1562
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
uh find a way to exploit it so so I
 

1563
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,390
uh find a way to exploit it so so I
think like some of these synthetic ads

1564
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:41,400
think like some of these synthetic ads
 

1565
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,830
think like some of these synthetic ads
will eventually find the universe to be

1566
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:42,840
will eventually find the universe to be
 

1567
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,450
will eventually find the universe to be
some kind of a puzzle and then solve it

1568
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:44,460
some kind of a puzzle and then solve it
 

1569
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,130
some kind of a puzzle and then solve it
in some way and that's kind of like the

1570
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:46,140
in some way and that's kind of like the
 

1571
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,350
in some way and that's kind of like the
end game somehow do you often think

1572
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,360
end game somehow do you often think
 

1573
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,930
end game somehow do you often think
about it as a as a simulation so as the

1574
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:53,940
about it as a as a simulation so as the
 

1575
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,430
about it as a as a simulation so as the
universe being a kind of computation

1576
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,440
universe being a kind of computation
 

1577
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,950
universe being a kind of computation
that has might have bugs and exploits

1578
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:57,960
that has might have bugs and exploits
 

1579
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,230
that has might have bugs and exploits
yes yeah I think so is that what physics

1580
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
yes yeah I think so is that what physics
 

1581
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,029
yes yeah I think so is that what physics
is essentially I think it's possible

1582
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:02,039
is essentially I think it's possible
 

1583
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,590
is essentially I think it's possible
that physics has exploits and we should

1584
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
that physics has exploits and we should
 

1585
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,570
that physics has exploits and we should
be trying to find them arranging some

1586
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:05,580
be trying to find them arranging some
 

1587
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,890
be trying to find them arranging some
kind of a crazy quantum mechanical

1588
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:06,900
kind of a crazy quantum mechanical
 

1589
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,810
kind of a crazy quantum mechanical
system that somehow gives you buffer

1590
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:08,820
system that somehow gives you buffer
 

1591
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,730
system that somehow gives you buffer
overflow somehow gives you a rounding

1592
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:10,740
overflow somehow gives you a rounding
 

1593
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,669
overflow somehow gives you a rounding
error and a floating Point

1594
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:12,679
error and a floating Point
 

1595
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,090
error and a floating Point
uh yeah that's right and like more and

1596
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,100
uh yeah that's right and like more and
 

1597
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,610
uh yeah that's right and like more and
more sophisticated exploits like those

1598
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:19,620
more sophisticated exploits like those
 

1599
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,990
more sophisticated exploits like those
are jokes but that could be actually

1600
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,000
are jokes but that could be actually
 

1601
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,490
are jokes but that could be actually
very close yeah we'll find some way to

1602
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:22,500
very close yeah we'll find some way to
 

1603
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,590
very close yeah we'll find some way to
extract infinite energy for example when

1604
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:24,600
extract infinite energy for example when
 

1605
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,909
extract infinite energy for example when
you train a reinforcement learning

1606
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:25,919
you train a reinforcement learning
 

1607
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,070
you train a reinforcement learning
agents um and physical simulations and

1608
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
agents um and physical simulations and
 

1609
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,470
agents um and physical simulations and
you ask them to say run quickly on the

1610
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,480
you ask them to say run quickly on the
 

1611
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,269
you ask them to say run quickly on the
flat ground they'll end up doing all

1612
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:32,279
flat ground they'll end up doing all
 

1613
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,710
flat ground they'll end up doing all
kinds of like weird things

1614
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:33,720
kinds of like weird things
 

1615
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,269
kinds of like weird things
um in part of that optimization right

1616
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
um in part of that optimization right
 

1617
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,950
um in part of that optimization right
they'll get on their back leg and they

1618
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
they'll get on their back leg and they
 

1619
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,110
they'll get on their back leg and they
will slide across the floor and it's

1620
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
will slide across the floor and it's
 

1621
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,149
will slide across the floor and it's
because of the optimization the

1622
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:41,159
because of the optimization the
 

1623
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,350
because of the optimization the
enforcement learning optimization on

1624
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,360
enforcement learning optimization on
 

1625
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,669
enforcement learning optimization on
that agent has figured out a way to

1626
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:43,679
that agent has figured out a way to
 

1627
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,810
that agent has figured out a way to
extract infinite energy from the

1628
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:44,820
extract infinite energy from the
 

1629
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,690
extract infinite energy from the
friction forces and basically their poor

1630
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:47,700
friction forces and basically their poor
 

1631
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,669
friction forces and basically their poor
implementation and they found a way to

1632
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:49,679
implementation and they found a way to
 

1633
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,049
implementation and they found a way to
generate infinite energy and just slide

1634
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:51,059
generate infinite energy and just slide
 

1635
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,430
generate infinite energy and just slide
across the surface and it's not what you

1636
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:52,440
across the surface and it's not what you
 

1637
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,950
across the surface and it's not what you
expected it's just a it's sort of like a

1638
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
expected it's just a it's sort of like a
 

1639
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,289
expected it's just a it's sort of like a
perverse solution and so maybe we can

1640
00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:57,299
perverse solution and so maybe we can
 

1641
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:58,730
perverse solution and so maybe we can
find something like that maybe we can be

1642
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:58,740
find something like that maybe we can be
 

1643
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,049
find something like that maybe we can be
that little

1644
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:00,059
that little
 

1645
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:03,610
that little
dog in this physical simulation the the

1646
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:03,620
dog in this physical simulation the the
 

1647
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,350
dog in this physical simulation the the
cracks or escapes the intended

1648
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:06,360
cracks or escapes the intended
 

1649
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,269
cracks or escapes the intended
consequences of the physics that the

1650
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:08,279
consequences of the physics that the
 

1651
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,190
consequences of the physics that the
Universe came up with we'll figure out

1652
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,200
Universe came up with we'll figure out
 

1653
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,750
Universe came up with we'll figure out
some kind of shortcut to some weirdness

1654
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
some kind of shortcut to some weirdness
 

1655
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,789
some kind of shortcut to some weirdness
yeah and then oh man but see the problem

1656
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:13,799
yeah and then oh man but see the problem
 

1657
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,070
yeah and then oh man but see the problem
with that weirdness is the first person

1658
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
with that weirdness is the first person
 

1659
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,470
with that weirdness is the first person
to discover the weirdness like sliding

1660
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
to discover the weirdness like sliding
 

1661
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,850
to discover the weirdness like sliding
in the back legs

1662
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:19,860
in the back legs
 

1663
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,630
in the back legs
that's all we're going to do yeah it's

1664
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:23,640
that's all we're going to do yeah it's
 

1665
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,850
that's all we're going to do yeah it's
very quickly because everybody does that

1666
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:25,860
very quickly because everybody does that
 

1667
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,029
very quickly because everybody does that
thing so like the the paper clip

1668
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039
thing so like the the paper clip
 

1669
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,789
thing so like the the paper clip
maximizer is a ridiculous idea but that

1670
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:31,799
maximizer is a ridiculous idea but that
 

1671
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,070
maximizer is a ridiculous idea but that
very well you know could be what then

1672
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,080
very well you know could be what then
 

1673
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,010
very well you know could be what then
we'll just uh we'll just all switch that

1674
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,020
we'll just uh we'll just all switch that
 

1675
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,810
we'll just uh we'll just all switch that
because it's so fun well no person will

1676
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:38,820
because it's so fun well no person will
 

1677
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,250
because it's so fun well no person will
Discover it I think by the way I think

1678
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:40,260
Discover it I think by the way I think
 

1679
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,590
Discover it I think by the way I think
it's going to have to be uh some kind of

1680
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:42,600
it's going to have to be uh some kind of
 

1681
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,990
it's going to have to be uh some kind of
a super intelligent AGI of a third

1682
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,000
a super intelligent AGI of a third
 

1683
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,430
a super intelligent AGI of a third
generation

1684
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:46,440
generation
 

1685
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,870
generation
like we're building the first generation

1686
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:47,880
like we're building the first generation
 

1687
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,330
like we're building the first generation
AGI you know

1688
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:50,340
AGI you know
 

1689
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,330
AGI you know
third generation yeah so the the

1690
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:53,340
third generation yeah so the the
 

1691
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,690
third generation yeah so the the
Bootloader for an AI the that AI yeah

1692
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:56,700
Bootloader for an AI the that AI yeah
 

1693
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,930
Bootloader for an AI the that AI yeah
will be a Bootloader for another AI yeah

1694
00:29:59,930 --> 00:29:59,940
will be a Bootloader for another AI yeah
 

1695
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,029
will be a Bootloader for another AI yeah
and then there's no way for us to

1696
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:02,039
and then there's no way for us to
 

1697
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,130
and then there's no way for us to
introspect like what that might even uh

1698
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:04,140
introspect like what that might even uh
 

1699
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,210
introspect like what that might even uh
I think it's very likely that these

1700
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,220
I think it's very likely that these
 

1701
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,529
I think it's very likely that these
things for example like say you have

1702
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:06,539
things for example like say you have
 

1703
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,570
things for example like say you have
these agis it's very like for example

1704
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:08,580
these agis it's very like for example
 

1705
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,789
these agis it's very like for example
they will be completely inert I like

1706
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
they will be completely inert I like
 

1707
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,169
they will be completely inert I like
these kinds of sci-fi books sometimes

1708
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:12,179
these kinds of sci-fi books sometimes
 

1709
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,789
these kinds of sci-fi books sometimes
where these things are just completely

1710
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:13,799
where these things are just completely
 

1711
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,049
where these things are just completely
inert they don't interact with anything

1712
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:15,059
inert they don't interact with anything
 

1713
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:16,430
inert they don't interact with anything
and I find that kind of beautiful

1714
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:16,440
and I find that kind of beautiful
 

1715
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,250
and I find that kind of beautiful
because uh they probably they've

1716
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,260
because uh they probably they've
 

1717
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,870
because uh they probably they've
probably figured out the meta game of

1718
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,880
probably figured out the meta game of
 

1719
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,070
probably figured out the meta game of
the universe in some way potentially

1720
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
the universe in some way potentially
 

1721
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,450
the universe in some way potentially
they're they're doing something

1722
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:23,460
they're they're doing something
 

1723
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,490
they're they're doing something
completely beyond our imagination

1724
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:25,500
completely beyond our imagination
 

1725
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,590
completely beyond our imagination
um and uh they don't interact with

1726
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
um and uh they don't interact with
 

1727
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,590
um and uh they don't interact with
simple chemical life forms like why

1728
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:30,600
simple chemical life forms like why
 

1729
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,690
simple chemical life forms like why
would you do that so I find those kinds

1730
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:32,700
would you do that so I find those kinds
 

1731
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,370
would you do that so I find those kinds
of ideas compelling what's their source

1732
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:34,380
of ideas compelling what's their source
 

1733
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,930
of ideas compelling what's their source
of fun what are they what are they doing

1734
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:35,940
of fun what are they what are they doing
 

1735
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,970
of fun what are they what are they doing
what's the source of solving in the

1736
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:37,980
what's the source of solving in the
 

1737
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,990
what's the source of solving in the
universe

1738

universe
 

1739
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,590
universe
but inert so can you define what it

1740
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:42,600
but inert so can you define what it
 

1741
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,730
but inert so can you define what it
means inert so they escape

1742
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:45,740
means inert so they escape
 

1743
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,450
means inert so they escape
as in um

1744
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:50,460

 

1745
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,130

they will behave in some very like

1746
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,140
they will behave in some very like
 

1747
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,289
they will behave in some very like
strange way to us because they're uh

1748
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:54,299
strange way to us because they're uh
 

1749
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,450
strange way to us because they're uh
they're beyond they're playing The Meta

1751
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,070
they're beyond they're playing The Meta
game uh and The Meta game is probably

1752
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
game uh and The Meta game is probably
 

1753
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,510
game uh and The Meta game is probably
say like arranging quantum mechanical

1754
00:30:59,510 --> 00:30:59,520
say like arranging quantum mechanical
 

1755
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,310
say like arranging quantum mechanical
systems in some very weird ways to

1756
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,320
systems in some very weird ways to
 

1757
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,830
systems in some very weird ways to
extract Infinite Energy uh solve the

1758
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
extract Infinite Energy uh solve the
 

1759
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,389
extract Infinite Energy uh solve the
digital expansion of Pi to whatever

00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:08,220
amount uh they will build their own like
 

1763
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,950
amount uh they will build their own like
little Fusion reactors or something

1764
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:09,960
little Fusion reactors or something
 

1765
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,269
little Fusion reactors or something
crazy like they're doing something

1766
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
crazy like they're doing something

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
Beyond Comprehension and uh not
 

1769
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,110

brilliant under the hood what if quantum

1772
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
brilliant under the hood what if quantum
 

1773
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,630

mechanics itself is the system and we're

1774
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
mechanics itself is the system and we're
 

1775
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,810
mechanics itself is the system and we're
just thinking it's physics

1776
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:23,820
just thinking it's physics
 

1777
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,230
just thinking it's physics
but we're really parasites on on or not

1778
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,240
but we're really parasites on on or not
 

1779
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,490
but we're really parasites on on or not
parasite we're not really hurting

organisms this organism and we're like

1784
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:33,299
organisms this organism and we're like
 

1785
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,630
organisms this organism and we're like
trying to understand it but really it is

1786
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:35,640
trying to understand it but really it is
 

1787
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,610
trying to understand it but really it is
an organism and with a deep deep

1788
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:37,620
an organism and with a deep deep
 

1789
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,649
an organism and with a deep deep
intelligence maybe physics itself is

1790
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:41,659
intelligence maybe physics itself is
 

1791
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:45,830
intelligence maybe physics itself is
uh the the organism that's doing a super

1792
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
uh the the organism that's doing a super
 

1793
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,450
uh the the organism that's doing a super
interesting thing and we're just like

1794
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:47,460
interesting thing and we're just like
 

1795
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,930
interesting thing and we're just like
one little thing yeah ant sitting on top

1796
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:50,940
one little thing yeah ant sitting on top
 

1797
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,730
one little thing yeah ant sitting on top
of it trying to get energy from it we're

1798
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:52,740
of it trying to get energy from it we're
 

1799
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,470
of it trying to get energy from it we're
just kind of like these particles in a

1800
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
just kind of like these particles in a
 

1801
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,850
just kind of like these particles in a
wave that I feel like is mostly

1802
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:55,860
wave that I feel like is mostly
 

1803
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,010
wave that I feel like is mostly
deterministic and takes uh Universe from

1804
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,020
deterministic and takes uh Universe from
 

1805
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,169
deterministic and takes uh Universe from
some kind of a big bang to some kind of

1806
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:00,179
some kind of a big bang to some kind of
 

1807
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,690
some kind of a big bang to some kind of
a super intelligent replicator some kind

1808
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:02,700
a super intelligent replicator some kind
 

1809
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,330
a super intelligent replicator some kind
of a stable point in the universe given

1810
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:05,340
of a stable point in the universe given
 

1811
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,029
of a stable point in the universe given
these laws of physics you don't think uh

1812
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:08,039
these laws of physics you don't think uh
 

1813
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,370
these laws of physics you don't think uh
as Einstein said God doesn't play dice

1814
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:10,380
as Einstein said God doesn't play dice
 

1815
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,649
as Einstein said God doesn't play dice
so you think it's mostly deterministic

1816
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:12,659
so you think it's mostly deterministic
 

1817
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,029
so you think it's mostly deterministic
there's no Randomness in the thing I

1818
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:14,039
there's no Randomness in the thing I
 

1819
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,470
there's no Randomness in the thing I
think it's deterministic oh there's tons

1820
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:15,480
think it's deterministic oh there's tons
 

1821
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,690
think it's deterministic oh there's tons
of uh well I'm I want to be careful with

1822
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:17,700
of uh well I'm I want to be careful with
 

1823
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,970
of uh well I'm I want to be careful with
Randomness pseudo random yeah I don't

1824
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:19,980
Randomness pseudo random yeah I don't
 

1825
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,130
Randomness pseudo random yeah I don't
like random uh I think maybe the laws of

1826
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,140
like random uh I think maybe the laws of
 

1827
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,870
like random uh I think maybe the laws of
physics are deterministic

1828
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:23,880
physics are deterministic
 

1829
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,669
physics are deterministic
um yeah I think they're determinants

1830
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:25,679
um yeah I think they're determinants
 

1831
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,289
um yeah I think they're determinants
just got really uncomfortable with this

1832
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:27,299
just got really uncomfortable with this
 

1833
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:28,690
just got really uncomfortable with this
question

1834
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:28,700
question
 

1835
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,070
question
do you have anxiety about whether the

1836
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,080
do you have anxiety about whether the
 

1837
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,789
do you have anxiety about whether the
universe is random or not

1838
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:33,799
universe is random or not
 

1839
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,070
universe is random or not
what's there's no Randomness uh you say

1840
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,080
what's there's no Randomness uh you say
 

1841
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,570
what's there's no Randomness uh you say
you like Goodwill Hunting it's not your

1842
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:38,580
you like Goodwill Hunting it's not your
 

1843
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,269
you like Goodwill Hunting it's not your
fault Andre it's not it's not your fault

1844
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
fault Andre it's not it's not your fault
 

1845
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,529
fault Andre it's not it's not your fault
man

1846
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:42,539
man
 

1847
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,590
man
um so you don't like Randomness uh yeah

1848
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
um so you don't like Randomness uh yeah
 

1849
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,690
um so you don't like Randomness uh yeah
I think it's uh unsettling I think it's

1850
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:47,700
I think it's uh unsettling I think it's
 

1851
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,370
I think it's uh unsettling I think it's
a deterministic system I think that

1852
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:49,380
a deterministic system I think that
 

1853
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,710
a deterministic system I think that
things that look random like say the uh

1854
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:51,720
things that look random like say the uh
 

1855
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,630
things that look random like say the uh
collapse of the wave function Etc I

1856
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:53,640
collapse of the wave function Etc I
 

1857
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,769
collapse of the wave function Etc I
think they're actually deterministic

1858
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:54,779
think they're actually deterministic
 

1859
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,470
think they're actually deterministic
just entanglement uh and so on and uh

1860
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:57,480
just entanglement uh and so on and uh
 

1861
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,730
just entanglement uh and so on and uh
some kind of a Multiverse Theory

1862
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:58,740
some kind of a Multiverse Theory
 

1863
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,830
some kind of a Multiverse Theory
something something okay so why does it

1864
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:00,840
something something okay so why does it
 

1865
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,889
something something okay so why does it
feel like we have a free will like if I

1866
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:03,899
feel like we have a free will like if I
 

1867
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,190
feel like we have a free will like if I
raise the hand I chose to do this now

1868
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
raise the hand I chose to do this now
 

1869
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,549
raise the hand I chose to do this now
um what

1870
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:09,559
um what
 

1871
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,990
um what
that doesn't feel like a deterministic

1872
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
that doesn't feel like a deterministic
 

1873
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,330
that doesn't feel like a deterministic
thing it feels like I'm making a choice

1874
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:14,340
thing it feels like I'm making a choice
 

1875
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,549
thing it feels like I'm making a choice
it feels like it okay so it's all

1876
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
it feels like it okay so it's all
 

1877
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,610
it feels like it okay so it's all
feelings it's just feelings yeah so when

1878
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:19,620
feelings it's just feelings yeah so when
 

1879
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,630
feelings it's just feelings yeah so when
an RL agent is making a choice is that

1880
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:23,640
an RL agent is making a choice is that
 

1881
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,529
an RL agent is making a choice is that
um

1882
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:24,539
um
 

1883
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,149
um
it's not really making a choice the

1884
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,159
it's not really making a choice the
 

1885
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,950
it's not really making a choice the
choices are all already there yeah

1886
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:27,960
choices are all already there yeah
 

1887
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,090
choices are all already there yeah
you're interpreting the choice and

1888
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,100
you're interpreting the choice and
 

1889
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,009
you're interpreting the choice and
you're creating a narrative for or

1890

00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:48,899
and grow in interesting ways just what
 

1907
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,590
and grow in interesting ways just what
what cool ideas like like we made you

1908
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
what cool ideas like like we made you
 

1909
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,310
what cool ideas like like we made you
sit back and go hmm small big or small

1910
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,320
sit back and go hmm small big or small
 

1911
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,570
sit back and go hmm small big or small
well the one that I've been thinking

1912
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:56,580
well the one that I've been thinking
 

1913
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,470
well the one that I've been thinking
about recently the most probably is the

1914
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,480
about recently the most probably is the
 

1915
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,690
about recently the most probably is the
the Transformer architecture

1916
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:02,700
the Transformer architecture
 

1917
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,690
the Transformer architecture
um so basically uh neural networks have

1918
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:05,700
um so basically uh neural networks have
 

1919
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,909
um so basically uh neural networks have
a lot of architectures that were trendy

1920
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
a lot of architectures that were trendy
 

1921
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,250
a lot of architectures that were trendy
have come and gone for different sensory

1922
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,260
have come and gone for different sensory
 

1923
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,409
have come and gone for different sensory
modalities like for Vision Audio text

1924
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:12,419
modalities like for Vision Audio text
 

1925
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:13,730
modalities like for Vision Audio text
you would process them with different

1926
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:13,740
you would process them with different
 

1927
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,589
you would process them with different
looking neural nuts and recently we've

1928
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
looking neural nuts and recently we've
 

1929
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,450
looking neural nuts and recently we've
seen these convergence towards one

1930
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:17,460
seen these convergence towards one
 

1931
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,030
seen these convergence towards one
architecture the Transformer and you can

1932
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,040
architecture the Transformer and you can
 

1933
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,010
architecture the Transformer and you can
feed it video or you can feed it you

1934
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,020
feed it video or you can feed it you
 

1935
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,690
feed it video or you can feed it you
know images or speech or text and it

1936
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:23,700
know images or speech or text and it
 

1937
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,369
know images or speech or text and it
just gobbles it up and it's kind of like

1938
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:25,379
just gobbles it up and it's kind of like
 

1939
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,490
just gobbles it up and it's kind of like
a bit of a general purpose uh computer

1940
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:28,500
a bit of a general purpose uh computer
 

1941
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,169
a bit of a general purpose uh computer
that is also trainable and very

1942
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:30,179
that is also trainable and very
 

1943
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,790
that is also trainable and very
efficient to run on our Hardware

1944
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:31,800
efficient to run on our Hardware
 

1945
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,810
efficient to run on our Hardware
and so uh this paper came out in 2016 I

1946
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:35,820
and so uh this paper came out in 2016 I
 

1947
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,770
and so uh this paper came out in 2016 I
want to say

1948
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:36,780
want to say
 

1949
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,329
want to say
um attention is all you need attention

1950
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:38,339
um attention is all you need attention
 

1951
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,430
um attention is all you need attention
is all you need you criticize the paper

1952
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:40,440
is all you need you criticize the paper
 

1953
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,909
is all you need you criticize the paper
title in retrospect that it wasn't

1954
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,919
title in retrospect that it wasn't
 

1955
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,270
title in retrospect that it wasn't
um it didn't foresee the bigness of the

1956
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:47,280
um it didn't foresee the bigness of the
 

1957
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,889
um it didn't foresee the bigness of the
impact yeah that it was going to have

1958
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:48,899
impact yeah that it was going to have
 

1959
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,089
impact yeah that it was going to have
yeah I'm not sure if the authors were

1960
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:50,099
yeah I'm not sure if the authors were
 

1961
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,829
yeah I'm not sure if the authors were
aware of the impact that that paper

1962
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
aware of the impact that that paper
 

1963
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,210
aware of the impact that that paper
would go on to have probably they

1964
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:53,220
would go on to have probably they
 

1965
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,310
would go on to have probably they
weren't but I think they were aware of

1966
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:55,320
weren't but I think they were aware of
 

1967
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,810
weren't but I think they were aware of
some of the motivations and design

1968
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:56,820
some of the motivations and design
 

1969
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,310
some of the motivations and design
decisions beyond the Transformer and

1970
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
decisions beyond the Transformer and
 

1971
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,349
decisions beyond the Transformer and
they chose not to I think expand on it

1972
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:00,359
they chose not to I think expand on it
 

1973
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,329
they chose not to I think expand on it
in that way in the paper and so I think

1974
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:02,339
in that way in the paper and so I think
 

1975
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,730
in that way in the paper and so I think
they had an idea that there was more

1976
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:04,740
they had an idea that there was more
 

1977
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,070
they had an idea that there was more
um than just the surface of just like oh

1978
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,080
um than just the surface of just like oh
 

1979
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,270
um than just the surface of just like oh
we're just doing translation and here's

1980
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,280
we're just doing translation and here's
 

1981
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,530
we're just doing translation and here's
a better architecture you're not just

1982
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:09,540
a better architecture you're not just
 

1983
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,970
a better architecture you're not just
doing translation this is like a really

1984
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:10,980
doing translation this is like a really
 

1985
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,770
doing translation this is like a really
cool differentiable optimizable

1986
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:12,780
cool differentiable optimizable
 

1987
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,450
cool differentiable optimizable
efficient computer that you've proposed

1988
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:14,460
efficient computer that you've proposed
 

1989
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,430
efficient computer that you've proposed
and maybe they didn't have all of that

1990
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:16,440
and maybe they didn't have all of that
 

1991
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,630
and maybe they didn't have all of that
foresight but I think is really

1992
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:17,640
foresight but I think is really
 

1993
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,430
foresight but I think is really
interesting isn't it funny sorry to

1994
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
interesting isn't it funny sorry to
 

1995
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,730
interesting isn't it funny sorry to
interrupt that title is memeable that

1996
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:22,740
interrupt that title is memeable that
 

1997
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,670
interrupt that title is memeable that
they went for such a profound idea they

1998
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
they went for such a profound idea they
 

1999
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,650
they went for such a profound idea they
went with the I don't think anyone used

2000
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:27,660
went with the I don't think anyone used
 

2001
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,970
went with the I don't think anyone used
that kind of title before right

2002
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:28,980
that kind of title before right
 

2003
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,710

protection is all you need yeah it's

2004
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:30,720
protection is all you need yeah it's
 

2005
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,810
protection is all you need yeah it's
like a meme or something exactly it's

2006
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:32,820
like a meme or something exactly it's
 

2007
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,710
like a meme or something exactly it's
not funny that one like uh maybe if it

2008
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,720
not funny that one like uh maybe if it
 

2009
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,970
not funny that one like uh maybe if it
was a more serious title it wouldn't

2010
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:37,980
was a more serious title it wouldn't
 

2011
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,069
was a more serious title it wouldn't
have the impact honestly I yeah there is

2012
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
have the impact honestly I yeah there is
 

2013
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,930
have the impact honestly I yeah there is
an element of me that honestly agrees

2014
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:41,940
an element of me that honestly agrees
 

2015
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,130
an element of me that honestly agrees
with you and prefers it this way yes

2016
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,140

00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:31,320
and you want to train this computer so
 

2061
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,230
and you want to train this computer so
you want to set its weights and I think

00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:33,240
you want to set its weights and I think
 

2063
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,849
you want to set its weights and I think
there's a number of design criteria that

2064
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:34,859
there's a number of design criteria that
 

2065
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,890
there's a number of design criteria that
sort of overlap in the Transformer

2066
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:36,900
sort of overlap in the Transformer
 

2067
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,569
sort of overlap in the Transformer
simultaneously that made it very

2068
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:38,579
simultaneously that made it very
 

2069
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,069
simultaneously that made it very
successful and I think the authors were

2070
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,079
successful and I think the authors were
 

2071
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,130
successful and I think the authors were
kind of uh deliberately trying to make

2072
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:43,140
kind of uh deliberately trying to make
 

2073
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,030
kind of uh deliberately trying to make
this really powerful architecture and um

2074
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,040
this really powerful architecture and um
 

2075
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,270
this really powerful architecture and um
so basically it's very powerful in the

2076
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:50,280
so basically it's very powerful in the
 

2077
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,410
so basically it's very powerful in the
forward pass because it's able to

2078
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:51,420
forward pass because it's able to
 

2079
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,370
forward pass because it's able to
express

2080
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:52,380
express
 

2081
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,390
express
um very general computation as a sort of

2082
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,400
um very general computation as a sort of
 

2083
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,170
um very general computation as a sort of
something that looks like message

2084
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:57,180
something that looks like message
 

2085
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,089
something that looks like message
passing you have nodes and they all

2086
00:36:59,089 --> 00:36:59,099
passing you have nodes and they all
 

2087
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,490
passing you have nodes and they all
store vectors and these nodes get to

2088
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:01,500
store vectors and these nodes get to
 

2089
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,410
store vectors and these nodes get to
basically look at each other and it's

2090
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:03,420
basically look at each other and it's
 

2091
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,390
basically look at each other and it's
each other's vectors and they get to

2092
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:05,400
each other's vectors and they get to
 

2093
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,670
each other's vectors and they get to
communicate and basically notes get to

2094
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,680
communicate and basically notes get to
 

2095
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,589
communicate and basically notes get to
broadcast hey I'm looking for certain

2096
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599
broadcast hey I'm looking for certain
 

2097
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,970
broadcast hey I'm looking for certain
things and then other nodes get to

2098
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:10,980
things and then other nodes get to
 

2099
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,290
things and then other nodes get to
broadcast hey these are the things I

2100
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:12,300
broadcast hey these are the things I
 

2101
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,730
broadcast hey these are the things I
have those are the keys and the values

2102
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:13,740
have those are the keys and the values
 

2103
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,470
have those are the keys and the values
so it's not just the tension yeah

2104
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:15,480
so it's not just the tension yeah
 

2105
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,730
so it's not just the tension yeah
exactly Transformer is much more than

2106
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:16,740
exactly Transformer is much more than
 

2107
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,170
exactly Transformer is much more than
just the attention component it's got

2108
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:18,180
just the attention component it's got
 

2109
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,910
just the attention component it's got
many pieces architectural that went into

2110
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:19,920
many pieces architectural that went into
 

2111
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,349
many pieces architectural that went into
it the residual connection of the way

2112
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
it the residual connection of the way
 

2113
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,210
it the residual connection of the way
it's arranged there's a multi-layer

2114
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:23,220
it's arranged there's a multi-layer
 

2115
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,490
it's arranged there's a multi-layer
perceptron in there the way it's stacked

2116
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:25,500
perceptron in there the way it's stacked
 

2117
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,750
perceptron in there the way it's stacked
and so on

2118
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:26,760
and so on
 

2119
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,950
and so on
um but basically there's a message

2120
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:27,960
um but basically there's a message
 

2121
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,510
um but basically there's a message
passing scheme where nodes get to look

2122
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
passing scheme where nodes get to look
 

2123
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,890
passing scheme where nodes get to look
at each other decide what's interesting

2124
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:30,900
at each other decide what's interesting
 

2125
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,710
at each other decide what's interesting
and then update each other and uh so I

2126
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:33,720
and then update each other and uh so I
 

2127
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,690
and then update each other and uh so I
think the um when you get to the details

2128
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:35,700
think the um when you get to the details
 

2129
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,010
think the um when you get to the details
of it I think it's a very expressive

2130
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,020
of it I think it's a very expressive
 

2131
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,109
of it I think it's a very expressive
function uh so it can express lots of

2132
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
function uh so it can express lots of
 

2133
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,130
function uh so it can express lots of
different types of algorithms and

2134
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,140
different types of algorithms and
 

2135
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,870
different types of algorithms and
forward paths not only that but the way

2136
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:41,880
forward paths not only that but the way
 

2137
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,310
forward paths not only that but the way
it's designed with the residual

2138
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:43,320
it's designed with the residual
 

2139
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,870
it's designed with the residual
connections layer normalizations the

2140
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
connections layer normalizations the
 

2141
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,670
connections layer normalizations the
softmax attention and everything it's

2142
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:46,680
softmax attention and everything it's
 

2143
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,170
softmax attention and everything it's
also optimizable this is a really big

2144
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,180
also optimizable this is a really big
 

2145
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,690
also optimizable this is a really big
deal because there's lots of computers

2146
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:50,700
deal because there's lots of computers
 

2147
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,829
deal because there's lots of computers
that are powerful that you can't

2148
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:51,839
that are powerful that you can't
 

2149
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,990
that are powerful that you can't
optimize or they're not easy to optimize

2150
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,000
optimize or they're not easy to optimize
 

2151
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,310
optimize or they're not easy to optimize
using the techniques that we have which

2152
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:55,320
using the techniques that we have which
 

2153
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,569
using the techniques that we have which
is back propagation and gradient and

2154
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:56,579
is back propagation and gradient and
 

2155
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,250
is back propagation and gradient and
send these are first order methods very

2156
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:58,260
send these are first order methods very
 

2157
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,950
send these are first order methods very
simple optimizers really and so

2158
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
simple optimizers really and so
 

2159
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,530
simple optimizers really and so
um you also need it to be optimizable

2160
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:03,540
um you also need it to be optimizable
 

2161
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,569
um you also need it to be optimizable
um and then lastly you want it to run

2162
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:05,579
um and then lastly you want it to run
 

2163
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,089
um and then lastly you want it to run
efficiently in the hardware our Hardware

2164
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:07,099
efficiently in the hardware our Hardware
 

2165
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:09,890
efficiently in the hardware our Hardware
is a massive throughput machine like

2166
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:09,900
is a massive throughput machine like
 

2167
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,370
is a massive throughput machine like
gpus they prefer lots of parallelism so

2168
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:13,380
gpus they prefer lots of parallelism so
 

2169
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,630
gpus they prefer lots of parallelism so
you don't want to do lots of sequential

2170
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
you don't want to do lots of sequential
 

2171
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,829
you don't want to do lots of sequential
operations you want to do a lot of

2172
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839
operations you want to do a lot of
 

2173
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,690
operations you want to do a lot of
operations serially and the Transformer

2174
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:17,700
operations serially and the Transformer
 

2175
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,950
operations serially and the Transformer
is designed with that in mind as well

2176
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
is designed with that in mind as well
 

2177
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,230
is designed with that in mind as well
and so it's designed for our hardware

2178
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,240
and so it's designed for our hardware
 

2179
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,790
and so it's designed for our hardware
and it's designed to both be very

2180
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
and it's designed to both be very
 

2181
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,470
and it's designed to both be very
expressive in a forward pass but also

2182
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480
expressive in a forward pass but also
 

2183
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,970
expressive in a forward pass but also
very optimizable in the backward pass

2184
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:25,980
very optimizable in the backward pass
 

2185
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,970
very optimizable in the backward pass
and you said that uh the residual

2186
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:28,980
and you said that uh the residual
 

2187
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,710
and you said that uh the residual
connections support a kind of ability to

2188
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
connections support a kind of ability to
 

2189
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,349
connections support a kind of ability to
learn short algorithms fast them first

2190
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
learn short algorithms fast them first
 

2191
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,230
learn short algorithms fast them first
and then gradually extend them longer

2192
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:36,240
and then gradually extend them longer
 

2193
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,970
and then gradually extend them longer
during training yeah what's what's the

2194
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:37,980
during training yeah what's what's the
 

2195
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,950
during training yeah what's what's the
idea of learning short algorithms right

2196
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:39,960
idea of learning short algorithms right
 

2197
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,870
idea of learning short algorithms right
think of it as a so basically a

2198
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:41,880
think of it as a so basically a
 

2199
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,589
think of it as a so basically a
Transformer is a series of uh blocks

2200
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
Transformer is a series of uh blocks
 

2201
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,970
Transformer is a series of uh blocks
right and these blocks have attention

2202
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:46,980
right and these blocks have attention
 

2203
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,890
right and these blocks have attention
and a little multi-layer perceptron and

2204
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:48,900
and a little multi-layer perceptron and
 

2205
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,810
and a little multi-layer perceptron and
so you you go off into a block and you

2206
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:50,820
so you you go off into a block and you
 

2207
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,550
so you you go off into a block and you
come back to this residual pathway and

2208
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
come back to this residual pathway and
 

2209
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,630
come back to this residual pathway and
then you go off and you come back and

2210
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:53,640
then you go off and you come back and
 

2211
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,530
then you go off and you come back and
then you have a number of layers

2212
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:54,540
then you have a number of layers
 

2213
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,930
then you have a number of layers
arranged sequentially and so the way to

2214
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:56,940
arranged sequentially and so the way to
 

2215
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,790
arranged sequentially and so the way to
look at it I think is because of the

2216
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:58,800
look at it I think is because of the
 

2217
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,530
look at it I think is because of the
residual pathway in the backward path

2218
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:00,540
residual pathway in the backward path
 

2219
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,050
residual pathway in the backward path
the gradients uh sort of flow along it

2220
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,060
the gradients uh sort of flow along it
 

2221
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,510
the gradients uh sort of flow along it
uninterrupted because addition

2222
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:05,520
uninterrupted because addition
 

2223
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,430
uninterrupted because addition
distributes the gradient equally to all

2224
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,440
distributes the gradient equally to all
 

2225
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,349
distributes the gradient equally to all
of its branches so the gradient from the

2226
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
of its branches so the gradient from the
 

2227
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,510
of its branches so the gradient from the
supervision at the top uh just floats

2228
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
supervision at the top uh just floats
 

2229
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,750
supervision at the top uh just floats
directly to the first layer and the all

2230
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:14,760
directly to the first layer and the all
 

2231
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,550
directly to the first layer and the all
the residual connections are arranged so

2232
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
the residual connections are arranged so
 

2233
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,450
the residual connections are arranged so
that in the beginning during

2234
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:17,460
that in the beginning during
 

2235
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,950
that in the beginning during
initialization they contribute nothing

2236
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960
initialization they contribute nothing
 

2237
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,230
initialization they contribute nothing
to the residual pathway

2238
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,240
to the residual pathway
 

2239
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,849
to the residual pathway
um so what it kind of looks like is

2240
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:22,859
um so what it kind of looks like is
 

2241
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,349
um so what it kind of looks like is
imagine the Transformer is kind of like

2242
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:24,359
imagine the Transformer is kind of like
 

2243
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,829
imagine the Transformer is kind of like
a uh python uh function like a death

2244
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
a uh python uh function like a death
 

2245
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,710
a uh python uh function like a death
and um you get to do various kinds of

2246
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
and um you get to do various kinds of
 

2247
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,930
and um you get to do various kinds of
like lines of code say you have a

2248
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:32,940
like lines of code say you have a
 

2249
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,329
like lines of code say you have a
hundred layers deep Transformer

2250
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:35,339
hundred layers deep Transformer
 

2251
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,710
hundred layers deep Transformer
typically they would be much shorter say

2252
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,720
typically they would be much shorter say
 

2253
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,450
typically they would be much shorter say
20. so if 20 lines of code then you can

2254
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:38,460
20. so if 20 lines of code then you can
 

2255
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,190
20. so if 20 lines of code then you can
do something in them and so think of

2256
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,200
do something in them and so think of
 

2257
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,569
do something in them and so think of
during the optimization basically what

2258
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:41,579
during the optimization basically what
 

2259
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,829
during the optimization basically what
it looks like is first you optimize the

2260
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:42,839
it looks like is first you optimize the
 

2261
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,030
it looks like is first you optimize the
first line of code and then the second

2262
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,040
first line of code and then the second
 

2263
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,530
first line of code and then the second
line of code can kick in and the third

2264
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:45,540
line of code can kick in and the third
 

2265
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,810
line of code can kick in and the third
line of code can and I kind of feel like

2266
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:47,820
line of code can and I kind of feel like
 

2267
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,250
line of code can and I kind of feel like
because of the residual pathway and the

2268
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,260
because of the residual pathway and the
 

2269
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,290
because of the residual pathway and the
Dynamics of the optimization you can

2270
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:51,300
Dynamics of the optimization you can
 

2271
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,030
Dynamics of the optimization you can
sort of learn a very short algorithm

2272
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,040
sort of learn a very short algorithm
 

2273
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,589
sort of learn a very short algorithm
that gets the approximate tensor but

2274
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:54,599
that gets the approximate tensor but
 

2275
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,089
that gets the approximate tensor but
then the other layers can sort of kick

2276
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:56,099
then the other layers can sort of kick
 

2277
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,349
then the other layers can sort of kick
in and start to create a contribution

2278
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:57,359
in and start to create a contribution
 

2279
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,089
in and start to create a contribution
and at the end of it you're you're

2280
00:39:59,089 --> 00:39:59,099
and at the end of it you're you're
 

2281
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,010
and at the end of it you're you're
optimizing over an algorithm that is 20

2282
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:01,020
optimizing over an algorithm that is 20
 

2283
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,390
optimizing over an algorithm that is 20
lines of code

2284
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
lines of code
 

2285
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,770
lines of code
except these lines of code are very

2286
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:03,780
except these lines of code are very
 

2287
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,329
except these lines of code are very
complex because it's an entire block of

2288
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:05,339
complex because it's an entire block of
 

2289
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:06,770
complex because it's an entire block of
a transformer you can do a lot in there

2290
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:06,780
a transformer you can do a lot in there
 

2291
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,030
a transformer you can do a lot in there
what's really interesting is that this

2292
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,040
what's really interesting is that this
 

2293
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,130
what's really interesting is that this
Transformer architecture actually has

2294
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:10,140
Transformer architecture actually has
 

2295
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,109
Transformer architecture actually has
been a remarkably resilient basically

2296
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:12,119
been a remarkably resilient basically
 

2297
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,849
been a remarkably resilient basically
the Transformer that came out in 2016 is

2298
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:13,859
the Transformer that came out in 2016 is
 

2299
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:14,990
the Transformer that came out in 2016 is
the Transformer you would use today

2300
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,000
the Transformer you would use today
 

2301
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,790
the Transformer you would use today
except you reshuffle some of the layer

2302
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:16,800
except you reshuffle some of the layer
 

2303
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,069
except you reshuffle some of the layer
norms the layer normalizations have been

2304
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:19,079
norms the layer normalizations have been
 

2305
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,069
norms the layer normalizations have been
reshuffled to a pre-norm formulation and

2306
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:22,079
reshuffled to a pre-norm formulation and
 

2307
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,810
reshuffled to a pre-norm formulation and
so it's been remarkably stable but

2308
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:23,820
so it's been remarkably stable but
 

2309
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,370
so it's been remarkably stable but
there's a lot of bells and whistles that

2310
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:25,380
there's a lot of bells and whistles that
 

2311
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,050
there's a lot of bells and whistles that
people have attached on and try to uh

2312
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,060
people have attached on and try to uh
 

2313
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,849
people have attached on and try to uh
improve it I do think that basically

2314
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:28,859
improve it I do think that basically
 

2315
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,890
improve it I do think that basically
it's a it's a big step in simultaneously

2316
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:30,900
it's a it's a big step in simultaneously
 

2317
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,990
it's a it's a big step in simultaneously
optimizing for lots of properties of a

00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,000

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,250

desirable neural network architecture

2320
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:34,260
desirable neural network architecture
 

2321
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,690
desirable neural network architecture
and I think people have been trying to

2322
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:35,700
and I think people have been trying to
 

2323
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,069
and I think people have been trying to
change it but it's proven remarkably

2324
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:37,079
change it but it's proven remarkably
 

2325
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,589
change it but it's proven remarkably
resilient but I do think that there

2326
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
resilient but I do think that there
 

2327
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,910
resilient but I do think that there
should be even better architectures

2328
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:40,920
should be even better architectures
 

2329
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,510
should be even better architectures
potentially but it's uh your you admire

2330
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:44,520
potentially but it's uh your you admire
 

2331
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,190
potentially but it's uh your you admire
the resilience here yeah there's

2332
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,200
the resilience here yeah there's
 

2333
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,270
the resilience here yeah there's
something profound about this

2334
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,280
something profound about this
 

2335
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,790
something profound about this

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,829
we can everything can be turned into a

guys is do not touch the Transformer

2384
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,140
guys is do not touch the Transformer
 

2385
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,470
guys is do not touch the Transformer
touch everything else yes so people are

2386
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
touch everything else yes so people are
 

2387
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,730
touch everything else yes so people are
scaling up the data sets making them

2388
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:37,740
scaling up the data sets making them
 

2389
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,990
scaling up the data sets making them
much much bigger they're working on the

2390
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:39,000
much much bigger they're working on the
 

2391
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,490
much much bigger they're working on the
evaluation making the evaluation much

2392
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:40,500
evaluation making the evaluation much
 

2393
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,130

00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,140
much bigger and uh
 

2395
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,510
much bigger and uh
um they're basically keeping the

2396
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:44,520
um they're basically keeping the
 

2397
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,250
um they're basically keeping the
architecture unchanged and that's how

2398
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:46,260
architecture unchanged and that's how
 

2399
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,230
architecture unchanged and that's how
we've um that's the last five years of

00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,240
we've um that's the last five years of
 

2401
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,569
we've um that's the last five years of
progress in AI kind of

2402
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:50,579
progress in AI kind of
 

2403
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,030
progress in AI kind of
what do you think about one flavor of it

2404
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,040
what do you think about one flavor of it
 

2405
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,710
what do you think about one flavor of it
which is language models

2406
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
which is language models
 

2407
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,990
which is language models
have you been surprised

2408
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,000
have you been surprised
 

2409
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,430
have you been surprised
uh

2410
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:58,440
uh
 

2411
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,589
uh
has your sort of imagination been

2412
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:00,599
has your sort of imagination been
 

2413
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,930
has your sort of imagination been
captivated by you mentioned GPT and all

2414
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:02,940
captivated by you mentioned GPT and all
 

2415
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,130
captivated by you mentioned GPT and all
the bigger and bigger and bigger

2416
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:04,140
the bigger and bigger and bigger
 

2417
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,450
the bigger and bigger and bigger
language models

2418
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,460
language models
 

2419
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,690
language models
and uh what are the limits

2420
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:08,700
and uh what are the limits
 

2421
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,290
and uh what are the limits
of those models do you think

2422
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:12,300
of those models do you think
 

2423
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,770
of those models do you think
so just let the task of natural language

2424
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:15,780
so just let the task of natural language
 

2425
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,510
so just let the task of natural language
basically the way GPT is trained right

2426
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
basically the way GPT is trained right
 

2427
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,190
basically the way GPT is trained right
is you just download a mass amount of

2428
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
is you just download a mass amount of
 

2429
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,589
is you just download a mass amount of
text Data from the internet and you try

2430
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:21,599
text Data from the internet and you try
 

2431
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,690
text Data from the internet and you try
to predict the next word in a sequence

2432
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:23,700
to predict the next word in a sequence
 

2433
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,670
to predict the next word in a sequence
roughly speaking you're predicting will

2434
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
roughly speaking you're predicting will
 

2435
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,069
roughly speaking you're predicting will
work chunks but uh roughly speaking

2436
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
work chunks but uh roughly speaking
 

2437
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,050
work chunks but uh roughly speaking
that's it and what's been really

2438
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,060
that's it and what's been really
 

2439
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,670
that's it and what's been really
interesting to watch is

2440
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
interesting to watch is
 

2441
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,050
interesting to watch is
uh basically it's a language model

2442
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,060
uh basically it's a language model
 

2443
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,430
uh basically it's a language model
language models have actually existed

2444
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:34,440
language models have actually existed
 

2445
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,930
language models have actually existed
for a very long time

2446
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:35,940
for a very long time
 

2447
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,730
for a very long time
um there's papers on language modeling

2448
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:37,740
um there's papers on language modeling
 

2449
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,310
um there's papers on language modeling
from 2003 even earlier can you explain

2450
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:40,320
from 2003 even earlier can you explain
 

2451
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,890
from 2003 even earlier can you explain
that case what a language model is uh

2452
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:42,900
that case what a language model is uh
 

2453
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,630
that case what a language model is uh
yeah so language model just basically

2454
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,640
yeah so language model just basically
 

2455
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,910
yeah so language model just basically
the rough idea is um just predicting the

2456
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:46,920
the rough idea is um just predicting the
 

2457
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,190
the rough idea is um just predicting the
next word in a sequence roughly speaking

2458
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,200
next word in a sequence roughly speaking
 

2459
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,109
next word in a sequence roughly speaking
uh so there's a paper from for example

2460
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
uh so there's a paper from for example
 

2461
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,770
uh so there's a paper from for example
bengio and the team from 2003 where for

2462
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:54,780
bengio and the team from 2003 where for
 

2463
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,930
bengio and the team from 2003 where for
the first time they were using a neural

2464
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:56,940
the first time they were using a neural
 

2465
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,790
the first time they were using a neural
network to take say like three or five

2466
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
network to take say like three or five
 

2467
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,530
network to take say like three or five
words and predict the

2468
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:00,540
words and predict the
 

2469
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,630
words and predict the
um next word and they're doing this on

2470
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
um next word and they're doing this on
 

2471
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,250
um next word and they're doing this on
much smaller data sets and the neural

2472
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,260
much smaller data sets and the neural
 

2473
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,990
much smaller data sets and the neural
net is not a Transformer it's a multiple

2474
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,000
net is not a Transformer it's a multiple
 

2475
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,030
net is not a Transformer it's a multiple
error perceptron but but it's the first

2476
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,040
error perceptron but but it's the first
 

2477
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,230
error perceptron but but it's the first
time that a neural network has been

2478
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:09,240
time that a neural network has been
 

2479
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,849
time that a neural network has been
applied in that setting but even before

2480
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:10,859
applied in that setting but even before
 

2481
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,829
applied in that setting but even before
neural networks there were language

2482
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:12,839
neural networks there were language
 

2483
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,950
neural networks there were language
models except they were using engram

2484
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:15,960
models except they were using engram
 

2485
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,650
models except they were using engram
models so engram models are just a count

2486
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:18,660
models so engram models are just a count
 

2487
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,990
models so engram models are just a count
based models so

2488
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,000
based models so
 

2489
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,609
based models so
um if you try to if you start to take

2490
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:22,619
um if you try to if you start to take
 

2491
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,010
um if you try to if you start to take
two words and predict the third one you

2492
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,020
two words and predict the third one you
 

2493
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,870
two words and predict the third one you
just count up how many times you've seen

2494
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
just count up how many times you've seen
 

2495
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,270
just count up how many times you've seen
any two word combinations and what came

2496
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
any two word combinations and what came
 

2497
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,250
any two word combinations and what came
next and what you predict that's coming

2498
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,260
next and what you predict that's coming
 

2499
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,630
next and what you predict that's coming
next is just what you've seen the most

2500
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
next is just what you've seen the most
 

2501
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,010
next is just what you've seen the most
of in the training set

2502
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:34,020
of in the training set
 

2503
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,990
of in the training set
and so language modeling has been around

2504
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
and so language modeling has been around
 

2505
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,490
and so language modeling has been around
for a long time neural networks have

2506
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:37,500
for a long time neural networks have
 

2507
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,870
for a long time neural networks have
done language modeling for a long time

2508
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880
done language modeling for a long time
 

2509
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,329
done language modeling for a long time
so really what's new or interesting or

2510
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:41,339
so really what's new or interesting or
 

2511
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,390
so really what's new or interesting or
exciting is just realizing that when you

2512
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
exciting is just realizing that when you
 

2513
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,710
exciting is just realizing that when you
scale it up

2514
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:45,720
scale it up
 

2515
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,990
scale it up
with a powerful enough neural net

2516
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,000
with a powerful enough neural net
 

2517
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,849
with a powerful enough neural net
Transformer you have all these emergent

2518
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:49,859
Transformer you have all these emergent
 

2519
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:52,609
Transformer you have all these emergent
properties where basically what happens

2520
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:52,619
properties where basically what happens
 

2521
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:55,309
properties where basically what happens
is if you have a large enough data set

2522
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:55,319
is if you have a large enough data set
 

2523
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,930
is if you have a large enough data set
of text

2524
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:56,940
of text
 

2525
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,630
of text
you are in the task of predicting the

2526
00:43:59,630 --> 00:43:59,640
you are in the task of predicting the
 

2527
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,970
you are in the task of predicting the
next word you are multitasking a huge

2528
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:01,980
next word you are multitasking a huge
 

2529
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,069
next word you are multitasking a huge
amount of different kinds of problems

2530
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
amount of different kinds of problems
 

2531
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,010
amount of different kinds of problems
you are multitasking understanding of

2532
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:07,020
you are multitasking understanding of
 

2533
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,349
you are multitasking understanding of
you know chemistry physics human nature

2534
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
you know chemistry physics human nature
 

2535
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,390
you know chemistry physics human nature
lots of things are sort of clustered in

2536
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:11,400
lots of things are sort of clustered in
 

2537
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,589
lots of things are sort of clustered in
that objective it's a very simple

2538
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:12,599
that objective it's a very simple
 

2539
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:13,910
that objective it's a very simple
objective but actually you have to

2540
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:13,920
objective but actually you have to
 

2541
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,589
objective but actually you have to
understand a lot about the world to make

2542
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
understand a lot about the world to make
 

2543
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,109
understand a lot about the world to make
that prediction you just said the U word

2544
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:18,119
that prediction you just said the U word
 

2545
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:21,890
that prediction you just said the U word
understanding uh are you in terms of

2546
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:21,900
understanding uh are you in terms of
 

2547
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,109
understanding uh are you in terms of
chemistry and physics and so on what do

2548
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:24,119
chemistry and physics and so on what do
 

2549
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,730
chemistry and physics and so on what do
you feel like it's doing is it searching

2550
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:25,740
you feel like it's doing is it searching
 

2551
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,349
you feel like it's doing is it searching
for the right context

2552
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
for the right context
 

2553
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,870
for the right context
uh in in like what what is it what is

2554
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:29,880
uh in in like what what is it what is
 

2555
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,569
uh in in like what what is it what is
the actual process Happening Here Yeah

2556
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:32,579
the actual process Happening Here Yeah
 

2557
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:34,609
the actual process Happening Here Yeah
so basically it gets a thousand words

2558
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:34,619
so basically it gets a thousand words
 

2559
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:35,990
so basically it gets a thousand words
and it's trying to predict a thousand at

2560
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
and it's trying to predict a thousand at
 

2561
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,089
and it's trying to predict a thousand at
first and uh in order to do that very

2562
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:38,099
first and uh in order to do that very
 

2563
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:39,950
first and uh in order to do that very
very well over the entire data set

2564
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:39,960
very well over the entire data set
 

2565
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,510
very well over the entire data set
available on the internet you actually

2566
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520
available on the internet you actually
 

2567
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,270
available on the internet you actually
have to basically kind of understand the

2568
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:44,280
have to basically kind of understand the
 

2569
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,550
have to basically kind of understand the
context of of what's going on in there

2570
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:46,560
context of of what's going on in there
 

2571
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,450
context of of what's going on in there
yeah

2572
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:47,460
yeah
 

2573
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,970
yeah
um and uh it's a sufficiently hard

2574
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:49,980
um and uh it's a sufficiently hard
 

2575
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,790
um and uh it's a sufficiently hard
problem that you uh if you have a

2576
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:52,800
problem that you uh if you have a
 

2577
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,170
problem that you uh if you have a
powerful enough computer like a

2578
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,180
powerful enough computer like a
 

2579
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,730
powerful enough computer like a
Transformer you end up with uh

2580
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:55,740
Transformer you end up with uh
 

2581
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,670
Transformer you end up with uh
interesting Solutions and uh you can ask

2582
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:58,680
interesting Solutions and uh you can ask
 

2583
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,790
interesting Solutions and uh you can ask
it uh to all do all kinds of things and

2584
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:01,800
it uh to all do all kinds of things and
 

2585
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,430
it uh to all do all kinds of things and
um it it shows a lot of emerging

2586
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:04,440
um it it shows a lot of emerging
 

2587
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,170
um it it shows a lot of emerging
properties like in context learning that

2588
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:06,180
properties like in context learning that
 

2589
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,270
properties like in context learning that
was the big deal with GPT and the

2590
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:08,280
was the big deal with GPT and the
 

2591
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,890
was the big deal with GPT and the
original paper when they published it is

2592
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:09,900
original paper when they published it is
 

2593
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,930
original paper when they published it is
that you can just sort of uh prompt it

2594
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:11,940
that you can just sort of uh prompt it
 

2595
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,490
that you can just sort of uh prompt it
in various ways and ask it to do various

2596
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:13,500
in various ways and ask it to do various
 

2597
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,750
in various ways and ask it to do various
things and it will just kind of complete

2598
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:14,760
things and it will just kind of complete
 

2599
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,130
things and it will just kind of complete
the sentence but in the process of just

2600
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:16,140
the sentence but in the process of just
 

2601
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,510
the sentence but in the process of just
completing the sentence it's actually

2602
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
completing the sentence it's actually
 

2603
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,250
completing the sentence it's actually
solving all kinds of really uh

2604
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,260
solving all kinds of really uh
 

2605
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,050
solving all kinds of really uh
interesting problems that we care about

2606
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:21,060
interesting problems that we care about
 

2607
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,849
interesting problems that we care about
do you think it's doing something like

2608
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:22,859
do you think it's doing something like
 

2609
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,290
do you think it's doing something like
understanding

2610
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:24,300
understanding
 

2611
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,329
understanding
like and when we use the word

2612
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:26,339
like and when we use the word
 

2613
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,450
like and when we use the word
understanding for us humans

2614
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:29,460
understanding for us humans
 

2615
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,130
understanding for us humans
I think it's doing some understanding it

2616
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:31,140
I think it's doing some understanding it
 

2617
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,470
I think it's doing some understanding it
in its weights it understands I think a

2618
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:33,480
in its weights it understands I think a
 

2619
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,990
in its weights it understands I think a
lot about the world and it has to in

2620
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
lot about the world and it has to in
 

2621
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,130
lot about the world and it has to in
order to predict the next word in a

2622
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:37,140
order to predict the next word in a
 

2623
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,390
order to predict the next word in a
sequence

2624
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:38,400
sequence
 

2625
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,370
sequence
so let's train on the data from the

2626
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:40,380
so let's train on the data from the
 

2627
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,990
so let's train on the data from the
internet

2628
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,000
internet
 

2629
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,089
internet
uh what do you think about this this

2630
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:44,099
uh what do you think about this this
 

2631
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,309
uh what do you think about this this
approach in terms of data sets of using

2632
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:46,319
approach in terms of data sets of using
 

2633
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,890
approach in terms of data sets of using
data from the internet do you think the

2634
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:48,900
data from the internet do you think the
 

2635
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,750
data from the internet do you think the
internet has enough structured data to

2636
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:50,760
internet has enough structured data to
 

2637
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,510
internet has enough structured data to
teach AI about human civilization

2638
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:53,520
teach AI about human civilization
 

2639
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,550
teach AI about human civilization
yeah so I think the internet has a huge

2640
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:55,560
yeah so I think the internet has a huge
 

2641
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,109
yeah so I think the internet has a huge
amount of data I'm not sure if it's a

2642
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:57,119
amount of data I'm not sure if it's a
 

2643
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,390
amount of data I'm not sure if it's a
complete enough set I don't know that uh

2644
00:45:59,390 --> 00:45:59,400
complete enough set I don't know that uh
 

2645
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,030
complete enough set I don't know that uh
text is enough for having a sufficiently

2646
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:02,040
text is enough for having a sufficiently
 

2647
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,730
text is enough for having a sufficiently
powerful AGI as an outcome

2648
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:04,740
powerful AGI as an outcome
 

2649
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,530
powerful AGI as an outcome
um of course there is audio and video

2650
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:06,540
um of course there is audio and video
 

2651
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,970
um of course there is audio and video
and images and all that kind of stuff

2652
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:07,980
and images and all that kind of stuff
 

2653
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,950
and images and all that kind of stuff
yeah so text by itself I'm a little bit

2654
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:09,960
yeah so text by itself I'm a little bit
 

2655
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,390
yeah so text by itself I'm a little bit
suspicious about there's a ton of things

2656
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:11,400
suspicious about there's a ton of things
 

2657
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,490
suspicious about there's a ton of things
we don't put in text in writing uh just

2658
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:13,500
we don't put in text in writing uh just
 

2659
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,990
we don't put in text in writing uh just
because they're obvious to us about how

2660
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:15,000
because they're obvious to us about how
 

2661
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,250
because they're obvious to us about how
the world works and the physics of it

2662
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:16,260
the world works and the physics of it
 

2663
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,809
the world works and the physics of it
and the Things fall we don't put that

2664
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:17,819
and the Things fall we don't put that
 

2665
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:19,250
and the Things fall we don't put that
stuff in text because why would you we

2666
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:19,260
stuff in text because why would you we
 

2667
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,809
stuff in text because why would you we
share that understanding

2668
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:20,819
share that understanding
 

2669
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,430
share that understanding
and so Texas communication medium

2670
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:22,440
and so Texas communication medium
 

2671
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,550
and so Texas communication medium
between humans and it's not a

2672
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:24,560
between humans and it's not a
 

2673
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,510
between humans and it's not a
all-encompassing medium of knowledge

2674
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:26,520
all-encompassing medium of knowledge
 

2675
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,609
all-encompassing medium of knowledge
about the world but as you pointed out

2676
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:28,619
about the world but as you pointed out
 

2677
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,770
about the world but as you pointed out
we do have video and we have images and

2678
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:30,780
we do have video and we have images and
 

2679
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,630
we do have video and we have images and
we have audio and so I think that that

2680
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:32,640
we have audio and so I think that that
 

2681
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,490
we have audio and so I think that that
definitely helps a lot but we haven't

2682
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:34,500
definitely helps a lot but we haven't
 

2683
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,309
definitely helps a lot but we haven't
trained models uh sufficiently uh across

2684
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:37,319
trained models uh sufficiently uh across
 

2685
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:39,770
trained models uh sufficiently uh across
both across all those modalities yet so

2686
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:39,780
both across all those modalities yet so
 

2687
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,790
both across all those modalities yet so
I think that's what a lot of people are

2688
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
I think that's what a lot of people are
 

2689
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,290
I think that's what a lot of people are
interested in but I wonder what that

2690
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:42,300
interested in but I wonder what that
 

2691
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,329
interested in but I wonder what that
shared understanding of like well we

2692
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:44,339
shared understanding of like well we
 

2693
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,010
shared understanding of like well we
might call Common Sense

2694
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:46,020
might call Common Sense
 

2695
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,250
might call Common Sense
has to be learned

2696
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:48,260
has to be learned
 

2697
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,329
has to be learned
inferred in order to complete the

2698
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:50,339
inferred in order to complete the
 

2699
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:53,569
inferred in order to complete the
sentence correctly so maybe the fact

2700
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:53,579
sentence correctly so maybe the fact
 

2701
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:56,390
sentence correctly so maybe the fact
that it's implied on the internet the

2702
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:56,400
that it's implied on the internet the
 

2703
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,490
that it's implied on the internet the
model is going to have to learn that not

2704
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:58,500
model is going to have to learn that not
 

2705
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,490
model is going to have to learn that not
by reading about it by inferring it in

2706
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:01,500
by reading about it by inferring it in
 

2707
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,130
by reading about it by inferring it in
the representation so like common sense

2708
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:04,140
the representation so like common sense
 

2709
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,569
the representation so like common sense
just like we I don't think we learn

2710
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:05,579
just like we I don't think we learn
 

2711
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:08,809
just like we I don't think we learn
common sense like nobody says

2712
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:08,819
common sense like nobody says
 

2713
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,150
common sense like nobody says
tells us explicitly we just figure it

2714
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,160
tells us explicitly we just figure it
 

2715
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,950
tells us explicitly we just figure it
all out by interacting with the world

2716
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
all out by interacting with the world
 

2717
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,530
all out by interacting with the world
right so here's a model of reading about

2718
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:15,540
right so here's a model of reading about
 

2719
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,510
right so here's a model of reading about
the way people interact with the world

2720
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:17,520
the way people interact with the world
 

2721
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,430
the way people interact with the world
it might have to infer that

2722
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
it might have to infer that
 

2723
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,089
it might have to infer that
I wonder yeah uh you you briefly worked

2724
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:23,099
I wonder yeah uh you you briefly worked
 

2725
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,250
I wonder yeah uh you you briefly worked
on a project called the world of bits

2726
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:25,260
on a project called the world of bits
 

2727
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,530
on a project called the world of bits
training in our RL system to take

2728
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:27,540
training in our RL system to take
 

2729
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,170
training in our RL system to take
actions on the internet

2730
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:29,180
actions on the internet
 

2731
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,609
actions on the internet
versus just consuming the internet like

2732
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:31,619
versus just consuming the internet like
 

2733
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:32,990
versus just consuming the internet like
we talked about do you think there's a

2734
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,000
we talked about do you think there's a
 

2735
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,030
we talked about do you think there's a
future for that kind of system

2736
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:34,040
future for that kind of system
 

2737
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,870
future for that kind of system
interacting with the internet to help

2738
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:35,880
interacting with the internet to help
 

2739
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,030
interacting with the internet to help
the learning yes I think that's probably

2740
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:38,040
the learning yes I think that's probably
 

2741
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,010
the learning yes I think that's probably
the uh the final frontier for a lot of

2742
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:40,020
the uh the final frontier for a lot of
 

2743
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,470
the uh the final frontier for a lot of
these models because

2744
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480
these models because
 

2745
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,510
these models because
um so as you mentioned I was at open AI

2746
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:44,520
um so as you mentioned I was at open AI
 

2747
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,770
um so as you mentioned I was at open AI
I was working on this project world of

2748
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:45,780
I was working on this project world of
 

2749
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,089
I was working on this project world of
bits and basically it was the idea of

2750
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:47,099
bits and basically it was the idea of
 

2751
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,650
bits and basically it was the idea of
giving neural networks access to a

2752
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:48,660
giving neural networks access to a
 

2753
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,349
giving neural networks access to a
keyboard and a mouse and the idea could

2754
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:51,359
keyboard and a mouse and the idea could
 

2755
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,770
keyboard and a mouse and the idea could
possibly go wrong so basically you um

2756
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:54,780
possibly go wrong so basically you um
 

2757
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,650
possibly go wrong so basically you um
you perceive the input of the screen

2758
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:57,660
you perceive the input of the screen
 

2759
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,790
you perceive the input of the screen
pixels

2760
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
pixels
 

2761
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,250
pixels
and basically the state of the computer

2762
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:01,260
and basically the state of the computer
 

2763
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,109
and basically the state of the computer
is sort of visualized for human

2764
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
is sort of visualized for human
 

2765
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,809
is sort of visualized for human
consumption in images of the web browser

2766
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:05,819
consumption in images of the web browser
 

2767
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,430
consumption in images of the web browser
and stuff like that and then you give

2768
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,440
and stuff like that and then you give
 

2769
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,690
and stuff like that and then you give
the neural network the ability to press

2770
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:08,700
the neural network the ability to press
 

2771
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,550
the neural network the ability to press
keyboards and use the mouse and we're

2772
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:10,560
keyboards and use the mouse and we're
 

2773
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,990
keyboards and use the mouse and we're
trying to get it to for example complete

2774
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
trying to get it to for example complete
 

2775
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,730
trying to get it to for example complete
bookings and you know interact with user

2776
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:13,740
bookings and you know interact with user
 

2777
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,370
bookings and you know interact with user
interfaces and um what did you learn

2778
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:16,380
interfaces and um what did you learn
 

2779
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,109
interfaces and um what did you learn
from that experience like what was some

2780
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:18,119
from that experience like what was some
 

2781
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,050
from that experience like what was some
fun stuff this is super cool idea yeah I

2782
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:21,060
fun stuff this is super cool idea yeah I
 

2783
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,430
fun stuff this is super cool idea yeah I
mean it's like

2784
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:22,440
mean it's like
 

2785
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,890
mean it's like
uh yeah I mean the the step between

2786
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:24,900
uh yeah I mean the the step between
 

2787
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,829
uh yeah I mean the the step between
Observer to actor yeah is a super

2788
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:27,839
Observer to actor yeah is a super
 

2789
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,050
Observer to actor yeah is a super
fascinating step yeah well the universal

2790
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:30,060
fascinating step yeah well the universal
 

2791
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,030
fascinating step yeah well the universal
interface in the digital realm I would

2792
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:32,040
interface in the digital realm I would
 

2793
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,309
interface in the digital realm I would
say and there's a universal interface in

2794
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
say and there's a universal interface in
 

2795
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,870
say and there's a universal interface in
like the Physical Realm which in my mind

2796
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:35,880
like the Physical Realm which in my mind
 

2797
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,030
like the Physical Realm which in my mind
is a humanoid form factor kind of thing

2798
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:38,040
is a humanoid form factor kind of thing
 

2799
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,010
is a humanoid form factor kind of thing
we can later talk about Optimus and so

2800
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:40,020
we can later talk about Optimus and so
 

2801
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,530
we can later talk about Optimus and so
on but I feel like there's a

2802
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:42,540
on but I feel like there's a
 

2803
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,210
on but I feel like there's a
they're kind of like a similar

2804
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:44,220
they're kind of like a similar
 

2805
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,829
they're kind of like a similar
philosophy in some way where the human

2806
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:45,839
philosophy in some way where the human
 

2807
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,690
philosophy in some way where the human
the world the physical world is designed

2808
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:47,700
the world the physical world is designed
 

2809
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,550
the world the physical world is designed
for the human form and the digital world

2810
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:49,560
for the human form and the digital world
 

2811
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,650
for the human form and the digital world
is designed for the human form of seeing

2812
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:51,660
is designed for the human form of seeing
 

2813
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,930
is designed for the human form of seeing
the screen and using keyword keyboard

2814
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:53,940
the screen and using keyword keyboard
 

2815
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,030
the screen and using keyword keyboard
and mouse and so as the universal

2816
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:56,040
and mouse and so as the universal
 

2817
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,970
and mouse and so as the universal
interface that can basically uh command

2818
00:48:58,970 --> 00:48:58,980
interface that can basically uh command
 

2819
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,470
interface that can basically uh command
the digital infrastructure we've built

2820
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
the digital infrastructure we've built
 

2821
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,230
the digital infrastructure we've built
up for ourselves and so it feels like a

2822
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,240
up for ourselves and so it feels like a
 

2823
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,210
up for ourselves and so it feels like a
very powerful interface to to command

2824
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:05,220
very powerful interface to to command
 

2825
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,609
very powerful interface to to command
and to build on top of now to your

2826
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:07,619
and to build on top of now to your
 

2827
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:08,750
and to build on top of now to your
question as to like what I learned from

2828
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:08,760
question as to like what I learned from
 

2829
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,730
question as to like what I learned from
that it's interesting because the world

2830
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:10,740
that it's interesting because the world
 

2831
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,069
that it's interesting because the world
of bits was basically uh too early I

2832
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:13,079
of bits was basically uh too early I
 

2833
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,010
of bits was basically uh too early I
think at open AI at the time

2834
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:15,020
think at open AI at the time
 

2835
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,890
think at open AI at the time
this is around 2015 or so and the

2836
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:18,900
this is around 2015 or so and the
 

2837
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,390
this is around 2015 or so and the
Zeitgeist at that time was very

2838
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:20,400
Zeitgeist at that time was very
 

2839
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,490
Zeitgeist at that time was very
different in AI from the Zeitgeist today

2840
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:22,500
different in AI from the Zeitgeist today
 

2841
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,010
different in AI from the Zeitgeist today
at the time everyone was super excited

2842
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:25,020
at the time everyone was super excited
 

2843
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,390
at the time everyone was super excited
about reinforcement learning from

2844
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:26,400
about reinforcement learning from
 

2845
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,849
about reinforcement learning from
scratch this is the time of the Atari

2846
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:28,859
scratch this is the time of the Atari
 

2847
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:31,130
scratch this is the time of the Atari
paper where uh neural networks were

2848
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,140
paper where uh neural networks were
 

2849
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,230
paper where uh neural networks were
playing Atari games and beating humans

2850
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:33,240
playing Atari games and beating humans
 

2851
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,170
playing Atari games and beating humans
in some cases uh alphago and so on so

2852
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:36,180
in some cases uh alphago and so on so
 

2853
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,309
in some cases uh alphago and so on so
everyone's very excited about train

2854
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:37,319
everyone's very excited about train
 

2855
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:38,569
everyone's very excited about train
training neural networks from scratch

2856
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:38,579
training neural networks from scratch
 

2857
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,609
training neural networks from scratch
using reinforcement learning

2858
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:40,619
using reinforcement learning
 

2859
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,170
using reinforcement learning
um directly

2860
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:42,180
um directly
 

2861
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,730
um directly
it turns out that reinforcement learning

2862
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:43,740
it turns out that reinforcement learning
 

2863
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,290
it turns out that reinforcement learning
is extremely inefficient way of training

2864
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:45,300
is extremely inefficient way of training
 

2865
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,030
is extremely inefficient way of training
neural networks because you're taking

2866
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,040
neural networks because you're taking
 

2867
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,109
neural networks because you're taking
all these actions and all these

2868
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:48,119
all these actions and all these
 

2869
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,730
all these actions and all these
observations and you get some sparse

2870
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:49,740
observations and you get some sparse
 

2871
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,890
observations and you get some sparse
rewards once in a while so you do all

2872
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:51,900
rewards once in a while so you do all
 

2873
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,750
rewards once in a while so you do all
this stuff based on all these inputs and

2874
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,760
this stuff based on all these inputs and
 

2875
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,609
this stuff based on all these inputs and
once in a while you're like told you did

2876
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:55,619
once in a while you're like told you did
 

2877
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,589
once in a while you're like told you did
a good thing you did a bad thing and

2878
00:49:57,589 --> 00:49:57,599
a good thing you did a bad thing and
 

2879
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,030
a good thing you did a bad thing and
it's just an extremely hard problem you

2880
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
it's just an extremely hard problem you
 

2881
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,530
it's just an extremely hard problem you
can't learn from that you can burn

2882
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:00,540
can't learn from that you can burn
 

2883
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,630
can't learn from that you can burn
forest and you can sort of Brute Force

2884
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:02,640
forest and you can sort of Brute Force
 

2885
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,950
forest and you can sort of Brute Force
through it and we saw that I think with

2886
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:03,960
through it and we saw that I think with
 

2887
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,470
through it and we saw that I think with
uh you know with uh go and DOTA and so

2888
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,480
uh you know with uh go and DOTA and so
 

2889
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,870
uh you know with uh go and DOTA and so
on and it does work but it's extremely

2890
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
on and it does work but it's extremely
 

2891
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,210
on and it does work but it's extremely
inefficient uh and not how you want to

2892
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:11,220
inefficient uh and not how you want to
 

2893
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,530
inefficient uh and not how you want to
approach problems uh practically

2894
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:12,540
approach problems uh practically
 

2895
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,329
approach problems uh practically
speaking and so that's the approach that

2896
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:14,339
speaking and so that's the approach that
 

2897
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:16,130
speaking and so that's the approach that
at the time we also took to World of

2898
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:16,140
at the time we also took to World of
 

2899
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,770
at the time we also took to World of
bits we would uh have an agent

2900
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:18,780
bits we would uh have an agent
 

2901
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,510
bits we would uh have an agent
initialize randomly so with keyboard

2902
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:20,520
initialize randomly so with keyboard
 

2903
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,250
initialize randomly so with keyboard
mash and mouse mash and try to make a

2904
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:22,260
mash and mouse mash and try to make a
 

2905
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,190
mash and mouse mash and try to make a
booking and it's just like revealed the

2906
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:25,200
booking and it's just like revealed the
 

2907
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,870
booking and it's just like revealed the
insanity of that approach very quickly

2908
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:26,880
insanity of that approach very quickly
 

2909
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,150
insanity of that approach very quickly
where you have to stumble by the correct

2910
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:29,160
where you have to stumble by the correct
 

2911
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,950
where you have to stumble by the correct
booking in order to get a reward of you

2912
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:30,960
booking in order to get a reward of you
 

2913
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,450
booking in order to get a reward of you
did it correctly and you're never going

2914
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:32,460
did it correctly and you're never going
 

2915
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,150
did it correctly and you're never going
to stumble by it by chance at random

2916
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:35,160
to stumble by it by chance at random
 

2917
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,950
to stumble by it by chance at random
so even with a simple web interface

2918
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
so even with a simple web interface
 

2919
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,630
so even with a simple web interface
there's too many options there's just

2920
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,640
there's too many options there's just
 

2921
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,849
there's too many options there's just
too many options uh and uh it's two

2922
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:40,859
too many options uh and uh it's two
 

2923
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:42,710
too many options uh and uh it's two
sparse of reward signal and you're

2924
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
sparse of reward signal and you're
 

2925
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,329
sparse of reward signal and you're
starting from scratch at the time and so

2926
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:44,339
starting from scratch at the time and so
 

2927
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:45,530
starting from scratch at the time and so
you don't know how to read you don't

2928
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:45,540
you don't know how to read you don't
 

2929
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,390
you don't know how to read you don't
understand pictures images buttons you

2930
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:47,400
understand pictures images buttons you
 

2931
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,410
understand pictures images buttons you
don't understand what it means to like

2932
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:48,420
don't understand what it means to like
 

2933
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,270
don't understand what it means to like
make a booking but now what's happened

2934
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:50,280
make a booking but now what's happened
 

2935
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,089
make a booking but now what's happened
is uh it is time to revisit that and

2936
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:53,099
is uh it is time to revisit that and
 

2937
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:55,069
is uh it is time to revisit that and
open your eyes interested in this uh

2938
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:55,079
open your eyes interested in this uh
 

2939
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:56,690
open your eyes interested in this uh
companies like Adept are interested in

2940
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:56,700
companies like Adept are interested in
 

2941
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,329
companies like Adept are interested in
this and so on and uh the idea is coming

2942
00:50:59,329 --> 00:50:59,339
this and so on and uh the idea is coming
 

2943
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:00,890
this and so on and uh the idea is coming
back because the interface is very

2944
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:00,900
back because the interface is very
 

2945
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,450
back because the interface is very
powerful but now you're not training an

2946
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:02,460
powerful but now you're not training an
 

2947
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,890
powerful but now you're not training an
agent from scratch you are taking the

2948
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:03,900
agent from scratch you are taking the
 

2949
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,530
agent from scratch you are taking the
GPT as an initialization so GPT is

2950
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:06,540
GPT as an initialization so GPT is
 

2951
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,190
GPT as an initialization so GPT is
pre-trained on all of text and it

2952
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:10,200
pre-trained on all of text and it
 

2953
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,630
pre-trained on all of text and it
understands what's a booking it

2954
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:11,640
understands what's a booking it
 

2955
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,490
understands what's a booking it
understands what's a submit it

2956
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:13,500
understands what's a submit it
 

2957
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,190
understands what's a submit it
understands um quite a bit more and so

2958
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:16,200
understands um quite a bit more and so
 

2959
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,390
understands um quite a bit more and so
it already has those representations

2960
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:17,400
it already has those representations
 

2961
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,130
it already has those representations
they are very powerful and that makes

2962
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:19,140
they are very powerful and that makes
 

2963
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,450
they are very powerful and that makes
all the training significantly more

2964
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:20,460
all the training significantly more
 

2965
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,670
all the training significantly more
efficient and makes the problem

2966
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:22,680
efficient and makes the problem
 

2967
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,370
efficient and makes the problem
tractable should the interaction be with

2968
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:25,380
tractable should the interaction be with
 

2969
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,109
tractable should the interaction be with
like the way humans see it with the

2970
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:27,119
like the way humans see it with the
 

2971
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,970
like the way humans see it with the
buttons and the language or it should be

2972
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:28,980
buttons and the language or it should be
 

2973
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,250
buttons and the language or it should be
with the HTML JavaScript and this and

2974
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:31,260
with the HTML JavaScript and this and
 

2975
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,230
with the HTML JavaScript and this and
the CSS what's what do you think is the

2976
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:33,240
the CSS what's what do you think is the
 

2977
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,569
the CSS what's what do you think is the
better so today all this interest is

2978
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:35,579
better so today all this interest is
 

2979
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,430
better so today all this interest is
mostly on the level of HTML CSS and so

2980
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:37,440
mostly on the level of HTML CSS and so
 

2981
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,170
mostly on the level of HTML CSS and so
on that's done because of computational

2982
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:39,180
on that's done because of computational
 

2983
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,470
on that's done because of computational
constraints but I think ultimately

2984
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:42,480
constraints but I think ultimately
 

2985
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,329
constraints but I think ultimately
everything is designed for human visual

2986
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:44,339
everything is designed for human visual
 

2987
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,370
everything is designed for human visual
consumption and so at the end of the day

2988
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:46,380
consumption and so at the end of the day
 

2989
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,450
consumption and so at the end of the day
there's all the additional information

2990
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:47,460
there's all the additional information
 

2991
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,270
there's all the additional information
is in the layout of the web page and

2992
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:50,280
is in the layout of the web page and
 

2993
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,770
is in the layout of the web page and
what's next to you and what's a red

2994
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:51,780
what's next to you and what's a red
 

2995
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,910
what's next to you and what's a red
background and all this kind of stuff

2996
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:52,920
background and all this kind of stuff
 

2997
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,650
background and all this kind of stuff
and what it looks like visually so I

2998
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:54,660
and what it looks like visually so I
 

2999
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,910
and what it looks like visually so I
think that's the final frontier as we

3000
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:55,920
think that's the final frontier as we
 

3001
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,890
think that's the final frontier as we
are taking in pixels and we're giving

3002
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:57,900
are taking in pixels and we're giving
 

3003
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,170
are taking in pixels and we're giving
out keyboard mouse commands but I think

3004
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:00,180
out keyboard mouse commands but I think
 

3005
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,210
out keyboard mouse commands but I think
it's impractical still today do you

3006
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:02,220
it's impractical still today do you
 

3007
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,609
it's impractical still today do you
worry about bots on the internet

3008
00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:04,619
worry about bots on the internet
 

3009
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:07,010
worry about bots on the internet
given given these ideas given how

3010
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:07,020
given given these ideas given how
 

3011
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,210
given given these ideas given how
exciting they are do you worry about

3012
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:08,220
exciting they are do you worry about
 

3013
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,910
exciting they are do you worry about
bots on Twitter being not the the stupid

3014
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:10,920
bots on Twitter being not the the stupid
 

3015
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,589
bots on Twitter being not the the stupid
boss that we see now with the cryptobots

3016
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:12,599
boss that we see now with the cryptobots
 

3017
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:14,569
boss that we see now with the cryptobots
but the Bots that might be out there

3018
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:14,579
but the Bots that might be out there
 

3019
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:16,970
but the Bots that might be out there
actually that we don't see that they're

3020
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:16,980
actually that we don't see that they're
 

3021
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,490
actually that we don't see that they're
interacting in interesting ways so this

3022
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:19,500
interacting in interesting ways so this
 

3023
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,870
interacting in interesting ways so this
kind of system feels like it should be

3024
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:20,880
kind of system feels like it should be
 

3025
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,870
kind of system feels like it should be
able to pass the I'm not a robot click

3026
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:23,880
able to pass the I'm not a robot click
 

3027
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,150
able to pass the I'm not a robot click
button whatever

3028
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,160
button whatever
 

3029
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,410
button whatever
um which you actually understand how

3030
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:27,420
um which you actually understand how
 

3031
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,990
um which you actually understand how
that test works I don't quite like

3032
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
that test works I don't quite like
 

3033
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,970
that test works I don't quite like
there's there's a there's a check box or

3034
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:31,980
there's there's a there's a check box or
 

3035
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,010
there's there's a there's a check box or
whatever that you click it's presumably

3036
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:34,020
whatever that you click it's presumably
 

3037
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:37,490
whatever that you click it's presumably
tracking oh I see like Mouse movement

3038
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:37,500
tracking oh I see like Mouse movement
 

3039
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,150
tracking oh I see like Mouse movement
and the timing and so on yeah so exactly

3040
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:41,160
and the timing and so on yeah so exactly
 

3041
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,349
and the timing and so on yeah so exactly
this kind of system we're talking about

3042
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:42,359
this kind of system we're talking about
 

3043
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,990
this kind of system we're talking about
should be able to pass that so yeah what

3044
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:45,000
should be able to pass that so yeah what
 

3045
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,030
should be able to pass that so yeah what
do you feel about

3046
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,040
do you feel about
 

3047
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,510
do you feel about
um Bots that are language models Plus

3048
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:50,520
um Bots that are language models Plus
 

3049
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,569
um Bots that are language models Plus
have some interact ability and are able

3050
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:53,579
have some interact ability and are able
 

3051
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:55,190
have some interact ability and are able
to tweet and reply and so on do you

3052
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:55,200
to tweet and reply and so on do you
 

3053
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,750
to tweet and reply and so on do you
worry about that world

3054
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:56,760
worry about that world
 

3055
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,190
worry about that world
uh yeah I think it's always been a bit

3056
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:58,200
uh yeah I think it's always been a bit
 

3057
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,530
uh yeah I think it's always been a bit
of an arms race uh between sort of the

3058
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:00,540
of an arms race uh between sort of the
 

3059
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,870
of an arms race uh between sort of the
attack and the defense uh so the attack

3060
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
attack and the defense uh so the attack
 

3061
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,309
attack and the defense uh so the attack
will get stronger but the defense will

3062
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,319
will get stronger but the defense will
 

3063
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,470
will get stronger but the defense will
get stronger as well our ability to

3064
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
get stronger as well our ability to
 

3065
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,450
get stronger as well our ability to
detect that how do you defend how do you

3066
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:08,460
detect that how do you defend how do you
 

3067
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,630
detect that how do you defend how do you
detect how do you know that your karpate

3068
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:11,640
detect how do you know that your karpate
 

3069
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,569
detect how do you know that your karpate
account on Twitter is is human

3070
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:14,579
account on Twitter is is human
 

3071
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:16,790
account on Twitter is is human
how do you approach that like if people

3072
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:16,800
how do you approach that like if people
 

3073
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,270
how do you approach that like if people
were claim you know uh how would you

3074
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:20,280
were claim you know uh how would you
 

3075
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,790
were claim you know uh how would you
defend yourself in the court of law that

3076
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
defend yourself in the court of law that
 

3077
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,410
defend yourself in the court of law that
I'm a human

3078
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:24,420
I'm a human
 

3079
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,910
I'm a human
um this account is yeah at some point I

3080
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:25,920
um this account is yeah at some point I
 

3081
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,430
um this account is yeah at some point I
think uh it might be I think the society

3082
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:28,440
think uh it might be I think the society
 

3083
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,290
think uh it might be I think the society
Society will evolve a little bit like we

3084
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:30,300
Society will evolve a little bit like we
 

3085
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,510
Society will evolve a little bit like we
might start signing digitally signing uh

3086
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:32,520
might start signing digitally signing uh
 

3087
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,549
might start signing digitally signing uh
some of our correspondents or you know

3088
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
some of our correspondents or you know
 

3089
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,829
some of our correspondents or you know
things that we create uh right now it's

3090
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:36,839
things that we create uh right now it's
 

3091
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,450
things that we create uh right now it's
not necessary but maybe in the future it

3092
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:38,460
not necessary but maybe in the future it
 

3093
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,790
not necessary but maybe in the future it
might be I do think that we are going

3094
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:40,800
might be I do think that we are going
 

3095
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,829
might be I do think that we are going
towards the world where we share

3096
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:42,839
towards the world where we share
 

3097
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,970
towards the world where we share
we share the digital space with uh AIS

3098
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:45,980
we share the digital space with uh AIS
 

3099
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,130
we share the digital space with uh AIS
synthetic beings yeah and uh they will

3100
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,140
synthetic beings yeah and uh they will
 

3101
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,930
synthetic beings yeah and uh they will
get much better and they will share our

3102
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:50,940
get much better and they will share our
 

3103
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,309
get much better and they will share our
digital realm and they'll eventually

3104
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
digital realm and they'll eventually
 

3105
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,690
digital realm and they'll eventually
share our Physical Realm as well it's

3106
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:53,700
share our Physical Realm as well it's
 

3107
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,490
share our Physical Realm as well it's
much harder uh but that's kind of like

3108
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:55,500
much harder uh but that's kind of like
 

3109
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,170
much harder uh but that's kind of like
the world we're going towards and most

3110
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:57,180
the world we're going towards and most
 

3111
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,790
the world we're going towards and most
of them will be benign and awful and

3112
00:53:58,790 --> 00:53:58,800
of them will be benign and awful and
 

3113
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,349
of them will be benign and awful and
some of them will be malicious and it's

3114
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:00,359
some of them will be malicious and it's
 

3115
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:01,910
some of them will be malicious and it's
going to be an arms race trying to

3116
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
going to be an arms race trying to
 

3117
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,609
going to be an arms race trying to
detect them so I mean the worst isn't

3118
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:04,619
detect them so I mean the worst isn't
 

3119
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,010
detect them so I mean the worst isn't
the AI is the worst is the AIS

3120
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,020
the AI is the worst is the AIS
 

3121
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,829
the AI is the worst is the AIS
pretending to be human so mine I don't

3122
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:09,839
pretending to be human so mine I don't
 

3123
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,870
pretending to be human so mine I don't
know if it's always malicious there's

3124
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:11,880
know if it's always malicious there's
 

3125
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,190
know if it's always malicious there's
obviously a lot of malicious

3126
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
obviously a lot of malicious
 

3127
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,410
obviously a lot of malicious
applications but yeah it could also be

3128
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:15,420
applications but yeah it could also be
 

3129
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,010
applications but yeah it could also be
you know if I was an AI I would try very

3130
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:19,020
you know if I was an AI I would try very
 

3131
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,630
you know if I was an AI I would try very
hard to pretend to be human because

3132
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:20,640
hard to pretend to be human because
 

3133
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,730
hard to pretend to be human because
we're in a human world yeah I wouldn't

3134
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:22,740
we're in a human world yeah I wouldn't
 

3135
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,309
we're in a human world yeah I wouldn't
get any respect as an AI yeah I want to

3136
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:25,319
get any respect as an AI yeah I want to
 

3137
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:26,809
get any respect as an AI yeah I want to
get some love and respect I don't think

3138
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:26,819
get some love and respect I don't think
 

3139
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:28,609
get some love and respect I don't think
the problem is intractable people are

3140
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:28,619
the problem is intractable people are
 

3141
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:30,109
the problem is intractable people are
people are thinking about the proof of

3142
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:30,119
people are thinking about the proof of
 

3143
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,329
people are thinking about the proof of
personhood yes and uh we might start

3144
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:32,339
personhood yes and uh we might start
 

3145
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,370
personhood yes and uh we might start
digitally signing our stuff and we might

3146
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:34,380
digitally signing our stuff and we might
 

3147
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,950
digitally signing our stuff and we might
all end up having like uh

3148
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:36,960
all end up having like uh
 

3149
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,510
all end up having like uh
yeah basically some some solution for

3150
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:38,520
yeah basically some some solution for
 

3151
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,890
yeah basically some some solution for
proof of personhood it doesn't seem to

3152
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:39,900
proof of personhood it doesn't seem to
 

3153
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,390
proof of personhood it doesn't seem to
be intractable it's just something that

3154
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:41,400
be intractable it's just something that
 

3155
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,549
be intractable it's just something that
we haven't had to do until now but I

3156
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:43,559
we haven't had to do until now but I
 

3157
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,049
we haven't had to do until now but I
think once the need like really starts

3158
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:45,059
think once the need like really starts
 

3159
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:47,569
think once the need like really starts
to emerge which is soon I think when

3160
00:54:47,569 --> 00:54:47,579
to emerge which is soon I think when
 

3161
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,030
to emerge which is soon I think when
people think about it much more so but

3162
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:50,040
people think about it much more so but
 

3163
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,970
people think about it much more so but
that too will be a race because

3164
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:52,980
that too will be a race because
 

3165
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,910
that too will be a race because
um obviously you can probably uh spoof

3166
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
um obviously you can probably uh spoof
 

3167
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,109
um obviously you can probably uh spoof
or fake the the the proof of

3168
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
or fake the the the proof of
 

3169
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,849
or fake the the the proof of
personhood so you have to try to figure

3170
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:01,859
personhood so you have to try to figure
 

3171
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:04,730
personhood so you have to try to figure
out how to probably I mean it's weird

3172
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:04,740
out how to probably I mean it's weird
 

3173
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,170
out how to probably I mean it's weird
that we have like Social Security

3174
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:06,180
that we have like Social Security
 

3175
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,530
that we have like Social Security
numbers and like passports and stuff

3176
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:09,540
numbers and like passports and stuff
 

3177
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,990
numbers and like passports and stuff
it seems like it's harder to fake stuff

3178
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:12,000
it seems like it's harder to fake stuff
 

3179
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,329
it seems like it's harder to fake stuff
in the physical space than the residual

3180
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:14,339
in the physical space than the residual
 

3181
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:16,069
in the physical space than the residual
space it just feels like it's going to

3182
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:16,079
space it just feels like it's going to
 

3183
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,910
space it just feels like it's going to
be very tricky very tricky to out

3184
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:19,920
be very tricky very tricky to out
 

3185
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,770
be very tricky very tricky to out
um because it seems to be pretty low

3186
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:21,780
um because it seems to be pretty low
 

3187
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,049
um because it seems to be pretty low
cost fake stuff what are you gonna put

3188
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:24,059
cost fake stuff what are you gonna put
 

3189
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:28,130
cost fake stuff what are you gonna put
an AI in jail for like trying to use a

3190
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:28,140
an AI in jail for like trying to use a
 

3191
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,710
an AI in jail for like trying to use a
fake fake personhood proof you can I

3192
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
fake fake personhood proof you can I
 

3193
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,390
fake fake personhood proof you can I
mean okay fine you'll put a lot of AIS

3194
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:32,400
mean okay fine you'll put a lot of AIS
 

3195
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,069
mean okay fine you'll put a lot of AIS
in jail but there'll be more ai's

3196
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:34,079
in jail but there'll be more ai's
 

3197
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,349
in jail but there'll be more ai's
arbitrary like exponentially more the

3198
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:36,359
arbitrary like exponentially more the
 

3199
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:39,170
arbitrary like exponentially more the
cost of creating a bot is very low

3200
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:39,180
cost of creating a bot is very low
 

3201
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,410
cost of creating a bot is very low
uh unless there's some kind of way

3202
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:42,420
uh unless there's some kind of way
 

3203
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,349
uh unless there's some kind of way
to track accurately

3204
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:45,359
to track accurately
 

3205
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,990
to track accurately
like you're not allowed to create any

3206
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:48,000
like you're not allowed to create any
 

3207
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,650
like you're not allowed to create any
program without showing uh tying

3208
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:51,660
program without showing uh tying
 

3209
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,190
program without showing uh tying
yourself to that program like you any

3210
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,200
yourself to that program like you any
 

3211
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,690
yourself to that program like you any
program that runs on the internet you'll

3212
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:56,700
program that runs on the internet you'll
 

3213
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,930
program that runs on the internet you'll
be able to uh Trace every single human

3214
00:55:59,930 --> 00:55:59,940
be able to uh Trace every single human
 

3215
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,430
be able to uh Trace every single human
program that was involved with that

3216
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:01,440
program that was involved with that
 

3217
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,290
program that was involved with that
program yeah maybe you have to start

3218
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:03,300
program yeah maybe you have to start
 

3219
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,390
program yeah maybe you have to start
declaring when uh you know we have to

3220
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:05,400
declaring when uh you know we have to
 

3221
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,650
declaring when uh you know we have to
start drawing those boundaries and

3222
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:06,660
start drawing those boundaries and
 

3223
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,049
start drawing those boundaries and
keeping track of okay uh what our

3224
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:09,059
keeping track of okay uh what our
 

3225
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:10,849
keeping track of okay uh what our
digital entities versus

3226
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:10,859
digital entities versus
 

3227
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:14,030
digital entities versus
human entities and uh what is the

3228
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:14,040
human entities and uh what is the
 

3229
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,349
human entities and uh what is the
ownership of human entities and digital

3230
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
ownership of human entities and digital
 

3231
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,089
ownership of human entities and digital
entities and uh

3232
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:17,099
entities and uh
 

3233
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:18,470
entities and uh
something like that

3234
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:18,480
something like that
 

3235
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,010
something like that
um

3236
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:19,020
um
 

3237
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,170
um
I don't know but I think I'm optimistic

3238
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:21,180
I don't know but I think I'm optimistic
 

3239
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,530
I don't know but I think I'm optimistic
that this is uh this is uh possible and

3240
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:24,540
that this is uh this is uh possible and
 

3241
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,030
that this is uh this is uh possible and
at some in some sense we're currently in

3242
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:26,040
at some in some sense we're currently in
 

3243
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,670
at some in some sense we're currently in
like the worst time of it because

3244
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:28,680
like the worst time of it because
 

3245
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,230
like the worst time of it because
um all these Bots suddenly have become

3246
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:30,240
um all these Bots suddenly have become
 

3247
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,390
um all these Bots suddenly have become
very capable but we don't have defenses

3248
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
very capable but we don't have defenses
 

3249
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,490
very capable but we don't have defenses
yet built up as a society and but I

3250
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:34,500
yet built up as a society and but I
 

3251
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,750
yet built up as a society and but I
think uh that doesn't seem to be

3252
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:35,760
think uh that doesn't seem to be
 

3253
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,490
think uh that doesn't seem to be
intractable it's just something that we

3254
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:37,500
intractable it's just something that we
 

3255
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,049
intractable it's just something that we
have to deal with it seems weird that

3256
00:56:39,049 --> 00:56:39,059
have to deal with it seems weird that
 

3257
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:41,089
have to deal with it seems weird that
the Twitter but like really crappy

3258
00:56:41,089 --> 00:56:41,099
the Twitter but like really crappy
 

3259
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,569
the Twitter but like really crappy
Twitter Bots are so numerous like is it

3260
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:44,579
Twitter Bots are so numerous like is it
 

3261
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:47,150
Twitter Bots are so numerous like is it
so I presume that the engineers at

3262
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:47,160
so I presume that the engineers at
 

3263
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,770
so I presume that the engineers at
Twitter are very good

3264
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:48,780
Twitter are very good
 

3265
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,349
Twitter are very good
so it seems like what I would infer from

3266
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
so it seems like what I would infer from
 

3267
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,130
so it seems like what I would infer from
that

3268
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:52,140
that
 

3269
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,190
that
uh is it seems like a hard problem it

3270
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
uh is it seems like a hard problem it
 

3271
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,170
uh is it seems like a hard problem it
they're probably catching all right if I

3272
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:57,180
they're probably catching all right if I
 

3273
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,390
they're probably catching all right if I
were to sort of steal them on the case

3274
00:56:59,390 --> 00:56:59,400
were to sort of steal them on the case
 

3275
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,150
were to sort of steal them on the case
it's a hard problem and there's a huge

3276
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
it's a hard problem and there's a huge
 

3277
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,069
it's a hard problem and there's a huge
cost to uh false positive

3278
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:07,079
cost to uh false positive
 

3279
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:10,970
cost to uh false positive
to to removing a post by somebody that's

3280
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:10,980
to to removing a post by somebody that's
 

3281
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,490
to to removing a post by somebody that's
not a bot because creates a very bad

3282
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:13,500
not a bot because creates a very bad
 

3283
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,530
not a bot because creates a very bad
user experience so they're very cautious

3284
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:15,540
user experience so they're very cautious
 

3285
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,069
user experience so they're very cautious
about removing so maybe it's uh and

3286
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:19,079
about removing so maybe it's uh and
 

3287
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:20,630
about removing so maybe it's uh and
maybe the boss are really good at

3288
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640
maybe the boss are really good at
 

3289
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,849
maybe the boss are really good at
learning what gets removed and not

3290
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:22,859
learning what gets removed and not
 

3291
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:24,770
learning what gets removed and not
such that they can stay ahead of the

3292
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:24,780
such that they can stay ahead of the
 

3293
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,049
such that they can stay ahead of the
removal process very quickly my

3294
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:27,059
removal process very quickly my
 

3295
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:28,910
removal process very quickly my
impression of it honestly is there's a

3296
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:28,920
impression of it honestly is there's a
 

3297
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,490
impression of it honestly is there's a
lot of blowing for it I mean yeah just

3298
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:31,500
lot of blowing for it I mean yeah just
 

3299
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,950
lot of blowing for it I mean yeah just
that's what I it's not subtle it's my

3300
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:33,960
that's what I it's not subtle it's my
 

3301
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,809
that's what I it's not subtle it's my
impression of it it's not so but you

3302
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:35,819
impression of it it's not so but you
 

3303
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,849
impression of it it's not so but you
have to yeah that's my impression as

3304
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:37,859
have to yeah that's my impression as
 

3305
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,910
have to yeah that's my impression as
well but it feels like maybe you're

3306
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:40,920
well but it feels like maybe you're
 

3307
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,790
well but it feels like maybe you're
seeing the the tip of the iceberg maybe

3308
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:43,800
seeing the the tip of the iceberg maybe
 

3309
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,470
seeing the the tip of the iceberg maybe
the number of bots is in like the

3310
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:45,480
the number of bots is in like the
 

3311
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,990
the number of bots is in like the
trillions and you have to like

3312
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:48,000
trillions and you have to like
 

3313
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,690
trillions and you have to like
just it's a constant assault of bots and

3314
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:50,700
just it's a constant assault of bots and
 

3315
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,210
just it's a constant assault of bots and
yeah you yeah I don't know

3316
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:53,220
yeah you yeah I don't know
 

3317
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,549
yeah you yeah I don't know
um you have to still man the case

3318
00:57:55,549 --> 00:57:55,559
um you have to still man the case
 

3319
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,049
um you have to still man the case
because the boss I'm seeing are pretty

3320
00:57:57,049 --> 00:57:57,059
because the boss I'm seeing are pretty
 

3321
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,329
because the boss I'm seeing are pretty
like obvious I could write a few lines

3322
00:57:59,329 --> 00:57:59,339
like obvious I could write a few lines
 

3323
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:01,490
like obvious I could write a few lines
of code that catch these Bots I mean

3324
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:01,500
of code that catch these Bots I mean
 

3325
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,510
of code that catch these Bots I mean
definitely there's a lot of longing

3326
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:02,520
definitely there's a lot of longing
 

3327
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,549
definitely there's a lot of longing
fruit but I will say I agree that if you

3328
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:04,559
fruit but I will say I agree that if you
 

3329
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,170
fruit but I will say I agree that if you
are a sophisticated actor you could

3330
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:06,180
are a sophisticated actor you could
 

3331
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,549
are a sophisticated actor you could
probably create a pretty good bot right

3332
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:07,559
probably create a pretty good bot right
 

3333
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,630
probably create a pretty good bot right
now

3334
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
now
 

3335
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,549
now
um you know using tools like gpts

3336
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:10,559
um you know using tools like gpts
 

3337
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,470
um you know using tools like gpts
because it's a language model you can

3338
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
because it's a language model you can
 

3339
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,470
because it's a language model you can
generate faces that look quite good now

3340
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,480
generate faces that look quite good now
 

3341
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,809
generate faces that look quite good now
uh and you can do this at scale and so I

3342
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:17,819
uh and you can do this at scale and so I
 

3343
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:20,329
uh and you can do this at scale and so I
think um yeah it's quite plausible and

3344
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:20,339
think um yeah it's quite plausible and
 

3345
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:22,250
think um yeah it's quite plausible and
it's going to be hard to defend there

3346
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:22,260
it's going to be hard to defend there
 

3347
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,410
it's going to be hard to defend there
was a Google engineer that claimed that

3348
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:24,420
was a Google engineer that claimed that
 

3349
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,470
was a Google engineer that claimed that
the Lambda was sentient do you think

3350
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:27,480
the Lambda was sentient do you think
 

3351
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,370
the Lambda was sentient do you think
there's any inkling of Truth

3352
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:31,380
there's any inkling of Truth
 

3353
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,849
there's any inkling of Truth
to what he felt and more importantly to

3354
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:34,859
to what he felt and more importantly to
 

3355
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:37,190
to what he felt and more importantly to
me at least do you think language models

3356
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:37,200
me at least do you think language models
 

3357
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,049
me at least do you think language models
will achieve sentence or the illusion of

3358
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:39,059
will achieve sentence or the illusion of
 

3359
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:40,010
will achieve sentence or the illusion of
sentience

3360
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,020
sentience
 

3361
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,890
sentience
soonish fish yeah to me it's a little

3362
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:42,900
soonish fish yeah to me it's a little
 

3363
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,750
soonish fish yeah to me it's a little
bit of a canary Nicole mine kind of

3364
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:44,760
bit of a canary Nicole mine kind of
 

3365
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,049
bit of a canary Nicole mine kind of
moment honestly a little bit because uh

3366
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:48,059
moment honestly a little bit because uh
 

3367
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:50,390
moment honestly a little bit because uh
so this engineer spoke to like a chatbot

3368
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
so this engineer spoke to like a chatbot
 

3369
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,750
so this engineer spoke to like a chatbot
at Google and uh became convinced that

3370
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:53,760
at Google and uh became convinced that
 

3371
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,030
at Google and uh became convinced that
uh this bot is sentient yeah as there's

3372
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:56,040
uh this bot is sentient yeah as there's
 

3373
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,710
uh this bot is sentient yeah as there's
some existential philosophical questions

3374
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:57,720
some existential philosophical questions
 

3375
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,210
some existential philosophical questions
and it gave like reasonable answers and

3376
00:58:59,210 --> 00:58:59,220
and it gave like reasonable answers and
 

3377
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,450
and it gave like reasonable answers and
looked real and uh and so on so to me

3378
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:02,460
looked real and uh and so on so to me
 

3379
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,190
looked real and uh and so on so to me
it's a uh

3380
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:04,200
it's a uh
 

3381
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,950
it's a uh
he was he was uh he wasn't sufficiently

3382
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:06,960
he was he was uh he wasn't sufficiently
 

3383
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,230
he was he was uh he wasn't sufficiently
trying to stress the system I think and

3384
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:09,240
trying to stress the system I think and
 

3385
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,289
trying to stress the system I think and
uh exposing the truth of it as it is

3386
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:12,299
uh exposing the truth of it as it is
 

3387
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,549
uh exposing the truth of it as it is
today

3388
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:13,559
today
 

3389
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:14,329
today
um

3390
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:14,339
um
 

3391
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:16,910
um
but uh I think this will be increasingly

3392
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:16,920
but uh I think this will be increasingly
 

3393
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,510
but uh I think this will be increasingly
harder over time uh so uh yeah I think

3394
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:20,520
harder over time uh so uh yeah I think
 

3395
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,130
harder over time uh so uh yeah I think
more and more people will basically uh

3396
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:22,140
more and more people will basically uh
 

3397
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,870
more and more people will basically uh
become

3398
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:23,880
become
 

3399
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,309
become
um

3400
00:59:25,309 --> 00:59:25,319
um
 

3401
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:26,870
um
yeah I think more and more there will be

3402
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:26,880
yeah I think more and more there will be
 

3403
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,609
yeah I think more and more there will be
more people like that over time as this

3404
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:28,619
more people like that over time as this
 

3405
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:30,349
more people like that over time as this
gets better like form an emotional

3406
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:30,359
gets better like form an emotional
 

3407
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,750
gets better like form an emotional
connection to to an AI yeah perfectly

3408
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:32,760
connection to to an AI yeah perfectly
 

3409
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,030
connection to to an AI yeah perfectly
plausible in my mind I think these AIS

3410
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:35,040
plausible in my mind I think these AIS
 

3411
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,190
plausible in my mind I think these AIS
are actually quite good at human human

3412
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:37,200
are actually quite good at human human
 

3413
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,710
are actually quite good at human human
connection human emotion a ton of text

3414
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:39,720
connection human emotion a ton of text
 

3415
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,930
connection human emotion a ton of text
on the Internet is about humans and

3416
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:41,940
on the Internet is about humans and
 

3417
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,089
on the Internet is about humans and
connection and love and so on so I think

3418
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:44,099
connection and love and so on so I think
 

3419
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:45,890
connection and love and so on so I think
they have a very good understanding in

3420
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:45,900
they have a very good understanding in
 

3421
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,930
they have a very good understanding in
some in some sense of of how people

3422
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:47,940
some in some sense of of how people
 

3423
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,569
some in some sense of of how people
speak to each other about this and um

3424
00:59:50,569 --> 00:59:50,579
speak to each other about this and um
 

3425
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:52,430
speak to each other about this and um
they're very capable of creating a lot

3426
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:52,440
they're very capable of creating a lot
 

3427
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,130
they're very capable of creating a lot
of that kind of text the um

3428
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:55,140
of that kind of text the um
 

3429
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,750
of that kind of text the um
there's a lot of like sci-fi from 50s

3430
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:56,760
there's a lot of like sci-fi from 50s
 

3431
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,490
there's a lot of like sci-fi from 50s
and 60s that imagined AIS in a very

3432
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:58,500
and 60s that imagined AIS in a very
 

3433
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,109
and 60s that imagined AIS in a very
different way they are calculating cold

3434
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:00,119
different way they are calculating cold
 

3435
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:02,089
different way they are calculating cold
vulcan-like machines that's not what

3436
01:00:02,089 --> 01:00:02,099
vulcan-like machines that's not what
 

3437
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,309
vulcan-like machines that's not what
we're getting today we're getting pretty

3438
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:04,319
we're getting today we're getting pretty
 

3439
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,789
we're getting today we're getting pretty
emotional AIS that actually uh are very

3440
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:07,799
emotional AIS that actually uh are very
 

3441
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:10,730
emotional AIS that actually uh are very
competent and capable of generating

3442
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:10,740
competent and capable of generating
 

3443
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,349
competent and capable of generating
you know possible sounding text with

3444
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:12,359
you know possible sounding text with
 

3445
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,270
you know possible sounding text with
respect to all of these topics see I'm

3446
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:14,280
respect to all of these topics see I'm
 

3447
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,190
respect to all of these topics see I'm
really hopeful about AI systems that are

3448
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:16,200
really hopeful about AI systems that are
 

3449
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,870
really hopeful about AI systems that are
like companions that help you grow

3450
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:17,880
like companions that help you grow
 

3451
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,329
like companions that help you grow
develop as a human being help you

3452
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:20,339
develop as a human being help you
 

3453
01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:22,609
develop as a human being help you
maximize long-term happiness but I'm

3454
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:22,619
maximize long-term happiness but I'm
 

3455
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,950
maximize long-term happiness but I'm
also very worried about AI systems that

3456
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
also very worried about AI systems that
 

3457
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,289
also very worried about AI systems that
figure out from the internet the humans

3458
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:27,299
figure out from the internet the humans
 

3459
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:29,569
figure out from the internet the humans
get attracted to drama and so these

3460
01:00:29,569 --> 01:00:29,579
get attracted to drama and so these
 

3461
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:31,130
get attracted to drama and so these
would just be like [\h__\h] talking AIS

3462
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:31,140
would just be like [\h__\h] talking AIS
 

3463
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,230
would just be like [\h__\h] talking AIS
that's just constantly did you hear like

3464
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:33,240
that's just constantly did you hear like
 

3465
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,870
that's just constantly did you hear like
they'll do gossip they'll do uh they'll

3466
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:35,880
they'll do gossip they'll do uh they'll
 

3467
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,349
they'll do gossip they'll do uh they'll
try to plant seeds of Suspicion to like

3468
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:39,359
try to plant seeds of Suspicion to like
 

3469
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,530
try to plant seeds of Suspicion to like
other humans that you love and trust and

3470
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:42,540
other humans that you love and trust and
 

3471
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,049
other humans that you love and trust and
just kind of mess with people uh in the

3472
01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:45,059
just kind of mess with people uh in the
 

3473
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,370
just kind of mess with people uh in the
you know because because that's going to

3474
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:46,380
you know because because that's going to
 

3475
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,710
you know because because that's going to
get a lot of attention so drama maximize

3476
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:48,720
get a lot of attention so drama maximize
 

3477
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,250
get a lot of attention so drama maximize
drama on the path to maximizing uh

3478
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,260
drama on the path to maximizing uh
 

3479
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,470
drama on the path to maximizing uh
engagement and US humans will feed into

3480
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,480
engagement and US humans will feed into
 

3481
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,890
engagement and US humans will feed into
that machine yeah and get it'll be a

3482
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:57,900
that machine yeah and get it'll be a
 

3483
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,670
that machine yeah and get it'll be a
giant drama shitstorm

3484
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:00,680
giant drama shitstorm
 

3485
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,410
giant drama shitstorm
so I'm worried about that so it's the

3486
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:03,420
so I'm worried about that so it's the
 

3487
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,049
so I'm worried about that so it's the
objective function really defines the

3488
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:06,059
objective function really defines the
 

3489
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,690
objective function really defines the
way that human civilization progresses

3490
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:08,700
way that human civilization progresses
 

3491
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,450
way that human civilization progresses
with AIS in it yeah I think right now at

3492
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:11,460
with AIS in it yeah I think right now at
 

3493
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,490
with AIS in it yeah I think right now at
least today they are not sort of it's

3494
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:13,500
least today they are not sort of it's
 

3495
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,750
least today they are not sort of it's
not correct to really think of them as

3496
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:14,760
not correct to really think of them as
 

3497
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,089
not correct to really think of them as
goal seeking agents that want to do

3498
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:17,099
goal seeking agents that want to do
 

3499
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:19,430
goal seeking agents that want to do
something they have no long-term memory

3500
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,440
something they have no long-term memory
 

3501
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,589
something they have no long-term memory
or anything they it's literally a good

3502
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
or anything they it's literally a good
 

3503
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,569
or anything they it's literally a good
approximation of it is you get a

3504
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:23,579
approximation of it is you get a
 

3505
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:24,530
approximation of it is you get a
thousand words and you're trying to

3506
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:24,540
thousand words and you're trying to
 

3507
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,030
thousand words and you're trying to
predict a thousand at first and then you

3508
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:26,040
predict a thousand at first and then you
 

3509
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,250
predict a thousand at first and then you
continue feeding it in and you are free

3510
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:28,260
continue feeding it in and you are free
 

3511
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,049
continue feeding it in and you are free
to prompt it in whatever way you want so

3512
01:01:30,049 --> 01:01:30,059
to prompt it in whatever way you want so
 

3513
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:33,230
to prompt it in whatever way you want so
in text so you say okay you are a

3514
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:33,240
in text so you say okay you are a
 

3515
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,030
in text so you say okay you are a
psychologist and you are very good and

3516
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,040
psychologist and you are very good and
 

3517
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,010
psychologist and you are very good and
you love humans and here's a

3518
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:37,020
you love humans and here's a
 

3519
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,089
you love humans and here's a
conversation between you and another

3520
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:38,099
conversation between you and another
 

3521
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:41,390
conversation between you and another
human human colon Something you

3522
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,400
human human colon Something you
 

3523
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,370
human human colon Something you
something and then it just continues the

3524
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:43,380
something and then it just continues the
 

3525
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,510
something and then it just continues the
pattern and suddenly you're having a

3526
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:44,520
pattern and suddenly you're having a
 

3527
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,589
pattern and suddenly you're having a
conversation with a fake psychologist

3528
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
conversation with a fake psychologist
 

3529
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,870
conversation with a fake psychologist
who's not trying to help you and so it's

3530
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:47,880
who's not trying to help you and so it's
 

3531
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,490
who's not trying to help you and so it's
still kind of like in a realm of a tool

3532
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:49,500
still kind of like in a realm of a tool
 

3533
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,650
still kind of like in a realm of a tool
it is a um people can prompt their

3534
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:51,660
it is a um people can prompt their
 

3535
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,329
it is a um people can prompt their
arbitrary ways and it can create really

3536
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:53,339
arbitrary ways and it can create really
 

3537
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:55,250
arbitrary ways and it can create really
incredible text but it doesn't have

3538
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,260
incredible text but it doesn't have
 

3539
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,930
incredible text but it doesn't have
long-term goals over long periods of

3540
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:56,940
long-term goals over long periods of
 

3541
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,569
long-term goals over long periods of
time it doesn't try to uh so it doesn't

3542
01:01:59,569 --> 01:01:59,579
time it doesn't try to uh so it doesn't
 

3543
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:01,490
time it doesn't try to uh so it doesn't
look that way right now yeah but you can

3544
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:01,500
look that way right now yeah but you can
 

3545
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,410
look that way right now yeah but you can
do short-term goals that have long-term

3546
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:03,420
do short-term goals that have long-term
 

3547
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,530
do short-term goals that have long-term
effects so if my prompting

3548
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:06,540
effects so if my prompting
 

3549
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,930
effects so if my prompting
short-term goal is to get Andre capacity

3550
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:08,940
short-term goal is to get Andre capacity
 

3551
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,450
short-term goal is to get Andre capacity
to respond to me on Twitter when I

3552
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:11,460
to respond to me on Twitter when I
 

3553
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:14,270
to respond to me on Twitter when I
like I think AI might that's the goal

3554
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:14,280
like I think AI might that's the goal
 

3555
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,069
like I think AI might that's the goal
but he might figure out that talking

3556
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
but he might figure out that talking
 

3557
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,289
but he might figure out that talking
[\h__\h] to you it would be the best in a

3558
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:18,299
[\h__\h] to you it would be the best in a
 

3559
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:20,089
[\h__\h] to you it would be the best in a
highly sophisticating interesting way

3560
01:02:20,089 --> 01:02:20,099
highly sophisticating interesting way
 

3561
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,370
highly sophisticating interesting way
and then you build up a relationship

3562
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:22,380
and then you build up a relationship
 

3563
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,849
and then you build up a relationship
when you respond once and then it

3564
01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:25,859
when you respond once and then it
 

3565
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:29,569
when you respond once and then it
like over time it gets to not be

3566
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:29,579
like over time it gets to not be
 

3567
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,990
like over time it gets to not be
sophisticated and just

3568
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
sophisticated and just
 

3569
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,710
sophisticated and just
like just talk [\h__\h]

3570
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:35,720
like just talk [\h__\h]
 

3571
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,690
like just talk [\h__\h]
and okay maybe you won't get to Andre

3572
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:38,700
and okay maybe you won't get to Andre
 

3573
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,150
and okay maybe you won't get to Andre
but it might get to another celebrity it

3574
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:41,160
but it might get to another celebrity it
 

3575
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,970
but it might get to another celebrity it
might get into other big accounts and

3576
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:43,980
might get into other big accounts and
 

3577
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,130
might get into other big accounts and
then it'll just so with just that simple

3578
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:46,140
then it'll just so with just that simple
 

3579
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,589
then it'll just so with just that simple
goal get them to respond yeah maximize

3580
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:48,599
goal get them to respond yeah maximize
 

3581
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:50,630
goal get them to respond yeah maximize
the probability of actual response yeah

3582
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,640
the probability of actual response yeah
 

3583
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,609
the probability of actual response yeah
I mean you could prompt a uh powerful

3584
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:52,619
I mean you could prompt a uh powerful
 

3585
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:54,530
I mean you could prompt a uh powerful
model like this with their its opinion

3586
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:54,540
model like this with their its opinion
 

3587
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,870
model like this with their its opinion
about how to do any possible thing

3588
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:56,880
about how to do any possible thing
 

3589
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,190
about how to do any possible thing
you're interested in so they will

3590
01:02:58,190 --> 01:02:58,200
you're interested in so they will
 

3591
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,630
you're interested in so they will
discuss they're kind of on track to

3592
01:02:59,630 --> 01:02:59,640
discuss they're kind of on track to
 

3593
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,670
discuss they're kind of on track to
become these oracles I could I sort of

3594
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
become these oracles I could I sort of
 

3595
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,950
become these oracles I could I sort of
think of it that way they are oracles uh

3596
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:03,960
think of it that way they are oracles uh
 

3597
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,390
think of it that way they are oracles uh
currently is just text but they will

3598
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:05,400
currently is just text but they will
 

3599
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,650
currently is just text but they will
have calculators they will have access

3600
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:06,660
have calculators they will have access
 

3601
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,510
have calculators they will have access
to Google search they will have all

3602
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:08,520
to Google search they will have all
 

3603
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,490
to Google search they will have all
kinds of couches and gizmos they will be

3604
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:10,500
kinds of couches and gizmos they will be
 

3605
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,349
kinds of couches and gizmos they will be
able to operate the internet and find

3606
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:12,359
able to operate the internet and find
 

3607
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,569
able to operate the internet and find
different information and

3608
01:03:14,569 --> 01:03:14,579
different information and
 

3609
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:15,770
different information and
um

3610
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:15,780
um
 

3611
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,809
um
yeah in some sense

3612
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:17,819
yeah in some sense
 

3613
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:19,250
yeah in some sense
that's kind of like currently what it

3614
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:19,260
that's kind of like currently what it
 

3615
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,390
that's kind of like currently what it
looks like in terms of the development

3616
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:20,400
looks like in terms of the development
 

3617
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,829
looks like in terms of the development
do you think it'll be an improvement

3618
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
do you think it'll be an improvement
 

3619
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:26,270
do you think it'll be an improvement
eventually over what Google is for

3620
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:26,280
eventually over what Google is for
 

3621
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,370
eventually over what Google is for
access to human knowledge like it'll be

3622
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:28,380
access to human knowledge like it'll be
 

3623
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,990
access to human knowledge like it'll be
a more effective search engine to access

3624
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
a more effective search engine to access
 

3625
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,789
a more effective search engine to access
human knowledge I think there's definite

3626
01:03:31,789 --> 01:03:31,799
human knowledge I think there's definite
 

3627
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:33,170
human knowledge I think there's definite
scope in building a better search engine

3628
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:33,180
scope in building a better search engine
 

3629
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,450
scope in building a better search engine
today and I think Google they have all

3630
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:35,460
today and I think Google they have all
 

3631
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,890
today and I think Google they have all
the tools all the people they have

3632
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:36,900
the tools all the people they have
 

3633
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,910
the tools all the people they have
everything they need they have all the

3634
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
everything they need they have all the
 

3635
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,349
everything they need they have all the
puzzle pieces they have people training

3636
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:39,359
puzzle pieces they have people training
 

3637
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,450
puzzle pieces they have people training
Transformers at scale they have all the

3638
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:41,460
Transformers at scale they have all the
 

3639
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,150
Transformers at scale they have all the
data uh it's just not obvious if they

3640
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
data uh it's just not obvious if they
 

3641
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,829
data uh it's just not obvious if they
are capable as an organization to

3642
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
are capable as an organization to
 

3643
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,390
are capable as an organization to
innovate on their search engine right

3644
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:47,400
innovate on their search engine right
 

3645
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,069
innovate on their search engine right
now and if they don't someone else will

3646
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:49,079
now and if they don't someone else will
 

3647
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,870
now and if they don't someone else will
there's absolute scope for building a

3648
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:50,880
there's absolute scope for building a
 

3649
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,430
there's absolute scope for building a
significantly better search engine built

3650
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:52,440
significantly better search engine built
 

3651
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,829
significantly better search engine built
on these tools it's so interesting a

3652
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:54,839
on these tools it's so interesting a
 

3653
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:57,289
on these tools it's so interesting a
large company where the search there's

3654
01:03:57,289 --> 01:03:57,299
large company where the search there's
 

3655
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:59,690
large company where the search there's
already an infrastructure it works as it

3656
01:03:59,690 --> 01:03:59,700
already an infrastructure it works as it
 

3657
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,849
already an infrastructure it works as it
brings out a lot of money so where

3658
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:01,859
brings out a lot of money so where
 

3659
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:04,490
brings out a lot of money so where
structurally inside a company is their

3660
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:04,500
structurally inside a company is their
 

3661
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,650
structurally inside a company is their
motivation to Pivot yeah to say we're

3662
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:06,660
motivation to Pivot yeah to say we're
 

3663
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,630
motivation to Pivot yeah to say we're
going to build a new search engine yep

3664
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:08,640
going to build a new search engine yep
 

3665
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,329
going to build a new search engine yep
that's really hard so it's usually going

3666
01:04:11,329 --> 01:04:11,339
that's really hard so it's usually going
 

3667
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:13,849
that's really hard so it's usually going
to come from a startup right that's um

3668
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:13,859
to come from a startup right that's um
 

3669
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:16,670
to come from a startup right that's um
that would be yeah or some other more

3670
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:16,680
that would be yeah or some other more
 

3671
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,530
that would be yeah or some other more
competent organization

3672
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:18,540
competent organization
 

3673
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,589
competent organization
um so uh I don't know so currently for

3674
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
um so uh I don't know so currently for
 

3675
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,750
um so uh I don't know so currently for
example maybe Bing has another shot at

3676
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:23,760
example maybe Bing has another shot at
 

3677
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,390
example maybe Bing has another shot at
it you know so Microsoft Edge because

3678
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,400
it you know so Microsoft Edge because
 

3679
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,430
it you know so Microsoft Edge because
we're talking offline

3680
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:28,440
we're talking offline
 

3681
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,170
we're talking offline
um I mean I definitely it's really

3682
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:30,180
um I mean I definitely it's really
 

3683
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,970
um I mean I definitely it's really
interesting because search engines used

3684
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:31,980
interesting because search engines used
 

3685
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,829
interesting because search engines used
to be about okay here's some query

3686
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
to be about okay here's some query
 

3687
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,190
to be about okay here's some query
here's here's here's web pages that look

3688
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:37,200
here's here's here's web pages that look
 

3689
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,870
here's here's here's web pages that look
like the stuff that you have but you

3690
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
like the stuff that you have but you
 

3691
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,549
like the stuff that you have but you
could just directly go to answer and

3692
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:40,559
could just directly go to answer and
 

3693
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,470
could just directly go to answer and
then have supporting evidence

3694
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:42,480
then have supporting evidence
 

3695
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,750
then have supporting evidence
um and these uh these models basically

3696
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:44,760
um and these uh these models basically
 

3697
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,430
um and these uh these models basically
they've read all the texts and they've

3698
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:46,440
they've read all the texts and they've
 

3699
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,289
they've read all the texts and they've
read all the web pages and so sometimes

3700
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:48,299
read all the web pages and so sometimes
 

3701
01:04:48,299 --> 01:04:49,549
read all the web pages and so sometimes
when you see yourself going over to

3702
01:04:49,549 --> 01:04:49,559
when you see yourself going over to
 

3703
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:50,870
when you see yourself going over to
search results and sort of getting like

3704
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:50,880
search results and sort of getting like
 

3705
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,089
search results and sort of getting like
a sense of like the average answer to

3706
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:53,099
a sense of like the average answer to
 

3707
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:54,589
a sense of like the average answer to
whatever you're interested in uh like

3708
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:54,599
whatever you're interested in uh like
 

3709
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:55,789
whatever you're interested in uh like
that just directly comes out you don't

3710
01:04:55,789 --> 01:04:55,799
that just directly comes out you don't
 

3711
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:57,589
that just directly comes out you don't
have to do that work

3712
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:57,599
have to do that work
 

3713
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,190
have to do that work
um

3714
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:58,200
um
 

3715
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,710
um
so they're kind of like uh

3716
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:00,720
so they're kind of like uh
 

3717
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,329
so they're kind of like uh
yeah I think they have a way to this of

3718
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:02,339
yeah I think they have a way to this of
 

3719
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:05,030
yeah I think they have a way to this of
distilling all that knowledge into

3720
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:05,040
distilling all that knowledge into
 

3721
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,950
distilling all that knowledge into
like some level of insight basically do

3722
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:06,960
like some level of insight basically do
 

3723
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,349
like some level of insight basically do
you think of prompting as a kind of

3724
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:09,359
you think of prompting as a kind of
 

3725
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,809
you think of prompting as a kind of
teaching and learning like this whole

3726
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:11,819
teaching and learning like this whole
 

3727
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:14,950
teaching and learning like this whole
process like another layer

3728
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
process like another layer
 

3729
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,210
process like another layer
you know because maybe that's what

3730
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:17,220
you know because maybe that's what
 

3731
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,829
you know because maybe that's what
humans are we already have that

3732
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:18,839
humans are we already have that
 

3733
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:21,349
humans are we already have that
background model and then your the world

3734
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:21,359
background model and then your the world
 

3735
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,589
background model and then your the world
is prompting you yeah exactly I think

3736
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:24,599
is prompting you yeah exactly I think
 

3737
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:26,150
is prompting you yeah exactly I think
the way we are programming these

3738
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:26,160
the way we are programming these
 

3739
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,970
the way we are programming these
computers now like gpts is is converging

3740
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:28,980
computers now like gpts is is converging
 

3741
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,710
computers now like gpts is is converging
to how you program humans I mean how do

3742
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:30,720
to how you program humans I mean how do
 

3743
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,589
to how you program humans I mean how do
I program humans via prompt I go to

3744
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:33,599
I program humans via prompt I go to
 

3745
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,569
I program humans via prompt I go to
people and I I prompt them to do things

3746
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:35,579
people and I I prompt them to do things
 

3747
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:38,030
people and I I prompt them to do things
I prompt them from information and so uh

3748
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:38,040
I prompt them from information and so uh
 

3749
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,410
I prompt them from information and so uh
natural language prompt is how we

3750
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:39,420
natural language prompt is how we
 

3751
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:40,849
natural language prompt is how we
program humans and we're starting to

3752
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:40,859
program humans and we're starting to
 

3753
01:05:40,859 --> 01:05:42,230
program humans and we're starting to
program computers directly in that

3754
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:42,240
program computers directly in that
 

3755
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,670
program computers directly in that
interface it's like pretty remarkable

3756
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:43,680
interface it's like pretty remarkable
 

3757
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,829
interface it's like pretty remarkable
honestly so you've spoken a lot about

3758
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
honestly so you've spoken a lot about
 

3759
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,730
honestly so you've spoken a lot about
the idea of software 2.0

3760
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:49,740

 

3761
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,530

um all good ideas

3762
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:51,540
um all good ideas
 

3763
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:54,170
um all good ideas
become like cliches so quickly like the

3764
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:54,180
become like cliches so quickly like the
 

3765
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,049
become like cliches so quickly like the
terms it's kind of hilarious

3766
01:05:57,049 --> 01:05:57,059
terms it's kind of hilarious
 

3767
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,030
terms it's kind of hilarious
um it's like I think Eminem once said

3768
01:05:59,030 --> 01:05:59,040
um it's like I think Eminem once said
 

3769
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,910
um it's like I think Eminem once said
that like if he gets annoyed by a song

3770
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:01,920
that like if he gets annoyed by a song
 

3771
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,370
that like if he gets annoyed by a song
He's written very quickly that means

3772
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:04,380
He's written very quickly that means
 

3773
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,770
He's written very quickly that means
it's going to be a big hit because it's

3774
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:06,780
it's going to be a big hit because it's
 

3775
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:10,309
it's going to be a big hit because it's
it's too catchy but uh can you describe

3776
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
it's too catchy but uh can you describe
 

3777
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,930
it's too catchy but uh can you describe
this idea and how you're thinking about

3778
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:11,940
this idea and how you're thinking about
 

3779
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,730
this idea and how you're thinking about
it has evolved over the months and years

3780
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:13,740
it has evolved over the months and years
 

3781
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:17,329
it has evolved over the months and years
since since you coined it yeah

3782
01:06:17,329 --> 01:06:17,339
since since you coined it yeah
 

3783
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:19,250
since since you coined it yeah
yeah so I had a blog post on software

3784
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:19,260
yeah so I had a blog post on software
 

3785
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,950
yeah so I had a blog post on software
2.0 I think several years ago now

3786
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:21,960
2.0 I think several years ago now
 

3787
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,549
2.0 I think several years ago now
um

3788
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:22,559
um
 

3789
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,650
um
and the reason I wrote that post is

3790
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:24,660
and the reason I wrote that post is
 

3791
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,690
and the reason I wrote that post is
because I kept I kind of saw something

3792
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:26,700
because I kept I kind of saw something
 

3793
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,089
because I kept I kind of saw something
remarkable happening in

3794
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:29,099
remarkable happening in
 

3795
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:31,130
remarkable happening in
like software development and how a lot

3796
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:31,140
like software development and how a lot
 

3797
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,930
like software development and how a lot
of code was being transitioned to be

3798
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:32,940
of code was being transitioned to be
 

3799
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,390
of code was being transitioned to be
written not in sort of like C plus and

3800
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:35,400
written not in sort of like C plus and
 

3801
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,770
written not in sort of like C plus and
so on but it's written in the weights of

3802
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:36,780
so on but it's written in the weights of
 

3803
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,870
so on but it's written in the weights of
a neural net basically just saying that

3804
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:38,880
a neural net basically just saying that
 

3805
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,549
a neural net basically just saying that
neural Nets are taking over software the

3806
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:40,559
neural Nets are taking over software the
 

3807
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,430
neural Nets are taking over software the
realm of software and uh taking more and

3808
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:43,440
realm of software and uh taking more and
 

3809
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,710
realm of software and uh taking more and
more tasks and at the time I think not

3810
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:45,720
more tasks and at the time I think not
 

3811
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,289
more tasks and at the time I think not
many people understood uh this uh deeply

3812
01:06:48,289 --> 01:06:48,299
many people understood uh this uh deeply
 

3813
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:49,670
many people understood uh this uh deeply
enough that this is a big deal it's a

3814
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:49,680
enough that this is a big deal it's a
 

3815
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,829
enough that this is a big deal it's a
big transition uh neural networks were

3816
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:51,839
big transition uh neural networks were
 

3817
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,750
big transition uh neural networks were
seen as one of multiple classification

3818
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:53,760
seen as one of multiple classification
 

3819
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,730
seen as one of multiple classification
algorithms you might use for your data

3820
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:55,740
algorithms you might use for your data
 

3821
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,250
algorithms you might use for your data
set problem on kaggle like this is not

3822
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:58,260
set problem on kaggle like this is not
 

3823
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:01,309
set problem on kaggle like this is not
that this is a change in how we program

3824
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:01,319
that this is a change in how we program
 

3825
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:02,870
that this is a change in how we program
computers

3826
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:02,880
computers
 

3827
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,049
computers
and I saw neural Nets as uh this is

3828
01:07:06,049 --> 01:07:06,059
and I saw neural Nets as uh this is
 

3829
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:07,849
and I saw neural Nets as uh this is
going to take over the way we program

3830
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:07,859
going to take over the way we program
 

3831
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:09,289
going to take over the way we program
computers is going to change is not

3832
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:09,299
computers is going to change is not
 

3833
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:11,210
computers is going to change is not
going to be people writing a software in

3834
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:11,220
going to be people writing a software in
 

3835
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,589
going to be people writing a software in
C plus or something like that and

3836
01:07:12,589 --> 01:07:12,599
C plus or something like that and
 

3837
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:14,630
C plus or something like that and
directly programming the software it's

3838
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:14,640
directly programming the software it's
 

3839
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,970
directly programming the software it's
going to be accumulating training sets

3840
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:16,980
going to be accumulating training sets
 

3841
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,770
going to be accumulating training sets
and data sets and crafting these

3842
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:18,780
and data sets and crafting these
 

3843
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,849
and data sets and crafting these
objectives by which we train these

3844
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:19,859
objectives by which we train these
 

3845
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:21,650
objectives by which we train these
neural Nets and at some point there's

3846
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:21,660
neural Nets and at some point there's
 

3847
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,450
neural Nets and at some point there's
going to be a compilation process from

3848
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:23,460
going to be a compilation process from
 

3849
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,190
going to be a compilation process from
the data sets and the objective and the

3850
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:25,200
the data sets and the objective and the
 

3851
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,529
the data sets and the objective and the
architecture specification into the

3852
01:07:27,529 --> 01:07:27,539
architecture specification into the
 

3853
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:29,809
architecture specification into the
binary which is really just uh the

3854
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:29,819
binary which is really just uh the
 

3855
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:32,089
binary which is really just uh the
neural nut you know weights and the

3856
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:32,099
neural nut you know weights and the
 

3857
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:33,829
neural nut you know weights and the
forward pass of the neural net and then

3858
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:33,839
forward pass of the neural net and then
 

3859
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,690
forward pass of the neural net and then
you can deploy that binary and so I was

3860
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:35,700
you can deploy that binary and so I was
 

3861
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,150
you can deploy that binary and so I was
talking about that sort of transition

3862
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:37,160
talking about that sort of transition
 

3863
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,609
talking about that sort of transition
and uh that's what the post is about and

3864
01:07:40,609 --> 01:07:40,619
and uh that's what the post is about and
 

3865
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:42,349
and uh that's what the post is about and
I saw this sort of play out in a lot of

3866
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:42,359
I saw this sort of play out in a lot of
 

3867
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:45,650
I saw this sort of play out in a lot of
fields uh you know autopilot being one

3868
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:45,660
fields uh you know autopilot being one
 

3869
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,450
fields uh you know autopilot being one
of them but also just a simple image

3870
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:47,460
of them but also just a simple image
 

3871
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,970
of them but also just a simple image
classification people thought originally

3872
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:49,980
classification people thought originally
 

3873
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,010
classification people thought originally
you know in the 80s and so on that they

3874
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:52,020
you know in the 80s and so on that they
 

3875
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,170
you know in the 80s and so on that they
would write the algorithm for detecting

3876
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:54,180
would write the algorithm for detecting
 

3877
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,210
would write the algorithm for detecting
a dog in an image and they had all these

3878
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:56,220
a dog in an image and they had all these
 

3879
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,010
a dog in an image and they had all these
ideas about how the brain does it and

3880
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:58,020
ideas about how the brain does it and
 

3881
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,510
ideas about how the brain does it and
first we detected corners and then we

3882
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
first we detected corners and then we
 

3883
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,770
first we detected corners and then we
detect lines and then we stitched them

3884
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:00,780
detect lines and then we stitched them
 

3885
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,329
detect lines and then we stitched them
up and they were like really going at it

3886
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:02,339
up and they were like really going at it
 

3887
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:03,710
up and they were like really going at it
they were like thinking about how

3888
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:03,720
they were like thinking about how
 

3889
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,210
they were like thinking about how
they're going to write the algorithm and

3890
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:05,220
they're going to write the algorithm and
 

3891
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,809
they're going to write the algorithm and
this is not the way you build it

3892
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:07,819
this is not the way you build it
 

3893
01:08:07,819 --> 01:08:10,069
this is not the way you build it
and there was a smooth transition where

3894
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
and there was a smooth transition where
 

3895
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,170
and there was a smooth transition where
okay first we thought we were going to

3896
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,180
okay first we thought we were going to
 

3897
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,450
okay first we thought we were going to
build everything then we were building

3898
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:14,460
build everything then we were building
 

3899
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,970
build everything then we were building
the features uh so like Hawk features

3900
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:16,980
the features uh so like Hawk features
 

3901
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,010
the features uh so like Hawk features
and things like that that detect these

3902
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:19,020
and things like that that detect these
 

3903
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,209
and things like that that detect these
little statistical patterns from image

3904
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:20,219
little statistical patterns from image
 

3905
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:21,890
little statistical patterns from image
patches and then there was a little bit

3906
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:21,900
patches and then there was a little bit
 

3907
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,809
patches and then there was a little bit
of learning on top of it like a support

3908
01:08:23,809 --> 01:08:23,819
of learning on top of it like a support
 

3909
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:26,630
of learning on top of it like a support
Vector machine or binary classifier for

3910
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:26,640
Vector machine or binary classifier for
 

3911
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,610
Vector machine or binary classifier for
cat versus dog and images on top of the

3912
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:28,620
cat versus dog and images on top of the
 

3913
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,769
cat versus dog and images on top of the
features so we wrote the features but we

3914
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:30,779
features so we wrote the features but we
 

3915
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:33,590
features so we wrote the features but we
trained the last layer sort of the the

3916
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:33,600
trained the last layer sort of the the
 

3917
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,209
trained the last layer sort of the the
classifier and then people are like

3918
01:08:35,209 --> 01:08:35,219
classifier and then people are like
 

3919
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:36,349
classifier and then people are like
actually let's not even design the

3920
01:08:36,349 --> 01:08:36,359
actually let's not even design the
 

3921
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,269
actually let's not even design the
features because we can't honestly we're

3922
01:08:38,269 --> 01:08:38,279
features because we can't honestly we're
 

3923
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,130
features because we can't honestly we're
not very good at it so let's also learn

3924
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:40,140
not very good at it so let's also learn
 

3925
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,930
not very good at it so let's also learn
the features and then you end up with

3926
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:41,940
the features and then you end up with
 

3927
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,189
the features and then you end up with
basically a convolutional neural net

3928
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:43,199
basically a convolutional neural net
 

3929
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:45,110
basically a convolutional neural net
where you're learning most of it you're

3930
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:45,120
where you're learning most of it you're
 

3931
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,450
where you're learning most of it you're
just specifying the architecture and the

3932
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:47,460
just specifying the architecture and the
 

3933
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,070
just specifying the architecture and the
architecture has tons of fill in the

3934
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:49,080
architecture has tons of fill in the
 

3935
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,050
architecture has tons of fill in the
blanks which is all the knobs and you

3936
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:51,060
blanks which is all the knobs and you
 

3937
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,849
blanks which is all the knobs and you
let the optimization write most of it

3938
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:52,859
let the optimization write most of it
 

3939
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:54,829
let the optimization write most of it
and so this transition is happening

3940
01:08:54,829 --> 01:08:54,839
and so this transition is happening
 

3941
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,410
and so this transition is happening
across the industry everywhere and uh

3942
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:57,420
across the industry everywhere and uh
 

3943
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,329
across the industry everywhere and uh
suddenly we end up with a ton of code

3944
01:08:59,329 --> 01:08:59,339
suddenly we end up with a ton of code
 

3945
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:01,070
suddenly we end up with a ton of code
that is written in neural net weights

3946
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:01,080
that is written in neural net weights
 

3947
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,689
that is written in neural net weights
and I was just pointing out that the

3948
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:02,699
and I was just pointing out that the
 

3949
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:04,970
and I was just pointing out that the
analogy is actually pretty strong and we

3950
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:04,980
analogy is actually pretty strong and we
 

3951
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,709
analogy is actually pretty strong and we
have a lot of developer environments for

3952
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
have a lot of developer environments for
 

3953
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,769
have a lot of developer environments for
software 1.0 like we have Ides

3954
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:09,779
software 1.0 like we have Ides
 

3955
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,150
software 1.0 like we have Ides
um how you work with code how you debug

3956
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:11,160
um how you work with code how you debug
 

3957
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,189
um how you work with code how you debug
code how do you how do you run code how

3958
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:13,199
code how do you how do you run code how
 

3959
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:14,990
code how do you how do you run code how
do you maintain code we have GitHub so I

3960
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:15,000
do you maintain code we have GitHub so I
 

3961
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,130
do you maintain code we have GitHub so I
was trying to make those analogies in

3962
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:16,140
was trying to make those analogies in
 

3963
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,930
was trying to make those analogies in
the new realm like what is the GitHub or

3964
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:17,940
the new realm like what is the GitHub or
 

3965
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,729
the new realm like what is the GitHub or
software 2.0 it turns out that something

3966
01:09:19,729 --> 01:09:19,739
software 2.0 it turns out that something
 

3967
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,229
software 2.0 it turns out that something
that looks like hugging face right now

3968
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:21,239
that looks like hugging face right now
 

3969
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:24,410
that looks like hugging face right now
uh you know and so I think some people

3970
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:24,420
uh you know and so I think some people
 

3971
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,729
uh you know and so I think some people
took it seriously and built cool

3972
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:25,739
took it seriously and built cool
 

3973
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:28,309
took it seriously and built cool
companies and uh many people originally

3974
01:09:28,309 --> 01:09:28,319
companies and uh many people originally
 

3975
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,870
companies and uh many people originally
attacked the post it actually was not

3976
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:29,880
attacked the post it actually was not
 

3977
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,209
attacked the post it actually was not
well received when I wrote it and I

3978
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:32,219
well received when I wrote it and I
 

3979
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:33,410
well received when I wrote it and I
think maybe it has something to do with

3980
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:33,420
think maybe it has something to do with
 

3981
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,090
think maybe it has something to do with
the title but the post was not well

3982
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:35,100
the title but the post was not well
 

3983
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,590
the title but the post was not well
received and I think more people sort of

3984
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:36,600
received and I think more people sort of
 

3985
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,510
received and I think more people sort of
have been coming around to it over time

3986
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:38,520
have been coming around to it over time
 

3987
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,289
have been coming around to it over time
yeah so you were the director of AI at

3988
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:42,299
yeah so you were the director of AI at
 

3989
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:45,130
yeah so you were the director of AI at
Tesla where I think this idea

3990
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:45,140
Tesla where I think this idea
 

3991
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:49,189
Tesla where I think this idea
was really implemented at scale which is

3992
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
was really implemented at scale which is
 

3993
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,630
was really implemented at scale which is
how you have engineering teams doing

3994
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
how you have engineering teams doing
 

3995
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,450
how you have engineering teams doing
software 2.0 so can you sort of Linger

3996
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:53,460
software 2.0 so can you sort of Linger
 

3997
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:56,930
software 2.0 so can you sort of Linger
on that idea of I think we're in the

3998
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:56,940
on that idea of I think we're in the
 

3999
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,490
on that idea of I think we're in the
really early stages of everything you

4000
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:58,500
really early stages of everything you
 

4001
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,250
really early stages of everything you
just said which is like GitHub Ides

4002
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:01,260
just said which is like GitHub Ides
 

4003
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,890
just said which is like GitHub Ides
like how do we build engineering teams

4004
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:03,900
like how do we build engineering teams
 

4005
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:07,130
like how do we build engineering teams
that that work in software 2.0 systems

4006
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:07,140
that that work in software 2.0 systems
 

4007
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:10,250
that that work in software 2.0 systems
and and the the data collection and the

4008
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:10,260
and and the the data collection and the
 

4009
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,890
and and the the data collection and the
data annotation which is

4010
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:12,900
data annotation which is
 

4011
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,709
data annotation which is
all part of that software 2.0 like what

4012
01:10:15,709 --> 01:10:15,719
all part of that software 2.0 like what
 

4013
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:17,450
all part of that software 2.0 like what
do you think is the task of programming

4014
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:17,460
do you think is the task of programming
 

4015
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:21,410
do you think is the task of programming
a software 2.0 is it debugging in the

4016
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:21,420
a software 2.0 is it debugging in the
 

4017
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,870
a software 2.0 is it debugging in the
space of hyper parameters or is it also

4018
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:23,880
space of hyper parameters or is it also
 

4019
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,990
space of hyper parameters or is it also
debugging the space of data yeah the way

4020
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:27,000
debugging the space of data yeah the way
 

4021
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,450
debugging the space of data yeah the way
by which you program the computer and

4022
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:29,460
by which you program the computer and
 

4023
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,630
by which you program the computer and
influence its algorithm is not by

4024
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:32,640
influence its algorithm is not by
 

4025
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,790
influence its algorithm is not by
writing the commands yourself you're

4026
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:34,800
writing the commands yourself you're
 

4027
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,310
writing the commands yourself you're
changing mostly the data set uh you're

4028
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:37,320
changing mostly the data set uh you're
 

4029
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,010
changing mostly the data set uh you're
changing the um loss functions of like

4030
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:40,020
changing the um loss functions of like
 

4031
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,689
changing the um loss functions of like
what the neural net is trying to do how

4032
01:10:41,689 --> 01:10:41,699
what the neural net is trying to do how
 

4033
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:42,950
what the neural net is trying to do how
it's trying to predict things but yeah

4034
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:42,960
it's trying to predict things but yeah
 

4035
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,510
it's trying to predict things but yeah
basically the data sets and the

4036
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:44,520
basically the data sets and the
 

4037
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,950
basically the data sets and the
architectures of the neural net and um

4038
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:47,960
architectures of the neural net and um
 

4039
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,330
architectures of the neural net and um
so in the case of the autopilot a lot of

4040
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:50,340
so in the case of the autopilot a lot of
 

4041
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,470
so in the case of the autopilot a lot of
the data sets have to do with for

4042
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,480
the data sets have to do with for
 

4043
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,910
the data sets have to do with for
example detection of objects and Lane

4044
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:52,920
example detection of objects and Lane
 

4045
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,410
example detection of objects and Lane
line markings and traffic lights and so

4046
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:54,420
line markings and traffic lights and so
 

4047
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,090
line markings and traffic lights and so
on So You accumulate massive data sets

4048
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:56,100
on So You accumulate massive data sets
 

4049
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,790
on So You accumulate massive data sets
of here's an example here's the desired

4050
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:58,800
of here's an example here's the desired
 

4051
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,270
of here's an example here's the desired
label and then uh here's roughly how the

4052
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:02,280
label and then uh here's roughly how the
 

4053
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,530
label and then uh here's roughly how the
architect here's roughly what the

4054
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:03,540
architect here's roughly what the
 

4055
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,729
architect here's roughly what the
algorithm should look like and that's a

4056
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:04,739
algorithm should look like and that's a
 

4057
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:06,229
algorithm should look like and that's a
conclusional neural net so the

4058
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:06,239
conclusional neural net so the
 

4059
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,370
conclusional neural net so the
specification of the architecture is

4060
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:07,380
specification of the architecture is
 

4061
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,290
specification of the architecture is
like a hint as to what the algorithm

4062
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:09,300
like a hint as to what the algorithm
 

4063
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,910
like a hint as to what the algorithm
should roughly look like and then to

4064
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:10,920
should roughly look like and then to
 

4065
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,890
should roughly look like and then to
fill in the blanks process of

4066
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:12,900
fill in the blanks process of
 

4067
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,530
fill in the blanks process of
optimization is the training process

4068
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:15,540
optimization is the training process
 

4069
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,270
optimization is the training process
and then you take your neural nut that

4070
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:17,280
and then you take your neural nut that
 

4071
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,530
and then you take your neural nut that
was trained it gives all the right

4072
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:18,540
was trained it gives all the right
 

4073
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,090
was trained it gives all the right
answers on your data set and you deploy

4074
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:20,100
answers on your data set and you deploy
 

4075
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:20,870
answers on your data set and you deploy
it

4076
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:20,880
it
 

4077
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,470
it
so there's in that case perhaps it all

4078
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480
so there's in that case perhaps it all
 

4079
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,510
so there's in that case perhaps it all
machine learning cases there's a lot of

4080
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:26,520
machine learning cases there's a lot of
 

4081
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,950
machine learning cases there's a lot of
tasks

4082
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:27,960
tasks
 

4083
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,510
tasks
so is coming up formulating a task like

4084
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:32,520
so is coming up formulating a task like
 

4085
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,149
so is coming up formulating a task like
uh for a multi-headed neural network is

4086
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:35,159
uh for a multi-headed neural network is
 

4087
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:36,590
uh for a multi-headed neural network is
formulating a task part of the

4088
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:36,600
formulating a task part of the
 

4089
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,290
formulating a task part of the
programming yeah very much so how you

4090
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:39,300
programming yeah very much so how you
 

4091
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,229
programming yeah very much so how you
break down a problem into a set of tasks

4092
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:42,239
break down a problem into a set of tasks
 

4093
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,250
break down a problem into a set of tasks
yeah

4094
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:43,260
yeah
 

4095
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,110
yeah
I'm on a high level I would say if you

4096
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
I'm on a high level I would say if you
 

4097
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,470
I'm on a high level I would say if you
look at the software running in in the

4098
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
look at the software running in in the
 

4099
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,209
look at the software running in in the
autopilot I gave a number of talks on

4100
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:50,219
autopilot I gave a number of talks on
 

4101
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:52,370
autopilot I gave a number of talks on
this topic I would say originally a lot

4102
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:52,380
this topic I would say originally a lot
 

4103
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,990
this topic I would say originally a lot
of it was written in software 1.0

4104
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:54,000
of it was written in software 1.0
 

4105
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,689
of it was written in software 1.0
there's imagine lots of C plus plus all

4106
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:56,699
there's imagine lots of C plus plus all
 

4107
01:11:56,699 --> 01:11:59,270
there's imagine lots of C plus plus all
right and then gradually there was a

4108
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280
right and then gradually there was a
 

4109
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,590
right and then gradually there was a
tiny neural net that was for example

4110
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:00,600
tiny neural net that was for example
 

4111
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,870
tiny neural net that was for example
predicting given a single image is there

4112
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
predicting given a single image is there
 

4113
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,490
predicting given a single image is there
like a traffic light or not or is there

4114
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:04,500
like a traffic light or not or is there
 

4115
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,169
like a traffic light or not or is there
a landline marking or not and this

4116
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:06,179
a landline marking or not and this
 

4117
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:08,510
a landline marking or not and this
neural net didn't have too much to do in

4118
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:08,520
neural net didn't have too much to do in
 

4119
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,250
neural net didn't have too much to do in
this in the scope of the software it was

4120
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:10,260
this in the scope of the software it was
 

4121
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,570
this in the scope of the software it was
making tiny predictions on individual

4122
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:11,580
making tiny predictions on individual
 

4123
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,790
making tiny predictions on individual
little image and then the rest of the

4124
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:13,800
little image and then the rest of the
 

4125
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,130
little image and then the rest of the
system stitched it up so okay we're

4126
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:16,140
system stitched it up so okay we're
 

4127
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,270
system stitched it up so okay we're
actually we don't have just a single

4128
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:17,280
actually we don't have just a single
 

4129
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,830
actually we don't have just a single
camera with eight cameras we actually

4130
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:18,840
camera with eight cameras we actually
 

4131
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,930
camera with eight cameras we actually
have eight cameras over time and so what

4132
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:20,940
have eight cameras over time and so what
 

4133
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,070
have eight cameras over time and so what
do you do with these predictions how do

4134
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,080
do you do with these predictions how do
 

4135
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,689
do you do with these predictions how do
you put them together how do you do the

4136
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:23,699
you put them together how do you do the
 

4137
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,370
you put them together how do you do the
fusion of all that information and how

4138
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:25,380
fusion of all that information and how
 

4139
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,930
fusion of all that information and how
do you act on it all of that was written

4140
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:26,940
do you act on it all of that was written
 

4141
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,570
do you act on it all of that was written
by humans um in C plus

4142
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:29,580
by humans um in C plus
 

4143
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,610
by humans um in C plus
and then we decided okay we don't

4144
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:31,620
and then we decided okay we don't
 

4145
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,370
and then we decided okay we don't
actually want uh to do all of that

4146
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:34,380
actually want uh to do all of that
 

4147
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,410
actually want uh to do all of that
Fusion in C plus code because we're

4148
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:36,420
Fusion in C plus code because we're
 

4149
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,610
Fusion in C plus code because we're
actually not good enough to write that

4150
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:37,620
actually not good enough to write that
 

4151
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,169
actually not good enough to write that
algorithm we want the neural Nets to

4152
01:12:39,169 --> 01:12:39,179
algorithm we want the neural Nets to
 

4153
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:40,790
algorithm we want the neural Nets to
write the algorithm and we want to Port

4154
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:40,800
write the algorithm and we want to Port
 

4155
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,250
write the algorithm and we want to Port
uh all of that software into the 2.0

4156
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:43,260
uh all of that software into the 2.0
 

4157
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,090
uh all of that software into the 2.0
stack

4158
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:44,100
stack
 

4159
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,830
stack
and so then we actually had neural Nets

4160
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:45,840
and so then we actually had neural Nets
 

4161
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,689
and so then we actually had neural Nets
that now take all the eight camera

4162
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:47,699
that now take all the eight camera
 

4163
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:49,370
that now take all the eight camera
images simultaneously and make

4164
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:49,380
images simultaneously and make
 

4165
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,930
images simultaneously and make
predictions for all of that

4166
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:50,940
predictions for all of that
 

4167
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,729
predictions for all of that
so

4168
01:12:52,729 --> 01:12:52,739
so
 

4169
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:54,530
so
um and and actually they don't make

4170
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:54,540
um and and actually they don't make
 

4171
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,330
um and and actually they don't make
predictions in a in the space of images

4172
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:56,340
predictions in a in the space of images
 

4173
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,630
predictions in a in the space of images
they now make predictions directly in 3D

4174
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:58,640
they now make predictions directly in 3D
 

4175
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,950
they now make predictions directly in 3D
and actually they don't in three

4176
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
and actually they don't in three
 

4177
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,930
and actually they don't in three
dimensions around the car and now

4178
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:02,940
dimensions around the car and now
 

4179
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,550
dimensions around the car and now
actually we don't

4180
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
actually we don't
 

4181
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,310
actually we don't
um manually fuse the predictions over in

4182
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:07,320
um manually fuse the predictions over in
 

4183
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,470
um manually fuse the predictions over in
3D over time we don't trust ourselves to

4184
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:09,480
3D over time we don't trust ourselves to
 

4185
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,450
3D over time we don't trust ourselves to
write that tracker so actually we give

4186
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:11,460
write that tracker so actually we give
 

4187
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,910
write that tracker so actually we give
the neural net uh the information over

4188
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:13,920
the neural net uh the information over
 

4189
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,770
the neural net uh the information over
time so it takes these videos now and

4190
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:15,780
time so it takes these videos now and
 

4191
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,630
time so it takes these videos now and
makes those predictions and so your sort

4192
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:17,640
makes those predictions and so your sort
 

4193
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,010
makes those predictions and so your sort
of just like putting more and more power

4194
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:19,020
of just like putting more and more power
 

4195
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,930
of just like putting more and more power
into the neural network processing and

4196
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:20,940
into the neural network processing and
 

4197
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,570
into the neural network processing and
at the end of it the eventual sort of

4198
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:23,580
at the end of it the eventual sort of
 

4199
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,010
at the end of it the eventual sort of
goal is to have most of the software

4200
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:25,020
goal is to have most of the software
 

4201
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,950
goal is to have most of the software
potentially be in the 2.0 land

4202
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:27,960
potentially be in the 2.0 land
 

4203
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,930
potentially be in the 2.0 land
um because it works significantly better

4204
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:29,940
um because it works significantly better
 

4205
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,910
um because it works significantly better
humans are just not very good at writing

4206
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:31,920
humans are just not very good at writing
 

4207
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,410
humans are just not very good at writing
software basically so the prediction is

4208
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:33,420
software basically so the prediction is
 

4209
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,229
software basically so the prediction is
space happening in this like 4D land

4210
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:36,239
space happening in this like 4D land
 

4211
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,270
space happening in this like 4D land
yeah was three-dimensional world over

4212
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:38,280
yeah was three-dimensional world over
 

4213
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,490
yeah was three-dimensional world over
time yeah how do you

4214
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:40,500
time yeah how do you
 

4215
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,189
time yeah how do you
do annotation in that world what what

4216
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:43,199
do annotation in that world what what
 

4217
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,550
do annotation in that world what what
have you as it's just a data annotation

4218
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:45,560
have you as it's just a data annotation
 

4219
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,350
have you as it's just a data annotation
whether it's self-supervised or manual

4220
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:48,360
whether it's self-supervised or manual
 

4221
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,490
whether it's self-supervised or manual
by humans is um is a big part of this

4222
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:52,500
by humans is um is a big part of this
 

4223
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,189
by humans is um is a big part of this
software 2.0 world right I would say by

4224
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:55,199
software 2.0 world right I would say by
 

4225
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,930
software 2.0 world right I would say by
far in the industry if you're like

4226
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:56,940
far in the industry if you're like
 

4227
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,970
far in the industry if you're like
talking about the industry and how what

4228
01:13:58,970 --> 01:13:58,980
talking about the industry and how what
 

4229
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,169
talking about the industry and how what
is the technology of what we have

4230
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:00,179
is the technology of what we have
 

4231
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:01,430
is the technology of what we have
available everything is supervised

4232
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:01,440
available everything is supervised
 

4233
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,130
available everything is supervised
learning so you need data sets of input

4234
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:04,140
learning so you need data sets of input
 

4235
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,410
learning so you need data sets of input
desired output and you need lots of it

4236
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:06,420
desired output and you need lots of it
 

4237
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,169
desired output and you need lots of it
and um there are three properties of it

4238
01:14:09,169 --> 01:14:09,179
and um there are three properties of it
 

4239
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:10,310
and um there are three properties of it
that you need you need it to be very

4240
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
that you need you need it to be very
 

4241
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,350
that you need you need it to be very
large you need it to be accurate No

4242
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:12,360
large you need it to be accurate No
 

4243
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,270
large you need it to be accurate No
mistakes and you need it to be diverse

4244
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:14,280
mistakes and you need it to be diverse
 

4245
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,810
mistakes and you need it to be diverse
you don't want to uh just have a lot of

4246
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:17,820
you don't want to uh just have a lot of
 

4247
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,370
you don't want to uh just have a lot of
correct examples of one thing you need

4248
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:19,380
correct examples of one thing you need
 

4249
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,810
correct examples of one thing you need
to really cover the space of possibility

4250
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:20,820
to really cover the space of possibility
 

4251
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,610
to really cover the space of possibility
as much as you can and the more you can

4252
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:22,620
as much as you can and the more you can
 

4253
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,350
as much as you can and the more you can
cover the space of possible inputs the

4254
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:24,360
cover the space of possible inputs the
 

4255
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,729
cover the space of possible inputs the
better the algorithm will work at the

4256
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:25,739
better the algorithm will work at the
 

4257
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:27,830
better the algorithm will work at the
end now once you have really good data

4258
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:27,840
end now once you have really good data
 

4259
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,470
end now once you have really good data
sets that you're collecting curating

4260
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:30,480
sets that you're collecting curating
 

4261
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,810
sets that you're collecting curating
um and cleaning you can train uh your

4262
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:32,820
um and cleaning you can train uh your
 

4263
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,890
um and cleaning you can train uh your
neural net

4264
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:33,900
neural net
 

4265
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,990
neural net
um on top of that so a lot of the work

4266
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
um on top of that so a lot of the work
 

4267
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,610
um on top of that so a lot of the work
goes into cleaning those data sets now

4268
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:37,620
goes into cleaning those data sets now
 

4269
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,590
goes into cleaning those data sets now
as you pointed out it's probably it

4270
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:39,600
as you pointed out it's probably it
 

4271
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,270
as you pointed out it's probably it
could be the question is how do you

4272
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:41,280
could be the question is how do you
 

4273
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,090
could be the question is how do you
achieve a ton of uh if you want to

4274
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:44,100
achieve a ton of uh if you want to
 

4275
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,310
achieve a ton of uh if you want to
basically predict in 3D you need data in

4276
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:46,320
basically predict in 3D you need data in
 

4277
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,310
basically predict in 3D you need data in
3D to back that up so in this video we

4278
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:49,320
3D to back that up so in this video we
 

4279
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,870
3D to back that up so in this video we
have eight videos coming from all the

4280
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
have eight videos coming from all the
 

4281
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,570
have eight videos coming from all the
cameras of the system and this is what

4282
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:53,580
cameras of the system and this is what
 

4283
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,550
cameras of the system and this is what
they saw and this is the truth of what

4284
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:55,560
they saw and this is the truth of what
 

4285
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,990
they saw and this is the truth of what
actually was around there was this car

4286
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:57,000
actually was around there was this car
 

4287
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,729
actually was around there was this car
there was this car this car these are

4288
01:14:58,729 --> 01:14:58,739
there was this car this car these are
 

4289
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:00,050
there was this car this car these are
the lane line markings this is geometry

4290
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:00,060
the lane line markings this is geometry
 

4291
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,310
the lane line markings this is geometry
of the road there's a traffic light in

4292
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:01,320
of the road there's a traffic light in
 

4293
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,050
of the road there's a traffic light in
this three-dimensional position you need

4294
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:03,060
this three-dimensional position you need
 

4295
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,490
this three-dimensional position you need
the ground truth

4296
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:04,500
the ground truth
 

4297
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,169
the ground truth
um and so the big question that the team

4298
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:06,179
um and so the big question that the team
 

4299
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:08,270
um and so the big question that the team
was solving of course is how do you how

4300
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:08,280
was solving of course is how do you how
 

4301
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,290
was solving of course is how do you how
do you arrive at that ground truth

4302
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:09,300
do you arrive at that ground truth
 

4303
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,850
do you arrive at that ground truth
because once you have a million of it

4304
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:10,860
because once you have a million of it
 

4305
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,950
because once you have a million of it
and it's large clean and diverse then

4306
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:12,960
and it's large clean and diverse then
 

4307
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,270
and it's large clean and diverse then
training a neural network on it works

4308
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:14,280
training a neural network on it works
 

4309
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,590
training a neural network on it works
extremely well and you can ship that

4310
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
extremely well and you can ship that
 

4311
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,610
extremely well and you can ship that
into the car

4312
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:16,620
into the car
 

4313
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,950
into the car
and uh so there's many mechanisms by

4314
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:18,960
and uh so there's many mechanisms by
 

4315
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,570
and uh so there's many mechanisms by
which we collected that training data

4316
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:20,580
which we collected that training data
 

4317
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,370
which we collected that training data
you can always go for human annotation

4318
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:22,380
you can always go for human annotation
 

4319
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,530
you can always go for human annotation
you can go for simulation as a source of

4320
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:24,540
you can go for simulation as a source of
 

4321
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,630
you can go for simulation as a source of
ground truth you can also go for what we

4322
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:26,640
ground truth you can also go for what we
 

4323
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,430
ground truth you can also go for what we
call the offline tracker

4324
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:28,440
call the offline tracker
 

4325
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,149
call the offline tracker
um

4326
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:29,159
um
 

4327
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:30,890
um
that we've spoken about at the AI day

4328
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:30,900
that we've spoken about at the AI day
 

4329
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,630
that we've spoken about at the AI day
and so on which is basically an

4330
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:32,640
and so on which is basically an
 

4331
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,610
and so on which is basically an
automatic reconstruction process for

4332
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:34,620
automatic reconstruction process for
 

4333
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,890
automatic reconstruction process for
taking those videos and recovering the

4334
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:36,900
taking those videos and recovering the
 

4335
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,290
taking those videos and recovering the
three-dimensional sort of reality of

4336
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:39,300
three-dimensional sort of reality of
 

4337
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,209
three-dimensional sort of reality of
what was around that car so basically

4338
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:41,219
what was around that car so basically
 

4339
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:42,410
what was around that car so basically
think of doing like a three-dimensional

4340
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:42,420
think of doing like a three-dimensional
 

4341
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,810
think of doing like a three-dimensional
reconstruction as an offline thing and

4342
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:44,820
reconstruction as an offline thing and
 

4343
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,510
reconstruction as an offline thing and
then understanding that okay there's 10

4344
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:47,520
then understanding that okay there's 10
 

4345
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,669
then understanding that okay there's 10
seconds of video this is what we saw and

4346
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:49,679
seconds of video this is what we saw and
 

4347
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,410
seconds of video this is what we saw and
therefore here's all the lane last cars

4348
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:51,420
therefore here's all the lane last cars
 

4349
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,450
therefore here's all the lane last cars
and so on and then once you have that

4350
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:53,460
and so on and then once you have that
 

4351
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,649
and so on and then once you have that
annotation you can train your neural

4352
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:54,659
annotation you can train your neural
 

4353
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:57,350
annotation you can train your neural
Nets to imitate it and how difficult is

4354
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,360
Nets to imitate it and how difficult is
 

4355
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,030
Nets to imitate it and how difficult is
the reconstruct the 3D reconstruction

4356
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
the reconstruct the 3D reconstruction
 

4357
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,430
the reconstruct the 3D reconstruction
it's difficult but it can be done so

4358
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:01,440
it's difficult but it can be done so
 

4359
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,930
it's difficult but it can be done so
there's so the there's overlap between

4360
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:02,940
there's so the there's overlap between
 

4361
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,130
there's so the there's overlap between
the cameras and you do the

4362
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:04,140
the cameras and you do the
 

4363
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,950
the cameras and you do the
Reconstruction and there's uh

4364
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:06,960
Reconstruction and there's uh
 

4365
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,470
Reconstruction and there's uh
perhaps if there's any inaccuracy so

4366
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:09,480
perhaps if there's any inaccuracy so
 

4367
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,630
perhaps if there's any inaccuracy so
that's caught in The annotation step

4368
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:11,640
that's caught in The annotation step
 

4369
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,310
that's caught in The annotation step
uh yes the nice thing about The

4370
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:13,320
uh yes the nice thing about The
 

4371
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,530
uh yes the nice thing about The
annotation is that it is fully offline

4372
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:15,540
annotation is that it is fully offline
 

4373
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,510
annotation is that it is fully offline
you have infinite time you have a chunk

4374
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:17,520
you have infinite time you have a chunk
 

4375
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,950
you have infinite time you have a chunk
of one minute and you're trying to just

4376
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:18,960
of one minute and you're trying to just
 

4377
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,870
of one minute and you're trying to just
offline in a super computer somewhere

4378
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
offline in a super computer somewhere
 

4379
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,910
offline in a super computer somewhere
figure out where were the positions of

4380
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:22,920
figure out where were the positions of
 

4381
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,649
figure out where were the positions of
all the cars all the people and you have

4382
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:24,659
all the cars all the people and you have
 

4383
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:26,090
all the cars all the people and you have
your full one minute of video from all

4384
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:26,100
your full one minute of video from all
 

4385
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,770
your full one minute of video from all
the Angles and you can run all the

4386
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:27,780
the Angles and you can run all the
 

4387
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,970
the Angles and you can run all the
neural Nets you want and they can be

4388
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:28,980
neural Nets you want and they can be
 

4389
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,610
neural Nets you want and they can be
very efficient massive neural Nets there

4390
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:31,620
very efficient massive neural Nets there
 

4391
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,870
very efficient massive neural Nets there
can be neural Nets that can't even run

4392
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:32,880
can be neural Nets that can't even run
 

4393
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,030
can be neural Nets that can't even run
in the car later at this time so they

4394
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,040
in the car later at this time so they
 

4395
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,410
in the car later at this time so they
can be even more powerful neurons than

4396
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:36,420
can be even more powerful neurons than
 

4397
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,270
can be even more powerful neurons than
what you can eventually deploy so you

4398
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:38,280
what you can eventually deploy so you
 

4399
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,110
what you can eventually deploy so you
can do anything you want

4400
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
can do anything you want
 

4401
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,729
can do anything you want
three-dimensional reconstruction neural

three-dimensional reconstruction neural
Nets uh anything you want just to

4404
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:42,300
Nets uh anything you want just to
 

4405
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,550
Nets uh anything you want just to
recover that truth and then you

4406
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:43,560
recover that truth and then you
 

4407
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,050
recover that truth and then you
supervise that truth

4408
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:45,060
supervise that truth
 

4409
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,910
supervise that truth
what have you learned you said no

4410
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:46,920
what have you learned you said no
 

4411
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,370
what have you learned you said no
mistakes about humans

4412
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:49,380
mistakes about humans
 

4413
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,729
mistakes about humans
doing annotation because I assume humans

4414
01:16:52,729 --> 01:16:52,739
doing annotation because I assume humans
 

4415
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:55,370
doing annotation because I assume humans
are uh there's like a range of things

4416
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:55,380
are uh there's like a range of things
 

4417
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,110
are uh there's like a range of things
they're good at in terms of clicking

4418
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
they're good at in terms of clicking
 

4419
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,689
they're good at in terms of clicking
stuff on screen it's not how interesting

4420
01:16:59,689 --> 01:16:59,699
stuff on screen it's not how interesting
 

4421
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,169
stuff on screen it's not how interesting
is that to you of a problem of designing

4422
01:17:02,169 --> 01:17:02,179
is that to you of a problem of designing
 

4423
01:17:02,179 --> 01:17:05,030
is that to you of a problem of designing
an annotator where humans are accurate

4424
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
an annotator where humans are accurate
 

4425
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,010
an annotator where humans are accurate
enjoy it like what are they even the

4426
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:07,020
enjoy it like what are they even the
 

4427
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,990
enjoy it like what are they even the
metrics are efficient or productive all

4428
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,000
metrics are efficient or productive all
 

4429
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,570
metrics are efficient or productive all
that kind of stuff yeah so uh I grew The

4430
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:11,580
that kind of stuff yeah so uh I grew The
 

4431
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,130
that kind of stuff yeah so uh I grew The
annotation team at Tesla from basically

4432
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:13,140
annotation team at Tesla from basically
 

4433
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,709
annotation team at Tesla from basically
zero to a thousand uh while I was there

4434
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:15,719
zero to a thousand uh while I was there
 

4435
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:18,350
zero to a thousand uh while I was there
that was really interesting you know my

4436
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:18,360
that was really interesting you know my
 

4437
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,630
that was really interesting you know my
background is a PhD student researcher

4438
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
background is a PhD student researcher
 

4439
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,370
background is a PhD student researcher
so growing that common organization was

4440
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:22,380
so growing that common organization was
 

4441
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:26,149
so growing that common organization was
pretty crazy uh but uh yeah I think it's

4442
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:26,159
pretty crazy uh but uh yeah I think it's
 

4443
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,130
pretty crazy uh but uh yeah I think it's
extremely interesting and part of the

4444
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:28,140
extremely interesting and part of the
 

4445
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,510
extremely interesting and part of the
design process very much behind the

4446
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:29,520
design process very much behind the
 

4447
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,550
design process very much behind the
autopilot as to where you use humans

4448
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:31,560
autopilot as to where you use humans
 

4449
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,229
autopilot as to where you use humans
humans are very good at certain kinds of

4450
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:33,239
humans are very good at certain kinds of
 

4451
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:34,669
humans are very good at certain kinds of
annotations they're very good for

4452
01:17:34,669 --> 01:17:34,679
annotations they're very good for
 

4453
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:35,990
annotations they're very good for
example at two-dimensional annotations

4454
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,000
example at two-dimensional annotations
 

4455
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,729
example at two-dimensional annotations
of images they're not good at annotating

4456
01:17:37,729 --> 01:17:37,739
of images they're not good at annotating
 

4457
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:40,550
of images they're not good at annotating
uh cars over time in three-dimensional

4458
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
uh cars over time in three-dimensional
 

4459
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,010
uh cars over time in three-dimensional
space very very hard and so that's why

4460
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:43,020
space very very hard and so that's why
 

4461
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,990
space very very hard and so that's why
we were very careful to design the tasks

4462
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:45,000
we were very careful to design the tasks
 

4463
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,729
we were very careful to design the tasks
that are easy to do for humans versus

4464
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:46,739
that are easy to do for humans versus
 

4465
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:48,050
that are easy to do for humans versus
things that should be left to the

4466
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:48,060
things that should be left to the
 

4467
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,090
things that should be left to the
offline tracker like maybe the maybe the

4468
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:50,100
offline tracker like maybe the maybe the
 

4469
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,350
offline tracker like maybe the maybe the
computer will do all the triangulation

4470
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,360
computer will do all the triangulation
 

4471
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,209
computer will do all the triangulation
and 3D reconstruction but the human will

4472
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:53,219
and 3D reconstruction but the human will
 

4473
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:55,010
and 3D reconstruction but the human will
say exactly these pixels of the image

4474
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:55,020
say exactly these pixels of the image
 

4475
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,350
say exactly these pixels of the image
are car exactly these pixels are human

4476
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:57,360
are car exactly these pixels are human
 

4477
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,050
are car exactly these pixels are human
and so co-designing the the data

4478
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:00,060
and so co-designing the the data
 

4479
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,750
and so co-designing the the data
annotation pipeline was very much bread

4480
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:02,760
annotation pipeline was very much bread
 

4481
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,910
annotation pipeline was very much bread
and butter was what I was doing daily do

4482
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:04,920
and butter was what I was doing daily do
 

4483
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,050
and butter was what I was doing daily do
you think there's still a lot of open

4484
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:06,060
you think there's still a lot of open
 

4485
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,810
you think there's still a lot of open
problems in that space

4486
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:08,820
problems in that space
 

4487
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:12,229
problems in that space
um just in general annotation where the

4488
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
um just in general annotation where the
 

4489
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,030
um just in general annotation where the
stuff the machines are good at machines

4490
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:14,040
stuff the machines are good at machines
 

4491
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,490
stuff the machines are good at machines
do and the humans do what they're good

4492
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:16,500
do and the humans do what they're good
 

4493
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,990
do and the humans do what they're good
at and there's maybe some iterative

4494
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000
at and there's maybe some iterative
 

4495
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,570
at and there's maybe some iterative
process right I think to a very large

4496
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:20,580
process right I think to a very large
 

4497
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,070
process right I think to a very large
extent we went through a number of

4498
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,080
extent we went through a number of
 

4499
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,870
extent we went through a number of
iterations and we learned a ton about

4500
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:23,880
iterations and we learned a ton about
 

4501
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,689
iterations and we learned a ton about
how to create these data sets I'm not

4502
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:26,699
how to create these data sets I'm not
 

4503
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:28,729
how to create these data sets I'm not
seeing big open problems like originally

4504
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:28,739
seeing big open problems like originally
 

4505
01:18:28,739 --> 01:18:30,770
seeing big open problems like originally
when I joined I was like I was really

4506
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:30,780
when I joined I was like I was really
 

4507
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,750
when I joined I was like I was really
not sure how this would turn out yeah

4508
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:32,760
not sure how this would turn out yeah
 

4509
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,729
not sure how this would turn out yeah
but by the time I left I was much more

4510
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:34,739
but by the time I left I was much more
 

4511
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:36,709
but by the time I left I was much more
secure in actually we sort of understand

4512
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:36,719
secure in actually we sort of understand
 

4513
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:37,970
secure in actually we sort of understand
the philosophy of how to create these

4514
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:37,980
the philosophy of how to create these
 

4515
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,590
the philosophy of how to create these
data sets and I was pretty comfortable

4516
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:39,600
data sets and I was pretty comfortable
 

4517
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,530
data sets and I was pretty comfortable
with where that was at the time so what

4518
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:42,540
with where that was at the time so what
 

4519
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,830
with where that was at the time so what
are strengths and limitations of cameras

4520
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
are strengths and limitations of cameras
 

4521
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,689
are strengths and limitations of cameras
for the driving test in your

4522
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:47,699
for the driving test in your
 

4523
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,490
for the driving test in your
understanding when you formulate the

4524
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:49,500
understanding when you formulate the
 

4525
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,649
understanding when you formulate the
driving task as a vision task with eight

4526
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:51,659
driving task as a vision task with eight
 

4527
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:52,970
driving task as a vision task with eight
cameras

4528
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:52,980
cameras
 

4529
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,189
cameras
you've seen that the entire you know

4530
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
you've seen that the entire you know
 

4531
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,510
you've seen that the entire you know
most of the history of the computer

4532
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:56,520
most of the history of the computer
 

4533
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,890
most of the history of the computer
vision field when it has to do with

4534
01:18:57,890 --> 01:18:57,900
vision field when it has to do with
 

4535
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,750
vision field when it has to do with
neural networks what just if you step

4536
01:18:59,750 --> 01:18:59,760
neural networks what just if you step
 

4537
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,430
neural networks what just if you step
back what are the strengths and

4538
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440
back what are the strengths and
 

4539
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,790
back what are the strengths and
limitations of pixels of using pixels to

4540
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:04,800
limitations of pixels of using pixels to
 

4541
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,310
limitations of pixels of using pixels to
drive yeah pixels I think are a

4542
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:07,320
drive yeah pixels I think are a
 

4543
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,649
drive yeah pixels I think are a
beautiful sensory beautiful sensor I

4544
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:09,659
beautiful sensory beautiful sensor I
 

4545
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:11,510
beautiful sensory beautiful sensor I
would say the thing is like cameras are

4546
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,520
would say the thing is like cameras are
 

4547
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,310
would say the thing is like cameras are
very very cheap and they provide a ton

4548
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:13,320
very very cheap and they provide a ton
 

4549
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:16,610
very very cheap and they provide a ton
of information ton of bits uh so it's uh

4550
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:16,620
of information ton of bits uh so it's uh
 

4551
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:19,010
of information ton of bits uh so it's uh
extremely cheap sensor for a ton of bits

4552
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:19,020
extremely cheap sensor for a ton of bits
 

4553
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,390
extremely cheap sensor for a ton of bits
and each one of these bits as a

4554
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,400
and each one of these bits as a
 

4555
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,070
and each one of these bits as a
constraint on the state of the world and

4556
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,080
constraint on the state of the world and
 

4557
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,370
constraint on the state of the world and
so you get lots of megapixel images uh

4558
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:25,380
so you get lots of megapixel images uh
 

4559
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,169
so you get lots of megapixel images uh
very cheap and it just gives you all

4560
01:19:27,169 --> 01:19:27,179
very cheap and it just gives you all
 

4561
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,550
very cheap and it just gives you all
these constraints for understanding

4562
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:28,560
these constraints for understanding
 

4563
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,630
these constraints for understanding
what's actually out there in the world

4564
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:29,640
what's actually out there in the world
 

4565
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,270
what's actually out there in the world
so vision is probably the highest

4566
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:32,280
so vision is probably the highest
 

4567
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,250
so vision is probably the highest
bandwidth sensor

4568
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:34,260
bandwidth sensor
 

4569
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,610
bandwidth sensor
it's a very high bandwidth sensor and um

4570
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:37,620
it's a very high bandwidth sensor and um
 

4571
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:42,290
it's a very high bandwidth sensor and um
I love that pixels it is a is a

4572
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:42,300
I love that pixels it is a is a
 

4573
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,870
I love that pixels it is a is a
constraint on the world This is highly

4574
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:44,880
constraint on the world This is highly
 

4575
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,310
constraint on the world This is highly
complex

4576
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:46,320
complex
 

4577
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,770
complex
uh high bandwidth constraint in the

4578
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:48,780
uh high bandwidth constraint in the
 

4579
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:49,970
uh high bandwidth constraint in the
world on the stage of the world that's

4580
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:49,980
world on the stage of the world that's
 

4581
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,590
world on the stage of the world that's
fascinating it's not just that but again

4582
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:51,600
fascinating it's not just that but again
 

4583
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,050
fascinating it's not just that but again
this real real importance of

4584
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:54,060
this real real importance of
 

4585
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,669
this real real importance of
it's the sensor that humans use

4586
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:55,679
it's the sensor that humans use
 

4587
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,370
it's the sensor that humans use
therefore everything is designed for

4588
01:19:58,370 --> 01:19:58,380
therefore everything is designed for
 

4589
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,130
therefore everything is designed for
that sensor yeah the text the writing

4590
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:01,140
that sensor yeah the text the writing
 

4591
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,229
that sensor yeah the text the writing
the flashing signs everything is

4592
01:20:03,229 --> 01:20:03,239
the flashing signs everything is
 

4593
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:06,649
the flashing signs everything is
designed for vision and so and you just

4594
01:20:06,649 --> 01:20:06,659
designed for vision and so and you just
 

4595
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:07,910
designed for vision and so and you just
find it everywhere and so that's why

4596
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
find it everywhere and so that's why
 

4597
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,070
find it everywhere and so that's why
that is the interface you want to be in

4598
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:10,080
that is the interface you want to be in
 

4599
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,390
that is the interface you want to be in
um talking again about these Universal

4600
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:11,400
um talking again about these Universal
 

4601
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,430
um talking again about these Universal
interfaces and uh that's where we

4602
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:13,440
interfaces and uh that's where we
 

4603
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,510
interfaces and uh that's where we
actually want to measure the world as

4604
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:14,520
actually want to measure the world as
 

4605
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,209
actually want to measure the world as
well and then develop software uh for

4606
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:17,219
well and then develop software uh for
 

4607
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:18,770
well and then develop software uh for
that sensor but there's other

4608
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:18,780
that sensor but there's other
 

4609
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,410
that sensor but there's other
constraints on the state of the world

4610
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:21,420
constraints on the state of the world
 

4611
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,810
constraints on the state of the world
that humans use to understand the world

4612
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:23,820
that humans use to understand the world
 

4613
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:27,649
that humans use to understand the world
I mean Vision ultimately is the main one

4614
01:20:27,649 --> 01:20:27,659
I mean Vision ultimately is the main one
 

4615
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:30,830
I mean Vision ultimately is the main one
but we're like we're like referencing

4616
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:30,840
but we're like we're like referencing
 

4617
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,990
but we're like we're like referencing
our understanding of human behavior and

4618
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:33,000
our understanding of human behavior and
 

4619
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,450
our understanding of human behavior and
some common sense

4620
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:34,460
some common sense
 

4621
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,010
some common sense
physics that could be inferred from

4622
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:37,020
physics that could be inferred from
 

4623
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:38,870
physics that could be inferred from
vision from from a perception

4624
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:38,880
vision from from a perception
 

4625
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,209
vision from from a perception
perspective but it feels like we're

4626
01:20:41,209 --> 01:20:41,219
perspective but it feels like we're
 

4627
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:43,669
perspective but it feels like we're
using some kind of reasoning

4628
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679
using some kind of reasoning
 

4629
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,790
using some kind of reasoning
to predict the world yeah not just the

4630
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,800
to predict the world yeah not just the
 

4631
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,350
to predict the world yeah not just the
pixels I mean you have a powerful prior

4632
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:48,360
pixels I mean you have a powerful prior
 

4633
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,350
pixels I mean you have a powerful prior
uh sorry right for how the world evolves

4634
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:51,360
uh sorry right for how the world evolves
 

4635
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,390
uh sorry right for how the world evolves
over time Etc so it's not just about the

4636
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:53,400
over time Etc so it's not just about the
 

4637
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,850
over time Etc so it's not just about the
likelihood term coming up from the data

4638
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:55,860
likelihood term coming up from the data
 

4639
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:57,470
likelihood term coming up from the data
itself telling you about what you are

4640
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:57,480
itself telling you about what you are
 

4641
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,390
itself telling you about what you are
observing but also the prior term of

4642
01:20:59,390 --> 01:20:59,400
observing but also the prior term of
 

4643
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,890
observing but also the prior term of
like where where are the likely things

4644
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:00,900
like where where are the likely things
 

4645
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,510
like where where are the likely things
to see and how do they likely move and

4646
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:02,520
to see and how do they likely move and
 

4647
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,930
to see and how do they likely move and
so on and the question is how complex is

4648
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:05,940
so on and the question is how complex is
 

4649
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,490
so on and the question is how complex is
the uh

4650
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:07,500
the uh
 

4651
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,550
the uh
the the range of possibilities that

4652
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,560
the the range of possibilities that
 

4653
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,770
the the range of possibilities that
might happen in the driving task right

4654
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:12,780
might happen in the driving task right
 

4655
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,050
might happen in the driving task right
that's still is is that to you still an

4656
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:15,060
that's still is is that to you still an
 

4657
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:17,030
that's still is is that to you still an
open problem of how difficult is driving

4658
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
open problem of how difficult is driving
 

4659
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,490
open problem of how difficult is driving
like philosophically speaking

4660
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:19,500
like philosophically speaking
 

4661
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,030
like philosophically speaking
like do you all the time you've worked

4662
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040
like do you all the time you've worked
 

4663
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,430
like do you all the time you've worked
on driving do you understand how hard

4664
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:25,440
on driving do you understand how hard
 

4665
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,470
on driving do you understand how hard
driving is yeah driving is really hard

4666
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:27,480
driving is yeah driving is really hard
 

4667
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,090
driving is yeah driving is really hard
because it has to do with the

4668
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:29,100
because it has to do with the
 

4669
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,470
because it has to do with the
predictions of all these other agents

4670
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:30,480
predictions of all these other agents
 

4671
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,090
predictions of all these other agents
and the theory of mind and you know what

4672
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:32,100
and the theory of mind and you know what
 

4673
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,189
and the theory of mind and you know what
they're gonna do and are they looking at

4674
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:34,199
they're gonna do and are they looking at
 

4675
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:35,570
they're gonna do and are they looking at
you are they where are they looking what

4676
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:35,580
you are they where are they looking what
 

4677
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,310
you are they where are they looking what
are they thinking yeah there's a lot

4678
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:37,320
are they thinking yeah there's a lot
 

4679
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,410
are they thinking yeah there's a lot
that goes there at the at the full tail

4680
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:39,420
that goes there at the at the full tail
 

4681
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,050
that goes there at the at the full tail
of you know the the expansion of the

4682
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:42,060
of you know the the expansion of the
 

4683
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:42,950
of you know the the expansion of the
nines that we have to be comfortable

4684
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:42,960
nines that we have to be comfortable
 

4685
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,470
nines that we have to be comfortable
with eventually the final problems are

4686
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:45,480
with eventually the final problems are
 

4687
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,030
with eventually the final problems are
of that form I don't think those are the

4688
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
of that form I don't think those are the
 

4689
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,250
of that form I don't think those are the
problems that are very common uh I think

4690
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:49,260
problems that are very common uh I think
 

4691
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,990
problems that are very common uh I think
eventually they're important but it's

4692
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,000
eventually they're important but it's
 

4693
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,790
eventually they're important but it's
like really in the tail end in the tail

4694
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
like really in the tail end in the tail
 

4695
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,850
like really in the tail end in the tail
and the rare edge cases

4696
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:54,860
and the rare edge cases
 

4697
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:58,010
and the rare edge cases
from the vision perspective what are the

4698
01:21:58,010 --> 01:21:58,020
from the vision perspective what are the
 

4699
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,930
from the vision perspective what are the
toughest parts of the vision problem of

4700
01:21:59,930 --> 01:21:59,940
toughest parts of the vision problem of
 

4701
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,510
toughest parts of the vision problem of
driving

4702
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:02,520

 

4703
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,169

um

4704
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:03,179
um
 

4705
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:05,689
um
well basically the sensor is extremely

4706
01:22:05,689 --> 01:22:05,699
well basically the sensor is extremely
 

4707
01:22:05,699 --> 01:22:07,310
well basically the sensor is extremely
powerful but you still need to process

4708
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:07,320
powerful but you still need to process
 

4709
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,350
powerful but you still need to process
that information

4710
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
that information
 

4711
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,930
that information
um and so going from brightnesses of

4712
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:11,940
um and so going from brightnesses of
 

4713
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,370
um and so going from brightnesses of
these pixel values to hey here the

4714
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:13,380
these pixel values to hey here the
 

4715
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,169
these pixel values to hey here the
three-dimensional world is extremely

4716
01:22:15,169 --> 01:22:15,179
three-dimensional world is extremely
 

4717
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:16,729
three-dimensional world is extremely
hard and that's what the neural networks

4718
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:16,739
hard and that's what the neural networks
 

4719
01:22:16,739 --> 01:22:19,610
hard and that's what the neural networks
are fundamentally doing and so

4720
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:19,620
are fundamentally doing and so
 

4721
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,590
are fundamentally doing and so
um the difficulty really is in just

4722
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:21,600
um the difficulty really is in just
 

4723
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,450
um the difficulty really is in just
doing an extremely good job of

4724
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:23,460
doing an extremely good job of
 

4725
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,910
doing an extremely good job of
engineering the entire pipeline uh the

4726
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
engineering the entire pipeline uh the
 

4727
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,490
engineering the entire pipeline uh the
entire data engine having the capacity

4728
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:28,500
entire data engine having the capacity
 

4729
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,290
entire data engine having the capacity
to train these neural nuts having the

4730
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:30,300
to train these neural nuts having the
 

4731
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,149
to train these neural nuts having the
ability to evaluate the system and

4732
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
ability to evaluate the system and
 

4733
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,790
ability to evaluate the system and
iterate on it uh so I would say just

4734
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:34,800
iterate on it uh so I would say just
 

4735
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,530
iterate on it uh so I would say just
doing this in production at scale is

4736
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:36,540
doing this in production at scale is
 

4737
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,910
doing this in production at scale is
like the hard part it's an execution

4738
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:37,920
like the hard part it's an execution
 

4739
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,110
like the hard part it's an execution
problem so the data engine but also the

4740
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:42,120
problem so the data engine but also the
 

4741
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,410
problem so the data engine but also the
um the sort of deployment of the system

4742
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:45,420
um the sort of deployment of the system
 

4743
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,510
um the sort of deployment of the system
such that has low latency performance so

4744
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,520
such that has low latency performance so
 

4745
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,310
such that has low latency performance so
it has to do all these steps yeah for

4746
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:49,320
it has to do all these steps yeah for
 

4747
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,750
it has to do all these steps yeah for
the neural net specifically just making

4748
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:50,760
the neural net specifically just making
 

4749
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,610
the neural net specifically just making
sure everything fits into the chip on

4750
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:52,620
sure everything fits into the chip on
 

4751
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:55,010
sure everything fits into the chip on
the car yeah and uh you have a finite

4752
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:55,020
the car yeah and uh you have a finite
 

4753
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,169
the car yeah and uh you have a finite
budget of flops that you can perform and

4754
01:22:57,169 --> 01:22:57,179
budget of flops that you can perform and
 

4755
01:22:57,179 --> 01:22:58,729
budget of flops that you can perform and
uh and memory bandwidth and other

4756
01:22:58,729 --> 01:22:58,739
uh and memory bandwidth and other
 

4757
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:00,649
uh and memory bandwidth and other
constraints and you have to make sure it

4758
01:23:00,649 --> 01:23:00,659
constraints and you have to make sure it
 

4759
01:23:00,659 --> 01:23:02,209
constraints and you have to make sure it
flies and you can squeeze in as much

4760
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:02,219
flies and you can squeeze in as much
 

4761
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:04,370
flies and you can squeeze in as much
compute as you can into the tiny what

4762
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:04,380
compute as you can into the tiny what
 

4763
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,510
compute as you can into the tiny what
have you learned from that process

4764
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
have you learned from that process
 

4765
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,189
have you learned from that process
because it maybe that's one of the

4766
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:07,199
because it maybe that's one of the
 

4767
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:10,189
because it maybe that's one of the
bigger like new things coming from a

4768
01:23:10,189 --> 01:23:10,199
bigger like new things coming from a
 

4769
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:11,570
bigger like new things coming from a
research background

4770
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:11,580
research background
 

4771
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,490
research background
where there's there's a system that has

4772
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:13,500
where there's there's a system that has
 

4773
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,110
where there's there's a system that has
to run under heavily constrained

4774
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:15,120
to run under heavily constrained
 

4775
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,970
to run under heavily constrained
resources right has to run really fast

4776
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:16,980
resources right has to run really fast
 

4777
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,490
resources right has to run really fast
what what kind of insights have you uh

4778
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:19,500
what what kind of insights have you uh
 

4779
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,750
what what kind of insights have you uh
learned from that

4780
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:20,760
learned from that
 

4781
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,149
learned from that
yeah I'm not sure if it's if there's too

4782
01:23:23,149 --> 01:23:23,159
yeah I'm not sure if it's if there's too
 

4783
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:25,189
yeah I'm not sure if it's if there's too
many insights you're trying to create a

4784
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:25,199
many insights you're trying to create a
 

4785
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,410
many insights you're trying to create a
neural net that will fit in what you

4786
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:27,420
neural net that will fit in what you
 

4787
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,149
neural net that will fit in what you
have available and you're always trying

4788
01:23:29,149 --> 01:23:29,159
have available and you're always trying
 

4789
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:30,950
have available and you're always trying
to optimize it and we talked a lot about

4790
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:30,960
to optimize it and we talked a lot about
 

4791
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,950
to optimize it and we talked a lot about
it on the AI day and uh basically the

4792
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:33,960
it on the AI day and uh basically the
 

4793
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,810
it on the AI day and uh basically the
the triple backflips that the team is

4794
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:35,820
the triple backflips that the team is
 

4795
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,910
the triple backflips that the team is
doing to make sure it all fits and

4796
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:37,920
doing to make sure it all fits and
 

4797
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,010
doing to make sure it all fits and
utilizes the engine uh so I think it's

4798
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:40,020
utilizes the engine uh so I think it's
 

4799
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,050
utilizes the engine uh so I think it's
extremely good engineering

4800
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:42,060
extremely good engineering
 

4801
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,850
extremely good engineering
um and then there's also all kinds of

4802
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:43,860
um and then there's also all kinds of
 

4803
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,590
um and then there's also all kinds of
little insights peppered in on how to do

4804
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:45,600
little insights peppered in on how to do
 

4805
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,810
little insights peppered in on how to do
it properly let's actually zoom out

4806
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:47,820
it properly let's actually zoom out
 

4807
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:48,830
it properly let's actually zoom out
because I don't think we talked about

4808
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:48,840
because I don't think we talked about
 

4809
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,250
because I don't think we talked about
the data engine the entirety of the

4810
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:51,260
the data engine the entirety of the
 

4811
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:54,470
the data engine the entirety of the
layout of this idea that I think is just

4812
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:54,480
layout of this idea that I think is just
 

4813
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,530
layout of this idea that I think is just
beautiful with humans in the loop can

4814
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:57,540
beautiful with humans in the loop can
 

4815
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,330
beautiful with humans in the loop can
you describe the data engine

4816
01:23:59,330 --> 01:23:59,340
you describe the data engine
 

4817
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,669
you describe the data engine
yeah the data engine is what I call the

4818
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
yeah the data engine is what I call the
 

4819
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,610
yeah the data engine is what I call the
almost biological feeling like process

4820
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:04,620
almost biological feeling like process
 

4821
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:07,970
almost biological feeling like process
by which you uh perfect the training

4822
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:07,980
by which you uh perfect the training
 

4823
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:10,010
by which you uh perfect the training
sets for these neural networks

4824
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:10,020
sets for these neural networks
 

4825
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,870
sets for these neural networks
um so because most of the programming

4826
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:11,880
um so because most of the programming
 

4827
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,490
um so because most of the programming
now is in the level of these data sets

4828
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:13,500
now is in the level of these data sets
 

4829
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,870
now is in the level of these data sets
and make sure they're large diverse and

4830
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
and make sure they're large diverse and
 

4831
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,110
and make sure they're large diverse and
clean oh basically you have a data set

4832
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:18,120
clean oh basically you have a data set
 

4833
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,790
clean oh basically you have a data set
that you think is good you train your

4834
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:19,800
that you think is good you train your
 

4835
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,430
that you think is good you train your
neural net you deploy it and then you

4836
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:22,440
neural net you deploy it and then you
 

4837
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,290
neural net you deploy it and then you
observe how well it's performing and

4838
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:24,300
observe how well it's performing and
 

4839
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,510
observe how well it's performing and
you're trying to uh always increase the

4840
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:26,520
you're trying to uh always increase the
 

4841
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,890
you're trying to uh always increase the
quality of your data set so you're

4842
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:27,900
quality of your data set so you're
 

4843
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,750
quality of your data set so you're
trying to catch scenarios basically

4844
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:29,760
trying to catch scenarios basically
 

4845
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,110
trying to catch scenarios basically
there are basically rare and uh it is in

4846
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:33,120
there are basically rare and uh it is in
 

4847
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,310
there are basically rare and uh it is in
these scenarios that the neural Nets

4848
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:34,320
these scenarios that the neural Nets
 

4849
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,630
these scenarios that the neural Nets
will typically struggle in because they

4850
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:35,640
will typically struggle in because they
 

4851
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,070
will typically struggle in because they
weren't told what to do in those rare

4852
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:37,080
weren't told what to do in those rare
 

4853
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,290
weren't told what to do in those rare
cases in the data set but now you can

4854
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:39,300
cases in the data set but now you can
 

4855
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,850
cases in the data set but now you can
close the loop because if you can now

4856
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:40,860
close the loop because if you can now
 

4857
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,130
close the loop because if you can now
collect all those at scale you can then

4858
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:43,140
collect all those at scale you can then
 

4859
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,930
collect all those at scale you can then
feed them back into the Reconstruction

4860
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:44,940
feed them back into the Reconstruction
 

4861
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,510
feed them back into the Reconstruction
process I described and uh reconstruct

4862
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:47,520
process I described and uh reconstruct
 

4863
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,310
process I described and uh reconstruct
the truth in those cases and add it to

4864
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:49,320
the truth in those cases and add it to
 

4865
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,990
the truth in those cases and add it to
the data set and so the whole thing ends

4866
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:51,000
the data set and so the whole thing ends
 

4867
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,970
the data set and so the whole thing ends
up being like a staircase of improvement

4868
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:52,980
up being like a staircase of improvement
 

4869
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:55,850
up being like a staircase of improvement
of perfecting your training set and you

4870
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:55,860
of perfecting your training set and you
 

4871
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,350
of perfecting your training set and you
have to go through deployments so that

4872
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,360
have to go through deployments so that
 

4873
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,050
have to go through deployments so that
you can mine uh the parts that are not

4874
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:00,060
you can mine uh the parts that are not
 

4875
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,689
you can mine uh the parts that are not
yet represented well in the data set so

4876
01:25:02,689 --> 01:25:02,699
yet represented well in the data set so
 

4877
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:03,950
yet represented well in the data set so
your data set is basically imperfect it

4878
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:03,960
your data set is basically imperfect it
 

4879
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,110
your data set is basically imperfect it
needs to be diverse it has pockets there

4880
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:06,120
needs to be diverse it has pockets there
 

4881
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,030
needs to be diverse it has pockets there
are missing and you need to pad out the

4882
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:08,040
are missing and you need to pad out the
 

4883
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,410
are missing and you need to pad out the
pockets you can sort of think of it that

4884
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:09,420
pockets you can sort of think of it that
 

4885
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,310
pockets you can sort of think of it that
way

4886
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,320
way
 

4887
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,950
way
in the data what role do humans play in

4888
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
in the data what role do humans play in
 

4889
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,229
in the data what role do humans play in
this so what's the uh this biological

4890
01:25:15,229 --> 01:25:15,239
this so what's the uh this biological
 

4891
01:25:15,239 --> 01:25:17,870
this so what's the uh this biological
system like a human body is made up of

4892
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:17,880
system like a human body is made up of
 

4893
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,229
system like a human body is made up of

4894
01:25:21,229 --> 01:25:21,239
cells what what role like how do you
 

4895
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:23,810
cells what what role like how do you
optimize the human uh system the the

4896
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:23,820
optimize the human uh system the the
 

4897
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,750
optimize the human uh system the the

task needs more data
 

4909
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,050
task needs more data
can you speak to the hyper parameters

4910
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:42,060
can you speak to the hyper parameters
 

4911
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:45,110
can you speak to the hyper parameters
the human uh system right it really just

4912
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:45,120
the human uh system right it really just
 

4913
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,490
the human uh system right it really just
comes down to extremely good execution

4914
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:46,500
comes down to extremely good execution
 

4915
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,870
comes down to extremely good execution
from an engineering team and does what

4916
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:47,880
from an engineering team and does what
 

4917
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,770
from an engineering team and does what
they're doing they understand

4918
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:48,780
they're doing they understand
 

4919
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,810
they're doing they understand
intuitively the philosophical insights

4920
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:50,820
intuitively the philosophical insights
 

4921
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,370
intuitively the philosophical insights
underlying the data engine and the

4922
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:52,380
underlying the data engine and the
 

4923
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,709
underlying the data engine and the
process by which the system improves and

4924
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:54,719
process by which the system improves and
 

4925
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,290
process by which the system improves and
uh how to again like delegate the

4926
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:57,300
uh how to again like delegate the
 

4927
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,970
uh how to again like delegate the
strategy of the data collection and how

4928
01:25:58,970 --> 01:25:58,980
strategy of the data collection and how
 

4929
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,530
strategy of the data collection and how
that works and then just making sure

4930
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:00,540
that works and then just making sure
 

4931
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:02,270
that works and then just making sure
it's all extremely well executed and

4932
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:02,280
it's all extremely well executed and
 

4933
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,070
it's all extremely well executed and
that's where most of the work is is not

4934
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,080
that's where most of the work is is not
 

4935
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,870
that's where most of the work is is not
even the philosophizing or the research

4936
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:05,880
even the philosophizing or the research
 

4937
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,550
even the philosophizing or the research
or the ideas of it it's just extremely

4938
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:07,560
or the ideas of it it's just extremely
 

4939
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,169
or the ideas of it it's just extremely
good execution it's so hard when you're

4940
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:09,179
good execution it's so hard when you're
 

4941
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:11,330
good execution it's so hard when you're
dealing with data at that scale so your

4942
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:11,340
dealing with data at that scale so your
 

4943
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:13,370
dealing with data at that scale so your
role in the data engine executing well

4944
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:13,380
role in the data engine executing well
 

4945
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:15,890
role in the data engine executing well
on it it is difficult and extremely

4946
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:15,900
on it it is difficult and extremely
 

4947
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:19,250
on it it is difficult and extremely
important is there a priority of like uh

4948
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:19,260
important is there a priority of like uh
 

4949
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:22,070
important is there a priority of like uh
like a vision board of saying like

4950
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,080
like a vision board of saying like
 

4951
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,110
like a vision board of saying like
we really need to get better at stop

4952
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:24,120
we really need to get better at stop
 

4953
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,129
we really need to get better at stop
lights

4954
01:26:25,129 --> 01:26:25,139
lights
 

4955
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:27,290
lights
yeah like the the prioritization of

4956
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:27,300
yeah like the the prioritization of
 

4957
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,330
yeah like the the prioritization of
tasks is that essentially and that comes

4958
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:29,340
tasks is that essentially and that comes
 

4959
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:32,450
tasks is that essentially and that comes
from the data that comes to um a very

4960
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:32,460
from the data that comes to um a very
 

4961
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:33,890
from the data that comes to um a very
large extent to what we are trying to

4962
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:33,900
large extent to what we are trying to
 

4963
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,209
large extent to what we are trying to
achieve in the product for a map where

4964
01:26:35,209 --> 01:26:35,219
achieve in the product for a map where
 

4965
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:36,649
achieve in the product for a map where
we're trying to the release we're trying

4966
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:36,659
we're trying to the release we're trying
 

4967
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:37,910
we're trying to the release we're trying
to get out

4968
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:37,920
to get out
 

4969
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,649
to get out
um in the feedback from the QA team

4970
01:26:39,649 --> 01:26:39,659
um in the feedback from the QA team
 

4971
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:41,330
um in the feedback from the QA team
worth it where the system is struggling

4972
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:41,340
worth it where the system is struggling
 

4973
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:42,470
worth it where the system is struggling
or not the things we're trying to

4974
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
or not the things we're trying to
 

4975
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,510
or not the things we're trying to
improve and the QA team gives some

4976
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:44,520
improve and the QA team gives some
 

4977
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,629
improve and the QA team gives some
signal some information

4978
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:46,639
signal some information
 

4979
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:49,490
signal some information
in aggregate about the performance of

4980
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:49,500
in aggregate about the performance of
 

4981
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,930
in aggregate about the performance of
the system in various conditions and

4982
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:50,940
the system in various conditions and
 

4983
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,310
the system in various conditions and
then of course all of us drive it and we

4984
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,320
then of course all of us drive it and we
 

4985
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,470
then of course all of us drive it and we
can also see it it's really nice to work

4986
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:54,480
can also see it it's really nice to work
 

4987
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,729
can also see it it's really nice to work
with the system that you can also

4988
01:26:55,729 --> 01:26:55,739
with the system that you can also
 

4989
01:26:55,739 --> 01:26:57,470
with the system that you can also
experience yourself you know it drives

4990
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:57,480
experience yourself you know it drives
 

4991
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,410
experience yourself you know it drives
you home it's is there some insight you

4992
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:00,420
you home it's is there some insight you
 

4993
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,209
you home it's is there some insight you
can draw from your individual experience

4994
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:02,219
can draw from your individual experience
 

4995
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:04,010
can draw from your individual experience
that you just can't quite get from an

4996
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:04,020
that you just can't quite get from an
 

4997
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,830
that you just can't quite get from an
aggregate statistical analysis of data

4998
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:06,840
aggregate statistical analysis of data
 

4999
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,770
aggregate statistical analysis of data
yeah it's so weird right yes it's it's

5000
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:09,780
yeah it's so weird right yes it's it's
 

5001
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,229
yeah it's so weird right yes it's it's
not scientific in a sense because you're

5002
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:12,239
not scientific in a sense because you're
 

5003
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,450
not scientific in a sense because you're
just one anecdotal sample yeah I think

5004
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:14,460
just one anecdotal sample yeah I think
 

5005
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:17,030
just one anecdotal sample yeah I think
there's a ton of uh it's a source of

5006
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:17,040
there's a ton of uh it's a source of
 

5007
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,470
there's a ton of uh it's a source of
truth it's your interaction with the

5008
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:18,480
truth it's your interaction with the
 

5009
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,090
truth it's your interaction with the
system yeah and you can see it you can

5010
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:20,100
system yeah and you can see it you can
 

5011
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,430
system yeah and you can see it you can
play with it you can perturb it you can

5012
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:22,440
play with it you can perturb it you can
 

5013
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,930
play with it you can perturb it you can
get a sense of it you have an intuition

5014
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:23,940
get a sense of it you have an intuition
 

5015
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:26,270
get a sense of it you have an intuition
for it I think numbers just like have a

5016
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:26,280
for it I think numbers just like have a
 

5017
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,250
for it I think numbers just like have a
way of numbers and plots and graphs are

5018
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:28,260
way of numbers and plots and graphs are
 

5019
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:31,250
way of numbers and plots and graphs are
you know much harder yeah it hides a lot

5020
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:31,260
you know much harder yeah it hides a lot
 

5021
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,530
you know much harder yeah it hides a lot
of it's like if you train a language

5022
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:33,540
of it's like if you train a language
 

5023
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,149
of it's like if you train a language
model

5024
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:35,159
model
 

5025
01:27:35,159 --> 01:27:37,910
model
it's a really powerful way is by you

5026
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:37,920
it's a really powerful way is by you
 

5027
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,709
it's a really powerful way is by you
interacting with it yeah 100 try to

5028
01:27:39,709 --> 01:27:39,719
interacting with it yeah 100 try to
 

5029
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:41,750
interacting with it yeah 100 try to
build up an intuition yeah I think like

5030
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
build up an intuition yeah I think like
 

5031
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,850
build up an intuition yeah I think like
Elon also like he always wanted to drive

5032
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:43,860
Elon also like he always wanted to drive
 

5033
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:46,490
Elon also like he always wanted to drive
the system himself he drives a lot and

5034
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:46,500
the system himself he drives a lot and
 

5035
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:50,030
the system himself he drives a lot and
uh I'm gonna say almost daily so uh he

5036
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:50,040
uh I'm gonna say almost daily so uh he
 

5037
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,070
uh I'm gonna say almost daily so uh he
also sees this as a source of Truth you

5038
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,080
also sees this as a source of Truth you
 

5039
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,709
also sees this as a source of Truth you
driving the system uh and it performing

5040
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:54,719
driving the system uh and it performing
 

5041
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,070
driving the system uh and it performing
and yeah so what do you think tough

5042
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:58,080
and yeah so what do you think tough
 

5043
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:01,189
and yeah so what do you think tough
questions here uh so Tesla last year

5044
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:01,199
questions here uh so Tesla last year
 

5045
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:04,669
questions here uh so Tesla last year
removed radar from um from the sensor

5046
01:28:04,669 --> 01:28:04,679
removed radar from um from the sensor
 

5047
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,530
removed radar from um from the sensor
suite and now just announced that it's

5048
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:06,540
suite and now just announced that it's
 

5049
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,890
suite and now just announced that it's
going to remove all ultrasonic sensors

5050
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:08,900
going to remove all ultrasonic sensors
 

5051
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:12,709
going to remove all ultrasonic sensors
relying solely on Vision so camera only

5052
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
relying solely on Vision so camera only
 

5053
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:14,810
relying solely on Vision so camera only
does that make the perception problem

5054
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:14,820
does that make the perception problem
 

5055
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:17,930
does that make the perception problem
harder or easier

5056
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:17,940
harder or easier
 

5057
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:19,669
harder or easier
I would almost reframe the question in

5058
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:19,679
I would almost reframe the question in
 

5059
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,370
I would almost reframe the question in
some way so the thing is basically you

5060
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:22,380
some way so the thing is basically you
 

5061
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,870
some way so the thing is basically you
would think that additional sensors by

5062
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:23,880
would think that additional sensors by
 

5063
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,850
would think that additional sensors by
the way can I just interrupt good I

5064
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:25,860
the way can I just interrupt good I
 

5065
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,649
the way can I just interrupt good I
wonder if a language model will ever do

5066
01:28:27,649 --> 01:28:27,659
wonder if a language model will ever do
 

5067
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:30,050
wonder if a language model will ever do
that if you prompt it let me reframe

5068
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:30,060
that if you prompt it let me reframe
 

5069
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,930
that if you prompt it let me reframe
your question that would be epic this is

5070
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:32,940
your question that would be epic this is
 

5071
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,629
your question that would be epic this is
the wrong problem sorry it's like a

5072
01:28:35,629 --> 01:28:35,639
the wrong problem sorry it's like a
 

5073
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:36,709
the wrong problem sorry it's like a
little bit of a wrong question because

5074
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:36,719
little bit of a wrong question because
 

5075
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,390
little bit of a wrong question because
basically you would think that these

5076
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:38,400
basically you would think that these
 

5077
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,510
basically you would think that these
sensors are an asset to you yeah but if

5078
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:41,520
sensors are an asset to you yeah but if
 

5079
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,729
sensors are an asset to you yeah but if
you fully consider the entire product in

5080
01:28:43,729 --> 01:28:43,739
you fully consider the entire product in
 

5081
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:45,110
you fully consider the entire product in
its entirety

5082
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
its entirety
 

5083
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,370
its entirety
these sensors are actually potentially

5084
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:46,380
these sensors are actually potentially
 

5085
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:47,390
these sensors are actually potentially
reliability

5086
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:47,400
reliability
 

5087
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,030
reliability
because these sensors aren't free they

5088
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:50,040
because these sensors aren't free they
 

5089
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,770
because these sensors aren't free they
don't just appear on your car you need

5090
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:51,780
don't just appear on your car you need
 

5091
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,450
don't just appear on your car you need
something you need to have an entire

5092
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:53,460
something you need to have an entire
 

5093
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:54,950
something you need to have an entire
supply chain you have people procuring

5094
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:54,960
supply chain you have people procuring
 

5095
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,750
supply chain you have people procuring
it there can be problems with them they

5096
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:56,760
it there can be problems with them they
 

5097
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,310
it there can be problems with them they
may need replacement they are part of

5098
01:28:58,310 --> 01:28:58,320
may need replacement they are part of
 

5099
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,450
may need replacement they are part of
the manufacturing process they can hold

5100
01:28:59,450 --> 01:28:59,460
the manufacturing process they can hold
 

5101
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:02,209
the manufacturing process they can hold
back the line in production you need to

5102
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:02,219
back the line in production you need to
 

5103
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:03,290
back the line in production you need to
Source them you need to maintain them

5104
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:03,300
Source them you need to maintain them
 

5105
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:04,850
Source them you need to maintain them
you have to have teams that write the

5106
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:04,860
you have to have teams that write the
 

5107
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:07,790
you have to have teams that write the
firmware all of it and then you also

5108
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:07,800
firmware all of it and then you also
 

5109
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,990
firmware all of it and then you also
have to incorporate and fuse them into

5110
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:09,000
have to incorporate and fuse them into
 

5111
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,430
have to incorporate and fuse them into
the system in some way and so it

5112
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:10,440
the system in some way and so it
 

5113
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,070
the system in some way and so it
actually like bloats the organ the a lot

5114
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:13,080
actually like bloats the organ the a lot
 

5115
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,490
actually like bloats the organ the a lot
of it and I think Elon is really good at

5116
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:15,500
of it and I think Elon is really good at
 

5117
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,990
of it and I think Elon is really good at
simplify simplified best part is no part

5118
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,000
simplify simplified best part is no part
 

5119
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,910
simplify simplified best part is no part
and he always tries to throw away things

5120
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:19,920
and he always tries to throw away things
 

5121
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:20,990
and he always tries to throw away things
that are not essential because he

5122
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:21,000
that are not essential because he
 

5123
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,729
that are not essential because he
understands the entropy in organizations

5124
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:22,739
understands the entropy in organizations
 

5125
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:25,850
understands the entropy in organizations
and approach and I think uh in this case

5126
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:25,860
and approach and I think uh in this case
 

5127
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,470
and approach and I think uh in this case
the cost is high and you're not

5128
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:27,480
the cost is high and you're not
 

5129
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,610
the cost is high and you're not
potentially seeing it if you're just a

5130
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:28,620
potentially seeing it if you're just a
 

5131
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:30,229
potentially seeing it if you're just a
computer vision engineer and I'm just

5132
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:30,239
computer vision engineer and I'm just
 

5133
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,090
computer vision engineer and I'm just
trying to improve my network and you

5134
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:32,100
trying to improve my network and you
 

5135
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,950
trying to improve my network and you
know is it more useful or less useful

5136
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:33,960
know is it more useful or less useful
 

5137
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,169
know is it more useful or less useful
how useful is it and the thing is if

5138
01:29:36,169 --> 01:29:36,179
how useful is it and the thing is if
 

5139
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:37,910
how useful is it and the thing is if
once you consider the full cost of a

5140
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:37,920
once you consider the full cost of a
 

5141
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,470
once you consider the full cost of a
sensor it actually is potentially a

5142
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:39,480
sensor it actually is potentially a
 

5143
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,330
sensor it actually is potentially a
liability and you need to be really sure

5144
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:41,340
liability and you need to be really sure
 

5145
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,950
liability and you need to be really sure
that it's giving you extremely useful

5146
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
that it's giving you extremely useful
 

5147
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,169
that it's giving you extremely useful
information in this case we looked at

5148
01:29:45,169 --> 01:29:45,179
information in this case we looked at
 

5149
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,090
information in this case we looked at
using it or not using it and the Delta

5150
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:47,100
using it or not using it and the Delta
 

5151
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,250
using it or not using it and the Delta
was not massive and so it's not useful

5152
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:49,260
was not massive and so it's not useful
 

5153
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,910
was not massive and so it's not useful
is it also blow in the data engine like

5154
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:52,920
is it also blow in the data engine like
 

5155
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,490
is it also blow in the data engine like
having more sensors

5156
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:54,500
having more sensors
 

5157
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,990
having more sensors
is a distraction and these sensors you

5158
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:57,000
is a distraction and these sensors you
 

5159
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,010
is a distraction and these sensors you
know they can change over time for

5160
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:58,020
know they can change over time for
 

5161
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:59,390
know they can change over time for
example you can have one type of say

5162
01:29:59,390 --> 01:29:59,400
example you can have one type of say
 

5163
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,890
example you can have one type of say
radar you can have other type of radar

5164
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:00,900
radar you can have other type of radar
 

5165
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,510
radar you can have other type of radar
they change over time I suddenly need to

5166
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:02,520
they change over time I suddenly need to
 

5167
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,770
they change over time I suddenly need to
worry about it now suddenly you have a

5168
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:03,780
worry about it now suddenly you have a
 

5169
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,570
worry about it now suddenly you have a
column in your sqlite telling you oh

5170
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:05,580
column in your sqlite telling you oh
 

5171
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,310
column in your sqlite telling you oh
which sensor type was it and they all

5172
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:07,320
which sensor type was it and they all
 

5173
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,770
which sensor type was it and they all
have different distributions and then uh

5174
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:09,780
have different distributions and then uh
 

5175
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,750
have different distributions and then uh
they can they just they contribute noise

5176
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,760
they can they just they contribute noise
 

5177
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,149
they can they just they contribute noise
and entropy into everything and they

5178
01:30:14,149 --> 01:30:14,159
and entropy into everything and they
 

5179
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,370
and entropy into everything and they
bloat stuff and also organizationally

5180
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:16,380
bloat stuff and also organizationally
 

5181
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:17,990
bloat stuff and also organizationally
has been really fascinating to me that

5182
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,000
has been really fascinating to me that
 

5183
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,149
has been really fascinating to me that
it can be very distracting

5184
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:20,159
it can be very distracting
 

5185
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,490
it can be very distracting
um if you if all if you only want to get

5186
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:22,500
um if you if all if you only want to get
 

5187
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,770
um if you if all if you only want to get
to work is Vision all the resources are

5188
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:24,780
to work is Vision all the resources are
 

5189
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,450
to work is Vision all the resources are
on it and you're building out a data

5190
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:26,460
on it and you're building out a data
 

5191
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,129
on it and you're building out a data
engine and you're actually making

5192
01:30:28,129 --> 01:30:28,139
engine and you're actually making
 

5193
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:30,129
engine and you're actually making
forward progress because that is the the

5194
01:30:30,129 --> 01:30:30,139
forward progress because that is the the
 

5195
01:30:30,139 --> 01:30:32,510
forward progress because that is the the
sensor with the most bandwidth the most

5196
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:32,520
sensor with the most bandwidth the most
 

5197
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,010
sensor with the most bandwidth the most
constraints on the world and you're

5198
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:34,020
constraints on the world and you're
 

5199
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:35,330
constraints on the world and you're
investing fully into that and you can

5200
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,340
investing fully into that and you can
 

5201
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,430
investing fully into that and you can
make that extremely good if you're uh

5202
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:37,440
make that extremely good if you're uh
 

5203
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,870
make that extremely good if you're uh
you're only a finite amount of sort of

5204
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:38,880
you're only a finite amount of sort of
 

5205
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,810
you're only a finite amount of sort of
spend of focus across different facets

5206
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:41,820
spend of focus across different facets
 

5207
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:45,229
spend of focus across different facets
of the system and uh this kind of

5208
01:30:45,229 --> 01:30:45,239
of the system and uh this kind of
 

5209
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:47,270
of the system and uh this kind of
reminds me of Rich Sutton's a bitter

5210
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280
reminds me of Rich Sutton's a bitter
 

5211
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,610
reminds me of Rich Sutton's a bitter
lesson it just seems like simplifying

5212
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:49,620
lesson it just seems like simplifying
 

5213
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,050
lesson it just seems like simplifying
the system yeah

5214
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:51,060
the system yeah
 

5215
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:53,510
the system yeah
in the long run now of course you don't

5216
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:53,520
in the long run now of course you don't
 

5217
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,189
in the long run now of course you don't
know what the long run it seems to be

5218
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:55,199
know what the long run it seems to be
 

5219
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,410
know what the long run it seems to be
always the right solution yeah yes in

5220
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:57,420
always the right solution yeah yes in
 

5221
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,090
always the right solution yeah yes in
that case it was 4rl but it seems to

5222
01:30:59,090 --> 01:30:59,100
that case it was 4rl but it seems to
 

5223
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,250
that case it was 4rl but it seems to
apply generally across all systems that

5224
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:01,260
apply generally across all systems that
 

5225
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:04,010
apply generally across all systems that
do computation yeah so where uh what do

5226
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:04,020
do computation yeah so where uh what do
 

5227
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,750
do computation yeah so where uh what do
you think about the lidar as a crutch

5228
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:05,760
you think about the lidar as a crutch
 

5229
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,830
you think about the lidar as a crutch
debate

5230
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:06,840
debate
 

5231
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,010
debate
uh the battle between point clouds and

5232
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:10,020
uh the battle between point clouds and
 

5233
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,030
uh the battle between point clouds and
pixels

5234
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:11,040
pixels
 

5235
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,950
pixels
yeah I think this debate is always like

5236
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
yeah I think this debate is always like
 

5237
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,629
yeah I think this debate is always like
slightly confusing to me because it

5238
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
slightly confusing to me because it
 

5239
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,129
slightly confusing to me because it
seems like the actual debate should be

5240
01:31:16,129 --> 01:31:16,139
seems like the actual debate should be
 

5241
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:17,870
seems like the actual debate should be
about like do you have the fleet or not

5242
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:17,880
about like do you have the fleet or not
 

5243
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,370
about like do you have the fleet or not
that's like the really important thing

5244
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:19,380
that's like the really important thing
 

5245
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,410
that's like the really important thing
about whether you can achieve a really

5246
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:21,420
about whether you can achieve a really
 

5247
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,629
about whether you can achieve a really
good functioning of an AI system at this

5248
01:31:23,629 --> 01:31:23,639
good functioning of an AI system at this
 

5249
01:31:23,639 --> 01:31:26,149
good functioning of an AI system at this
scale so data collection systems yeah do

5250
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
scale so data collection systems yeah do
 

5251
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,290
scale so data collection systems yeah do
you have a fleet or not it's

5252
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:27,300
you have a fleet or not it's
 

5253
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,850
you have a fleet or not it's
significantly more important whether you

5254
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:28,860
significantly more important whether you
 

5255
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,290
significantly more important whether you
have lidar or not it's just another

5256
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:30,300
have lidar or not it's just another
 

5257
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,729
have lidar or not it's just another
sensor

5258
01:31:31,729 --> 01:31:31,739
sensor
 

5259
01:31:31,739 --> 01:31:33,470
sensor
um and uh

5260
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:33,480
um and uh
 

5261
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,930
um and uh
yeah I think similar to the radar

5262
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:35,940
yeah I think similar to the radar
 

5263
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:38,570
yeah I think similar to the radar
discussion basically I um

5264
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:38,580
discussion basically I um
 

5265
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:40,490
discussion basically I um
but yeah I don't think it it um

5266
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:40,500
but yeah I don't think it it um
 

5267
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,490
but yeah I don't think it it um
basically doesn't offer extra extra

5268
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:43,500
basically doesn't offer extra extra
 

5269
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,290
basically doesn't offer extra extra
information is extremely costly it has

5270
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:45,300
information is extremely costly it has
 

5271
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,430
information is extremely costly it has
all kinds of problems you have to worry

5272
01:31:46,430 --> 01:31:46,440
all kinds of problems you have to worry
 

5273
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,169
all kinds of problems you have to worry
about it you have to calibrate it Etc it

5274
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:48,179
about it you have to calibrate it Etc it
 

5275
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:49,669
about it you have to calibrate it Etc it
creates bloat and entropy you have to be

5276
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:49,679
creates bloat and entropy you have to be
 

5277
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,070
creates bloat and entropy you have to be
really sure that you need this uh this

5278
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
really sure that you need this uh this
 

5279
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,290
really sure that you need this uh this
um sensor in this case I basically don't

5280
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:54,300
um sensor in this case I basically don't
 

5281
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,330
um sensor in this case I basically don't
think you need it and I think honestly I

5282
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:56,340
think you need it and I think honestly I
 

5283
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,649
think you need it and I think honestly I
will make a stronger statement I think

5284
01:31:57,649 --> 01:31:57,659
will make a stronger statement I think
 

5285
01:31:57,659 --> 01:31:59,450
will make a stronger statement I think
the others some of the other uh

5286
01:31:59,450 --> 01:31:59,460
the others some of the other uh
 

5287
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:00,950
the others some of the other uh
companies are using it are probably

5288
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:00,960
companies are using it are probably
 

5289
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,890
companies are using it are probably
going to drop it yeah so you have to

5290
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:03,900
going to drop it yeah so you have to
 

5291
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:07,250
going to drop it yeah so you have to
consider the sensor in the full

5292
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:07,260
consider the sensor in the full
 

5293
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:10,490
consider the sensor in the full
in considering can you build a big Fleet

5294
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:10,500
in considering can you build a big Fleet
 

5295
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,890
in considering can you build a big Fleet
that collects a lot of data and can you

5296
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:12,900
that collects a lot of data and can you
 

5297
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,570
that collects a lot of data and can you
integrate that sensor with that that

5298
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:14,580
integrate that sensor with that that
 

5299
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:17,030
integrate that sensor with that that
data and that sensor into a data engine

5300
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,040
data and that sensor into a data engine
 

5301
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,950
data and that sensor into a data engine
that's able to quickly find different

5302
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:18,960
that's able to quickly find different
 

5303
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,830
that's able to quickly find different
parts of the data that then continuously

5304
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840
parts of the data that then continuously
 

5305
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,810
parts of the data that then continuously
improves whatever the model that you're

5306
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:23,820
improves whatever the model that you're
 

5307
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:25,370
improves whatever the model that you're
using yeah another way to look at it is

5308
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:25,380
using yeah another way to look at it is
 

5309
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:28,070
using yeah another way to look at it is
like vision is necessary in a sense that

5310
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:28,080
like vision is necessary in a sense that
 

5311
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,709
like vision is necessary in a sense that
uh the drive the world is designed for

5312
01:32:30,709 --> 01:32:30,719
uh the drive the world is designed for
 

5313
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:31,910
uh the drive the world is designed for
human visual consumption so you need

5314
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:31,920
human visual consumption so you need
 

5315
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,910
human visual consumption so you need
vision is necessary and then also it is

5316
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:34,920
vision is necessary and then also it is
 

5317
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,010
vision is necessary and then also it is
sufficient because it has all the

5318
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:37,020
sufficient because it has all the
 

5319
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,450
sufficient because it has all the
information that you that you need for

5320
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:38,460
information that you that you need for
 

5321
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:40,250
information that you that you need for
driving and humans obviously is a vision

5322
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:40,260
driving and humans obviously is a vision
 

5323
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:41,870
driving and humans obviously is a vision
to drive so it's both necessary and

5324
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:41,880
to drive so it's both necessary and
 

5325
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,189
to drive so it's both necessary and
sufficient so you want to focus

5326
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:43,199
sufficient so you want to focus
 

5327
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:44,689
sufficient so you want to focus
resources and you have to be really sure

5328
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:44,699
resources and you have to be really sure
 

5329
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:45,830
resources and you have to be really sure
if you're going to bring in other

5330
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:45,840
if you're going to bring in other
 

5331
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,810
if you're going to bring in other
sensors you could you could you could

5332
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:47,820
sensors you could you could you could
 

5333
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,850
sensors you could you could you could
add sensors to Infinity at some point

5334
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:49,860
add sensors to Infinity at some point
 

5335
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:51,830
add sensors to Infinity at some point
you need to draw the line and I think in

5336
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:51,840
you need to draw the line and I think in
 

5337
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,970
you need to draw the line and I think in
this case you have to really consider

5338
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:52,980
this case you have to really consider
 

5339
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:55,970
this case you have to really consider
the full cost of any One sensor that

5340
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:55,980
the full cost of any One sensor that
 

5341
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:58,010
the full cost of any One sensor that
you're adopting and do you really need

5342
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:58,020
you're adopting and do you really need
 

5343
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,229
you're adopting and do you really need
it and I think the answer in this case

5344
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:00,239
it and I think the answer in this case
 

5345
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,850
it and I think the answer in this case
is no so what do you think about the

5346
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:01,860
is no so what do you think about the
 

5347
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:04,790
is no so what do you think about the
idea of the that the other companies

5348
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:04,800
idea of the that the other companies
 

5349
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,790
idea of the that the other companies
are forming high resolution maps and

5350
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:07,800
are forming high resolution maps and
 

5351
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,950
are forming high resolution maps and
constraining heavily the geographic

5352
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:09,960
constraining heavily the geographic
 

5353
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,470
constraining heavily the geographic
regions in which they operate is that

5354
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
regions in which they operate is that
 

5355
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:16,790
regions in which they operate is that
approach not in your in your view

5356
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:16,800
approach not in your in your view
 

5357
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,189
approach not in your in your view
um not going to scale over time to the

5358
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:19,199
um not going to scale over time to the
 

5359
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,050
um not going to scale over time to the
entirety of the United States I think

5360
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:21,060
entirety of the United States I think
 

5361
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:22,610
entirety of the United States I think
I'll take two as you mentioned like they

5362
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:22,620
I'll take two as you mentioned like they
 

5363
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,590
I'll take two as you mentioned like they
pre-map all the environments and they

5364
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:24,600
pre-map all the environments and they
 

5365
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,510
pre-map all the environments and they
need to refresh the map and they have a

5366
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:26,520
need to refresh the map and they have a
 

5367
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,550
need to refresh the map and they have a
perfect centimeter level accuracy map of

5368
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:28,560
perfect centimeter level accuracy map of
 

5369
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,990
perfect centimeter level accuracy map of
everywhere they're going to drive it's

5370
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:30,000
everywhere they're going to drive it's
 

5371
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,910
everywhere they're going to drive it's
crazy how are you going to

5372
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:31,920
crazy how are you going to
 

5373
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,410
crazy how are you going to
when we're talking about autonomy

5374
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:33,420
when we're talking about autonomy
 

5375
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,669
when we're talking about autonomy
actually changing the world we're

5376
01:33:34,669 --> 01:33:34,679
actually changing the world we're
 

5377
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:36,410
actually changing the world we're
talking about the deployment

5378
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:36,420
talking about the deployment
 

5379
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:38,930
talking about the deployment
on a on a global scale of autonomous

5380
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:38,940
on a on a global scale of autonomous
 

5381
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,910
on a on a global scale of autonomous
systems for transportation and if you

5382
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:40,920
systems for transportation and if you
 

5383
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,649
systems for transportation and if you
need to maintain a centimeter accurate

5384
01:33:42,649 --> 01:33:42,659
need to maintain a centimeter accurate
 

5385
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:45,410
need to maintain a centimeter accurate
map for Earth or like for many cities

5386
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:45,420
map for Earth or like for many cities
 

5387
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:46,910
map for Earth or like for many cities
and keep them updated it's a huge

5388
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:46,920
and keep them updated it's a huge
 

5389
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,709
and keep them updated it's a huge
dependency that you're taking on huge

5390
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:48,719
dependency that you're taking on huge
 

5391
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:49,729
dependency that you're taking on huge
dependency

5392
01:33:49,729 --> 01:33:49,739
dependency
 

5393
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:51,649
dependency
it's a massive massive dependency and

5394
01:33:51,649 --> 01:33:51,659
it's a massive massive dependency and
 

5395
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:52,910
it's a massive massive dependency and
now you need to ask yourself do you

5396
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:52,920
now you need to ask yourself do you
 

5397
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,290
now you need to ask yourself do you
really need it

5398
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:54,300
really need it
 

5399
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,450
really need it
and humans don't need it

5400
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:56,460
and humans don't need it
 

5401
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,550
and humans don't need it
um right so it's it's very useful to

5402
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:58,560
um right so it's it's very useful to
 

5403
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,649
um right so it's it's very useful to
have a low-level map of like okay the

5404
01:34:00,649 --> 01:34:00,659
have a low-level map of like okay the
 

5405
01:34:00,659 --> 01:34:02,149
have a low-level map of like okay the
connectivity of your road you know that

5406
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
connectivity of your road you know that
 

5407
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,890
connectivity of your road you know that
there's a fork coming up when you drive

5408
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:03,900
there's a fork coming up when you drive
 

5409
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:04,970
there's a fork coming up when you drive
an environment you sort of have that

5410
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:04,980
an environment you sort of have that
 

5411
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,110
an environment you sort of have that
high level understanding it's like a

5412
01:34:06,110 --> 01:34:06,120
high level understanding it's like a
 

5413
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,570
high level understanding it's like a
small Google Map and Tesla uses Google

5414
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:08,580
small Google Map and Tesla uses Google
 

5415
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:11,030
small Google Map and Tesla uses Google
Map like similar kind of resolution

5416
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:11,040
Map like similar kind of resolution
 

5417
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,550
Map like similar kind of resolution
information in the system but it will

01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:13,560
information in the system but it will
 

5419
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,470
information in the system but it will
not pre-map environments to send me a

5420
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:15,480
not pre-map environments to send me a
 

5421
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,270
not pre-map environments to send me a
level accuracy it's a crutch it's a

5422
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,280
level accuracy it's a crutch it's a
 

5423
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,669
level accuracy it's a crutch it's a
distraction it costs entropy and it

5424
01:34:19,669 --> 01:34:19,679
distraction it costs entropy and it
 

5425
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,410
distraction it costs entropy and it
diffuses the team it dilutes the team

5426
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:21,420
diffuses the team it dilutes the team
 

5427
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,669
diffuses the team it dilutes the team
and you're not focusing on what's

5428
01:34:22,669 --> 01:34:22,679
and you're not focusing on what's
 

5429
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:24,649
and you're not focusing on what's
actually necessary which is the computer

5430
01:34:24,649 --> 01:34:24,659
actually necessary which is the computer
 

5431
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,270
actually necessary which is the computer
vision problem

5432
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:26,280
vision problem
 

5433
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,310
vision problem
what did you learn about machine

5434
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,320
what did you learn about machine
 

5435
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:31,070
what did you learn about machine
learning about engineering about life

5436
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:31,080
learning about engineering about life
 

5437
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,430
learning about engineering about life
about yourself as one human being from

5438
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:34,440
about yourself as one human being from
 

5439
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,410
about yourself as one human being from
working with Elon Musk

5440
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:36,420
working with Elon Musk
 

5441
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,970
working with Elon Musk
I think the most I've learned is about

5442
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:37,980
I think the most I've learned is about
 

5443
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,950
I think the most I've learned is about
how to sort of run organizations

5444
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:39,960
how to sort of run organizations
 

5445
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,110
how to sort of run organizations
efficiently and how to

5446
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:42,120
efficiently and how to
 

5447
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,970
efficiently and how to
create efficient organizations and how

5448
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:43,980
create efficient organizations and how
 

5449
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:46,490
create efficient organizations and how
to fight entropy in an organization so

5450
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:46,500
to fight entropy in an organization so
 

5451
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,649
to fight entropy in an organization so
human Engineering in the fight against

5452
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:48,659
human Engineering in the fight against
 

5453
01:34:48,659 --> 01:34:51,410
human Engineering in the fight against
entropy yeah there's a there's a I think

5454
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:51,420
entropy yeah there's a there's a I think
 

5455
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,930
entropy yeah there's a there's a I think
Elon is a very efficient warrior in the

5456
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:53,940
Elon is a very efficient warrior in the
 

5457
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:55,790
Elon is a very efficient warrior in the
fight against entropy in organizations

5458
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:55,800
fight against entropy in organizations
 

5459
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,830
fight against entropy in organizations
what is the entropy in an organization

5460
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:57,840
what is the entropy in an organization
 

5461
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,270
what is the entropy in an organization
look like exactly it's process it's

5462
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:01,280
look like exactly it's process it's
 

5463
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:05,750
look like exactly it's process it's
it's process and inefficiencies and that

5464
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:05,760
it's process and inefficiencies and that
 

5465
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,370
it's process and inefficiencies and that
kind of stuff yeah meetings he hates

5466
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:07,380
kind of stuff yeah meetings he hates
 

5467
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:08,750
kind of stuff yeah meetings he hates
meetings he keeps telling people to skip

5468
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:08,760
meetings he keeps telling people to skip
 

5469
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,790
meetings he keeps telling people to skip
meetings if they're not useful

5470
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:10,800
meetings if they're not useful
 

5471
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,470
meetings if they're not useful
um he basically runs the world's biggest

5472
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,480
um he basically runs the world's biggest
 

5473
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:15,890
um he basically runs the world's biggest
uh startups I would say uh Tesla SpaceX

5474
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:15,900
uh startups I would say uh Tesla SpaceX
 

5475
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,870
uh startups I would say uh Tesla SpaceX
are the world's biggest startups Tesla

5476
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:17,880
are the world's biggest startups Tesla
 

5477
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,910
are the world's biggest startups Tesla
actually has multiple startups I think

5478
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
actually has multiple startups I think
 

5479
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,649
actually has multiple startups I think
it's better to look at it that way and

5480
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:21,659
it's better to look at it that way and
 

5481
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:23,930
it's better to look at it that way and
so I think he's he's extremely good at

5482
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:23,940
so I think he's he's extremely good at
 

5483
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:27,050
so I think he's he's extremely good at
uh at that and uh yeah he's a very good

5484
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:27,060
uh at that and uh yeah he's a very good
 

5485
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,850
uh at that and uh yeah he's a very good
intuition for streamline processes

5486
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:28,860
intuition for streamline processes
 

5487
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:30,649
intuition for streamline processes
making everything efficient uh best part

5488
01:35:30,649 --> 01:35:30,659
making everything efficient uh best part
 

5489
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:33,590
making everything efficient uh best part
is no part uh simplifying focusing

5490
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:33,600
is no part uh simplifying focusing
 

5491
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,050
is no part uh simplifying focusing
um and just kind of removing barriers uh

5492
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:36,060
um and just kind of removing barriers uh
 

5493
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:38,330
um and just kind of removing barriers uh
moving very quickly making big moves all

5494
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:38,340
moving very quickly making big moves all
 

5495
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,310
moving very quickly making big moves all
this is a very startupy sort of seeming

5496
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,320
this is a very startupy sort of seeming
 

5497
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,890
this is a very startupy sort of seeming
things but at scale so strong drive to

01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:42,900
things but at scale so strong drive to
 

5499
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:45,410
things but at scale so strong drive to
simplify for me from your perspective I

5500
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:45,420
simplify for me from your perspective I
 

5501
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,790
simplify for me from your perspective I
mean that

5502
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,800
mean that
 

5503
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,410
mean that
um that also probably applies to just

5504
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:48,420
um that also probably applies to just
 

5505
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:50,270
um that also probably applies to just

and otherwise yeah like simplify

5508
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:51,840
and otherwise yeah like simplify
 

5509
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,270
and otherwise yeah like simplify
simplify yes

5510
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:53,280
simplify yes
 

5511
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,250
simplify yes
what do you think is the secret to

can you introspect that

5518
01:36:03,649 --> 01:36:03,659
can you introspect that
 

5519
01:36:03,659 --> 01:36:05,750
can you introspect that
I do think you need someone in a

5520
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:05,760
I do think you need someone in a
 

5521
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,490
I do think you need someone in a
powerful position with a big hammer like

5522
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:07,500
powerful position with a big hammer like
 

5523
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,950
powerful position with a big hammer like
Elon who's like the cheerleader for that

5527
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,330
idea and ruthless ruthlessly pursues it
if no one has a big enough Hammer

5528
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:14,340
if no one has a big enough Hammer

just everything just crumbles yeah if
 

5537
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,390
just everything just crumbles yeah if
you have a big person who's also really

5567
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,070

shouldn't they AI know much better than

01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:01,080
shouldn't they AI know much better than

anyway uh what do you think is the value

5572
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:04,380
anyway uh what do you think is the value
 

5573
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:07,490
anyway uh what do you think is the value
of setting seemingly impossible goals

5574
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:07,500
of setting seemingly impossible goals
 

5575
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,370
of setting seemingly impossible goals
so like uh

5576
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:09,380
so like uh
 

5577
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:12,110
so like uh
our initial intuition which seems like

5578
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:12,120
our initial intuition which seems like
 

5579
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,550
our initial intuition which seems like
something that

5580
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:13,560
something that
 

5581
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,209
something that
you have taken on that Elon espouses

5582
01:37:17,209 --> 01:37:17,219
you have taken on that Elon espouses
 

5583
01:37:17,219 --> 01:37:19,729
you have taken on that Elon espouses
that where the initial intuition of the

5584
01:37:19,729 --> 01:37:19,739
that where the initial intuition of the
 

5585
01:37:19,739 --> 01:37:20,870
that where the initial intuition of the
community might say this is very

5586
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
community might say this is very
 

5587
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,910
community might say this is very
difficult and then you take it on anyway

5588
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:22,920
difficult and then you take it on anyway
 

5589
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,669
difficult and then you take it on anyway
with a crazy deadline you're just from a

5590
01:37:25,669 --> 01:37:25,679
with a crazy deadline you're just from a
 

5591
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,350
with a crazy deadline you're just from a
human engineering perspective

5592
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:27,360
human engineering perspective
 

5593
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,090
human engineering perspective
um

5594
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:28,100
um
 

5595
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:32,209
um
uh have you seen the value of that

5596
01:37:32,209 --> 01:37:32,219
uh have you seen the value of that
 

5597
01:37:32,219 --> 01:37:33,950
uh have you seen the value of that
I wouldn't say that setting impossible

5598
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:33,960
I wouldn't say that setting impossible
 

5599
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,990
I wouldn't say that setting impossible
goals exactly is is a good idea but I

5600
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:36,000
goals exactly is is a good idea but I
 

5601
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,610
goals exactly is is a good idea but I
think setting very ambitious goals is a

5602
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:37,620
think setting very ambitious goals is a
 

5603
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:40,310
think setting very ambitious goals is a
good idea I think there's a what I call

5604
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:40,320
good idea I think there's a what I call
 

5605
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,470
good idea I think there's a what I call
sublinear scaling of difficulty uh which

5606
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:42,480
sublinear scaling of difficulty uh which
 

5607
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,110
sublinear scaling of difficulty uh which
means that 10x problems are not 10x hard

5608
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:45,120
means that 10x problems are not 10x hard
 

5609
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,709
means that 10x problems are not 10x hard
usually 10x 10x harder problem is like 2

5610
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:48,719
usually 10x 10x harder problem is like 2
 

5611
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,530
usually 10x 10x harder problem is like 2
or 3x harder to execute on because if

5612
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:51,540
or 3x harder to execute on because if
 

5613
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:52,850
or 3x harder to execute on because if
you want to actually like if you want to

5614
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:52,860
you want to actually like if you want to
 

5615
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:55,129
you want to actually like if you want to
improve the system by 10 it costs some

5616
01:37:55,129 --> 01:37:55,139
improve the system by 10 it costs some
 

5617
01:37:55,139 --> 01:37:56,629
improve the system by 10 it costs some
amount of work and if you want to 10x

5618
01:37:56,629 --> 01:37:56,639
amount of work and if you want to 10x
 

5619
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:59,030
amount of work and if you want to 10x
improve the system it doesn't cost you

5620
01:37:59,030 --> 01:37:59,040
improve the system it doesn't cost you
 

5621
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,770
improve the system it doesn't cost you
know 100x amount of the work and it's

5622
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:00,780
know 100x amount of the work and it's
 

5623
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,910
know 100x amount of the work and it's
because you fundamentally change the

5624
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:01,920
because you fundamentally change the
 

5625
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,590
because you fundamentally change the
approach and it if you start with that

5626
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:03,600
approach and it if you start with that
 

5627
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,450
approach and it if you start with that
constraint then some approaches are

5628
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:05,460
constraint then some approaches are
 

5629
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:07,250
constraint then some approaches are
obviously dumb and not going to work and

5630
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:07,260
obviously dumb and not going to work and
 

5631
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,530
obviously dumb and not going to work and
it forces you to reevaluate

5632
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:09,540
it forces you to reevaluate
 

5633
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,629
it forces you to reevaluate
um and I think it's a very interesting

5634
01:38:11,629 --> 01:38:11,639
um and I think it's a very interesting
 

5635
01:38:11,639 --> 01:38:14,209
um and I think it's a very interesting
way of approaching problem solving but

5636
01:38:14,209 --> 01:38:14,219
way of approaching problem solving but
 

5637
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:16,250
way of approaching problem solving but
it requires a weird kind of thinking

5638
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:16,260
it requires a weird kind of thinking
 

5639
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,110
it requires a weird kind of thinking
it's just going back to your like PhD

5640
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:18,120
it's just going back to your like PhD
 

5641
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:22,250
it's just going back to your like PhD
days it's like how do you think which

5642
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:22,260
days it's like how do you think which
 

5643
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,590
days it's like how do you think which
ideas in in the machine Learning

5644
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:24,600
ideas in in the machine Learning
 

5645

Community are solvable yes it's uh it

5646
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:29,040
Community are solvable yes it's uh it
 

5647
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,310
Community are solvable yes it's uh it
requires what is that I mean there's the

5648
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:31,320
requires what is that I mean there's the
 

5649
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,050
requires what is that I mean there's the
cliche of first prince people's thinking

5650
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:33,060
cliche of first prince people's thinking
 

5651
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:35,450
cliche of first prince people's thinking
but like it requires to basically ignore

5652
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:35,460
but like it requires to basically ignore
 

5653
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:36,649
but like it requires to basically ignore
what the community is saying because

5654
01:38:36,649 --> 01:38:36,659
what the community is saying because
 

5655
01:38:36,659 --> 01:38:38,629
what the community is saying because
doesn't the community doesn't a

5656
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
doesn't the community doesn't a
 

5657
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,990
doesn't the community doesn't a
community in science usually draw lines

5658
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:42,000
community in science usually draw lines
 

5659
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,169
community in science usually draw lines
of what isn't isn't possible right and

5660
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:45,179
of what isn't isn't possible right and
 

5661
01:38:45,179 --> 01:38:47,090
of what isn't isn't possible right and
like it's very hard to break out of that

5662
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:47,100
like it's very hard to break out of that
 

5663
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,850
like it's very hard to break out of that
without going crazy yep I mean I think a

5664
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:49,860
without going crazy yep I mean I think a
 

5665
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,169
without going crazy yep I mean I think a
good example here is you know the Deep

5666
01:38:51,169 --> 01:38:51,179
good example here is you know the Deep
 

5667
01:38:51,179 --> 01:38:52,490
good example here is you know the Deep
learning revolution in some sense

5668
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:52,500
learning revolution in some sense
 

5669
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,189
learning revolution in some sense
because you could be in computer vision

5670
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
because you could be in computer vision
 

5671
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,110
because you could be in computer vision
at that time when during the Deep

5672
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:57,120
at that time when during the Deep
 

5673
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,270
at that time when during the Deep
learning sort of revolution of 2012 and

5674
01:38:59,270 --> 01:38:59,280
learning sort of revolution of 2012 and
 

5675
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,189
learning sort of revolution of 2012 and
so on uh you could be improving your

5676
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:01,199
so on uh you could be improving your
 

5677
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,530
so on uh you could be improving your
computer vision stack by 10 or we can

5678
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:03,540
computer vision stack by 10 or we can
 

5679
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,330
computer vision stack by 10 or we can
just be saying actually all this is

5680
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:05,340
just be saying actually all this is
 

5681
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:07,129
just be saying actually all this is
useless and how do I do 10x better

5682
01:39:07,129 --> 01:39:07,139
useless and how do I do 10x better
 

5683
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:08,570
useless and how do I do 10x better
computer vision well it's not probably

5684
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:08,580
computer vision well it's not probably
 

5685
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,450
computer vision well it's not probably
by tuning a hog feature detector I need

5686
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:11,460
by tuning a hog feature detector I need
 

5687
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,709
by tuning a hog feature detector I need
a different approach

5688
01:39:12,709 --> 01:39:12,719
a different approach
 

5689
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:13,850
a different approach
um I need something that is scalable

5690
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:13,860
um I need something that is scalable
 

5691
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:17,390
um I need something that is scalable
going back to uh Richard Sutton's um and

5692
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:17,400
going back to uh Richard Sutton's um and
 

5693
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,229
going back to uh Richard Sutton's um and
understanding sort of like the

5694
01:39:18,229 --> 01:39:18,239
understanding sort of like the
 

5695
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:21,229
understanding sort of like the
philosophy of the uh bitter lesson and

5696
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:21,239
philosophy of the uh bitter lesson and
 

5697
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:22,370
philosophy of the uh bitter lesson and
then being like actually I need a much

5698
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:22,380
then being like actually I need a much
 

5699
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:23,930
then being like actually I need a much
more scalable system like a neural

5700
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:23,940
more scalable system like a neural
 

5701
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,970
more scalable system like a neural
network that in principle works and then

5702
01:39:25,970 --> 01:39:25,980
network that in principle works and then
 

5703
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:27,410
network that in principle works and then
having some deep Believers that can

5704
01:39:27,410 --> 01:39:27,420
having some deep Believers that can
 

5705
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,970
having some deep Believers that can
actually execute on that mission and

5706
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:28,980
actually execute on that mission and
 

5707
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:34,010
actually execute on that mission and
make it work so that's the 10x solution

5708
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:34,020

 

5709
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,050

what do you think is the timeline to

5710
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:36,060
what do you think is the timeline to
 

5711
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,330
what do you think is the timeline to
solve the problem of autonomous driving

5712
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:38,340
solve the problem of autonomous driving
 

5713
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:42,410
solve the problem of autonomous driving
this still in part an open question

5714
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:42,420
this still in part an open question
 

5715
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,030
this still in part an open question
yeah I think the tough thing with

5716
01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:44,040
yeah I think the tough thing with
 

5717
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,830
yeah I think the tough thing with
timelines of self-driving obviously is

5718
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:45,840
timelines of self-driving obviously is
 

5719
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,629
timelines of self-driving obviously is
that no one has created self-driving

5720
01:39:47,629 --> 01:39:47,639
that no one has created self-driving
 

5721
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:50,930
that no one has created self-driving
yeah so it's not like what do you think

5722
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:50,940
yeah so it's not like what do you think
 

5723
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,310
yeah so it's not like what do you think
is a timeline to build this bridge well

5724
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,320
is a timeline to build this bridge well
 

5725
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,689
is a timeline to build this bridge well
we've built million Bridges before

5726
01:39:53,689 --> 01:39:53,699
we've built million Bridges before
 

5727
01:39:53,699 --> 01:39:56,270
we've built million Bridges before
here's how long that takes it's it you

5728
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:56,280
here's how long that takes it's it you
 

5729
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,310
here's how long that takes it's it you
know it's uh no one has built autonomy

5730
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,320
know it's uh no one has built autonomy
 

5731
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,610
know it's uh no one has built autonomy
it's not obvious uh some parts turn out

5732
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:01,620
it's not obvious uh some parts turn out
 

5733
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,169
it's not obvious uh some parts turn out
to be much easier than others so it's

5734
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:03,179
to be much easier than others so it's
 

5735
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:04,669
to be much easier than others so it's
really hard to forecast you do your best

5736
01:40:04,669 --> 01:40:04,679
really hard to forecast you do your best
 

5737
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:07,250
really hard to forecast you do your best
based on trend lines and so on and based

5738
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:07,260
based on trend lines and so on and based
 

5739
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:08,629
based on trend lines and so on and based
on intuition but that's why

5740
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:08,639
on intuition but that's why
 

5741
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,010
on intuition but that's why
fundamentally it's just really hard to

5742
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:10,020
fundamentally it's just really hard to
 

5743
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:12,110
fundamentally it's just really hard to
forecast this no one has even still like

5744
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:12,120
forecast this no one has even still like
 

5745
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,990
forecast this no one has even still like
being inside of it is hard to uh to do

5746
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:15,000
being inside of it is hard to uh to do
 

5747
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,490
being inside of it is hard to uh to do
yes some things turn out to be much

5748
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:16,500
yes some things turn out to be much
 

5749
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,629
yes some things turn out to be much
harder and some things turn out to be

5750
01:40:17,629 --> 01:40:17,639
harder and some things turn out to be
 

5751
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:18,709
harder and some things turn out to be
much easier

5752
01:40:18,709 --> 01:40:18,719
much easier
 

5753
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:21,890
much easier
do you try to avoid making forecasts

5754
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:21,900
do you try to avoid making forecasts
 

5755
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,629
do you try to avoid making forecasts
because like Elon doesn't avoid them

5756
01:40:23,629 --> 01:40:23,639
because like Elon doesn't avoid them
 

5757
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:26,209
because like Elon doesn't avoid them
right and heads of car companies in the

5758
01:40:26,209 --> 01:40:26,219
right and heads of car companies in the
 

5759
01:40:26,219 --> 01:40:29,510
right and heads of car companies in the
past have not avoided it either uh Ford

5760
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:29,520
past have not avoided it either uh Ford
 

5761
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,490
past have not avoided it either uh Ford
and other places have made predictions

5762
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:31,500
and other places have made predictions
 

5763
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,530
and other places have made predictions
that we're going to solve at level four

5764
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:33,540
that we're going to solve at level four
 

5765
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:37,070
that we're going to solve at level four
driving by 2020 2021 whatever and now

a thing
 

5783
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,970
a thing
yeah I would say like what's easy to say

5784
01:40:55,970 --> 01:40:55,980
yeah I would say like what's easy to say
 

5785
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:58,010
yeah I would say like what's easy to say
is that this problem is tractable and

5786
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:58,020
is that this problem is tractable and
 

5787
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:59,209
is that this problem is tractable and
that's an easy prediction to make

5788
01:40:59,209 --> 01:40:59,219
that's an easy prediction to make
 

5789
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:01,430
that's an easy prediction to make
extractable it's going to work yes it's

5790
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:01,440
extractable it's going to work yes it's
 

5791
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,810
extractable it's going to work yes it's
just really hard some things turn out to

5792
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:02,820
just really hard some things turn out to
 

5793
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:04,310
just really hard some things turn out to
be harder than some things turn out to

5794
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:04,320
be harder than some things turn out to
 

5795
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,189
be harder than some things turn out to
be easier uh so uh but it definitely

5796
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:07,199
be easier uh so uh but it definitely
 

5797
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,709
be easier uh so uh but it definitely
feels tractable and it feels like at

5798
01:41:09,709 --> 01:41:09,719
feels tractable and it feels like at
 

5799
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:11,090
feels tractable and it feels like at
least the team at Tesla which is what I

5800
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:11,100
least the team at Tesla which is what I
 

5801
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,890
least the team at Tesla which is what I
saw internally is definitely on track to

5802
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:12,900
saw internally is definitely on track to
 

5803
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,290
saw internally is definitely on track to
that how do you form

5804
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:15,300
that how do you form
 

5805
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,229
that how do you form
a uh strong representation that allows

5806
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:18,239
a uh strong representation that allows
 

5807
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,370
a uh strong representation that allows
you to make a prediction about

5808
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:19,380
you to make a prediction about
 

5809
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,890
you to make a prediction about
tractability so like you're the leader

5810
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:21,900
tractability so like you're the leader
 

5811
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,530
tractability so like you're the leader
of a lot a lot of humans

5812
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:24,540
of a lot a lot of humans
 

5813
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:27,110
of a lot a lot of humans
you have to kind of say this is actually

5814
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:27,120
you have to kind of say this is actually
 

5815
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,310
you have to kind of say this is actually
possible

5816
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
possible
 

5817
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,709
possible
like how do you build up that intuition

5818
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:30,719
like how do you build up that intuition
 

5819
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,629
like how do you build up that intuition
it doesn't have to be even driving it

5820
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:32,639
it doesn't have to be even driving it
 

5821
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:35,570
it doesn't have to be even driving it
could be other tasks it could be um and

5822
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:35,580
could be other tasks it could be um and
 

5823
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,490
could be other tasks it could be um and
I wonder what difficult tasks did you

5824
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:37,500
I wonder what difficult tasks did you
 

5825
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:38,390
I wonder what difficult tasks did you
work on in your life I mean

5826
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:38,400
work on in your life I mean
 

5827
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,669
work on in your life I mean
classification

5828
01:41:39,669 --> 01:41:39,679
classification
 

5829
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:42,169
classification
achieving certain just an image that

5830
01:41:42,169 --> 01:41:42,179
achieving certain just an image that
 

5831
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:44,450
achieving certain just an image that
certain level of superhuman level

5832
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:44,460
certain level of superhuman level
 

5833
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:47,689
certain level of superhuman level
performance yeah expert intuition

5834
01:41:47,689 --> 01:41:47,699
performance yeah expert intuition
 

5835
01:41:47,699 --> 01:41:50,750
performance yeah expert intuition
it's just intuition it's belief

5836
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:50,760
it's just intuition it's belief
 

5837
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,609
it's just intuition it's belief
so just like thinking about it long

5838
01:41:52,609 --> 01:41:52,619
so just like thinking about it long
 

5839
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:54,290
so just like thinking about it long
enough like studying looking at sample

5840
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:54,300
enough like studying looking at sample
 

5841
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,270
enough like studying looking at sample
data like you said driving

5842
01:41:56,270 --> 01:41:56,280
data like you said driving
 

5843
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,490
data like you said driving
uh my intuition has really flawed on

5844
01:41:58,490 --> 01:41:58,500
uh my intuition has really flawed on
 

5845
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,290
uh my intuition has really flawed on
this like I don't have a good intuition

5846
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:00,300
this like I don't have a good intuition
 

5847
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,689
this like I don't have a good intuition
about tractability it could be either it

5848
01:42:02,689 --> 01:42:02,699
about tractability it could be either it
 

5849
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:05,689
about tractability it could be either it
could be anything it could be solvable

5850
01:42:05,689 --> 01:42:05,699
could be anything it could be solvable
 

5851
01:42:05,699 --> 01:42:09,109
could be anything it could be solvable
like uh you know the driving task could

5852
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:09,119
like uh you know the driving task could
 

5853
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,109
like uh you know the driving task could
could be simplified into something quite

5854
01:42:12,109 --> 01:42:12,119
could be simplified into something quite
 

5855
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:14,810
could be simplified into something quite
trivial like uh the solution to the

5856
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:14,820
trivial like uh the solution to the
 

5857
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:17,030
trivial like uh the solution to the
problem would be quite trivial and at

5858
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,040
problem would be quite trivial and at
 

5859
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,709
problem would be quite trivial and at
scale more and more cars driving

5860
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
scale more and more cars driving
 

5861
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,270
scale more and more cars driving
perfectly

5862
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:20,280
perfectly
 

5863
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,430
perfectly
might make the problem much easier Yeah

5864
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:22,440
might make the problem much easier Yeah
 

5865
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,350
might make the problem much easier Yeah
the more cars you have driving like

5866
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:24,360
the more cars you have driving like
 

5867
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:27,050
the more cars you have driving like
people learn how to drive correctly not

5868
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:27,060
people learn how to drive correctly not
 

5869
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:29,090
people learn how to drive correctly not
correctly but in a way that's more

5870
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:29,100
correctly but in a way that's more
 

5871
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,510
correctly but in a way that's more
optimal for a heterogeneous system of

5872
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:32,520
optimal for a heterogeneous system of
 

5873
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,030
optimal for a heterogeneous system of
autonomous and semi-autonomous and

5874
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
autonomous and semi-autonomous and
 

5875
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,649
autonomous and semi-autonomous and
manually driven cars that could change

5876
01:42:36,649 --> 01:42:36,659
manually driven cars that could change
 

5877
01:42:36,659 --> 01:42:39,530
manually driven cars that could change
stuff then again also I've spent a

5878
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:39,540
stuff then again also I've spent a
 

5879
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,270
stuff then again also I've spent a
ridiculous number of hours just staring

5880
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:41,280
ridiculous number of hours just staring
 

5881
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:44,149
ridiculous number of hours just staring
at pedestrians crossing streets thinking

5882
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:44,159
at pedestrians crossing streets thinking
 

5883
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,390
at pedestrians crossing streets thinking
about humans and it feels like the way

5884
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:47,400
about humans and it feels like the way
 

5885
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,290
about humans and it feels like the way
we use our eye contact

5886
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:50,300
we use our eye contact
 

5887
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:53,149
we use our eye contact
it sends really strong signals and

5888
01:42:53,149 --> 01:42:53,159
it sends really strong signals and
 

5889
01:42:53,159 --> 01:42:55,010
it sends really strong signals and
there's certain quirks and edge cases of

5890
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:55,020
there's certain quirks and edge cases of
 

5891
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,629
there's certain quirks and edge cases of
behavior and of course a lot of the

5892
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:56,639
behavior and of course a lot of the
 

5893
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,550
behavior and of course a lot of the
fatalities that happen have to do with

5894
01:42:58,550 --> 01:42:58,560
fatalities that happen have to do with
 

5895
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,129
fatalities that happen have to do with
drunk driving and

5896
01:43:01,129 --> 01:43:01,139
drunk driving and
 

5897
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:02,930
drunk driving and
um both on The Pedestrian side and the

5898
01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:02,940
um both on The Pedestrian side and the
 

5899
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:05,209
um both on The Pedestrian side and the
driver's side so there's that problem of

5900
01:43:05,209 --> 01:43:05,219
driver's side so there's that problem of
 

5901
01:43:05,219 --> 01:43:06,590
driver's side so there's that problem of
driving at night and all that kind of

5902
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:06,600
driving at night and all that kind of
 

5903
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,750
driving at night and all that kind of
yeah so I wonder you know it's like the

5904
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:08,760
yeah so I wonder you know it's like the
 

5905
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,189
yeah so I wonder you know it's like the
space

5906
01:43:10,189 --> 01:43:10,199
space
 

5907
01:43:10,199 --> 01:43:12,109
space
of possible solution to autonomous

5908
01:43:12,109 --> 01:43:12,119
of possible solution to autonomous
 

5909
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:14,390
of possible solution to autonomous
driving includes so many human factor

5910
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:14,400
driving includes so many human factor
 

5911
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,590
driving includes so many human factor
issues

5912
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:15,600
issues
 

5913
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,810
issues
that it's almost impossible to predict

5914
01:43:17,810 --> 01:43:17,820
that it's almost impossible to predict
 

5915
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:20,209
that it's almost impossible to predict
there could be super clean nice

5916
01:43:20,209 --> 01:43:20,219
there could be super clean nice
 

5917
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:22,250
there could be super clean nice
Solutions yeah I would say definitely

5918
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:22,260
Solutions yeah I would say definitely
 

5919
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:24,050
Solutions yeah I would say definitely
like to use a game analogy there's some

5920
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:24,060
like to use a game analogy there's some
 

5921
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:26,570
like to use a game analogy there's some
fog of War but you definitely also see

5922
01:43:26,570 --> 01:43:26,580
fog of War but you definitely also see
 

5923
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:29,030
fog of War but you definitely also see
the frontier of improvement and you can

5924
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:29,040
the frontier of improvement and you can
 

5925
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,410
the frontier of improvement and you can
measure historically how much you've

5926
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:30,420
measure historically how much you've
 

5927
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,629
measure historically how much you've
made progress and I think for example at

5928
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:32,639
made progress and I think for example at
 

5929
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,850
made progress and I think for example at
least what I've seen in uh roughly five

5930
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:34,860
least what I've seen in uh roughly five
 

5931
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:36,830
least what I've seen in uh roughly five
years at Tesla when I joined it barely

5932
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:36,840
years at Tesla when I joined it barely
 

5933
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,530
years at Tesla when I joined it barely
kept laying on the highway I think going

5934
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:39,540
kept laying on the highway I think going
 

5935
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,390
kept laying on the highway I think going
up from Palo Alto to SF was like three

5936
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:41,400
up from Palo Alto to SF was like three
 

5937
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,310
up from Palo Alto to SF was like three
or four interventions anytime the road

5938
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:43,320
or four interventions anytime the road
 

5939
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,109
or four interventions anytime the road
would do anything geometrically or turn

5940
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:45,119
would do anything geometrically or turn
 

5941
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,330
would do anything geometrically or turn
too much it would just like not work and

5942
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:47,340
too much it would just like not work and
 

5943
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:48,590
too much it would just like not work and
so going from that to like a pretty

5944
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:48,600
so going from that to like a pretty
 

5945
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,390
so going from that to like a pretty
competent system in five years and

5946
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
competent system in five years and
 

5947
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,950
competent system in five years and
seeing what happens also under the hood

5948
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:51,960
seeing what happens also under the hood
 

5949
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,930
seeing what happens also under the hood
and what the scale which the team is

5950
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:53,940
and what the scale which the team is
 

5951
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,129
and what the scale which the team is
operating now with respect to data and

5952
01:43:55,129 --> 01:43:55,139
operating now with respect to data and
 

5953
01:43:55,139 --> 01:43:58,129
operating now with respect to data and
compute and everything else uh is just a

5954
01:43:58,129 --> 01:43:58,139
compute and everything else uh is just a
 

5955
01:43:58,139 --> 01:43:59,450
compute and everything else uh is just a
massive progress

5956
01:43:59,450 --> 01:43:59,460
massive progress
 

5957
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:02,390
massive progress
so there's a you're climbing a mountain

5958
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,400
so there's a you're climbing a mountain
 

5959
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,970
so there's a you're climbing a mountain
and it's fog but you're making a lot of

5960
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:04,980
and it's fog but you're making a lot of
 

5961
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,649
and it's fog but you're making a lot of
progress fog you're making progress and

5962
01:44:06,649 --> 01:44:06,659
progress fog you're making progress and
 

5963
01:44:06,659 --> 01:44:08,149
progress fog you're making progress and
you see what the next directions are and

5964
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:08,159
you see what the next directions are and
 

5965
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,169
you see what the next directions are and
you're looking at some of the remaining

5966
01:44:09,169 --> 01:44:09,179
you're looking at some of the remaining
 

5967
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:11,209
you're looking at some of the remaining
challenges and they're not like uh

5968
01:44:11,209 --> 01:44:11,219
challenges and they're not like uh
 

5969
01:44:11,219 --> 01:44:12,709
challenges and they're not like uh
they're not perturbing you and they're

5970
01:44:12,709 --> 01:44:12,719
they're not perturbing you and they're
 

5971
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:13,970
they're not perturbing you and they're
not changing your philosophy and you're

5972
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:13,980
not changing your philosophy and you're
 

5973
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,310
not changing your philosophy and you're
not contorting yourself you're like

5974
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:16,320
not contorting yourself you're like
 

5975
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,750
not contorting yourself you're like
actually these are the things that we

5976
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:17,760
actually these are the things that we
 

5977
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,010
actually these are the things that we
still need to do yeah the fundamental

5978
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:19,020
still need to do yeah the fundamental
 

5979
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:20,629
still need to do yeah the fundamental
components of solving the problems seem

5980
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:20,639
components of solving the problems seem
 

5981
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,310
components of solving the problems seem
to be there for the data engine to the

5982
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:22,320
to be there for the data engine to the
 

5983
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,470
to be there for the data engine to the

so you've done
 

5991
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:30,530
so you've done
uh over the years you've been a test

Side all of it can you speak to why you

6002
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:41,400
Side all of it can you speak to why you
 

6003
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:44,810
Side all of it can you speak to why you
chose to leave Tesla basically as I

6004
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:44,820
chose to leave Tesla basically as I
 

6005
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:46,910

described that ran I think over time

6006
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:46,920
described that ran I think over time
 

6007
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,950
described that ran I think over time
during those five years I've kind of uh

6008
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:48,960
during those five years I've kind of uh
 

6009
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,109
during those five years I've kind of uh
gotten myself into a little bit of a

6010
01:44:51,109 --> 01:44:51,119
gotten myself into a little bit of a
 

6011
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,390
gotten myself into a little bit of a
managerial position most of my days were

6012
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:53,400
managerial position most of my days were
 

6013
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:54,530
managerial position most of my days were
you know meetings and growing the

6014
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:54,540
you know meetings and growing the
 

6015
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,290
you know meetings and growing the
organization and making decisions about

6016
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:57,300
organization and making decisions about
 

6017
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,330
organization and making decisions about
sort of high level strategic decisions

6018
01:44:59,330 --> 01:44:59,340
sort of high level strategic decisions
 

6019
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:01,250
sort of high level strategic decisions
about the team and what it should be

01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:01,260
about the team and what it should be
 

6021
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,950
about the team and what it should be
working on and so on and uh

6022
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:03,960
working on and so on and uh
 

6023
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,689
working on and so on and uh
it's kind of like a corporate executive

6024
01:45:05,689 --> 01:45:05,699
it's kind of like a corporate executive
 

6025
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:08,149
it's kind of like a corporate executive
role and I can do it I think I'm okay at

6026
01:45:08,149 --> 01:45:08,159
role and I can do it I think I'm okay at
 

6027
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:09,950
role and I can do it I think I'm okay at
it but it's not like fundamentally what

6028
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:09,960
it but it's not like fundamentally what
 

6029
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:13,070
it but it's not like fundamentally what
I what I enjoy and so I think uh when I

6030
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:13,080
I what I enjoy and so I think uh when I
 

6031
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,930
I what I enjoy and so I think uh when I
joined uh there was no computer vision

6032
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:14,940
joined uh there was no computer vision
 

6033
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:16,550
joined uh there was no computer vision
team because Tesla was just going from

6034
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:16,560
team because Tesla was just going from
 

6035
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,290

computer vision system so when I showed

6042
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:22,500
computer vision system so when I showed
 

6043
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,689
computer vision system so when I showed
up there were two people training deep

6044
01:45:23,689 --> 01:45:23,699
up there were two people training deep
 

6045
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:25,729
up there were two people training deep
neural networks and they were training

6046
01:45:25,729 --> 01:45:25,739
neural networks and they were training
 

6047
01:45:25,739 --> 01:45:27,950
neural networks and they were training
them at a computer at their at their

6048
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:27,960
them at a computer at their at their
 

6049
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,070
them at a computer at their at their
legs like uh

6050
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:30,080
legs like uh
 

6051
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,810
legs like uh
kind of basic classification task yeah

6052
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:32,820
kind of basic classification task yeah
 

6053
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,370
kind of basic classification task yeah
and so

6054
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:34,380
and so
 

6055
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:36,350
and so
I kind of like grew that into what I

6056
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:36,360
I kind of like grew that into what I
 

6057
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,090
I kind of like grew that into what I
think is a fairly respectable deep

6058
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:38,100
think is a fairly respectable deep
 

6059
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:39,890

a very good um data annotation

6062
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:41,880
a very good um data annotation
 

6063
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:44,570
a very good um data annotation
organization and uh I was very happy

6064
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:44,580
organization and uh I was very happy
 

6065
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:45,890
organization and uh I was very happy
with where that was it became quite

6066
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:45,900
with where that was it became quite
 

6067
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:48,109
with where that was it became quite
autonomous and so I kind of stepped away

6068
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:48,119
autonomous and so I kind of stepped away
 

6069
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:50,450
autonomous and so I kind of stepped away
and I uh you know I'm very excited to do

6070
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:50,460
and I uh you know I'm very excited to do
 

6071
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:52,189
and I uh you know I'm very excited to do
much more technical things again

6072
01:45:52,189 --> 01:45:52,199
much more technical things again
 

6073
01:45:52,199 --> 01:45:54,530
much more technical things again
yeah and kind of like we focus on AGI

6074
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:54,540
yeah and kind of like we focus on AGI
 

6075
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:56,510
yeah and kind of like we focus on AGI
what was this soul searching like

6076
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:56,520
what was this soul searching like
 

6077
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,129
what was this soul searching like
because you took a little time off and

6078
01:45:58,129 --> 01:45:58,139
because you took a little time off and
 

6079
01:45:58,139 --> 01:46:00,109
because you took a little time off and
think like what um how many mushrooms

6080
01:46:00,109 --> 01:46:00,119
think like what um how many mushrooms
 

6081
01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:02,390
think like what um how many mushrooms
did you take no I'm just uh I mean what

6082
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:02,400
did you take no I'm just uh I mean what
 

6083
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,070
did you take no I'm just uh I mean what
what was going through your mind the

6084
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:04,080
what was going through your mind the
 

6085
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,310
what was going through your mind the
human lifetime is finite yeah he did a

6086
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:07,320
human lifetime is finite yeah he did a
 

6087
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:09,530
human lifetime is finite yeah he did a
few incredible things you're you're one

6088
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:09,540
few incredible things you're you're one
 

6089
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:11,169
few incredible things you're you're one
of the best teachers of AI in the world

6090
01:46:11,169 --> 01:46:11,179
of the best teachers of AI in the world
 

6091
01:46:11,179 --> 01:46:14,090
of the best teachers of AI in the world
you're one of the best and I don't mean

6092
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:14,100
you're one of the best and I don't mean
 

6093
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:15,590
you're one of the best and I don't mean
that I mean that in the best possible

6094
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:15,600
that I mean that in the best possible
 

6095
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,709
that I mean that in the best possible
way you're one of the best tinkerers in

6096
01:46:18,709 --> 01:46:18,719
way you're one of the best tinkerers in
 

6097
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,410
way you're one of the best tinkerers in
the AI world meaning like understanding

6098
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:21,420
the AI world meaning like understanding
 

6099
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:23,689
the AI world meaning like understanding
the fundamental fundamentals of how

6100
01:46:23,689 --> 01:46:23,699
the fundamental fundamentals of how
 

6101
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:25,669
the fundamental fundamentals of how
something works by building it from

6102
01:46:25,669 --> 01:46:25,679
something works by building it from
 

6103
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:27,709
something works by building it from
scratch and playing with it with the

6104
01:46:27,709 --> 01:46:27,719
scratch and playing with it with the
 

6105
01:46:27,719 --> 01:46:30,050
scratch and playing with it with the
basic intuitions it's like Einstein

6106
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:30,060
basic intuitions it's like Einstein
 

6107
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:31,609
basic intuitions it's like Einstein
feinmen were all really good at this

6108
01:46:31,609 --> 01:46:31,619
feinmen were all really good at this
 

6109
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:33,830
feinmen were all really good at this
kind of stuff like a small example of a

6110
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:33,840
kind of stuff like a small example of a
 

6111
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,810
kind of stuff like a small example of a
thing to to play with it to try to

6112
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:35,820
thing to to play with it to try to
 

6113
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,149
thing to to play with it to try to
understand it uh so that and obviously

6114
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:38,159
understand it uh so that and obviously
 

6115
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:41,149
understand it uh so that and obviously
now with us that you help build a team

6116
01:46:41,149 --> 01:46:41,159
now with us that you help build a team
 

6117
01:46:41,159 --> 01:46:43,609
now with us that you help build a team
of machine learning

6118
01:46:43,609 --> 01:46:43,619
of machine learning
 

6119
01:46:43,619 --> 01:46:46,070
of machine learning
um uh like engineers and a system that

6120
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,080
um uh like engineers and a system that
 

6121
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,390
um uh like engineers and a system that
actually accomplishes something in the

6122
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:47,400
actually accomplishes something in the
 

6123
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,609
actually accomplishes something in the
real world so given all that like what

6124
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:49,619
real world so given all that like what

01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:35,689
it doesn't make sense it doesn't compute
there's just something about him and

6280
01:49:35,689 --> 01:49:35,699
there's just something about him and
 

6281
01:49:35,699 --> 01:49:37,550
there's just something about him and
he's a singular human because you don't

6282
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:37,560
he's a singular human because you don't
 

6283
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,229
he's a singular human because you don't
get that many comedies

6284
01:49:39,229 --> 01:49:39,239
get that many comedies
 

6285
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,030
get that many comedies
these days and I wonder if it has to do

6286
01:49:41,030 --> 01:49:41,040
these days and I wonder if it has to do
 

6287
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,430
these days and I wonder if it has to do
about the culture uh or the like the

6288
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:43,440
about the culture uh or the like the
 

6289
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,109
about the culture uh or the like the
machine of Hollywood or does it have to

6290
01:49:45,109 --> 01:49:45,119
machine of Hollywood or does it have to
 

6291
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:46,850
machine of Hollywood or does it have to
do with just we got lucky with certain

6292
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:46,860
do with just we got lucky with certain
 

6293
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:48,770
do with just we got lucky with certain
people and comedy it came together

6294
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:48,780
people and comedy it came together
 

6295
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:52,270
people and comedy it came together
because he is a singular human

6296
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:52,280
because he is a singular human
 

6297
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,890
because he is a singular human
that was a ridiculous tangent I

6298
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:54,900
that was a ridiculous tangent I
 

6299
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:56,930
that was a ridiculous tangent I
apologize but you mentioned humanoid

6300
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:56,940
apologize but you mentioned humanoid
 

6301
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:59,149
apologize but you mentioned humanoid
robot so what do you think about Optimus

6302
01:49:59,149 --> 01:49:59,159
robot so what do you think about Optimus
 

6303
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:01,370
robot so what do you think about Optimus
about Tesla bot do you think we'll have

6304
01:50:01,370 --> 01:50:01,380
about Tesla bot do you think we'll have
 

6305
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:03,830
about Tesla bot do you think we'll have
robots in the factory in in the home in

6306
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:03,840
robots in the factory in in the home in
 

6307
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,189
robots in the factory in in the home in
10 20 30 40 50 years yeah I think it's a

6308
01:50:07,189 --> 01:50:07,199
10 20 30 40 50 years yeah I think it's a
 

6309
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:08,330
10 20 30 40 50 years yeah I think it's a
very hard project I think it's going to

6310
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:08,340
very hard project I think it's going to
 

6311
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:10,010
very hard project I think it's going to
take a while but who else is going to

6312
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:10,020
take a while but who else is going to
 

6313
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:12,470
take a while but who else is going to
build humano robots at scale yeah and I

6314
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:12,480
build humano robots at scale yeah and I
 

6315
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,910
build humano robots at scale yeah and I
think it is a very good form factor to

6316
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:13,920
think it is a very good form factor to
 

6317
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,229
think it is a very good form factor to
go after because like I mentioned the

6318
01:50:15,229 --> 01:50:15,239
go after because like I mentioned the
 

6319
01:50:15,239 --> 01:50:17,090
go after because like I mentioned the
the world is designed for humanoid form

6320
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:17,100
the world is designed for humanoid form
 

6321
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,709
the world is designed for humanoid form
factor these things would be able to

6322
01:50:18,709 --> 01:50:18,719
factor these things would be able to
 

6323
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:20,270
factor these things would be able to
operate our machines they would be able

6324
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:20,280
operate our machines they would be able
 

6325
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,490
operate our machines they would be able
to sit down in chairs uh potentially

6326
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:22,500
to sit down in chairs uh potentially
 

6327
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,010
to sit down in chairs uh potentially
even drive cars uh basically the world

6328
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:25,020
even drive cars uh basically the world
 

6329
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:26,390
even drive cars uh basically the world
is designed for humans that's the form

6330
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:26,400
is designed for humans that's the form
 

6331
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,189
is designed for humans that's the form
factor you want to invest into and make

6332
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:28,199
factor you want to invest into and make
 

6333
01:50:28,199 --> 01:50:30,470
factor you want to invest into and make
work over time uh I think you know

6334
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:30,480
work over time uh I think you know
 

6335
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,609
work over time uh I think you know
there's another school of thought which

6336
01:50:31,609 --> 01:50:31,619
there's another school of thought which
 

6337
01:50:31,619 --> 01:50:33,649
there's another school of thought which
is okay pick a problem and design a

6338
01:50:33,649 --> 01:50:33,659
is okay pick a problem and design a
 

6339
01:50:33,659 --> 01:50:35,270
is okay pick a problem and design a
robot to it but actually designing a

6340
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:35,280
robot to it but actually designing a
 

6341
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,470
robot to it but actually designing a
robot and getting a whole data engine

6342
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:36,480
robot and getting a whole data engine
 

6343
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,149
robot and getting a whole data engine
and everything behind it to work is

6344
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:38,159
and everything behind it to work is
 

6345
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:40,010
and everything behind it to work is
actually an incredibly hard problem so

6346
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:40,020
actually an incredibly hard problem so
 

6347
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:40,970
actually an incredibly hard problem so
it makes sense to go after General

6348
01:50:40,970 --> 01:50:40,980
it makes sense to go after General
 

6349
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:43,490
it makes sense to go after General
interfaces that uh okay they are not

6350
01:50:43,490 --> 01:50:43,500
interfaces that uh okay they are not
 

6351
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,169
interfaces that uh okay they are not
perfect for any one given task but they

6352
01:50:45,169 --> 01:50:45,179
perfect for any one given task but they
 

6353
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:47,270
perfect for any one given task but they
actually have the generality of just

6354
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:47,280
actually have the generality of just
 

6355
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,729
actually have the generality of just
with a prompt with English able to do

6356
01:50:49,729 --> 01:50:49,739
with a prompt with English able to do
 

6357
01:50:49,739 --> 01:50:51,950
with a prompt with English able to do
something across and so I think it makes

6358
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:51,960
something across and so I think it makes
 

6359
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:54,649
something across and so I think it makes
a lot of sense to go after a general uh

6360
01:50:54,649 --> 01:50:54,659
a lot of sense to go after a general uh
 

6361
01:50:54,659 --> 01:50:56,270
a lot of sense to go after a general uh
interface

6362
01:50:56,270 --> 01:50:56,280
interface
 

6363
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,850
interface
um in the physical world and I think

6364
01:50:58,850 --> 01:50:58,860
um in the physical world and I think
 

6365
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,290
um in the physical world and I think
it's a very difficult project I think

6366
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:00,300
it's a very difficult project I think
 

6367
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:02,870
it's a very difficult project I think
it's going to take time but I see no

6368
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:02,880
it's going to take time but I see no
 

6369
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,550
it's going to take time but I see no
other no other company that can execute

6370
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:04,560
other no other company that can execute
 

6371
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,629
other no other company that can execute
on that Vision I think it's going to be

6372
01:51:05,629 --> 01:51:05,639
on that Vision I think it's going to be
 

6373
01:51:05,639 --> 01:51:08,390
on that Vision I think it's going to be
amazing like uh basically physical labor

6374
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:08,400
amazing like uh basically physical labor
 

6375
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,830
amazing like uh basically physical labor
like if you think transportation is a

6376
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:09,840
like if you think transportation is a
 

6377
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,729
like if you think transportation is a
large Market try physical labor insane

6378
01:51:13,729 --> 01:51:13,739
large Market try physical labor insane
 

6379
01:51:13,739 --> 01:51:15,890
large Market try physical labor insane
well but it's not just physical labor to

6380
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:15,900
well but it's not just physical labor to
 

6381
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:17,930
well but it's not just physical labor to
me the thing that's also exciting is the

6382
01:51:17,930 --> 01:51:17,940
me the thing that's also exciting is the
 

6383
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,390
me the thing that's also exciting is the
social robotics so the the relationship

6384
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:20,400
social robotics so the the relationship
 

6385
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,070
social robotics so the the relationship
we'll have on different levels with

6386
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080
we'll have on different levels with
 

6387
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,530
we'll have on different levels with
those robots that's why I was really

6388
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:24,540
those robots that's why I was really
 

6389
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:28,010
those robots that's why I was really
excited to see Optimus like um people

6390
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:28,020
excited to see Optimus like um people
 

6391
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:30,310
excited to see Optimus like um people
have criticized me for the excitement

6392
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:30,320
have criticized me for the excitement
 

6393
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:34,129
have criticized me for the excitement
but I've I've worked with uh uh a lot of

6394
01:51:34,129 --> 01:51:34,139
but I've I've worked with uh uh a lot of
 

6395
01:51:34,139 --> 01:51:36,649
but I've I've worked with uh uh a lot of
research Labs that do humanoid legged

6396
01:51:36,649 --> 01:51:36,659
research Labs that do humanoid legged
 

6397
01:51:36,659 --> 01:51:40,010
research Labs that do humanoid legged
robots Boston Dynamics unitary a lot

6398
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:40,020
robots Boston Dynamics unitary a lot
 

6399
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,209
robots Boston Dynamics unitary a lot
there's a lot of companies that do

6400
01:51:41,209 --> 01:51:41,219
there's a lot of companies that do
 

6401
01:51:41,219 --> 01:51:45,050
there's a lot of companies that do
legged robots but that's the the

6402
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:45,060
legged robots but that's the the
 

6403
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:49,310
legged robots but that's the the
Elegance of the movement is a tiny tiny

6404
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:49,320
Elegance of the movement is a tiny tiny
 

6405
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:52,609
Elegance of the movement is a tiny tiny
part of the big picture so integrating

6406
01:51:52,609 --> 01:51:52,619
part of the big picture so integrating
 

6407
01:51:52,619 --> 01:51:54,590
part of the big picture so integrating
the two big exciting things to me about

6408
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:54,600
the two big exciting things to me about
 

6409
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:57,709
the two big exciting things to me about
Tesla doing humanoid or any Lego robots

6410
01:51:57,709 --> 01:51:57,719
Tesla doing humanoid or any Lego robots
 

6411
01:51:57,719 --> 01:51:59,570
Tesla doing humanoid or any Lego robots
is

6412
01:51:59,570 --> 01:51:59,580
is
 

6413
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:02,090
is
clearly integrating it into the data

6414
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:02,100
clearly integrating it into the data
 

6415
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:05,570
clearly integrating it into the data
engine so the the data engine aspect so

6416
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:05,580
engine so the the data engine aspect so
 

6417
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:07,310
engine so the the data engine aspect so
the actual intelligence for the

6418
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:07,320
the actual intelligence for the
 

6419
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,109
the actual intelligence for the
perception and the and the control and

6420
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:09,119
perception and the and the control and
 

6421
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:10,609
perception and the and the control and
the planning and all that kind of stuff

6422
01:52:10,609 --> 01:52:10,619
the planning and all that kind of stuff
 

6423
01:52:10,619 --> 01:52:12,709
the planning and all that kind of stuff
integrating into this huge the fleet

6424
01:52:12,709 --> 01:52:12,719
integrating into this huge the fleet
 

6425
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:14,450
integrating into this huge the fleet
that you mentioned right

6426
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:14,460
that you mentioned right
 

6427
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:17,930
that you mentioned right
um and then speaking of Fleet the second

6428
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:17,940
um and then speaking of Fleet the second
 

6429
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,729
um and then speaking of Fleet the second
thing is the mass manufacturers Just

6430
01:52:19,729 --> 01:52:19,739
thing is the mass manufacturers Just
 

6431
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:20,629
thing is the mass manufacturers Just
knowing

6432
01:52:20,629 --> 01:52:20,639
knowing
 

6433
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:23,410
knowing
uh culturally

6434
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:23,420
uh culturally
 

6435
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:27,229
uh culturally
uh driving towards a simple robot that's

6436
01:52:27,229 --> 01:52:27,239
uh driving towards a simple robot that's
 

6437
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:29,810
uh driving towards a simple robot that's
cheap to produce at scale yeah and doing

6438
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:29,820
cheap to produce at scale yeah and doing
 

6439
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:31,250
cheap to produce at scale yeah and doing
that well having experience to do that

6440
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:31,260
that well having experience to do that
 

6441
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:32,990
that well having experience to do that
well that changes everything that's why

6442
01:52:32,990 --> 01:52:33,000
well that changes everything that's why
 

6443
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,390
well that changes everything that's why
that's a very different culture and

6444
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:35,400
that's a very different culture and
 

6445
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,250
that's a very different culture and
style than Boston Dynamics who by the

6446
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:37,260
style than Boston Dynamics who by the
 

6447
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:40,370
style than Boston Dynamics who by the
way those those robots are just the the

6448
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:40,380
way those those robots are just the the
 

6449
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:43,910
way those those robots are just the the
way they move it's uh like it'll be a

6450
01:52:43,910 --> 01:52:43,920
way they move it's uh like it'll be a
 

6451
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,350
way they move it's uh like it'll be a
very long time before Tesla could

6452
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:45,360
very long time before Tesla could
 

6453
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,450
very long time before Tesla could
achieve the smoothness of movement but

6454
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:47,460
achieve the smoothness of movement but
 

6455
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:49,669
achieve the smoothness of movement but
that's not what it's about it's it's

6456
01:52:49,669 --> 01:52:49,679
that's not what it's about it's it's
 

6457
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:52,129
that's not what it's about it's it's
about uh it's about the entirety of the

6458
01:52:52,129 --> 01:52:52,139
about uh it's about the entirety of the
 

6459
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:53,570
about uh it's about the entirety of the
system like we talked about the data

6460
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:53,580
system like we talked about the data
 

6461
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,370
system like we talked about the data
engine and the fleet that's super

6462
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:55,380
engine and the fleet that's super
 

6463
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:57,470
engine and the fleet that's super
exciting even the initial sort of models

6464
01:52:57,470 --> 01:52:57,480
exciting even the initial sort of models
 

6465
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:00,109
exciting even the initial sort of models
uh but that too was really surprising

6466
01:53:00,109 --> 01:53:00,119
uh but that too was really surprising
 

6467
01:53:00,119 --> 01:53:02,750
uh but that too was really surprising
that in a few months you can get a

6468
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:02,760
that in a few months you can get a
 

6469
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,970
that in a few months you can get a
prototype yep and the reason that

6470
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:04,980
prototype yep and the reason that
 

6471
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:06,950
prototype yep and the reason that
happened very quickly is as you alluded

6472
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:06,960
happened very quickly is as you alluded
 

6473
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,750
happened very quickly is as you alluded
to there's a ton of copy based from

6474
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:08,760
to there's a ton of copy based from
 

6475
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,430
to there's a ton of copy based from
what's happening in the autopilot yes a

6476
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:10,440
what's happening in the autopilot yes a
 

6477
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,109
what's happening in the autopilot yes a
lot the amount of expertise that like

6478
01:53:12,109 --> 01:53:12,119
lot the amount of expertise that like
 

6479
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:13,729
lot the amount of expertise that like
came out of the Woodworks at Tesla for

6480
01:53:13,729 --> 01:53:13,739
came out of the Woodworks at Tesla for
 

6481
01:53:13,739 --> 01:53:15,410
came out of the Woodworks at Tesla for
building the human robot was incredible

6482
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:15,420
building the human robot was incredible
 

6483
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:18,410
building the human robot was incredible
to see like basically Elon said at one

6484
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:18,420
to see like basically Elon said at one
 

6485
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:20,570
to see like basically Elon said at one
point we're doing this and then

6486
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:20,580
point we're doing this and then
 

6487
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:22,790
point we're doing this and then
next day basically like all these CAD

6488
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
next day basically like all these CAD
 

6489
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,530
next day basically like all these CAD
models started to appear and people talk

6490
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:24,540
models started to appear and people talk
 

6491
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:25,729
models started to appear and people talk
about like the supply chain and

6492
01:53:25,729 --> 01:53:25,739
about like the supply chain and
 

6493
01:53:25,739 --> 01:53:28,010
about like the supply chain and
Manufacturing and uh people showed up

6494
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:28,020
Manufacturing and uh people showed up
 

6495
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:29,270
Manufacturing and uh people showed up
with like screwdrivers and everything

6496
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:29,280
with like screwdrivers and everything
 

6497
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,250
with like screwdrivers and everything
like the other day and started to like

6498
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:31,260
like the other day and started to like
 

6499
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:32,629
like the other day and started to like
put together the body and I was like

6500
01:53:32,629 --> 01:53:32,639
put together the body and I was like
 

6501
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:34,010
put together the body and I was like
whoa like all these people exist at

6502
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:34,020
whoa like all these people exist at
 

6503
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:35,810
whoa like all these people exist at
Tesla and fundamentally building a car

6504
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:35,820
Tesla and fundamentally building a car
 

6505
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:36,830
Tesla and fundamentally building a car
is actually not that different from

6506
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:36,840
is actually not that different from
 

6507
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,629
is actually not that different from
building a robot the same and that is

6508
01:53:38,629 --> 01:53:38,639
building a robot the same and that is
 

6509
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:41,149
building a robot the same and that is
true uh not just for uh the hardware

6510
01:53:41,149 --> 01:53:41,159
true uh not just for uh the hardware
 

6511
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:43,070
true uh not just for uh the hardware
pieces and also let's not forget

6512
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:43,080
pieces and also let's not forget
 

6513
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,850
pieces and also let's not forget
Hardware not just for a demo but

6514
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:45,860
Hardware not just for a demo but
 

6515
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:48,770
Hardware not just for a demo but
manufacturing of that Hardware at scale

6516
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:48,780
manufacturing of that Hardware at scale
 

6517
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,689
manufacturing of that Hardware at scale
is like a whole different thing but for

6518
01:53:50,689 --> 01:53:50,699
is like a whole different thing but for
 

6519
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:53,270
is like a whole different thing but for
software as well basically this robot

6520
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:53,280
software as well basically this robot
 

6521
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,629
software as well basically this robot
currently thinks it's a car

6522
01:53:55,629 --> 01:53:55,639
currently thinks it's a car
 

6523
01:53:55,639 --> 01:53:58,609
currently thinks it's a car
uh it's gonna have a midlife crisis at

6524
01:53:58,609 --> 01:53:58,619
uh it's gonna have a midlife crisis at
 

6525
01:53:58,619 --> 01:54:00,950
uh it's gonna have a midlife crisis at
some point it thinks it's a car

6526
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:00,960
some point it thinks it's a car
 

6527
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,629
some point it thinks it's a car
um some of the earlier demos actually we

6528
01:54:02,629 --> 01:54:02,639
um some of the earlier demos actually we
 

6529
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:03,649
um some of the earlier demos actually we
were talking about potentially doing

6530
01:54:03,649 --> 01:54:03,659
were talking about potentially doing
 

6531
01:54:03,659 --> 01:54:05,030
were talking about potentially doing
them outside in the parking lot because

6532
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:05,040
them outside in the parking lot because
 

6533
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,530
them outside in the parking lot because
that's where all of the computer vision

6534
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:06,540
that's where all of the computer vision
 

6535
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:08,590
that's where all of the computer vision
that was like working out of the box

6536
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:08,600
that was like working out of the box
 

6537
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,629
that was like working out of the box
instead of like in inside

6538
01:54:11,629 --> 01:54:11,639
instead of like in inside
 

6539
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:13,129
instead of like in inside
um but all the operating system

6540
01:54:13,129 --> 01:54:13,139
um but all the operating system
 

6541
01:54:13,139 --> 01:54:14,990
um but all the operating system
everything just copy pastes uh computer

6542
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:15,000
everything just copy pastes uh computer
 

6543
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,729
everything just copy pastes uh computer
vision mostly copy paste I mean you have

6544
01:54:16,729 --> 01:54:16,739
vision mostly copy paste I mean you have
 

6545
01:54:16,739 --> 01:54:17,870
vision mostly copy paste I mean you have
to retrain the neural Nets but the

6546
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:17,880
to retrain the neural Nets but the
 

6547
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:18,950
to retrain the neural Nets but the
approach and everything in data engine

6548
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:18,960
approach and everything in data engine
 

6549
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,870
approach and everything in data engine
and offline trackers and the way we go

6550
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
and offline trackers and the way we go
 

6551
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,370
and offline trackers and the way we go
about the occupancy tracker and so on

6552
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:22,380
about the occupancy tracker and so on
 

6553
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:24,050
about the occupancy tracker and so on
everything copy paste you just need to

6554
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:24,060
everything copy paste you just need to
 

6555
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:26,510
everything copy paste you just need to
retrain the neural Lots uh and then the

6556
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:26,520
retrain the neural Lots uh and then the
 

6557
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:27,890
retrain the neural Lots uh and then the
planning control of course has to change

6558
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:27,900
planning control of course has to change
 

6559
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:29,990
planning control of course has to change
quite a bit but there's a ton of copy

6560
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:30,000
quite a bit but there's a ton of copy
 

6561
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,729
quite a bit but there's a ton of copy
paste from what's happening at Tesla and

6562
01:54:31,729 --> 01:54:31,739
paste from what's happening at Tesla and
 

6563
01:54:31,739 --> 01:54:33,770
paste from what's happening at Tesla and
so if you were to if you were to go with

6564
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:33,780
so if you were to if you were to go with
 

6565
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:35,209
so if you were to if you were to go with
goal of like okay let's build a million

6566
01:54:35,209 --> 01:54:35,219
goal of like okay let's build a million
 

6567
01:54:35,219 --> 01:54:37,250
goal of like okay let's build a million
human robots and you're not Tesla that's

6568
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:37,260
human robots and you're not Tesla that's
 

6569
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:39,410
human robots and you're not Tesla that's
that's a lot to ask if you're a Tesla

6570
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:39,420
that's a lot to ask if you're a Tesla
 

6571
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:41,090
that's a lot to ask if you're a Tesla
it's actually like

6572
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:41,100
it's actually like
 

6573
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:43,370
it's actually like
it's not it's not that crazy and then

6574
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:43,380
it's not it's not that crazy and then
 

6575
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:45,229
it's not it's not that crazy and then
the the follow-up question is and how

6576
01:54:45,229 --> 01:54:45,239
the the follow-up question is and how
 

6577
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:46,609
the the follow-up question is and how
difficult just like we're driving how

6578
01:54:46,609 --> 01:54:46,619
difficult just like we're driving how
 

6579
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:49,189
difficult just like we're driving how
difficult is the manipulation task uh

6580
01:54:49,189 --> 01:54:49,199
difficult is the manipulation task uh
 

6581
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:50,930
difficult is the manipulation task uh
such that it can have an impact at scale

6582
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:50,940
such that it can have an impact at scale
 

6583
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:52,250
such that it can have an impact at scale
I think

6584
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:52,260
I think
 

6585
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:54,410
I think
depending on the context the really nice

6586
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:54,420
depending on the context the really nice
 

6587
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:58,189
depending on the context the really nice
thing about robotics is the um unless

6588
01:54:58,189 --> 01:54:58,199
thing about robotics is the um unless
 

6589
01:54:58,199 --> 01:54:59,750
thing about robotics is the um unless
you do a manufacturing that kind of

6590

for you same thing in Academia if you're
 

6745
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,310
for you same thing in Academia if you're
not careful there's a like a dynamical

6746
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:40,320
not careful there's a like a dynamical
 

6747
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:43,010
not careful there's a like a dynamical
system there if you if you think of in

6748
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:43,020
system there if you if you think of in
 

6749
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:44,810
system there if you if you think of in
silos and get jealous of somebody else

6750
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:44,820
silos and get jealous of somebody else
 

6751
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:47,930
silos and get jealous of somebody else
being successful that actually perhaps

6752
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:47,940
being successful that actually perhaps
 

6753
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:50,810
being successful that actually perhaps
counterintuitively uh leads the less

6754
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:50,820
counterintuitively uh leads the less
 

6755
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,550
counterintuitively uh leads the less
productivity of you as a community and

6756
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
productivity of you as a community and
 

6757
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,010
productivity of you as a community and
you individually I feel like if you keep

6758
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:55,020
you individually I feel like if you keep
 

6759
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:58,310
you individually I feel like if you keep
celebrating others that actually makes

6760
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:58,320
celebrating others that actually makes
 

6761
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,649
celebrating others that actually makes
you more successful yeah I think people

6762
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:00,659
you more successful yeah I think people
 

6763
01:58:00,659 --> 01:58:02,510
you more successful yeah I think people
haven't in depending on the industry

6764
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:02,520
haven't in depending on the industry
 

6765
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,550
haven't in depending on the industry
haven't quite learned that yet yeah some

6766
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:04,560
haven't quite learned that yet yeah some
 

6767
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,810
haven't quite learned that yet yeah some
people are also very negative and very

6768
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:05,820
people are also very negative and very
 

6769
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:07,310
people are also very negative and very
vocal so they're very prominently

6770
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:07,320
vocal so they're very prominently
 

6771
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:09,169
vocal so they're very prominently
featured but actually there's a ton of

6772
01:58:09,169 --> 01:58:09,179
featured but actually there's a ton of
 

6773
01:58:09,179 --> 01:58:11,030
featured but actually there's a ton of
people who are cheerleaders but they're

6774
01:58:11,030 --> 01:58:11,040
people who are cheerleaders but they're
 

6775
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,070
people who are cheerleaders but they're
silent cheerlead cheerleaders and uh

6776
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:13,080
silent cheerlead cheerleaders and uh
 

6777
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,470
silent cheerlead cheerleaders and uh
when you talk to people just in the

6778
01:58:15,470 --> 01:58:15,480
when you talk to people just in the
 

6779
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:16,790
when you talk to people just in the
world they will all tell you it's

6780
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:16,800
world they will all tell you it's
 

6781
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,109
world they will all tell you it's
amazing it's great especially like

6782
01:58:18,109 --> 01:58:18,119
amazing it's great especially like
 

6783
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:19,430
amazing it's great especially like
people who understand how difficult it

6784
01:58:19,430 --> 01:58:19,440
people who understand how difficult it
 

6785
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,810
people who understand how difficult it
is to get this stuff working like people

6786
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:20,820
is to get this stuff working like people
 

6787
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:22,189
is to get this stuff working like people
who have built products and makers

6788
01:58:22,189 --> 01:58:22,199
who have built products and makers
 

6789
01:58:22,199 --> 01:58:24,290
who have built products and makers
entrepreneur entrepreneurs like make

6790
01:58:24,290 --> 01:58:24,300
entrepreneur entrepreneurs like make
 

6791
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:26,750
entrepreneur entrepreneurs like make
making this work and changing something

6792
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:26,760
making this work and changing something
 

6793
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,270
making this work and changing something
is is incredibly hard those people are

6794
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:29,280
is is incredibly hard those people are
 

6795
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,850
is is incredibly hard those people are
more likely to cheerlead you well one of

6796
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:31,860
more likely to cheerlead you well one of
 

6797
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:33,350
more likely to cheerlead you well one of
the things that makes me sad is some

6798
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:33,360
the things that makes me sad is some
 

6799
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:35,390
the things that makes me sad is some
folks in the robotics Community uh don't

6800
01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:35,400
folks in the robotics Community uh don't
 

6801
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,709
folks in the robotics Community uh don't
do the cheerleading and they should

6802
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:36,719
do the cheerleading and they should
 

6803
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,689
do the cheerleading and they should
there's uh because they know how

6804
01:58:38,689 --> 01:58:38,699
there's uh because they know how
 

6805
01:58:38,699 --> 01:58:39,830
there's uh because they know how
difficult it is well they actually

6806
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:39,840
difficult it is well they actually
 

6807
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,330
difficult it is well they actually
sometimes don't know how difficult it is

6808
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:41,340
sometimes don't know how difficult it is
 

6809
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:43,729
sometimes don't know how difficult it is
to create a product at scale right they

6810
01:58:43,729 --> 01:58:43,739
to create a product at scale right they
 

6811
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:45,770
to create a product at scale right they
actually deploy in the real world a lot

6812
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:45,780
actually deploy in the real world a lot
 

6813
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:47,030
actually deploy in the real world a lot
of the

6814
01:58:47,030 --> 01:58:47,040
of the
 

6815
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:50,270
of the
development of robots and AI systems is

6816
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:50,280
development of robots and AI systems is
 

6817
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,870
development of robots and AI systems is
done on very specific small benchmarks

6818
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:53,880
done on very specific small benchmarks
 

6819
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,129
done on very specific small benchmarks
um and as opposed to real world

6820
01:58:55,129 --> 01:58:55,139
um and as opposed to real world
 

6821
01:58:55,139 --> 01:58:56,510
um and as opposed to real world
conditions yes

6822
01:58:56,510 --> 01:58:56,520
conditions yes
 

6823
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,550
conditions yes
yeah I think it's really hard to work on

6824
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:58,560
yeah I think it's really hard to work on
 

6825
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,709
yeah I think it's really hard to work on
robotics in academic setting or AI

6826
01:59:00,709 --> 01:59:00,719
robotics in academic setting or AI
 

6827
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:02,270
robotics in academic setting or AI
systems that apply in the real world you

6828
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:02,280
systems that apply in the real world you
 

6829
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:07,310
systems that apply in the real world you
you've criticized you uh flourished and

6830
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:07,320
you've criticized you uh flourished and
 

6831
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:09,770
you've criticized you uh flourished and
loved for time the imagenet the famed

6832
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:09,780
loved for time the imagenet the famed
 

6833
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:11,870
loved for time the imagenet the famed
image in that data set and I've recently

6834
01:59:11,870 --> 01:59:11,880
image in that data set and I've recently
 

6835
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:15,669
image in that data set and I've recently
had some words uh of criticism that the

6836
01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:15,679
had some words uh of criticism that the
 

6837
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,129
had some words uh of criticism that the
academic research ml Community gives a

6838
01:59:19,129 --> 01:59:19,139
academic research ml Community gives a
 

6839
01:59:19,139 --> 01:59:20,689
academic research ml Community gives a
little too much love still to the

6840
01:59:20,689 --> 01:59:20,699
little too much love still to the
 

6841
01:59:20,699 --> 01:59:22,850
little too much love still to the
imagenet or like those kinds of

6842
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:22,860
imagenet or like those kinds of
 

6843
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:24,830
imagenet or like those kinds of
benchmarks can you speak to the

6844
01:59:24,830 --> 01:59:24,840
benchmarks can you speak to the
 

6845
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:26,629
benchmarks can you speak to the
strengths and weaknesses of data sets

6846
01:59:26,629 --> 01:59:26,639
strengths and weaknesses of data sets
 

6847
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,229
strengths and weaknesses of data sets
used in machine learning research

6848
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:30,239
used in machine learning research
 

6849
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:31,790
used in machine learning research
actually I don't know that I recall the

6850
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:31,800
actually I don't know that I recall the
 

6851
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:34,550
actually I don't know that I recall the
specific instance where I was uh unhappy

6852
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:34,560
specific instance where I was uh unhappy
 

6853
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,530
specific instance where I was uh unhappy
or criticizing imagenet I think imagenet

6854
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:36,540
or criticizing imagenet I think imagenet
 

6855
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:39,410
or criticizing imagenet I think imagenet
has been extremely valuable uh it was

6856
01:59:39,410 --> 01:59:39,420
has been extremely valuable uh it was
 

6857
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:41,810
has been extremely valuable uh it was
basically a benchmark that allowed the

6858
01:59:41,810 --> 01:59:41,820
basically a benchmark that allowed the
 

6859
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:43,970
basically a benchmark that allowed the
Deep Learning Community to demonstrate

6860
01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:43,980
Deep Learning Community to demonstrate
 

6861
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:45,470
Deep Learning Community to demonstrate
that deep neural networks actually work

6862
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:45,480
that deep neural networks actually work
 

6863
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:48,649
that deep neural networks actually work
it was uh there's a massive value in

6864
01:59:48,649 --> 01:59:48,659
it was uh there's a massive value in
 

6865
01:59:48,659 --> 01:59:51,350
it was uh there's a massive value in
that um so I think imagenet was useful

6866
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:51,360
that um so I think imagenet was useful
 

6867
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,149
that um so I think imagenet was useful
but um basically it's become a bit of an

6868
01:59:53,149 --> 01:59:53,159
but um basically it's become a bit of an
 

6869
01:59:53,159 --> 01:59:55,490
but um basically it's become a bit of an
eminist at this point so eminist is like

6870
01:59:55,490 --> 01:59:55,500
eminist at this point so eminist is like
 

6871
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:58,010
eminist at this point so eminist is like
the 228 by 28 grayscale digits there's

6872
01:59:58,010 --> 01:59:58,020
the 228 by 28 grayscale digits there's
 

6873
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:59,390
the 228 by 28 grayscale digits there's
kind of a joke data set that everyone

6874
01:59:59,390 --> 01:59:59,400
kind of a joke data set that everyone
 

6875
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,669
kind of a joke data set that everyone
like just crushes if there's no Papers

6876
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:01,679
like just crushes if there's no Papers
 

6877
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:03,470
like just crushes if there's no Papers
written on MNS though right maybe they

6878
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:03,480
written on MNS though right maybe they
 

6879
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:05,750
written on MNS though right maybe they
should have strong papers like papers

6880
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
should have strong papers like papers
 

6881
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:08,149
should have strong papers like papers
that focus on like how do we learn with

6882
02:00:08,149 --> 02:00:08,159
that focus on like how do we learn with
 

6883
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:09,470
that focus on like how do we learn with
a small amount of data that kind of

6884
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:09,480
a small amount of data that kind of
 

6885
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:10,370
a small amount of data that kind of
stuff yeah I could see that being

6886
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:10,380
stuff yeah I could see that being
 

6887
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:11,870
stuff yeah I could see that being
helpful but not in sort of like Mainline

6888
02:00:11,870 --> 02:00:11,880
helpful but not in sort of like Mainline
 

6889
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,250
helpful but not in sort of like Mainline
computer vision research anymore of

6890
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:13,260
computer vision research anymore of
 

6891
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,229
computer vision research anymore of
course I think the way I've heard you

6892
02:00:15,229 --> 02:00:15,239
course I think the way I've heard you
 

6893
02:00:15,239 --> 02:00:16,669
course I think the way I've heard you
somewhere maybe I'm just imagining

6894
02:00:16,669 --> 02:00:16,679
somewhere maybe I'm just imagining
 

6895
02:00:16,679 --> 02:00:18,770
somewhere maybe I'm just imagining
things but I think you said like image

6896
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:18,780
things but I think you said like image
 

6897
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:20,149
things but I think you said like image
that was a huge contribution to the

6898
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:20,159
that was a huge contribution to the
 

6899
02:00:20,159 --> 02:00:21,589
that was a huge contribution to the

time to move past those kinds of well

6902
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:23,280
time to move past those kinds of well
 

6903
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:24,890
time to move past those kinds of well
image that has been crushed I mean you

6904
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:24,900
image that has been crushed I mean you
 

6905
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,930
image that has been crushed I mean you
know the error rates are

6906
02:00:26,930 --> 02:00:26,940
know the error rates are
 

6907
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:28,310
know the error rates are
uh

6908
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:28,320
uh
 

6909
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,070
uh
yeah we're getting like 90 accuracy in

6910
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:31,080
yeah we're getting like 90 accuracy in
 

6911
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:34,070
yeah we're getting like 90 accuracy in
in one thousand classification way uh

6912
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:34,080
in one thousand classification way uh
 

6913
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:36,430
in one thousand classification way uh
prediction and I've seen those images

6914
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:36,440
prediction and I've seen those images
 

6915
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:39,350
prediction and I've seen those images
and it's like really high that's really

6916
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:39,360
and it's like really high that's really
 

6917
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:40,669
and it's like really high that's really
that's really good if I remember

6918
02:00:40,669 --> 02:00:40,679
that's really good if I remember
 

6919
02:00:40,679 --> 02:00:43,129
that's really good if I remember
correctly the top five error rate is now

6920
02:00:43,129 --> 02:00:43,139
correctly the top five error rate is now
 

6921
02:00:43,139 --> 02:00:45,350
correctly the top five error rate is now
like one percent or something given your

6922
02:00:45,350 --> 02:00:45,360
like one percent or something given your
 

6923
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:47,149
like one percent or something given your

it that that could also need like a
 

6957
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,490
it that that could also need like a
viral like a leader right you know

somebody with popularity I mean that

6960
02:01:20,990 --> 02:01:21,000
somebody with popularity I mean that
 

6961
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,050
somebody with popularity I mean that
yeah why did image of that take off

6962
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:24,060
yeah why did image of that take off
 

6963
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:26,270
yeah why did image of that take off
is there or is it just the accident of

6964
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:26,280
is there or is it just the accident of

6968
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:30,360
difficult uh it was the right amount of
 

6969
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:32,750
difficult uh it was the right amount of
difficult and simple and uh interesting

6970
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:32,760
difficult and simple and uh interesting
 

6971
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,550
difficult and simple and uh interesting
enough it just kind of like it was it

6972
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,560
enough it just kind of like it was it
 

6973
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:36,050
enough it just kind of like it was it
was the right time for that kind of a

6974
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:36,060
was the right time for that kind of a
 

6975
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:37,430

02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:39,360
question from Reddit
 

6979
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:42,470
question from Reddit
uh what are your thoughts on the role

6980
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:42,480
uh what are your thoughts on the role
 

6981
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:44,390
uh what are your thoughts on the role
that synthetic data and game engines

6982
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,400
that synthetic data and game engines
 

6983
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,890
that synthetic data and game engines
will play in the future of neural net

6984
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:45,900
will play in the future of neural net
 

6985
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:48,169
will play in the future of neural net
model development

6986
02:01:48,169 --> 02:01:48,179
model development
 

6987
02:01:48,179 --> 02:01:49,310
model development
I think

6988
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:49,320
I think
 

6989
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:53,030
I think
um as neural Nets converge to humans

6990
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,040
um as neural Nets converge to humans
 

6991
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,669
um as neural Nets converge to humans
uh the value of simulation to neural

6992
02:01:55,669 --> 02:01:55,679
uh the value of simulation to neural
 

6993
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:56,870
uh the value of simulation to neural
Nets will be similar to value of

6994
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:56,880
Nets will be similar to value of
 

6995
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,510
Nets will be similar to value of
simulation to humans

6996
02:01:59,510 --> 02:01:59,520
simulation to humans
 

6997
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,270
simulation to humans
so people use simulation for uh

6998
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:02,280
so people use simulation for uh
 

6999
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,709
so people use simulation for uh
people use simulation because they can

7000
02:02:03,709 --> 02:02:03,719
people use simulation because they can
 

7001
02:02:03,719 --> 02:02:06,070
people use simulation because they can
learn something in that kind of a system

7002
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:06,080
learn something in that kind of a system
 

7003
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,030
learn something in that kind of a system
and without having to actually

7004
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:08,040
and without having to actually
 

7005
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:09,169
and without having to actually
experience it

7006
02:02:09,169 --> 02:02:09,179
experience it
 

7007
02:02:09,179 --> 02:02:10,550
experience it
um but are you referring to the

7008
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:10,560
um but are you referring to the
 

7009
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,129
um but are you referring to the
simulation we're doing our head no sorry

7010
02:02:13,129 --> 02:02:13,139
simulation we're doing our head no sorry
 

7011
02:02:13,139 --> 02:02:15,410
simulation we're doing our head no sorry
simulation I mean like video games or uh

7012
02:02:15,410 --> 02:02:15,420
simulation I mean like video games or uh
 

7013
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:18,350
simulation I mean like video games or uh
you know other forms of simulation for

7014
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:18,360
you know other forms of simulation for
 

7015
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:20,629
you know other forms of simulation for
various professionals well so let me

7016
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:20,639
various professionals well so let me
 

7017
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:22,310
various professionals well so let me
push back on that because maybe their

7018
02:02:22,310 --> 02:02:22,320
push back on that because maybe their
 

7019
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,490
push back on that because maybe their
simulation that we do in our heads like

7020
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:24,500
simulation that we do in our heads like
 

7021
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:27,229
simulation that we do in our heads like
simulate if I do this

7022
02:02:27,229 --> 02:02:27,239
simulate if I do this
 

7023
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:29,270
simulate if I do this
what do I think will happen Okay that's

7024
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,280
what do I think will happen Okay that's
 

7025
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,010
what do I think will happen Okay that's
like internal simulation yeah internal

7026
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:31,020
like internal simulation yeah internal
 

7027
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:32,209
like internal simulation yeah internal
isn't that what we're doing let's

7028
02:02:32,209 --> 02:02:32,219
isn't that what we're doing let's
 

7029
02:02:32,219 --> 02:02:33,890
isn't that what we're doing let's
assuming before we act oh yeah but

7030
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:33,900
assuming before we act oh yeah but
 

7031
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:35,209
assuming before we act oh yeah but
that's independent from like the use of

7032
02:02:35,209 --> 02:02:35,219
that's independent from like the use of
 

7033
02:02:35,219 --> 02:02:36,589
that's independent from like the use of
uh simulation in the sense of like

7034
02:02:36,589 --> 02:02:36,599
uh simulation in the sense of like
 

7035
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:38,629
uh simulation in the sense of like
computer games or using simulation for

7036
02:02:38,629 --> 02:02:38,639
computer games or using simulation for
 

7037
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:40,790
computer games or using simulation for
training set creation or you know is it

7038
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:40,800
training set creation or you know is it
 

7039
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,350
training set creation or you know is it
independent or is it just Loosely

7040
02:02:42,350 --> 02:02:42,360
independent or is it just Loosely
 

7041
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:44,510
independent or is it just Loosely
correlated because like uh

7042
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:44,520
correlated because like uh
 

7043
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:47,649
correlated because like uh
isn't that useful to do like um

7044
02:02:47,649 --> 02:02:47,659
isn't that useful to do like um
 

7045
02:02:47,659 --> 02:02:49,910
isn't that useful to do like um
counterfactual or like Edge case

7046
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:49,920
counterfactual or like Edge case
 

7047
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,950
counterfactual or like Edge case
simulation to like

7048
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:51,960
simulation to like
 

7049
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:53,570
simulation to like
you know what happens if there's a

7050
02:02:53,570 --> 02:02:53,580
you know what happens if there's a
 

7051
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:54,830
you know what happens if there's a
nuclear war

7052
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:54,840
nuclear war
 

7053
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,930
nuclear war
what happens if there's you know like

7054
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:56,940
what happens if there's you know like
 

7055
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,970
what happens if there's you know like
those kinds of things yeah that's a

7056
02:02:58,970 --> 02:02:58,980
those kinds of things yeah that's a
 

7057
02:02:58,980 --> 02:03:00,109
those kinds of things yeah that's a
different simulation from like Unreal

7058
02:03:00,109 --> 02:03:00,119
different simulation from like Unreal
 

7059
02:03:00,119 --> 02:03:01,970
different simulation from like Unreal
Engine that's how I interpreted the

7060
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:01,980
Engine that's how I interpreted the
 

7061
02:03:01,980 --> 02:03:03,770
Engine that's how I interpreted the
question uh so like

7062
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:03,780
question uh so like
 

7063
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:06,310
question uh so like
simulation of the average case

7064
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:06,320
simulation of the average case
 

7065
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:09,109
simulation of the average case
is that what's Unreal Engine what what

7066
02:03:09,109 --> 02:03:09,119
is that what's Unreal Engine what what
 

7067
02:03:09,119 --> 02:03:11,510
is that what's Unreal Engine what what
what what what do you mean by Unreal

7068
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:11,520
what what what do you mean by Unreal
 

7069
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,209
what what what do you mean by Unreal
Engine so

7070
02:03:13,209 --> 02:03:13,219
Engine so
 

7071
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:15,709
Engine so
simulating a world yeah physics of that

7072
02:03:15,709 --> 02:03:15,719
simulating a world yeah physics of that
 

7073
02:03:15,719 --> 02:03:17,209
simulating a world yeah physics of that
world

7074
02:03:17,209 --> 02:03:17,219
world
 

7075
02:03:17,219 --> 02:03:19,189
world
why is that different like because you

7076
02:03:19,189 --> 02:03:19,199
why is that different like because you
 

7077
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:22,189
why is that different like because you
also can add Behavior to that world and

7078
02:03:22,189 --> 02:03:22,199
also can add Behavior to that world and
 

7079
02:03:22,199 --> 02:03:23,689
also can add Behavior to that world and
you can try all kinds of stuff right

7080
02:03:23,689 --> 02:03:23,699
you can try all kinds of stuff right
 

7081
02:03:23,699 --> 02:03:26,149
you can try all kinds of stuff right
like you could throw all kinds of weird

7082
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:26,159
like you could throw all kinds of weird
 

7083
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:28,250
like you could throw all kinds of weird
things into it so Unreal Engine is not

7084
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:28,260
things into it so Unreal Engine is not
 

7085
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:30,589
things into it so Unreal Engine is not
just about similar I mean I guess it is

7086
02:03:30,589 --> 02:03:30,599
just about similar I mean I guess it is
 

7087
02:03:30,599 --> 02:03:32,149
just about similar I mean I guess it is
about submitting the physics of the

7088
02:03:32,149 --> 02:03:32,159
about submitting the physics of the
 

7089
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:34,370
about submitting the physics of the
world it's also doing something with

7090
02:03:34,370 --> 02:03:34,380
world it's also doing something with
 

7091
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:35,149
world it's also doing something with
that

7092
02:03:35,149 --> 02:03:35,159
that
 

7093
02:03:35,159 --> 02:03:37,189
that
yeah the graphics the physics and the

7094
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:37,199
yeah the graphics the physics and the
 

7095
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:38,689
yeah the graphics the physics and the
Agents that you put into the environment

7096
02:03:38,689 --> 02:03:38,699
Agents that you put into the environment
 

7097
02:03:38,699 --> 02:03:40,430
Agents that you put into the environment
and stuff like that yeah see I think you

7098
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:40,440
and stuff like that yeah see I think you
 

7099
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,109
and stuff like that yeah see I think you
I feel like you said that it's not that

7100
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:42,119
I feel like you said that it's not that
 

7101
02:03:42,119 --> 02:03:44,990
I feel like you said that it's not that
important I guess for the future of AI

7102
02:03:44,990 --> 02:03:45,000
important I guess for the future of AI
 

7103
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,270
important I guess for the future of AI
development is that is that correct to

7104
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,280
development is that is that correct to
 

7105
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,310
development is that is that correct to
interpret you that way uh I think

7106
02:03:49,310 --> 02:03:49,320
interpret you that way uh I think
 

7107
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:52,189
interpret you that way uh I think
humans use uh simulators

7108
02:03:52,189 --> 02:03:52,199
humans use uh simulators
 

7109
02:03:52,199 --> 02:03:54,589
humans use uh simulators
for um humans use simulators and they

7110
02:03:54,589 --> 02:03:54,599
for um humans use simulators and they
 

7111
02:03:54,599 --> 02:03:56,209
for um humans use simulators and they
find them useful and so computers will

7112
02:03:56,209 --> 02:03:56,219
find them useful and so computers will
 

7113
02:03:56,219 --> 02:03:58,910
find them useful and so computers will
use simulators and find them useful

7114
02:03:58,910 --> 02:03:58,920
use simulators and find them useful
 

7115
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,890
use simulators and find them useful
okay so you're saying it's not I I don't

7116
02:04:00,890 --> 02:04:00,900
okay so you're saying it's not I I don't
 

7117
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,629
okay so you're saying it's not I I don't
use simulators very often I play a video

7118
02:04:02,629 --> 02:04:02,639
use simulators very often I play a video
 

7119
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:04,189
use simulators very often I play a video
game every once in a while but I don't

7120
02:04:04,189 --> 02:04:04,199
game every once in a while but I don't
 

7121
02:04:04,199 --> 02:04:06,649
game every once in a while but I don't
think I derive any wisdom about my own

7122
02:04:06,649 --> 02:04:06,659
think I derive any wisdom about my own
 

7123
02:04:06,659 --> 02:04:08,810
think I derive any wisdom about my own
existence from from those video games

7124
02:04:08,810 --> 02:04:08,820
existence from from those video games
 

7125
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:11,689
existence from from those video games
it's a momentary escape from reality

7126
02:04:11,689 --> 02:04:11,699
it's a momentary escape from reality
 

7127
02:04:11,699 --> 02:04:14,750
it's a momentary escape from reality
versus a source of wisdom about reality

7128
02:04:14,750 --> 02:04:14,760
versus a source of wisdom about reality
 

7129
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:16,609
versus a source of wisdom about reality
so I don't so I think that's a very

7130
02:04:16,609 --> 02:04:16,619
so I don't so I think that's a very
 

7131
02:04:16,619 --> 02:04:18,649
so I don't so I think that's a very
polite way of saying simulation is not

7132
02:04:18,649 --> 02:04:18,659
polite way of saying simulation is not
 

7133
02:04:18,659 --> 02:04:20,030
polite way of saying simulation is not
that useful

7134
02:04:20,030 --> 02:04:20,040
that useful
 

7135
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:21,770
that useful
yeah maybe maybe not I don't see it as

7136
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:21,780
yeah maybe maybe not I don't see it as
 

7137
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:24,050
yeah maybe maybe not I don't see it as
like a fundamental really important part

7138
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:24,060
like a fundamental really important part
 

7139
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:26,030
like a fundamental really important part
of like training neural Nets currently

7140
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:26,040
of like training neural Nets currently
 

7141
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:28,790
of like training neural Nets currently
uh but I think uh as neural Nets become

7142
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:28,800
uh but I think uh as neural Nets become
 

7143
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,770
uh but I think uh as neural Nets become
more and more powerful I think you will

7144
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:30,780
more and more powerful I think you will
 

7145
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:33,350
more and more powerful I think you will
need fewer examples to train additional

7146
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,360
need fewer examples to train additional
 

7147
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:36,589
need fewer examples to train additional
behaviors and uh simulation is of course

7148
02:04:36,589 --> 02:04:36,599
behaviors and uh simulation is of course
 

7149
02:04:36,599 --> 02:04:38,149
behaviors and uh simulation is of course
there's a domain Gap in a simulation

7150
02:04:38,149 --> 02:04:38,159
there's a domain Gap in a simulation
 

7151
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:39,350
there's a domain Gap in a simulation
that's not the real world there's

7152
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:39,360
that's not the real world there's
 

7153
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:41,629
that's not the real world there's
slightly something different but uh with

7154
02:04:41,629 --> 02:04:41,639
slightly something different but uh with
 

7155
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:43,970
slightly something different but uh with
a powerful enough neural net uh you need

7156
02:04:43,970 --> 02:04:43,980
a powerful enough neural net uh you need
 

7157
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:45,709
a powerful enough neural net uh you need
um The Domain Gap can be bigger I think

7158
02:04:45,709 --> 02:04:45,719
um The Domain Gap can be bigger I think
 

7159
02:04:45,719 --> 02:04:46,970
um The Domain Gap can be bigger I think
because neural network will sort of

7160
02:04:46,970 --> 02:04:46,980
because neural network will sort of
 

7161
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:48,290
because neural network will sort of
understand that even though it's not the

7162
02:04:48,290 --> 02:04:48,300
understand that even though it's not the
 

7163
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:49,970
understand that even though it's not the
real world it like has all this high

7164
02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:49,980
real world it like has all this high
 

7165
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:51,290
real world it like has all this high
level structure that I'm supposed to be

7166
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:51,300
level structure that I'm supposed to be
 

7167
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,089
level structure that I'm supposed to be
able to learn from so then you'll know

7168
02:04:53,089 --> 02:04:53,099
able to learn from so then you'll know
 

7169
02:04:53,099 --> 02:04:54,169
able to learn from so then you'll know
we'll actually

7170
02:04:54,169 --> 02:04:54,179
we'll actually
 

7171
02:04:54,179 --> 02:04:57,169
we'll actually
yeah you'll be able to Leverage

7172
02:04:57,169 --> 02:04:57,179
yeah you'll be able to Leverage
 

7173
02:04:57,179 --> 02:05:00,290
yeah you'll be able to Leverage
the synthetic data better yes by closing

7174
02:05:00,290 --> 02:05:00,300
the synthetic data better yes by closing
 

7175
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:02,450
the synthetic data better yes by closing
the get better understanding in which

7176
02:05:02,450 --> 02:05:02,460
the get better understanding in which
 

7177
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:05,629
the get better understanding in which
ways this is not real data exactly

7178
02:05:05,629 --> 02:05:05,639
ways this is not real data exactly
 

7179
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:07,790
ways this is not real data exactly
uh right to do better questions next

7180
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:07,800
uh right to do better questions next
 

7181
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,649
uh right to do better questions next
time that was that was a question but

7182
02:05:09,649 --> 02:05:09,659
time that was that was a question but
 

7183
02:05:09,659 --> 02:05:14,149
time that was that was a question but
I'm just kidding all right um

7184
02:05:14,149 --> 02:05:14,159

 

7185
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:16,669

so is it possible do you think speaking

7186
02:05:16,669 --> 02:05:16,679
so is it possible do you think speaking
 

7187
02:05:16,679 --> 02:05:18,830
so is it possible do you think speaking
of feminist to construct neural Nets and

7188
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:18,840
of feminist to construct neural Nets and
 

7189
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:20,629
of feminist to construct neural Nets and
training processes that require very

7190
02:05:20,629 --> 02:05:20,639
training processes that require very
 

7191
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:22,629
training processes that require very
little data

7192
02:05:22,629 --> 02:05:22,639
little data
 

7193
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:25,010
little data
so we've been talking about huge data

7194
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:25,020
so we've been talking about huge data
 

7195
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,930
so we've been talking about huge data
sets like the internet for training I

7196
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:26,940
sets like the internet for training I
 

7197
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:28,370
sets like the internet for training I
mean one way to say that is like you

7198
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:28,380
mean one way to say that is like you
 

7199
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:30,229
mean one way to say that is like you
said like the querying itself is another

7200
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:30,239
said like the querying itself is another
 

7201
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:32,510
said like the querying itself is another
level of training I guess and that

7202
02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:32,520
level of training I guess and that
 

7203
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:35,390
level of training I guess and that
requires a little data yeah but do you

7204
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:35,400
requires a little data yeah but do you
 

7205
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:39,470
requires a little data yeah but do you
see any uh value in doing research and

7206
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:39,480
see any uh value in doing research and
 

7207
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:42,050
see any uh value in doing research and
kind of going down the direction of can

7208
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:42,060
kind of going down the direction of can
 

7209
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:44,510
kind of going down the direction of can
we use very little data to train to

7210
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:44,520
we use very little data to train to
 

7211
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,790
we use very little data to train to
construct a knowledge base 100 I just

7212
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:46,800
construct a knowledge base 100 I just
 

7213
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,169
construct a knowledge base 100 I just
think like at some point you need a

7214
02:05:48,169 --> 02:05:48,179
think like at some point you need a
 

7215
02:05:48,179 --> 02:05:49,669
think like at some point you need a
massive data set and then when you

7216
02:05:49,669 --> 02:05:49,679
massive data set and then when you
 

7217
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:51,410
massive data set and then when you
pre-train your massive neural nut and

7218
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:51,420
pre-train your massive neural nut and
 

7219
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,570
pre-train your massive neural nut and
get something that you know is like a

7220
02:05:53,570 --> 02:05:53,580
get something that you know is like a
 

7221
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:55,310
get something that you know is like a
GPT or something then you're able to be

7222
02:05:55,310 --> 02:05:55,320
GPT or something then you're able to be
 

7223
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:58,070
GPT or something then you're able to be
very efficient at training any arbitrary

7224
02:05:58,070 --> 02:05:58,080
very efficient at training any arbitrary
 

7225
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:01,370
very efficient at training any arbitrary
new task uh so a lot of these gpts you

7226
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:01,380
new task uh so a lot of these gpts you
 

7227
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:03,050
new task uh so a lot of these gpts you
know you can do tasks like sentiment

7228
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:03,060
know you can do tasks like sentiment
 

7229
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:05,209
know you can do tasks like sentiment
analysis or translation or so on just by

7230
02:06:05,209 --> 02:06:05,219
analysis or translation or so on just by
 

7231
02:06:05,219 --> 02:06:06,589
analysis or translation or so on just by
being prompted with very few examples

7232
02:06:06,589 --> 02:06:06,599
being prompted with very few examples
 

7233
02:06:06,599 --> 02:06:08,089
being prompted with very few examples
here's the kind of thing I want you to

7234
02:06:08,089 --> 02:06:08,099
here's the kind of thing I want you to
 

7235
02:06:08,099 --> 02:06:10,129
here's the kind of thing I want you to
do like here's an input sentence here's

7236
02:06:10,129 --> 02:06:10,139
do like here's an input sentence here's
 

7237
02:06:10,139 --> 02:06:11,570
do like here's an input sentence here's
the translation into German input

7238
02:06:11,570 --> 02:06:11,580
the translation into German input
 

7239
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,189
the translation into German input
sentence translation to German input

7240
02:06:13,189 --> 02:06:13,199
sentence translation to German input
 

7241
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:15,410
sentence translation to German input
sentence blank and the neural network

7242
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:15,420
sentence blank and the neural network
 

7243
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:16,729
sentence blank and the neural network
will complete the translation to German

7244
02:06:16,729 --> 02:06:16,739
will complete the translation to German
 

7245
02:06:16,739 --> 02:06:19,129
will complete the translation to German
just by looking at sort of the example

7246
02:06:19,129 --> 02:06:19,139
just by looking at sort of the example
 

7247
02:06:19,139 --> 02:06:20,689
just by looking at sort of the example
you've provided and so that's an example

7248
02:06:20,689 --> 02:06:20,699
you've provided and so that's an example
 

7249
02:06:20,699 --> 02:06:23,990
you've provided and so that's an example
of a very few shot uh learning in the

7250
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:24,000
of a very few shot uh learning in the
 

7251
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,310
of a very few shot uh learning in the
activations of the neural net instead of

7252
02:06:25,310 --> 02:06:25,320
activations of the neural net instead of
 

7253
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:26,930
activations of the neural net instead of
the weights of the neural land and so I

7254
02:06:26,930 --> 02:06:26,940
the weights of the neural land and so I
 

7255
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:27,950
the weights of the neural land and so I
think

7256
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:27,960
think
 

7257
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:30,350
think
basically uh just like humans neural

7258
02:06:30,350 --> 02:06:30,360
basically uh just like humans neural
 

7259
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,030
basically uh just like humans neural
Nets will become very data efficient at

7260
02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:32,040
Nets will become very data efficient at
 

7261
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:34,370
Nets will become very data efficient at
learning any other new task but at some

7262
02:06:34,370 --> 02:06:34,380
learning any other new task but at some
 

7263
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:35,870
learning any other new task but at some
point you need a massive data set to

7264
02:06:35,870 --> 02:06:35,880
point you need a massive data set to
 

7265
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,430
point you need a massive data set to
pre-train your network

7266
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:37,440
pre-train your network
 

7267
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:40,370
pre-train your network
to get that and probably we humans have

7268
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:40,380
to get that and probably we humans have
 

7269
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:42,410
to get that and probably we humans have
something like that do we do we have

7270
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:42,420
something like that do we do we have
 

7271
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:44,689
something like that do we do we have
something like that do we have a passive

7272
02:06:44,689 --> 02:06:44,699
something like that do we have a passive
 

7273
02:06:44,699 --> 02:06:46,870
something like that do we have a passive
in the background

7274
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:46,880
in the background
 

7275
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:50,750
in the background
background model constructing thing that

7276
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:50,760
background model constructing thing that
 

7277
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:52,010
background model constructing thing that
just runs all the time in a

7278
02:06:52,010 --> 02:06:52,020
just runs all the time in a
 

7279
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:53,750
just runs all the time in a
self-supervised way we're not conscious

7280
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:53,760
self-supervised way we're not conscious
 

7281
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:55,550
self-supervised way we're not conscious
of it I think humans definitely I mean

7282
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:55,560
of it I think humans definitely I mean
 

7283
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:57,589
of it I think humans definitely I mean
obviously we have uh we learn a lot

7284
02:06:57,589 --> 02:06:57,599
obviously we have uh we learn a lot
 

7285
02:06:57,599 --> 02:07:00,830
obviously we have uh we learn a lot
during during our life span but also we

7286
02:07:00,830 --> 02:07:00,840
during during our life span but also we
 

7287
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:02,689
during during our life span but also we
have a ton of Hardware that helps us

7288
02:07:02,689 --> 02:07:02,699
have a ton of Hardware that helps us
 

7289
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:04,790
have a ton of Hardware that helps us
initialize initialization coming from

7290
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:04,800
initialize initialization coming from
 

7291
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,950
initialize initialization coming from
sort of evolution and so I think that's

7292
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:06,960
sort of evolution and so I think that's
 

7293
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,109
sort of evolution and so I think that's
also a really big a big component a lot

7294
02:07:09,109 --> 02:07:09,119
also a really big a big component a lot
 

7295
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:10,430
also a really big a big component a lot
of people in the field I think they just

7296
02:07:10,430 --> 02:07:10,440
of people in the field I think they just
 

7297
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:11,870
of people in the field I think they just
talk about the amounts of like seconds

7298
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:11,880
talk about the amounts of like seconds
 

7299
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:14,089
talk about the amounts of like seconds
and the you know that a person has lived

7300
02:07:14,089 --> 02:07:14,099
and the you know that a person has lived
 

7301
02:07:14,099 --> 02:07:16,070
and the you know that a person has lived
pretending that this is a table arasa

7302
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:16,080
pretending that this is a table arasa
 

7303
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:17,870
pretending that this is a table arasa
sort of like a zero initialization of a

7304
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:17,880
sort of like a zero initialization of a
 

7305
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:20,390
sort of like a zero initialization of a
neural net and it's not like you can

7306
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:20,400
neural net and it's not like you can
 

7307
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,470
neural net and it's not like you can
look at a lot of animals like for

7308
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:21,480
look at a lot of animals like for
 

7309
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:24,589
look at a lot of animals like for
example zebras zebras get born and they

7310
02:07:24,589 --> 02:07:24,599
example zebras zebras get born and they
 

7311
02:07:24,599 --> 02:07:28,129
example zebras zebras get born and they
see and they can run there's zero train

7312
02:07:28,129 --> 02:07:28,139
see and they can run there's zero train
 

7313
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:29,990
see and they can run there's zero train
data in their lifespan they can just do

7314
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,000
data in their lifespan they can just do
 

7315
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,570
data in their lifespan they can just do
that so somehow I have no idea how

7316
02:07:32,570 --> 02:07:32,580
that so somehow I have no idea how
 

7317
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:34,310
that so somehow I have no idea how
Evolution has found a way to encode

02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:34,320
Evolution has found a way to encode
 

7319
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,870

02:07:35,870 --> 02:07:35,880
these algorithms and these neural net
 

7321
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:38,030

CGS and I have no idea how this works

7324
02:07:40,129 --> 02:07:40,139
CGS and I have no idea how this works
 

7325
02:07:40,139 --> 02:07:41,450
CGS and I have no idea how this works
but apparently it's possible because

7326
02:07:41,450 --> 02:07:41,460
but apparently it's possible because
 

7327
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:44,750
but apparently it's possible because
here's a proof by existence there's

7328
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:44,760
here's a proof by existence there's
 

7329
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:47,629
here's a proof by existence there's
something magical about going from a

7330
02:07:47,629 --> 02:07:47,639
something magical about going from a
 

7331
02:07:47,639 --> 02:07:49,729
something magical about going from a
single cell to an organism that is born

7332
02:07:49,729 --> 02:07:49,739
single cell to an organism that is born
 

7333
02:07:49,739 --> 02:07:52,070
single cell to an organism that is born
to the first few years of life I kind of

7334
02:07:52,070 --> 02:07:52,080
to the first few years of life I kind of
 

7335
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:53,570
to the first few years of life I kind of
like the idea that the reason we don't

7336
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:53,580
like the idea that the reason we don't
 

7337
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:55,669
like the idea that the reason we don't
remember anything about the first few

7338
02:07:55,669 --> 02:07:55,679
remember anything about the first few
 

7339
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:58,129
remember anything about the first few
years of our life is that it's a really

7340
02:07:58,129 --> 02:07:58,139
years of our life is that it's a really
 

7341
02:07:58,139 --> 02:08:00,350
years of our life is that it's a really
painful process like it's a very

7342
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:00,360
painful process like it's a very
 

7343
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:01,910
painful process like it's a very
difficult challenging

7344
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:01,920
difficult challenging
 

7345
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,270
difficult challenging
training process yeah like

7346
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:04,280
training process yeah like
 

7347
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:07,129
training process yeah like
intellectually like

7348
02:08:07,129 --> 02:08:07,139
intellectually like
 

7349
02:08:07,139 --> 02:08:10,070
intellectually like
and maybe yeah I mean I don't why don't

7350
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:10,080
and maybe yeah I mean I don't why don't
 

7351
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:12,350
and maybe yeah I mean I don't why don't
we remember any of that there might be

7352
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:12,360
we remember any of that there might be
 

7353
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:15,830
we remember any of that there might be
some crazy training going on and the

7354
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:15,840
some crazy training going on and the
 

7355
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:18,530
some crazy training going on and the
that maybe that's the background model

7356
02:08:18,530 --> 02:08:18,540
that maybe that's the background model
 

7357
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:23,390
that maybe that's the background model
training that uh is is very painful and

7358
02:08:23,390 --> 02:08:23,400
training that uh is is very painful and
 

7359
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:25,490
training that uh is is very painful and
so it's best for the system once it's

7360
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:25,500
so it's best for the system once it's
 

7361
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:26,870
so it's best for the system once it's
trained not to remember how it's

7362
02:08:26,870 --> 02:08:26,880
trained not to remember how it's
 

7363
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,669
trained not to remember how it's
constructed I think it's just like the

7364
02:08:28,669 --> 02:08:28,679
constructed I think it's just like the
 

7365
02:08:28,679 --> 02:08:30,589
constructed I think it's just like the
hardware for long-term memory is just

7366
02:08:30,589 --> 02:08:30,599
hardware for long-term memory is just
 

7367
02:08:30,599 --> 02:08:32,450
hardware for long-term memory is just
not fully developed sure I kind of feel

7368
02:08:32,450 --> 02:08:32,460
not fully developed sure I kind of feel
 

7369
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:35,510
not fully developed sure I kind of feel
like the first few years of uh of

7370
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:35,520
like the first few years of uh of
 

7371
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,070
like the first few years of uh of
infants is not actually like learning

7372
02:08:37,070 --> 02:08:37,080
infants is not actually like learning
 

7373
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:39,290
infants is not actually like learning
it's brain maturing yeah

7374
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:39,300
it's brain maturing yeah
 

7375
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:41,330
it's brain maturing yeah
um we're born premature

7376
02:08:41,330 --> 02:08:41,340
um we're born premature
 

7377
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:42,950
um we're born premature
um and there's a theory along those

7378
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:42,960
um and there's a theory along those
 

7379
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,330
um and there's a theory along those
lines because of the birth canal and the

7380
02:08:44,330 --> 02:08:44,340
lines because of the birth canal and the
 

7381
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:46,250
lines because of the birth canal and the
swelling of the brain and so we're born

7382
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:46,260
swelling of the brain and so we're born
 

7383
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:47,629
swelling of the brain and so we're born
premature and then the first few years

7384
02:08:47,629 --> 02:08:47,639
premature and then the first few years
 

7385
02:08:47,639 --> 02:08:49,970
premature and then the first few years
we're just the brains maturing and then

7386
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:49,980
we're just the brains maturing and then
 

7387
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:52,010
we're just the brains maturing and then
there's some learning eventually

7388
02:08:52,010 --> 02:08:52,020
there's some learning eventually
 

7389
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:52,669
there's some learning eventually
um

7390
02:08:52,669 --> 02:08:52,679
um
 

7391
02:08:52,679 --> 02:08:54,649
um
it's my current view on it what do you

7392
02:08:54,649 --> 02:08:54,659
it's my current view on it what do you
 

7393
02:08:54,659 --> 02:08:57,310
it's my current view on it what do you
think do you think neural Nets can have

7394
02:08:57,310 --> 02:08:57,320
think do you think neural Nets can have
 

7395
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:59,629
think do you think neural Nets can have
long-term memory

7396
02:08:59,629 --> 02:08:59,639
long-term memory
 

7397
02:08:59,639 --> 02:09:01,370
long-term memory
like that approach is something like

7398
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:01,380
like that approach is something like
 

7399
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:03,169
like that approach is something like
humans do you think you know do you

7400
02:09:03,169 --> 02:09:03,179
humans do you think you know do you
 

7401
02:09:03,179 --> 02:09:04,550
humans do you think you know do you
think there needs to be another meta

7402
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:04,560
think there needs to be another meta
 

7403
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:06,169
think there needs to be another meta
architecture on top of it to add

7404
02:09:06,169 --> 02:09:06,179
architecture on top of it to add
 

7405
02:09:06,179 --> 02:09:07,970
architecture on top of it to add
something like a knowledge base that

7406
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:07,980
something like a knowledge base that
 

7407
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:09,709
something like a knowledge base that
learns facts about the world and all

7408
02:09:09,709 --> 02:09:09,719
learns facts about the world and all
 

7409
02:09:09,719 --> 02:09:11,990
learns facts about the world and all
that kind of stuff yes but I don't know

7410
02:09:11,990 --> 02:09:12,000
that kind of stuff yes but I don't know
 

7411
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,910
that kind of stuff yes but I don't know
to what extent it will be explicitly

7412
02:09:13,910 --> 02:09:13,920
to what extent it will be explicitly
 

7413
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:15,290
to what extent it will be explicitly
constructed

7414
02:09:15,290 --> 02:09:15,300
constructed
 

7415
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:17,930
constructed
um it might take unintuitive forms where

7416
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:17,940
um it might take unintuitive forms where
 

7417
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:20,570
um it might take unintuitive forms where
you are telling the GPT like hey you

7418
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:20,580
you are telling the GPT like hey you
 

7419
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:22,550
you are telling the GPT like hey you
have a you have a declarative memory

7420
02:09:22,550 --> 02:09:22,560
have a you have a declarative memory
 

7421
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,290
have a you have a declarative memory
bank to which you can store and retrieve

7422
02:09:24,290 --> 02:09:24,300
bank to which you can store and retrieve
 

7423
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:26,270
bank to which you can store and retrieve
data from and whenever you encounter

7424
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:26,280
data from and whenever you encounter
 

7425
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:27,950
data from and whenever you encounter
some information that you find useful

7426
02:09:27,950 --> 02:09:27,960
some information that you find useful
 

7427
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:30,050
some information that you find useful
just save it to your memory bank and

7428
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:30,060
just save it to your memory bank and
 

7429
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:31,669
just save it to your memory bank and
here's an example of something you have

7430
02:09:31,669 --> 02:09:31,679
here's an example of something you have
 

7431
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:33,530
here's an example of something you have
retrieved and Heiser how you say it and

7432
02:09:33,530 --> 02:09:33,540
retrieved and Heiser how you say it and
 

7433
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:35,209
retrieved and Heiser how you say it and
here's how you load from it you just say

7434
02:09:35,209 --> 02:09:35,219
here's how you load from it you just say
 

7435
02:09:35,219 --> 02:09:38,209
here's how you load from it you just say
load whatever you teach it in text in

7436
02:09:38,209 --> 02:09:38,219
load whatever you teach it in text in
 

7437
02:09:38,219 --> 02:09:40,790
load whatever you teach it in text in
English and then it might learn to use a

7438
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:40,800
English and then it might learn to use a
 

7439
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,030
English and then it might learn to use a
memory bank from from that oh so so the

7440
02:09:44,030 --> 02:09:44,040
memory bank from from that oh so so the
 

7441
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:46,129
memory bank from from that oh so so the
neural net is the architecture for the

7442
02:09:46,129 --> 02:09:46,139
neural net is the architecture for the
 

7443
02:09:46,139 --> 02:09:48,470
neural net is the architecture for the
background model the the base thing and

7444
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,480
background model the the base thing and
 

7445
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:50,089
background model the the base thing and
then yeah everything else is just on top

7446
02:09:50,089 --> 02:09:50,099
then yeah everything else is just on top
 

7447
02:09:50,099 --> 02:09:51,589
then yeah everything else is just on top
of this it's not just a text right it's

7448
02:09:51,589 --> 02:09:51,599
of this it's not just a text right it's
 

7449
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:53,510
of this it's not just a text right it's
you're giving it gadgets and gizmos so

7450
02:09:53,510 --> 02:09:53,520
you're giving it gadgets and gizmos so
 

7451
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,430
you're giving it gadgets and gizmos so
uh you're teaching in some kind of a

7452
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:55,440
uh you're teaching in some kind of a
 

7453
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,229
uh you're teaching in some kind of a
special Language by which we can it can

7454
02:09:57,229 --> 02:09:57,239
special Language by which we can it can
 

7455
02:09:57,239 --> 02:09:58,790
special Language by which we can it can
save arbitrary information and retrieve

7456
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:58,800
save arbitrary information and retrieve
 

7457
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,770
save arbitrary information and retrieve
it at a later time and you're telling

7458
02:10:00,770 --> 02:10:00,780
it at a later time and you're telling
 

7459
02:10:00,780 --> 02:10:02,209
it at a later time and you're telling
about these special tokens and how to

7460
02:10:02,209 --> 02:10:02,219
about these special tokens and how to
 

7461
02:10:02,219 --> 02:10:04,370
about these special tokens and how to
arrange them to use these interfaces

7462
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:04,380
arrange them to use these interfaces
 

7463
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:06,169
arrange them to use these interfaces
it's like hey you can use a calculator

7464
02:10:06,169 --> 02:10:06,179
it's like hey you can use a calculator
 

7465
02:10:06,179 --> 02:10:08,930
it's like hey you can use a calculator
here's how you use it just do five three

7466
02:10:08,930 --> 02:10:08,940
here's how you use it just do five three
 

7467
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:11,450
here's how you use it just do five three
plus four one equals and when equals is

7468
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:11,460
plus four one equals and when equals is
 

7469
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:14,030
plus four one equals and when equals is
there uh a calculator will actually read

7470
02:10:14,030 --> 02:10:14,040
there uh a calculator will actually read
 

7471
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:15,109
there uh a calculator will actually read
out the answer and you don't have to

7472
02:10:15,109 --> 02:10:15,119
out the answer and you don't have to
 

7473
02:10:15,119 --> 02:10:17,030
out the answer and you don't have to
calculate it yourself and you just like

7474
02:10:17,030 --> 02:10:17,040
calculate it yourself and you just like
 

7475
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:18,169
calculate it yourself and you just like
tell it in English this might actually

7476
02:10:18,169 --> 02:10:18,179
tell it in English this might actually
 

7477
02:10:18,179 --> 02:10:21,470
tell it in English this might actually
work do you think in that sense gato is

7478
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:21,480
work do you think in that sense gato is
 

7479
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:23,149
work do you think in that sense gato is
interesting the the Deep Mind system

7480
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:23,159
interesting the the Deep Mind system
 

7481
02:10:23,159 --> 02:10:25,070
interesting the the Deep Mind system
that it's not just new language but

7482
02:10:25,070 --> 02:10:25,080
that it's not just new language but
 

7483
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:26,629
that it's not just new language but
actually throws it all

7484
02:10:26,629 --> 02:10:26,639
actually throws it all
 

7485
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:31,129
actually throws it all
uh in the same pile images actions all

7486
02:10:31,129 --> 02:10:31,139
uh in the same pile images actions all
 

7487
02:10:31,139 --> 02:10:32,930
uh in the same pile images actions all
that kind of stuff that's basically what

7488
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:32,940
that kind of stuff that's basically what
 

7489
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:34,970
that kind of stuff that's basically what
we're moving towards yeah I think so so

7490
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:34,980
we're moving towards yeah I think so so
 

7491
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:37,390
we're moving towards yeah I think so so
gato is uh is very much a kitchen sink

7492
02:10:37,390 --> 02:10:37,400
gato is uh is very much a kitchen sink
 

7493
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:39,890
gato is uh is very much a kitchen sink
approach to like

7494
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:39,900
approach to like
 

7495
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:41,930
approach to like
um reinforcement learning lots of

7496
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:41,940
um reinforcement learning lots of
 

7497
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:43,129
um reinforcement learning lots of
different environments with a single

7498
02:10:43,129 --> 02:10:43,139
different environments with a single
 

7499
02:10:43,139 --> 02:10:46,189
different environments with a single
fixed Transformer model right

7500
02:10:46,189 --> 02:10:46,199
fixed Transformer model right
 

7501
02:10:46,199 --> 02:10:48,050
fixed Transformer model right
um I think it's a very sort of early

7502
02:10:48,050 --> 02:10:48,060
um I think it's a very sort of early
 

7503
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:50,510
um I think it's a very sort of early
result in that in that realm but I think

7504
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:50,520
result in that in that realm but I think
 

7505
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:52,010
result in that in that realm but I think
uh yeah it's along the lines of what I

7506
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:52,020
uh yeah it's along the lines of what I
 

7507
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:53,209
uh yeah it's along the lines of what I
think things will eventually look like

7508
02:10:53,209 --> 02:10:53,219
think things will eventually look like
 

7509
02:10:53,219 --> 02:10:55,729
think things will eventually look like
right so this is the early days of a

7510
02:10:55,729 --> 02:10:55,739
right so this is the early days of a
 

7511
02:10:55,739 --> 02:10:56,990
right so this is the early days of a
system that eventually will look like

7512
02:10:56,990 --> 02:10:57,000
system that eventually will look like
 

7513
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,270
system that eventually will look like
this like from a rigid Rich sudden

7514
02:10:59,270 --> 02:10:59,280
this like from a rigid Rich sudden
 

7515
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,189
this like from a rigid Rich sudden
perspective yeah I'm not super huge fan

7516
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:01,199
perspective yeah I'm not super huge fan
 

7517
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:02,570
perspective yeah I'm not super huge fan
of I think all these interfaces that

7518
02:11:02,570 --> 02:11:02,580
of I think all these interfaces that
 

7519
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:04,850
of I think all these interfaces that
like look very different

7520
02:11:04,850 --> 02:11:04,860
like look very different
 

7521
02:11:04,860 --> 02:11:06,050
like look very different
um I would want everything to be

7522
02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:06,060
um I would want everything to be
 

7523
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:07,790
um I would want everything to be
normalized into the same API so for

7524
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:07,800
normalized into the same API so for
 

7525
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:09,709
normalized into the same API so for
example it's green pixels versus same

7526
02:11:09,709 --> 02:11:09,719
example it's green pixels versus same
 

7527
02:11:09,719 --> 02:11:11,209
example it's green pixels versus same
API instead of having like different

7528
02:11:11,209 --> 02:11:11,219
API instead of having like different
 

7529
02:11:11,219 --> 02:11:12,530
API instead of having like different
world environments at a very different

7530
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:12,540
world environments at a very different
 

7531
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:14,510
world environments at a very different
physics and Joint configurations and

7532
02:11:14,510 --> 02:11:14,520
physics and Joint configurations and
 

7533
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,010
physics and Joint configurations and
appearances and whatever and you're

7534
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:16,020
appearances and whatever and you're
 

7535
02:11:16,020 --> 02:11:17,450
appearances and whatever and you're
having some kind of special tokens for

7536
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:17,460
having some kind of special tokens for
 

7537
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:20,089
having some kind of special tokens for
different games that you can plug I'd

7538
02:11:20,089 --> 02:11:20,099
different games that you can plug I'd
 

7539
02:11:20,099 --> 02:11:21,470
different games that you can plug I'd
rather just normalize everything to a

7540
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:21,480
rather just normalize everything to a
 

7541
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:23,450
rather just normalize everything to a
single interface so it looks the same to

7542
02:11:23,450 --> 02:11:23,460
single interface so it looks the same to
 

7543
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:25,250
single interface so it looks the same to
the neural net if that makes sense so

7544
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:25,260
the neural net if that makes sense so
 

7545
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:27,169
the neural net if that makes sense so
it's all going to be pixel based pong in

7546
02:11:27,169 --> 02:11:27,179
it's all going to be pixel based pong in
 

7547
02:11:27,179 --> 02:11:30,250
it's all going to be pixel based pong in
the end I think so

7548
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:30,260

 

7549
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:34,010

okay uh let me ask you about your own

7550
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:34,020
okay uh let me ask you about your own
 

7551
02:11:34,020 --> 02:11:35,689
okay uh let me ask you about your own
personal life

7552
02:11:35,689 --> 02:11:35,699
personal life
 

7553
02:11:35,699 --> 02:11:37,189
personal life
a lot of people want to know you're one

7554
02:11:37,189 --> 02:11:37,199
a lot of people want to know you're one
 

7555
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:38,510
a lot of people want to know you're one
of the most productive and brilliant

7556
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:38,520
of the most productive and brilliant
 

7557
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:40,970
of the most productive and brilliant
people in the history of AI what is a

7558
02:11:40,970 --> 02:11:40,980
people in the history of AI what is a
 

7559
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:42,470
people in the history of AI what is a
productive day in the life of Andre

7560
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:42,480
productive day in the life of Andre
 

7561
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:44,330
productive day in the life of Andre
capathi look like

7562
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:44,340
capathi look like
 

7563
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:47,870
capathi look like
what time do you wake up because imagine

7564
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:47,880
what time do you wake up because imagine
 

7565
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:49,609
what time do you wake up because imagine
um some kind of dance between the

7566
02:11:49,609 --> 02:11:49,619
um some kind of dance between the
 

7567
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:51,229
um some kind of dance between the
average productive day and a perfect

7568
02:11:51,229 --> 02:11:51,239
average productive day and a perfect
 

7569
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:53,030
average productive day and a perfect
productive day so the perfect productive

7570
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:53,040
productive day so the perfect productive
 

7571
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,709
productive day so the perfect productive
day is the thing we strive

7572
02:11:54,709 --> 02:11:54,719
day is the thing we strive
 

7573
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:56,990
day is the thing we strive
towards in the average is kind of what

7574
02:11:56,990 --> 02:11:57,000
towards in the average is kind of what
 

7575
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,850
towards in the average is kind of what
it kind of converges to getting all the

7576
02:11:58,850 --> 02:11:58,860
it kind of converges to getting all the
 

7577
02:11:58,860 --> 02:12:01,490
it kind of converges to getting all the
mistakes and human eventualities and so

7578
02:12:01,490 --> 02:12:01,500
mistakes and human eventualities and so
 

7579
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:03,410
mistakes and human eventualities and so
on yeah so what times you wake up are

7580
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:03,420
on yeah so what times you wake up are
 

7581
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:05,149
on yeah so what times you wake up are
you morning person I'm not a morning

7582
02:12:05,149 --> 02:12:05,159
you morning person I'm not a morning
 

7583
02:12:05,159 --> 02:12:07,850
you morning person I'm not a morning
person I'm a night owl for sure I think

7584
02:12:07,850 --> 02:12:07,860
person I'm a night owl for sure I think
 

7585
02:12:07,860 --> 02:12:10,490
person I'm a night owl for sure I think
stable or not that's semi-stable like a

7586
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:10,500
stable or not that's semi-stable like a
 

7587
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:11,990
stable or not that's semi-stable like a
eight or nine or something like that

7588
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:12,000
eight or nine or something like that
 

7589
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,810
eight or nine or something like that
during my PhD it was even later I used

7590
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:14,820
during my PhD it was even later I used
 

7591
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:17,689
during my PhD it was even later I used
to go to sleep usually at 3am I think uh

7592
02:12:17,689 --> 02:12:17,699
to go to sleep usually at 3am I think uh
 

7593
02:12:17,699 --> 02:12:20,270
to go to sleep usually at 3am I think uh
the am hours are are precious and very

7594
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:20,280
the am hours are are precious and very
 

7595
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,350
the am hours are are precious and very
interesting time to work because

7596
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:21,360
interesting time to work because
 

7597
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:23,030
interesting time to work because
everyone is asleep

7598
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:23,040
everyone is asleep
 

7599
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:25,250
everyone is asleep
um at 8 AM or 7 A.M the east coast is

7600
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:25,260
um at 8 AM or 7 A.M the east coast is
 

7601
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:27,410
um at 8 AM or 7 A.M the east coast is
awake so there's already activity

7602
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:27,420
awake so there's already activity
 

7603
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:28,430
awake so there's already activity
there's already some text messages

7604
02:12:28,430 --> 02:12:28,440
there's already some text messages
 

7605
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:30,169
there's already some text messages
whatever there's stuff happening you can

7606
02:12:30,169 --> 02:12:30,179
whatever there's stuff happening you can
 

7607
02:12:30,179 --> 02:12:32,270
whatever there's stuff happening you can
go in like some news website and there's

7608
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:32,280
go in like some news website and there's
 

7609
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:34,550
go in like some news website and there's
stuff happening it's distracting uh at

7610
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:34,560
stuff happening it's distracting uh at
 

7611
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,950
stuff happening it's distracting uh at
3am everything is totally quiet and so

7612
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:36,960
3am everything is totally quiet and so
 

7613
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:38,089
3am everything is totally quiet and so
you're not going to be bothered and you

7614
02:12:38,089 --> 02:12:38,099
you're not going to be bothered and you
 

7615
02:12:38,099 --> 02:12:39,890
you're not going to be bothered and you
have solid chunks of time to do your

7616
02:12:39,890 --> 02:12:39,900
have solid chunks of time to do your
 

7617
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:41,390
have solid chunks of time to do your
work

7618
02:12:41,390 --> 02:12:41,400
work
 

7619
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:44,510
work
um so I like those periods Night Owl by

7620
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:44,520
um so I like those periods Night Owl by
 

7621
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:46,430
um so I like those periods Night Owl by
default and then I think like productive

7622
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:46,440
default and then I think like productive
 

7623
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:48,169
default and then I think like productive
time basically

7624
02:12:48,169 --> 02:12:48,179
time basically
 

7625
02:12:48,179 --> 02:12:49,669
time basically
um what I like to do is you need you

7626
02:12:49,669 --> 02:12:49,679
um what I like to do is you need you
 

7627
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:51,229
um what I like to do is you need you
need to like build some momentum on the

7628
02:12:51,229 --> 02:12:51,239
need to like build some momentum on the
 

7629
02:12:51,239 --> 02:12:54,470
need to like build some momentum on the
problem without too much distraction and

7630
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:54,480
problem without too much distraction and
 

7631
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:58,250
problem without too much distraction and
um you need to load your Ram uh your

7632
02:12:58,250 --> 02:12:58,260
um you need to load your Ram uh your
 

7633
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:00,229
um you need to load your Ram uh your
working memory with that problem

7634
02:13:00,229 --> 02:13:00,239
working memory with that problem
 

7635
02:13:00,239 --> 02:13:01,669
working memory with that problem
and then you need to be obsessed with it

7636
02:13:01,669 --> 02:13:01,679
and then you need to be obsessed with it
 

7637
02:13:01,679 --> 02:13:02,930
and then you need to be obsessed with it
when you're taking shower when you're

7638
02:13:02,930 --> 02:13:02,940
when you're taking shower when you're
 

7639
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:04,850
when you're taking shower when you're
falling asleep you need to be obsessed

7640
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:04,860
falling asleep you need to be obsessed
 

7641
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:06,109
falling asleep you need to be obsessed
with the problem and it's fully in your

7642
02:13:06,109 --> 02:13:06,119
with the problem and it's fully in your
 

7643
02:13:06,119 --> 02:13:08,030
with the problem and it's fully in your
memory and you're ready to wake up and

7644
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:08,040
memory and you're ready to wake up and
 

7645
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:09,649
memory and you're ready to wake up and
work on it right there so there's a

7646
02:13:09,649 --> 02:13:09,659
work on it right there so there's a
 

7647
02:13:09,659 --> 02:13:12,350
work on it right there so there's a
scale of uh is this in a scale temporal

7648
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:12,360
scale of uh is this in a scale temporal
 

7649
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:13,910
scale of uh is this in a scale temporal
scale of a single day or a couple of

7650
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:13,920
scale of a single day or a couple of
 

7651
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:16,129
scale of a single day or a couple of
days a week a month so I can't talk

7652
02:13:16,129 --> 02:13:16,139
days a week a month so I can't talk
 

7653
02:13:16,139 --> 02:13:17,450
days a week a month so I can't talk
about one day basically in isolation

7654
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:17,460
about one day basically in isolation
 

7655
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:19,850
about one day basically in isolation
because it's a whole process when I want

7656
02:13:19,850 --> 02:13:19,860
because it's a whole process when I want
 

7657
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:21,169
because it's a whole process when I want
to get when I want to get productive in

7658
02:13:21,169 --> 02:13:21,179
to get when I want to get productive in
 

7659
02:13:21,179 --> 02:13:23,629
to get when I want to get productive in
the problem I feel like I need a span of

7660
02:13:23,629 --> 02:13:23,639
the problem I feel like I need a span of
 

7661
02:13:23,639 --> 02:13:25,490
the problem I feel like I need a span of
a few days where I can really get in on

7662
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:25,500
a few days where I can really get in on
 

7663
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:27,229
a few days where I can really get in on
that problem and I don't want to be

7664
02:13:27,229 --> 02:13:27,239
that problem and I don't want to be
 

7665
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:29,510
that problem and I don't want to be
interrupted and I'm going to just uh be

7666
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:29,520
interrupted and I'm going to just uh be
 

7667
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:30,770
interrupted and I'm going to just uh be
completely obsessed with that problem

7668
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:30,780
completely obsessed with that problem
 

7669
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,510
completely obsessed with that problem
and that's where I do most of my good

7670
02:13:32,510 --> 02:13:32,520
and that's where I do most of my good
 

7671
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:33,950
and that's where I do most of my good
workouts

7672
02:13:33,950 --> 02:13:33,960
workouts
 

7673
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:35,810
workouts
you've done a bunch of cool like little

7674
02:13:35,810 --> 02:13:35,820
you've done a bunch of cool like little
 

7675
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,609
you've done a bunch of cool like little
projects in a very short amount of time

7676
02:13:37,609 --> 02:13:37,619
projects in a very short amount of time
 

7677
02:13:37,619 --> 02:13:39,530
projects in a very short amount of time
very quickly so that that requires you

7678
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:39,540
very quickly so that that requires you
 

7679
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:41,450
very quickly so that that requires you
just focusing on it yeah basically I

7680
02:13:41,450 --> 02:13:41,460
just focusing on it yeah basically I
 

7681
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:42,830
just focusing on it yeah basically I
need to load my working memory with the

7682
02:13:42,830 --> 02:13:42,840
need to load my working memory with the
 

7683
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:44,390
need to load my working memory with the
problem and I need to be productive

7684
02:13:44,390 --> 02:13:44,400
problem and I need to be productive
 

7685
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,950
problem and I need to be productive
because there's always like a huge fixed

7686
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:45,960
because there's always like a huge fixed
 

7687
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:49,250
because there's always like a huge fixed
cost to approaching any problem uh you

7688
02:13:49,250 --> 02:13:49,260
cost to approaching any problem uh you
 

7689
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:50,569
cost to approaching any problem uh you
know like I was struggling with this for

7690
02:13:50,569 --> 02:13:50,579
know like I was struggling with this for
 

7691
02:13:50,579 --> 02:13:52,310
know like I was struggling with this for
example at Tesla because I want to work

7692
02:13:52,310 --> 02:13:52,320
example at Tesla because I want to work
 

7693
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:54,169
example at Tesla because I want to work
on like small side projects but okay you

7694
02:13:54,169 --> 02:13:54,179
on like small side projects but okay you
 

7695
02:13:54,179 --> 02:13:55,669
on like small side projects but okay you
first need to figure out okay I need to

7696
02:13:55,669 --> 02:13:55,679
first need to figure out okay I need to
 

7697
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:57,290
first need to figure out okay I need to
SSH into my cluster I need to bring up a

7698
02:13:57,290 --> 02:13:57,300
SSH into my cluster I need to bring up a
 

7699
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:59,030
SSH into my cluster I need to bring up a
vs code editor so I can like work on

7700
02:13:59,030 --> 02:13:59,040
vs code editor so I can like work on
 

7701
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:01,609
vs code editor so I can like work on
this I need to I run into some stupid

7702
02:14:01,609 --> 02:14:01,619
this I need to I run into some stupid
 

7703
02:14:01,619 --> 02:14:03,530
this I need to I run into some stupid
error because of some reason like you're

error because of some reason like you're
 

7705
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:04,609
error because of some reason like you're
not at a point where you can be just

7706
02:14:04,609 --> 02:14:04,619
not at a point where you can be just
 

7707
02:14:04,619 --> 02:14:06,530
not at a point where you can be just
productive right away you are facing

7708
02:14:06,530 --> 02:14:06,540
productive right away you are facing
 

7709
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:10,189
productive right away you are facing
barriers and so it's about uh really

7710
02:14:10,189 --> 02:14:10,199
barriers and so it's about uh really
 

7711
02:14:10,199 --> 02:14:11,870
barriers and so it's about uh really
removing all that barrier and you're

7712
02:14:11,870 --> 02:14:11,880
removing all that barrier and you're
 

7713
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:13,430
removing all that barrier and you're
able to go into the problem and you have

7714
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:13,440
able to go into the problem and you have
 

7715
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:15,169
able to go into the problem and you have
the full problem loaded in your memory

7716
02:14:15,169 --> 02:14:15,179
the full problem loaded in your memory
 

7717
02:14:15,179 --> 02:14:17,390
the full problem loaded in your memory
and somehow avoiding distractions of all

7778
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:22,860
uh and also on your ability to deeply
 

7779
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:25,189
uh and also on your ability to deeply
understand the world because how there's

7780

understand the world because how there's
 

7781
02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:26,750
understand the world because how there's
a bunch of sources of information you're

7782
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:26,760
a bunch of sources of information you're
 

7783
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:28,490
a bunch of sources of information you're
not really focused on deeply integrating

7784
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:28,500
not really focused on deeply integrating
 

7785
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:30,169
not really focused on deeply integrating
yeah it's a little bit distracting or

7786
02:15:30,169 --> 02:15:30,179
yeah it's a little bit distracting or
 

7787
02:15:30,179 --> 02:15:32,689
yeah it's a little bit distracting or
yeah in terms of a perfectly productive

7788
02:15:32,689 --> 02:15:32,699
yeah in terms of a perfectly productive
 

7789
02:15:32,699 --> 02:15:36,410
yeah in terms of a perfectly productive
day for how long of a stretch of time

7790
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:36,420
day for how long of a stretch of time
 

7791
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:38,750
day for how long of a stretch of time
in one session do you try to work and

7792
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:38,760
in one session do you try to work and
 

7793
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:40,790
in one session do you try to work and
focus on a thing it's a couple hours is

7794
02:15:40,790 --> 02:15:40,800
focus on a thing it's a couple hours is
 

7795
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,129
focus on a thing it's a couple hours is
it one hours or 30 minutes is 10 minutes

7796
02:15:43,129 --> 02:15:43,139
it one hours or 30 minutes is 10 minutes
 

7797
02:15:43,139 --> 02:15:45,290
it one hours or 30 minutes is 10 minutes
I can probably go like a small few hours

7798
02:15:45,290 --> 02:15:45,300
I can probably go like a small few hours
 

7799
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:46,669
I can probably go like a small few hours
and then I need some breaks in between

7800
02:15:46,669 --> 02:15:46,679
and then I need some breaks in between
 

7801
02:15:46,679 --> 02:15:50,270
and then I need some breaks in between
for like food and stuff and uh

7802
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:50,280
for like food and stuff and uh
 

7803
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:52,010
for like food and stuff and uh
yeah but I think like uh it's still

7804
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:52,020
yeah but I think like uh it's still
 

7805
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:53,870
yeah but I think like uh it's still
really hard to accumulate hours I was

7806
02:15:53,870 --> 02:15:53,880
really hard to accumulate hours I was
 

7807
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:55,550
really hard to accumulate hours I was
using a Tracker that told me exactly how

7808
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:55,560
using a Tracker that told me exactly how
 

7809
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:56,870
using a Tracker that told me exactly how
much time I've spent coding any one day

7810
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:56,880
much time I've spent coding any one day
 

7811
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,970
much time I've spent coding any one day
and even on a very productive day I

7812
02:15:58,970 --> 02:15:58,980
and even on a very productive day I
 

7813
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:00,530
and even on a very productive day I
still spent only like six or eight hours

7814
02:16:00,530 --> 02:16:00,540
still spent only like six or eight hours
 

7815
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:02,629
still spent only like six or eight hours
yeah and it's just because there's so

7816
02:16:02,629 --> 02:16:02,639
yeah and it's just because there's so
 

7817
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:06,290
yeah and it's just because there's so
much padding commute talking to people

7818
02:16:06,290 --> 02:16:06,300
much padding commute talking to people
 

7819
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:08,930
much padding commute talking to people

7827
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,370
yourself as a human is very high and and
there seems to be a desire within the

society that creates that padding yeah
 

7833
02:16:23,639 --> 02:16:25,729
society that creates that padding yeah
because I yeah the most productive days

7834
02:16:25,729 --> 02:16:25,739

better in my mind but it just means I
 

7957
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:29,750
better in my mind but it just means I
prefer plant-based food and raw or

7958

prefer plant-based food and raw or
 

7959
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:32,570

isn't that weird it's really one of the
 

8031
02:19:44,939 --> 02:19:47,570
isn't that weird it's really one of the
many weird things about human biology is

8032
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:47,580
many weird things about human biology is
 

8033
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:49,730
many weird things about human biology is
figure something out it finds finds

8034
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:49,740
figure something out it finds finds
 

8035
02:19:49,740 --> 02:19:50,929

another source of energy or something

8036
02:19:50,929 --> 02:19:50,939
another source of energy or something
 

8037
02:19:50,939 --> 02:19:54,170
another source of energy or something
like that or uh relaxes the system I

8038
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:54,180
like that or uh relaxes the system I
 

8039
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:55,310
like that or uh relaxes the system I
don't know how yeah the body is like

8040

conversions in Tesla but any any company
 

8095
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,250
conversions in Tesla but any any company
is there a convergence towards the

8096
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:55,260
is there a convergence towards the
 

8097

schedule you're all awake at the same
time I mean I do try to create a routine

8108
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:07,380
time I mean I do try to create a routine
 

8109
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:09,290
time I mean I do try to create a routine
and I try to create a steady state in

8110
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:09,300
and I try to create a steady state in
 

8111
02:21:09,300 --> 02:21:11,870
and I try to create a steady state in
which I'm uh comfortable in uh so I have

8112
02:21:11,870 --> 02:21:11,880
which I'm uh comfortable in uh so I have
 

8113
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:13,610
which I'm uh comfortable in uh so I have
a morning routine I have a day routine I

8114
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:13,620
a morning routine I have a day routine I
 

8115
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:15,170
a morning routine I have a day routine I
try to keep things to do a steady state

8116
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:15,180
try to keep things to do a steady state
 

8117
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:18,290
try to keep things to do a steady state
and um things are predictable and then

8118
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:18,300
and um things are predictable and then
 

8119
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:19,730
and um things are predictable and then
you can sort of just like your body just

8120
02:21:19,730 --> 02:21:19,740
you can sort of just like your body just
 

8121
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:21,349
you can sort of just like your body just
sort of like sticks to that and if you

8122
02:21:21,349 --> 02:21:21,359
sort of like sticks to that and if you
 

8123
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:22,670
sort of like sticks to that and if you
try to stress that a little too much it

8124
02:21:22,670 --> 02:21:22,680
try to stress that a little too much it
 

8125
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:23,990
try to stress that a little too much it
will create uh you know when you're

8126
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:24,000
will create uh you know when you're

you know where you need to go yeah yeah
that's weird as humans with the habits

8134
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:32,880
that's weird as humans with the habits
 

8135
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:34,490
that's weird as humans with the habits
and stuff uh what are your thoughts on

work-life balance throughout a human

8138
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:36,720
work-life balance throughout a human
 

8139
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:38,570
work-life balance throughout a human
lifetime

8140
02:21:38,570 --> 02:21:38,580
lifetime
 

8141
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:41,330
lifetime
so the testing part was known for sort

8142
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:41,340
so the testing part was known for sort
 

8143
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:43,910
so the testing part was known for sort
of pushing people to their limits

8144
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:43,920
of pushing people to their limits
 

8145
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,710
of pushing people to their limits
in terms of what they're able to do in

8146
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:45,720
in terms of what they're able to do in
 

8147
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:48,710
in terms of what they're able to do in
terms of what they're uh trying to do in

8148
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:48,720
terms of what they're uh trying to do in
 

8149
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:50,150
terms of what they're uh trying to do in
terms of how much they work all that

8150
02:21:50,150 --> 02:21:50,160
terms of how much they work all that
 

8151
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,190
terms of how much they work all that
kind of stuff yeah I mean I will say

8152
02:21:52,190 --> 02:21:52,200
kind of stuff yeah I mean I will say
 

8153
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:54,770
kind of stuff yeah I mean I will say
teslaq is still too much uh bad rep for

8154
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:54,780
teslaq is still too much uh bad rep for
 

8155
02:21:54,780 --> 02:21:56,330
teslaq is still too much uh bad rep for
this because what's happening is Tesla

8156
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:56,340
this because what's happening is Tesla
 

8157
02:21:56,340 --> 02:21:58,910
this because what's happening is Tesla
is a it's a bursting environment uh so I

8158
02:21:58,910 --> 02:21:58,920
is a it's a bursting environment uh so I
 

8159
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,950
is a it's a bursting environment uh so I
would say the Baseline uh my only point

8160
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:00,960
would say the Baseline uh my only point
 

8161
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,450
would say the Baseline uh my only point
of reference is Google where I've

8162
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:02,460
of reference is Google where I've
 

8163
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:04,010
of reference is Google where I've
interned three times and I saw what it's

8164
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:04,020
interned three times and I saw what it's
 

8165
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:06,530
interned three times and I saw what it's
like inside Google and and deepmind

8166
02:22:06,530 --> 02:22:06,540
like inside Google and and deepmind
 

8167
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:08,210
like inside Google and and deepmind
um I would say the Baseline is higher

8168
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:08,220
um I would say the Baseline is higher
 

8169
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:09,950
um I would say the Baseline is higher
than that but then there's a punctuated

8170
02:22:09,950 --> 02:22:09,960
than that but then there's a punctuated
 

8171
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:11,570
than that but then there's a punctuated
equilibrium where once in a while

8172
02:22:11,570 --> 02:22:11,580
equilibrium where once in a while
 

8173
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:13,550
equilibrium where once in a while
there's a fire and uh someone like

8174
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:13,560
there's a fire and uh someone like
 

8175
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:15,650
there's a fire and uh someone like
people work really hard and so it's

8176
02:22:15,650 --> 02:22:15,660
people work really hard and so it's
 

8177
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:17,570
people work really hard and so it's
spiky and bursty and then all the

8178
02:22:17,570 --> 02:22:17,580
spiky and bursty and then all the
 

8179
02:22:17,580 --> 02:22:19,250
spiky and bursty and then all the
stories get collected about the bursts

8180
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:19,260
stories get collected about the bursts
 

8181
02:22:19,260 --> 02:22:20,809
stories get collected about the bursts
yeah and then it gives the appearance of

8182
02:22:20,809 --> 02:22:20,819
yeah and then it gives the appearance of
 

8183
02:22:20,819 --> 02:22:22,610
yeah and then it gives the appearance of
like total insanity but actually it's

8184
02:22:22,610 --> 02:22:22,620
like total insanity but actually it's
 

8185
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:24,889
like total insanity but actually it's
just a bit more intense environment and

8186
02:22:24,889 --> 02:22:24,899
just a bit more intense environment and
 

8187
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:27,710
just a bit more intense environment and
there are fires and Sprints and so I

8188
02:22:27,710 --> 02:22:27,720
there are fires and Sprints and so I
 

8189
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:29,570
there are fires and Sprints and so I
think uh you know definitely though I I

8190
02:22:29,570 --> 02:22:29,580
think uh you know definitely though I I
 

8191
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:30,590
think uh you know definitely though I I
would say

8192
02:22:30,590 --> 02:22:30,600
would say
 

8193
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:32,090
would say
um it's a more intense environment than

8194
02:22:32,090 --> 02:22:32,100
um it's a more intense environment than
 

8195
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:33,650
um it's a more intense environment than
something you would get but you in your

8196
02:22:33,650 --> 02:22:33,660
something you would get but you in your
 

8197

brilliant person like yourself
about finding a balance between work and

8208
02:22:46,610 --> 02:22:46,620
about finding a balance between work and
 

8209
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:49,790
about finding a balance between work and
life or is it such a thing not a good

8210
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:49,800
life or is it such a thing not a good
 

8211
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:51,650
life or is it such a thing not a good
thought experiment

8212
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:51,660
thought experiment
 

8213
02:22:51,660 --> 02:22:55,670
thought experiment
yeah I think I think balance is good but

8214
02:22:55,670 --> 02:22:55,680
yeah I think I think balance is good but
 

8215
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:57,410
yeah I think I think balance is good but
I also love to have Sprints that are out

8216
02:22:57,410 --> 02:22:57,420
I also love to have Sprints that are out
 

8217
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:59,630
I also love to have Sprints that are out
of distribution and that's what I think

8218
02:22:59,630 --> 02:22:59,640
of distribution and that's what I think
 

8219
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:02,809
of distribution and that's what I think
I've been pretty uh creative and

8220
02:23:02,809 --> 02:23:02,819
I've been pretty uh creative and
 

8221
02:23:02,819 --> 02:23:05,690
I've been pretty uh creative and
um as well Sprints out of distribution

8222
02:23:05,690 --> 02:23:05,700
um as well Sprints out of distribution
 

8223
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:07,969
um as well Sprints out of distribution
means that most of the time

8224
02:23:07,969 --> 02:23:07,979
means that most of the time
 

8225
02:23:07,979 --> 02:23:11,929
means that most of the time
you have a yeah quote-unquote balance I

familiar with is one large screen uh 27
inch

8292
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:18,600
inch
 

8293
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:20,630
inch
um and my laptop on the side with

8294
02:24:20,630 --> 02:24:20,640
um and my laptop on the side with
 

8295
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:22,790
um and my laptop on the side with
operating system I do Max that's my

8296
02:24:22,790 --> 02:24:22,800
operating system I do Max that's my
 

8297
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:25,969
operating system I do Max that's my
primary for all tasks I would say OS X

8298
02:24:25,969 --> 02:24:25,979
primary for all tasks I would say OS X
 

8299
02:24:25,979 --> 02:24:27,110
primary for all tasks I would say OS X
but when you're working on deep learning

8300
02:24:27,110 --> 02:24:27,120
but when you're working on deep learning
 

8301
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,849
but when you're working on deep learning
everything as Linux your SSH into a

8302
02:24:28,849 --> 02:24:28,859
everything as Linux your SSH into a
 

8303
02:24:28,859 --> 02:24:31,190
everything as Linux your SSH into a
cluster and you're working remotely but

8304
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:31,200
cluster and you're working remotely but
 

8305
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:32,510
cluster and you're working remotely but
what about the actual development like

8306
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:32,520
what about the actual development like
 

8307
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:35,090
what about the actual development like
that using the IDE yeah you would use uh

8308
02:24:35,090 --> 02:24:35,100
that using the IDE yeah you would use uh
 

8309
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:37,010
that using the IDE yeah you would use uh
I think a good way is you just run vs

8310
02:24:37,010 --> 02:24:37,020
I think a good way is you just run vs
 

8311
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:38,210
I think a good way is you just run vs
code

8312
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:38,220
code
 

8313
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:39,889
code
um my favorite editor right now on your

8314
02:24:39,889 --> 02:24:39,899
um my favorite editor right now on your
 

8315
02:24:39,899 --> 02:24:41,870
um my favorite editor right now on your
Mac but you are actually you have a

8316
02:24:41,870 --> 02:24:41,880
Mac but you are actually you have a
 

8317
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:44,090
Mac but you are actually you have a
remote folder through SSH

8318
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:44,100
remote folder through SSH
 

8319
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:45,950
remote folder through SSH
um so the actual files that you're

8320
02:24:45,950 --> 02:24:45,960
um so the actual files that you're
 

8321
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:47,030
um so the actual files that you're
manipulating are on the cluster

8322
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:47,040
manipulating are on the cluster
 

8323
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:50,389
manipulating are on the cluster
somewhere else so what's the best IDE

8324
02:24:50,389 --> 02:24:50,399
somewhere else so what's the best IDE
 

8325
02:24:50,399 --> 02:24:53,570
somewhere else so what's the best IDE
uh vs code what else do people so I use

8326
02:24:53,570 --> 02:24:53,580
uh vs code what else do people so I use
 

8327
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:58,190
uh vs code what else do people so I use
emacs still that's cool uh so it may be

8328
02:24:58,190 --> 02:24:58,200
emacs still that's cool uh so it may be
 

8329
02:24:58,200 --> 02:24:59,809
emacs still that's cool uh so it may be
cool I don't know if it's maximum

8330
02:24:59,809 --> 02:24:59,819
cool I don't know if it's maximum
 

8331
02:24:59,819 --> 02:25:01,429
cool I don't know if it's maximum
productivity

8332
02:25:01,429 --> 02:25:01,439
productivity
 

8333
02:25:01,439 --> 02:25:03,230
productivity
um so what what do you recommend in

8334
02:25:03,230 --> 02:25:03,240
um so what what do you recommend in
 

8335
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:05,330
um so what what do you recommend in
terms of editors you worked with a lot

8336
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:05,340
terms of editors you worked with a lot
 

8337
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:07,849
terms of editors you worked with a lot
of software Engineers editors for

8338
02:25:07,849 --> 02:25:07,859
of software Engineers editors for
 

8339
02:25:07,859 --> 02:25:10,250
of software Engineers editors for
python C plus plus machine learning

8340
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:10,260
python C plus plus machine learning
 

8341
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:12,349
python C plus plus machine learning
applications I think the current answer

8342
02:25:12,349 --> 02:25:12,359
applications I think the current answer
 

8343
02:25:12,359 --> 02:25:14,570
applications I think the current answer
is vs code currently I believe that's

8344
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:14,580
is vs code currently I believe that's
 

8345
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:15,590
is vs code currently I believe that's
the best

8346
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:15,600
the best
 

8347
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:17,750
the best
um IDE it's got a huge amount of

8348
02:25:17,750 --> 02:25:17,760
um IDE it's got a huge amount of
 

8349
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:20,330
um IDE it's got a huge amount of
extensions it has a GitHub co-pilot

8350
02:25:20,330 --> 02:25:20,340
extensions it has a GitHub co-pilot
 

8351
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:22,790
extensions it has a GitHub co-pilot
um uh integration which I think is very

8352
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:22,800
um uh integration which I think is very
 

8353
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,469
um uh integration which I think is very
valuable what do you think about the the

8354
02:25:24,469 --> 02:25:24,479
valuable what do you think about the the
 

8355
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:26,870
valuable what do you think about the the
co-pilot integration I was actually uh I

8356
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:26,880
co-pilot integration I was actually uh I
 

8357
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:28,429
co-pilot integration I was actually uh I
got to talk a bunch with Guido and

8358
02:25:28,429 --> 02:25:28,439
got to talk a bunch with Guido and
 

8359
02:25:28,439 --> 02:25:30,830
got to talk a bunch with Guido and
Rossum who's a creative Python and he

8360
02:25:30,830 --> 02:25:30,840
Rossum who's a creative Python and he
 

8361
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:33,830
Rossum who's a creative Python and he
loves Coppola he like he programs a lot

8362
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:33,840
loves Coppola he like he programs a lot
 

8363
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:36,469
loves Coppola he like he programs a lot
with it yeah uh do you

8364
02:25:36,469 --> 02:25:36,479
with it yeah uh do you
 

8365
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:38,929
with it yeah uh do you
yeah he's copilot I love it and uh it's

8366
02:25:38,929 --> 02:25:38,939
yeah he's copilot I love it and uh it's
 

8367
02:25:38,939 --> 02:25:40,910
yeah he's copilot I love it and uh it's
free for me but I would pay for it yeah

8368
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:40,920
free for me but I would pay for it yeah
 

8369
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:42,290
free for me but I would pay for it yeah
I think it's very good and the utility

8370
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:42,300
I think it's very good and the utility
 

8371
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:44,630
I think it's very good and the utility
that I found with it was is in is it I

8372
02:25:44,630 --> 02:25:44,640
that I found with it was is in is it I
 

8373
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:45,950
that I found with it was is in is it I
would say there is a learning curve and

8374
02:25:45,950 --> 02:25:45,960
would say there is a learning curve and
 

8375
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:48,469
would say there is a learning curve and
you need to figure out when it's helpful

8376
02:25:48,469 --> 02:25:48,479
you need to figure out when it's helpful
 

8377
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:50,090
you need to figure out when it's helpful
and when to pay attention to its outputs

8378
02:25:50,090 --> 02:25:50,100
and when to pay attention to its outputs
 

8379
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:51,230
and when to pay attention to its outputs
and when it's not going to be helpful

8380
02:25:51,230 --> 02:25:51,240
and when it's not going to be helpful
 

8381
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:52,670
and when it's not going to be helpful
where you should not pay attention to it

8382
02:25:52,670 --> 02:25:52,680
where you should not pay attention to it
 

8383
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:54,230
where you should not pay attention to it
because if you're just reading its

8384
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:54,240
because if you're just reading its
 

8385
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:55,490
because if you're just reading its
suggestions all the time it's not a good

8386
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:55,500
suggestions all the time it's not a good
 

8387
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:57,110
suggestions all the time it's not a good
way of interacting with it but I think I

8388
02:25:57,110 --> 02:25:57,120
way of interacting with it but I think I
 

8389
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:58,550
way of interacting with it but I think I
was able to sort of like mold myself to

8390
02:25:58,550 --> 02:25:58,560
was able to sort of like mold myself to
 

8391
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:00,349
was able to sort of like mold myself to
it I find it's very helpful number one

8392
02:26:00,349 --> 02:26:00,359
it I find it's very helpful number one
 

8393
02:26:00,359 --> 02:26:03,410
it I find it's very helpful number one
in copy paste and replace some parts so

8394
02:26:03,410 --> 02:26:03,420
in copy paste and replace some parts so
 

8395
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:05,690
in copy paste and replace some parts so
I don't um when the pattern is clear

8396
02:26:05,690 --> 02:26:05,700
I don't um when the pattern is clear
 

8397
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:06,950
I don't um when the pattern is clear
it's really good at completing the

8398
02:26:06,950 --> 02:26:06,960
it's really good at completing the
 

8399
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:09,050
it's really good at completing the
pattern and number two sometimes it

8400
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:09,060
pattern and number two sometimes it
 

8401
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:11,870
pattern and number two sometimes it
suggests apis that I'm not aware of so

8402
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:11,880
suggests apis that I'm not aware of so
 

8403
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:13,370
suggests apis that I'm not aware of so
it tells you about something that you

8404
02:26:13,370 --> 02:26:13,380
it tells you about something that you
 

8405
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:15,349
it tells you about something that you
didn't know so and that's an opportunity

8406
02:26:15,349 --> 02:26:15,359
didn't know so and that's an opportunity
 

8407
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:16,849
didn't know so and that's an opportunity
to discover and you it's an opportunity

8408
02:26:16,849 --> 02:26:16,859
to discover and you it's an opportunity
 

8409
02:26:16,859 --> 02:26:19,070
to discover and you it's an opportunity
to see I would never take copilot code

8410
02:26:19,070 --> 02:26:19,080
to see I would never take copilot code
 

8411
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,770
to see I would never take copilot code
AS given I almost always uh copy a copy

8412
02:26:21,770 --> 02:26:21,780
AS given I almost always uh copy a copy
 

8413
02:26:21,780 --> 02:26:23,090
AS given I almost always uh copy a copy
this into a Google Search and you see

8414
02:26:23,090 --> 02:26:23,100

what this function is doing and then
 

8417
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:25,790

02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:27,840
exactly what I need thank you copilot so
 

8421
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,450
exactly what I need thank you copilot so
you learned something so it's in part a

02:26:47,030 --> 02:26:47,040
copilot really I mean it's it's
 

8439
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:49,910
copilot really I mean it's it's
autopilot for programming right and

8440
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:49,920
autopilot for programming right and
 

8441
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:51,650
autopilot for programming right and
currently it's doing the link following

8442
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:51,660
currently it's doing the link following
 

8443
02:26:51,660 --> 02:26:53,210
currently it's doing the link following
which is like the simple copy paste and

8444
02:26:53,210 --> 02:26:53,220
which is like the simple copy paste and
 

8445
02:26:53,220 --> 02:26:55,370
which is like the simple copy paste and
sometimes suggest uh but over time it's

8446
02:26:55,370 --> 02:26:55,380
sometimes suggest uh but over time it's
 

8447
02:26:55,380 --> 02:26:56,990
sometimes suggest uh but over time it's
going to become more and more autonomous

8448
02:26:56,990 --> 02:26:57,000
going to become more and more autonomous
 

8449
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,450
going to become more and more autonomous
and so the same thing will play out in

8450
02:26:59,450 --> 02:26:59,460
and so the same thing will play out in
 

8451
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:01,130
and so the same thing will play out in
not just coding but actually across many

8452
02:27:01,130 --> 02:27:01,140
not just coding but actually across many
 

8453
02:27:01,140 --> 02:27:02,630
not just coding but actually across many
many different things probably but

8454
02:27:02,630 --> 02:27:02,640
many different things probably but
 

8455
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:04,309
many different things probably but
coding is an important one right like

8456
02:27:04,309 --> 02:27:04,319
coding is an important one right like
 

8457
02:27:04,319 --> 02:27:06,650
coding is an important one right like
writing programs yeah what how do you

8458
02:27:06,650 --> 02:27:06,660
writing programs yeah what how do you
 

8459
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:08,870
writing programs yeah what how do you
see the future of that developing uh the

8460
02:27:08,870 --> 02:27:08,880
see the future of that developing uh the
 

8461
02:27:08,880 --> 02:27:10,670
see the future of that developing uh the
program synthesis like being able to

8462
02:27:10,670 --> 02:27:10,680
program synthesis like being able to
 

8463
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:12,590
program synthesis like being able to
write programs that are more and more

8464
02:27:12,590 --> 02:27:12,600
write programs that are more and more
 

8465
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:15,050
write programs that are more and more
complicated because right now it's human

8466
02:27:15,050 --> 02:27:15,060
complicated because right now it's human
 

8467
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:18,590
complicated because right now it's human
supervised in interesting ways yes like

8468
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:18,600
supervised in interesting ways yes like
 

8469
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,450
supervised in interesting ways yes like
what it feels like the transition will

8470
02:27:20,450 --> 02:27:20,460
what it feels like the transition will
 

8471
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:21,830
what it feels like the transition will
be very painful

8472
02:27:21,830 --> 02:27:21,840
be very painful
 

8473
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:24,110
be very painful
my mental model for it is the same thing

8474
02:27:24,110 --> 02:27:24,120
my mental model for it is the same thing
 

8475
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:26,570
my mental model for it is the same thing
will happen as with the autopilot uh So

8476
02:27:26,570 --> 02:27:26,580
will happen as with the autopilot uh So
 

8477
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:28,010
will happen as with the autopilot uh So
currently it's doing link following is

8478
02:27:28,010 --> 02:27:28,020
currently it's doing link following is
 

8479
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:30,170
currently it's doing link following is
doing some simple stuff and eventually

8480
02:27:30,170 --> 02:27:30,180
doing some simple stuff and eventually
 

8481
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:31,910
doing some simple stuff and eventually
we'll be doing autonomy and people will

8482
02:27:31,910 --> 02:27:31,920
we'll be doing autonomy and people will
 

8483
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:33,469
we'll be doing autonomy and people will
have to intervene less and less and

8484
02:27:33,469 --> 02:27:33,479
have to intervene less and less and
 

8485
02:27:33,479 --> 02:27:35,809
have to intervene less and less and
there could be like you like testing

8486
02:27:35,809 --> 02:27:35,819
there could be like you like testing
 

8487
02:27:35,819 --> 02:27:37,250
there could be like you like testing
mechanisms

8488
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:37,260
mechanisms
 

8489
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:39,170
mechanisms
like if it writes a function and that

8490
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:39,180
like if it writes a function and that
 

8491
02:27:39,180 --> 02:27:41,630
like if it writes a function and that
function looks pretty damn correct but

8492
02:27:41,630 --> 02:27:41,640
function looks pretty damn correct but
 

8493
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:43,250
function looks pretty damn correct but
how do you know it's correct because

8494
02:27:43,250 --> 02:27:43,260
how do you know it's correct because
 

8495
02:27:43,260 --> 02:27:45,170
how do you know it's correct because
you're like getting lazier and lazier as

8496
02:27:45,170 --> 02:27:45,180
you're like getting lazier and lazier as
 

8497
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:47,090
you're like getting lazier and lazier as
a programmer like your ability to

8498
02:27:47,090 --> 02:27:47,100
a programmer like your ability to
 

8499
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:49,250
a programmer like your ability to
because like little bugs but I guess it

8500
02:27:49,250 --> 02:27:49,260
because like little bugs but I guess it
 

8501
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:51,410
because like little bugs but I guess it
won't make a little no it will it

8502
02:27:51,410 --> 02:27:51,420
won't make a little no it will it
 

8503
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:54,469
won't make a little no it will it
copilot will make uh off by one subtle

8504
02:27:54,469 --> 02:27:54,479
copilot will make uh off by one subtle
 

8505
02:27:54,479 --> 02:27:56,330
copilot will make uh off by one subtle
bugs it has done that to me but do you

8506
02:27:56,330 --> 02:27:56,340
bugs it has done that to me but do you
 

8507
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:58,730
bugs it has done that to me but do you
think future systems will or is it

8508
02:27:58,730 --> 02:27:58,740
think future systems will or is it
 

8509
02:27:58,740 --> 02:28:00,950
think future systems will or is it
really the off by one is actually a

8510
02:28:00,950 --> 02:28:00,960
really the off by one is actually a
 

8511
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:03,410
really the off by one is actually a
fundamental challenge of programming in

8512
02:28:03,410 --> 02:28:03,420
fundamental challenge of programming in
 

8513
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:05,030
fundamental challenge of programming in
that case it wasn't fundamental and I

8514
02:28:05,030 --> 02:28:05,040
that case it wasn't fundamental and I
 

8515
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:07,309
that case it wasn't fundamental and I
think things can improve but uh yeah I

8516
02:28:07,309 --> 02:28:07,319
think things can improve but uh yeah I
 

8517
02:28:07,319 --> 02:28:08,750
think things can improve but uh yeah I
think humans have to supervise I am

8518
02:28:08,750 --> 02:28:08,760
think humans have to supervise I am
 

8519
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:10,190
think humans have to supervise I am
nervous about people not supervising

8520
02:28:10,190 --> 02:28:10,200
nervous about people not supervising
 

8521
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:12,650
nervous about people not supervising
what comes out and what happens to for

8522
02:28:12,650 --> 02:28:12,660
what comes out and what happens to for
 

8523
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:14,270
what comes out and what happens to for
example the proliferation of bugs in all

8524
02:28:14,270 --> 02:28:14,280
example the proliferation of bugs in all
 

8525
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:16,250
example the proliferation of bugs in all
of our systems I'm nervous about that

8526
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:16,260
of our systems I'm nervous about that
 

8527
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:18,050
of our systems I'm nervous about that
but I think and there will probably be

8528
02:28:18,050 --> 02:28:18,060
but I think and there will probably be
 

8529
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:19,969
but I think and there will probably be
some other copilots for bug finding and

8530
02:28:19,969 --> 02:28:19,979
some other copilots for bug finding and
 

8531
02:28:19,979 --> 02:28:21,469
some other copilots for bug finding and
stuff like that at some point because

8532
02:28:21,469 --> 02:28:21,479
stuff like that at some point because
 

8533
02:28:21,479 --> 02:28:22,849
stuff like that at some point because
there will be like a lot more automation

8534
02:28:22,849 --> 02:28:22,859
there will be like a lot more automation
 

8535
02:28:22,859 --> 02:28:25,090
there will be like a lot more automation
for uh oh man

8536
02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:25,100
for uh oh man
 

8537
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:28,969
for uh oh man
so it's like a program a co-pilot that

8538
02:28:28,969 --> 02:28:28,979
so it's like a program a co-pilot that
 

8539
02:28:28,979 --> 02:28:31,849
so it's like a program a co-pilot that
generates a compiler for one that does a

8540
02:28:31,849 --> 02:28:31,859
generates a compiler for one that does a
 

8541
02:28:31,859 --> 02:28:34,910
generates a compiler for one that does a
linter yes one that does like a a type

8542
02:28:34,910 --> 02:28:34,920
linter yes one that does like a a type
 

8543
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:37,190
linter yes one that does like a a type
Checker yes

8544
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:37,200
Checker yes
 

8545
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:40,130
Checker yes
it's a committee of like a GPT sort of

8546
02:28:40,130 --> 02:28:40,140
it's a committee of like a GPT sort of
 

8547
02:28:40,140 --> 02:28:41,750
it's a committee of like a GPT sort of
like and then they'll be like a manager

8548
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:41,760
like and then they'll be like a manager
 

8549
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:43,550
like and then they'll be like a manager
for the committee yeah and then there'll

8550
02:28:43,550 --> 02:28:43,560
for the committee yeah and then there'll
 

8551
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:45,110
for the committee yeah and then there'll
be somebody that says a new version of

8552
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:45,120
be somebody that says a new version of
 

8553
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:46,910
be somebody that says a new version of
this is needed we need to regenerate it

8554
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:46,920
this is needed we need to regenerate it
 

8555
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:48,650
this is needed we need to regenerate it
yeah there were 10 gpts that were

8556
02:28:48,650 --> 02:28:48,660
yeah there were 10 gpts that were
 

8557
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:49,969
yeah there were 10 gpts that were
forwarded and gave 50 suggestions

8558
02:28:49,969 --> 02:28:49,979
forwarded and gave 50 suggestions
 

8559
02:28:49,979 --> 02:28:51,830
forwarded and gave 50 suggestions
another one looked at it and picked a

8560
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:51,840
another one looked at it and picked a
 

8561
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:54,110
another one looked at it and picked a
few that they like a bug one looked at

8562
02:28:54,110 --> 02:28:54,120
few that they like a bug one looked at
 

8563
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:55,309
few that they like a bug one looked at
it and it was like it's probably a bug

8564
02:28:55,309 --> 02:28:55,319
it and it was like it's probably a bug
 

8565
02:28:55,319 --> 02:28:57,110
it and it was like it's probably a bug
they got re-ranked by some other thing

8566
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:57,120
they got re-ranked by some other thing
 

8567
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:00,230
they got re-ranked by some other thing
and then a final Ensemble uh GPT comes

8568
02:29:00,230 --> 02:29:00,240
and then a final Ensemble uh GPT comes
 

8569
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:01,490
and then a final Ensemble uh GPT comes
in it's like okay given everything you

8570
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:01,500
in it's like okay given everything you
 

8571
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:02,570
in it's like okay given everything you
guys have told me this is probably the

8572
02:29:02,570 --> 02:29:02,580
guys have told me this is probably the
 

8573
02:29:02,580 --> 02:29:05,210
guys have told me this is probably the
next token you know the feeling is the

8574
02:29:05,210 --> 02:29:05,220
next token you know the feeling is the
 

8575
02:29:05,220 --> 02:29:06,530
next token you know the feeling is the
number of programmers in the world has

8576
02:29:06,530 --> 02:29:06,540
number of programmers in the world has
 

8577
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:08,450
number of programmers in the world has
been growing and growing very quickly do

8578
02:29:08,450 --> 02:29:08,460
been growing and growing very quickly do
 

8579
02:29:08,460 --> 02:29:09,770
been growing and growing very quickly do
you think it's possible that it'll

8580
02:29:09,770 --> 02:29:09,780
you think it's possible that it'll
 

8581
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:12,590
you think it's possible that it'll
actually level out and drop to like a

8582
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:12,600
actually level out and drop to like a
 

8583
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:14,389
actually level out and drop to like a
very low number with this kind of world

8584
02:29:14,389 --> 02:29:14,399
very low number with this kind of world
 

8585
02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:16,370
very low number with this kind of world
because then you'll be doing software

8586
02:29:16,370 --> 02:29:16,380
because then you'll be doing software
 

8587
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:19,250
because then you'll be doing software
2.0 programming

8588
02:29:19,250 --> 02:29:19,260
2.0 programming
 

8589
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:21,429
2.0 programming
um and you'll be doing this kind of

8590
02:29:21,429 --> 02:29:21,439
um and you'll be doing this kind of
 

8591
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:24,110
um and you'll be doing this kind of
generation of copilot type systems

8592
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:24,120
generation of copilot type systems
 

8593
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:26,389
generation of copilot type systems
programming but you won't be doing the

8594
02:29:26,389 --> 02:29:26,399
programming but you won't be doing the
 

8595
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:27,490
programming but you won't be doing the
old school

8596
02:29:27,490 --> 02:29:27,500
old school
 

8597
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:30,530
old school
software 1.0 program I don't currently

8598
02:29:30,530 --> 02:29:30,540
software 1.0 program I don't currently
 

8599
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:31,969
software 1.0 program I don't currently
think that they're just going to replace

8600
02:29:31,969 --> 02:29:31,979
think that they're just going to replace
 

8601
02:29:31,979 --> 02:29:33,650
think that they're just going to replace
human programmers

8602
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:33,660
human programmers
 

8603
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:34,610
human programmers
um

8604
02:29:34,610 --> 02:29:34,620
um
 

8605
02:29:34,620 --> 02:29:36,710
um
it's I'm so hesitant saying stuff like

8606
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:36,720
it's I'm so hesitant saying stuff like
 

8607
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,990
it's I'm so hesitant saying stuff like
this right because this is going to be

8608
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:39,000
this right because this is going to be
 

8609
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,030
this right because this is going to be
replaced in five years I don't know it's

8610
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:41,040
replaced in five years I don't know it's
 

8611
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:43,429
replaced in five years I don't know it's
going to show that like this is where we

8612
02:29:43,429 --> 02:29:43,439
going to show that like this is where we
 

8613
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:46,250
going to show that like this is where we
thought because I I agree with you but I

8614
02:29:46,250 --> 02:29:46,260
thought because I I agree with you but I
 

8615
02:29:46,260 --> 02:29:48,290
thought because I I agree with you but I
think we might be very surprised

8616
02:29:48,290 --> 02:29:48,300
think we might be very surprised
 

8617
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:51,710
think we might be very surprised
right like what are the next

8618
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:51,720
right like what are the next
 

8619
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:54,110
right like what are the next
I I what's your sense of what we're

8620
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:54,120
I I what's your sense of what we're
 

8621
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:55,730
I I what's your sense of what we're
seeing with language models like does it

8622
02:29:55,730 --> 02:29:55,740
seeing with language models like does it
 

8623
02:29:55,740 --> 02:29:57,710
seeing with language models like does it
feel like the beginning or the middle or

8624
02:29:57,710 --> 02:29:57,720
feel like the beginning or the middle or
 

8625
02:29:57,720 --> 02:29:59,870
feel like the beginning or the middle or
the end the beginning 100 I think the

8626
02:29:59,870 --> 02:29:59,880
the end the beginning 100 I think the
 

8627
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:01,490
the end the beginning 100 I think the
big question in my mind is for sure GPT

8628
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:01,500
big question in my mind is for sure GPT
 

8629
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:02,929
big question in my mind is for sure GPT
will be able to program quite well

8630
02:30:02,929 --> 02:30:02,939
will be able to program quite well
 

8631
02:30:02,939 --> 02:30:05,030
will be able to program quite well
competently and so on how do you steer

8632
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:05,040
competently and so on how do you steer
 

8633
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:06,889
competently and so on how do you steer
the system you still have to provide

8634
02:30:06,889 --> 02:30:06,899
the system you still have to provide
 

8635
02:30:06,899 --> 02:30:08,450
the system you still have to provide
some guidance to what you actually are

8636
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:08,460
some guidance to what you actually are
 

8637
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:10,550
some guidance to what you actually are
looking for and so how do you steer it

8638
02:30:10,550 --> 02:30:10,560
looking for and so how do you steer it
 

8639
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:12,830
looking for and so how do you steer it
and how do you say how do you talk to it

8640
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:12,840
and how do you say how do you talk to it
 

8641
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:14,570
and how do you say how do you talk to it
how do you um

8642
02:30:14,570 --> 02:30:14,580
how do you um
 

8643
02:30:14,580 --> 02:30:16,610
how do you um
audit it and verify that what is done is

8644
02:30:16,610 --> 02:30:16,620
audit it and verify that what is done is
 

8645
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:18,050
audit it and verify that what is done is
correct and how do you like work with

8646
02:30:18,050 --> 02:30:18,060
correct and how do you like work with
 

8647
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:20,210
correct and how do you like work with
this and it's as much not just an AI

8648
02:30:20,210 --> 02:30:20,220
this and it's as much not just an AI
 

8649
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:22,849
this and it's as much not just an AI
problem but a UI ux problem yeah

8650
02:30:22,849 --> 02:30:22,859
problem but a UI ux problem yeah
 

8651
02:30:22,859 --> 02:30:25,790
problem but a UI ux problem yeah
um so beautiful fertile ground for so

8652
02:30:25,790 --> 02:30:25,800
um so beautiful fertile ground for so
 

8653
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:28,309
um so beautiful fertile ground for so
much interesting work for vs code plus

8654
02:30:28,309 --> 02:30:28,319
much interesting work for vs code plus
 

8655
02:30:28,319 --> 02:30:30,290
much interesting work for vs code plus
plus where you're not just it's not just

8656
02:30:30,290 --> 02:30:30,300
plus where you're not just it's not just
 

8657
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:31,670
plus where you're not just it's not just
human programming anymore it's amazing

8658
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:31,680
human programming anymore it's amazing
 

8659
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,469
human programming anymore it's amazing
yeah so you're interacting with the

8660
02:30:33,469 --> 02:30:33,479
yeah so you're interacting with the
 

8661
02:30:33,479 --> 02:30:36,050
yeah so you're interacting with the
system so not just one prompt but it's

8662
02:30:36,050 --> 02:30:36,060
system so not just one prompt but it's
 

8663
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:37,849
system so not just one prompt but it's
iterative prompting yeah you're trying

8664
02:30:37,849 --> 02:30:37,859
iterative prompting yeah you're trying
 

8665
02:30:37,859 --> 02:30:39,530
iterative prompting yeah you're trying
to figure out having a conversation with

8666
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:39,540
to figure out having a conversation with
 

8667
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:41,270
to figure out having a conversation with
the system yeah that actually I mean to

8668
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:41,280
the system yeah that actually I mean to
 

8669
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,309
the system yeah that actually I mean to
me that's super exciting to have a

8670
02:30:43,309 --> 02:30:43,319
me that's super exciting to have a
 

8671
02:30:43,319 --> 02:30:44,690
me that's super exciting to have a
conversation with the program I'm

8672
02:30:44,690 --> 02:30:44,700
conversation with the program I'm
 

8673
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:45,710
conversation with the program I'm
writing

8674
02:30:45,710 --> 02:30:45,720
writing
 

8675
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:47,510
writing
yeah maybe at some point uh you're just

8676
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:47,520
yeah maybe at some point uh you're just
 

8677
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,070
yeah maybe at some point uh you're just
conversing with it it's like okay here's

8678
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:49,080
conversing with it it's like okay here's
 

8679
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:50,950
conversing with it it's like okay here's
what I want to do actually this variable

8680
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:50,960
what I want to do actually this variable
 

8681
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:53,030
what I want to do actually this variable
maybe it's not even that low level as

8682
02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:53,040
maybe it's not even that low level as
 

8683
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:56,030
maybe it's not even that low level as
variable but you can also Imagine like

8684
02:30:56,030 --> 02:30:56,040
variable but you can also Imagine like
 

8685
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:58,370
variable but you can also Imagine like
can you translate this to c plus and

8686
02:30:58,370 --> 02:30:58,380
can you translate this to c plus and
 

8687
02:30:58,380 --> 02:31:00,230
can you translate this to c plus and
back to python yeah that already kind of

8688
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:00,240
back to python yeah that already kind of
 

8689
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:02,030
back to python yeah that already kind of
existence no but just like doing it as

8690
02:31:02,030 --> 02:31:02,040
existence no but just like doing it as
 

8691
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:04,670
existence no but just like doing it as
part of the program experience like I

8692
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:04,680
part of the program experience like I
 

8693
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:06,110
part of the program experience like I
think I'd like to write this function in

8694
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:06,120
think I'd like to write this function in
 

8695
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:07,090
think I'd like to write this function in
C plus plus

8696
02:31:07,090 --> 02:31:07,100
C plus plus
 

8697
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:09,830
C plus plus
or or like you just keep changing for

8698
02:31:09,830 --> 02:31:09,840
or or like you just keep changing for
 

8699
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,630
or or like you just keep changing for
different uh different programs because

8700
02:31:11,630 --> 02:31:11,640
different uh different programs because
 

8701
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:14,210
different uh different programs because
they're different syntax maybe I want to

8702
02:31:14,210 --> 02:31:14,220
they're different syntax maybe I want to
 

8703
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:15,490
they're different syntax maybe I want to
convert this into a functional language

8704
02:31:15,490 --> 02:31:15,500
convert this into a functional language
 

8705
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:18,170
convert this into a functional language
and so like you get to become

8706
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:18,180
and so like you get to become
 

8707
02:31:18,180 --> 02:31:21,050
and so like you get to become
multilingual as a programmer and dance

8708
02:31:21,050 --> 02:31:21,060
multilingual as a programmer and dance
 

8709
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:23,389
multilingual as a programmer and dance
back and forth efficiently yeah I mean I

8710
02:31:23,389 --> 02:31:23,399
back and forth efficiently yeah I mean I
 

8711
02:31:23,399 --> 02:31:25,370
back and forth efficiently yeah I mean I
think the UI ux of it though is like

8712
02:31:25,370 --> 02:31:25,380
think the UI ux of it though is like
 

8713
02:31:25,380 --> 02:31:26,929
think the UI ux of it though is like
still very hard to think through because

8714
02:31:26,929 --> 02:31:26,939
still very hard to think through because
 

8715
02:31:26,939 --> 02:31:28,849
still very hard to think through because
it's not just about writing code on a

8716
02:31:28,849 --> 02:31:28,859
it's not just about writing code on a
 

8717
02:31:28,859 --> 02:31:30,710
it's not just about writing code on a
page you have an entire developer

8718
02:31:30,710 --> 02:31:30,720
page you have an entire developer
 

8719
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:32,210
page you have an entire developer
environment you have a bunch of hardware

8720
02:31:32,210 --> 02:31:32,220
environment you have a bunch of hardware
 

8721
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:34,190
environment you have a bunch of hardware
on it uh you have some environmental

8722
02:31:34,190 --> 02:31:34,200
on it uh you have some environmental
 

8723
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:35,630
on it uh you have some environmental
variables you have some scripts that are

8724
02:31:35,630 --> 02:31:35,640
variables you have some scripts that are
 

8725
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:37,070
variables you have some scripts that are
running in the Chrome job like there's a

8726
02:31:37,070 --> 02:31:37,080
running in the Chrome job like there's a
 

8727
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:38,809
running in the Chrome job like there's a
lot going on to like working with

8728
02:31:38,809 --> 02:31:38,819
lot going on to like working with
 

8729
02:31:38,819 --> 02:31:41,990
lot going on to like working with
computers and how do these uh systems

8730
02:31:41,990 --> 02:31:42,000
computers and how do these uh systems
 

8731
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,570
computers and how do these uh systems
set up environment flags and work across

8732
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:44,580
set up environment flags and work across
 

8733
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:45,830
set up environment flags and work across
multiple machines and set up screen

8734
02:31:45,830 --> 02:31:45,840
multiple machines and set up screen
 

8735
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:47,389
multiple machines and set up screen
sessions and automate different

8736
02:31:47,389 --> 02:31:47,399
sessions and automate different
 

8737
02:31:47,399 --> 02:31:49,429
sessions and automate different
processes like how all that works and

8738
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
processes like how all that works and
 

8739
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:51,230
processes like how all that works and
it's auditable by humans and so on is

8740
02:31:51,230 --> 02:31:51,240
it's auditable by humans and so on is
 

8741
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:52,790
it's auditable by humans and so on is
like massive question at the moment

8742
02:31:52,790 --> 02:31:52,800
like massive question at the moment
 

8743
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:55,790
like massive question at the moment
you've built archive sanity

8744
02:31:55,790 --> 02:31:55,800
you've built archive sanity
 

8745
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:58,309
you've built archive sanity
what is archive and what is the future

8746
02:31:58,309 --> 02:31:58,319
what is archive and what is the future
 

8747
02:31:58,319 --> 02:32:00,650
what is archive and what is the future
of academic research publishing that you

8748
02:32:00,650 --> 02:32:00,660
of academic research publishing that you
 

8749
02:32:00,660 --> 02:32:02,929
of academic research publishing that you
would like to see so archive is This

8750
02:32:02,929 --> 02:32:02,939
would like to see so archive is This
 

8751
02:32:02,939 --> 02:32:04,550
would like to see so archive is This
pre-print Server so if you have a paper

8752
02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:04,560
pre-print Server so if you have a paper
 

8753
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:06,770
pre-print Server so if you have a paper
you can submit it for publication to

8754
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:06,780
you can submit it for publication to
 

8755
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:08,270
you can submit it for publication to
journals or conferences and then wait

8756
02:32:08,270 --> 02:32:08,280
journals or conferences and then wait
 

8757
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:09,770
journals or conferences and then wait
six months and then maybe get a decision

8758
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:09,780
six months and then maybe get a decision
 

8759
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:11,809
six months and then maybe get a decision
pass or fail or you can just upload it

8760
02:32:11,809 --> 02:32:11,819
pass or fail or you can just upload it
 

8761
02:32:11,819 --> 02:32:13,070
pass or fail or you can just upload it
to Archive

8762
02:32:13,070 --> 02:32:13,080
to Archive
 

8763
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:15,110
to Archive
and then people can tweet about it three

8764
02:32:15,110 --> 02:32:15,120
and then people can tweet about it three
 

8765
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,030
and then people can tweet about it three
minutes later and then everyone sees it

8766
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:17,040
minutes later and then everyone sees it
 

8767
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:18,290
minutes later and then everyone sees it
everyone reads it and everyone can

8768
02:32:18,290 --> 02:32:18,300
everyone reads it and everyone can
 

8769
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:20,750
everyone reads it and everyone can
profit from it uh in their own ways you

8770
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:20,760
profit from it uh in their own ways you
 

8771
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:23,510
profit from it uh in their own ways you
can cite it and it has an official look

8772
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:23,520
can cite it and it has an official look
 

8773
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:25,969
can cite it and it has an official look
to it it feels like a pub like it feels

8774
02:32:25,969 --> 02:32:25,979
to it it feels like a pub like it feels
 

8775
02:32:25,979 --> 02:32:27,889
to it it feels like a pub like it feels
like a publication process yeah it feels

8776
02:32:27,889 --> 02:32:27,899
like a publication process yeah it feels
 

8777
02:32:27,899 --> 02:32:29,450
like a publication process yeah it feels
different than you if you just put in a

8778
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:29,460
different than you if you just put in a
 

8779
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:31,490
different than you if you just put in a
blog post oh yeah yeah I mean it's a

8780
02:32:31,490 --> 02:32:31,500
blog post oh yeah yeah I mean it's a
 

8781
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:33,710
blog post oh yeah yeah I mean it's a
paper and usually the the bar is higher

8782
02:32:33,710 --> 02:32:33,720
paper and usually the the bar is higher
 

8783
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:35,510
paper and usually the the bar is higher
for something that you would expect on

8784
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:35,520
for something that you would expect on
 

8785
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:37,130
for something that you would expect on
archive as opposed to and something you

8786
02:32:37,130 --> 02:32:37,140
archive as opposed to and something you
 

8787
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:38,570
archive as opposed to and something you
would see in a blog post well the

8788
02:32:38,570 --> 02:32:38,580
would see in a blog post well the
 

8789
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:41,330
would see in a blog post well the
culture created the bar because you

8790
02:32:41,330 --> 02:32:41,340
culture created the bar because you
 

8791
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:43,010
culture created the bar because you
could probably yes host a pretty crappy

8792
02:32:43,010 --> 02:32:43,020
could probably yes host a pretty crappy
 

8793
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:44,929
could probably yes host a pretty crappy
face for an archive

8794
02:32:44,929 --> 02:32:44,939
face for an archive
 

8795
02:32:44,939 --> 02:32:46,969
face for an archive
um so what's that make you feel like

8796
02:32:46,969 --> 02:32:46,979
um so what's that make you feel like
 

8797
02:32:46,979 --> 02:32:48,469
um so what's that make you feel like
what's that make you feel about peer

8798
02:32:48,469 --> 02:32:48,479
what's that make you feel about peer
 

8799
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:51,950
what's that make you feel about peer
review so rigorous peer review by two

8800
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:51,960
review so rigorous peer review by two
 

8801
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:55,250
review so rigorous peer review by two
three experts versus the peer review of

8802
02:32:55,250 --> 02:32:55,260
three experts versus the peer review of
 

8803
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:58,010
three experts versus the peer review of
the community right as it's written yeah

8804
02:32:58,010 --> 02:32:58,020
the community right as it's written yeah
 

8805
02:32:58,020 --> 02:32:59,750
the community right as it's written yeah
basically I think the community is very

8806
02:32:59,750 --> 02:32:59,760
basically I think the community is very
 

8807
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,730
basically I think the community is very
well able to peer review things very

8808
02:33:01,730 --> 02:33:01,740
well able to peer review things very
 

8809
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:04,969
well able to peer review things very
quickly on Twitter and I think maybe it

8810
02:33:04,969 --> 02:33:04,979
quickly on Twitter and I think maybe it
 

8811
02:33:04,979 --> 02:33:06,469
quickly on Twitter and I think maybe it
just has to do something with AI machine

8812
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:06,479
just has to do something with AI machine
 

8813
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,150
just has to do something with AI machine
learning field specifically though I

8814
02:33:08,150 --> 02:33:08,160
learning field specifically though I
 

8815
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:09,410
learning field specifically though I
feel like things are more easily

8816
02:33:09,410 --> 02:33:09,420
feel like things are more easily
 

8817
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:12,770
feel like things are more easily
auditable um and the verification is is

8818
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:12,780
auditable um and the verification is is
 

8819
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:14,690
auditable um and the verification is is
easier potentially than the verification

8820
02:33:14,690 --> 02:33:14,700
easier potentially than the verification
 

8821
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:16,730
easier potentially than the verification
somewhere else so it's kind of like um

8822
02:33:16,730 --> 02:33:16,740
somewhere else so it's kind of like um
 

8823
02:33:16,740 --> 02:33:18,650
somewhere else so it's kind of like um
you can think of these uh scientific

8824
02:33:18,650 --> 02:33:18,660
you can think of these uh scientific
 

8825
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:19,670
you can think of these uh scientific
Publications there's like little

8826
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:19,680
Publications there's like little
 

8827
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:21,050
Publications there's like little
blockchains where everyone's building on

8828
02:33:21,050 --> 02:33:21,060
blockchains where everyone's building on
 

8829
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:22,190
blockchains where everyone's building on
each other's work and setting each other

8830
02:33:22,190 --> 02:33:22,200
each other's work and setting each other
 

8831
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:24,170
each other's work and setting each other
and you sort of have ai which is kind of

8832
02:33:24,170 --> 02:33:24,180
and you sort of have ai which is kind of
 

8833
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:25,910
and you sort of have ai which is kind of
like this much faster and loose

8834
02:33:25,910 --> 02:33:25,920
like this much faster and loose
 

8835
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:29,270
like this much faster and loose
blockchain but then you have and any one

8836
02:33:29,270 --> 02:33:29,280
blockchain but then you have and any one
 

8837
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:31,670
blockchain but then you have and any one
individual entry is like very um very

8838
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:31,680
individual entry is like very um very
 

8839
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,050
individual entry is like very um very
cheap to make and then you have other

8840
02:33:33,050 --> 02:33:33,060
cheap to make and then you have other
 

8841
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:34,429
cheap to make and then you have other
fields where maybe that model doesn't

8842
02:33:34,429 --> 02:33:34,439
fields where maybe that model doesn't
 

8843
02:33:34,439 --> 02:33:36,050
fields where maybe that model doesn't
make as much sense

8844
02:33:36,050 --> 02:33:36,060
make as much sense
 

8845
02:33:36,060 --> 02:33:38,570
make as much sense
um and so I think in AI at least things

8846
02:33:38,570 --> 02:33:38,580
um and so I think in AI at least things
 

8847
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:40,550
um and so I think in AI at least things
are pretty easily verifiable and so

8848
02:33:40,550 --> 02:33:40,560
are pretty easily verifiable and so
 

8849
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:41,929
are pretty easily verifiable and so
that's why when people upload papers

8850
02:33:41,929 --> 02:33:41,939
that's why when people upload papers
 

8851
02:33:41,939 --> 02:33:43,250
that's why when people upload papers
they're a really good idea and so on

8852
02:33:43,250 --> 02:33:43,260
they're a really good idea and so on
 

8853
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:45,530
they're a really good idea and so on
people can try it out like the next day

8854
02:33:45,530 --> 02:33:45,540
people can try it out like the next day
 

8855
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:47,330
people can try it out like the next day
and they can be the final Arbiter

8856
02:33:47,330 --> 02:33:47,340
and they can be the final Arbiter
 

8857
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:48,710
and they can be the final Arbiter
whether it works or not on their problem

8858
02:33:48,710 --> 02:33:48,720
whether it works or not on their problem
 

8859
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:50,150
whether it works or not on their problem
and the whole thing just moves

8860
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,160
and the whole thing just moves
 

8861
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:52,250
and the whole thing just moves
significantly faster so I kind of feel

8862
02:33:52,250 --> 02:33:52,260
significantly faster so I kind of feel
 

8863
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:54,290
significantly faster so I kind of feel
like Academia still has a place sorry

8864
02:33:54,290 --> 02:33:54,300
like Academia still has a place sorry
 

8865
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:55,670
like Academia still has a place sorry
this like conference Journal process

8866
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:55,680
this like conference Journal process
 

8867
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:57,230
this like conference Journal process
still has a place but it's sort of like

8868
02:33:57,230 --> 02:33:57,240
still has a place but it's sort of like
 

8869
02:33:57,240 --> 02:34:00,410
still has a place but it's sort of like
an um it lags behind I think and it's a

8870
02:34:00,410 --> 02:34:00,420
an um it lags behind I think and it's a
 

8871
02:34:00,420 --> 02:34:02,510
an um it lags behind I think and it's a
bit more maybe higher quality process

8872
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:02,520
bit more maybe higher quality process
 

8873
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:05,330
bit more maybe higher quality process
but it's not sort of the place where you

8874
02:34:05,330 --> 02:34:05,340
but it's not sort of the place where you
 

8875
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:06,710
but it's not sort of the place where you
will discover Cutting Edge work anymore

8876
02:34:06,710 --> 02:34:06,720
will discover Cutting Edge work anymore
 

8877
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:08,450
will discover Cutting Edge work anymore
yeah it used to be the case when I was

8878
02:34:08,450 --> 02:34:08,460
yeah it used to be the case when I was
 

8879
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:09,650
yeah it used to be the case when I was
starting my PhD that you go to

8880
02:34:09,650 --> 02:34:09,660
starting my PhD that you go to
 

8881
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:11,450
starting my PhD that you go to
conferences and journals and you discuss

8882
02:34:11,450 --> 02:34:11,460
conferences and journals and you discuss
 

8883
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:13,130
conferences and journals and you discuss
all the latest research now when you go

8884
02:34:13,130 --> 02:34:13,140
all the latest research now when you go
 

8885
02:34:13,140 --> 02:34:14,870
all the latest research now when you go
to a conference or Journal like no one

8886
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:14,880
to a conference or Journal like no one
 

8887
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,190
to a conference or Journal like no one
discusses anything that's there because

8888
02:34:16,190 --> 02:34:16,200
discusses anything that's there because
 

8889
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:18,250
discusses anything that's there because
it's already like three generations ago

8890
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:18,260
it's already like three generations ago
 

8891
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:21,110
it's already like three generations ago
irrelevant yes which makes me sad about

8892
02:34:21,110 --> 02:34:21,120
irrelevant yes which makes me sad about
 

8893
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:23,030
irrelevant yes which makes me sad about
like deepmind for example where they

8894
02:34:23,030 --> 02:34:23,040
like deepmind for example where they
 

8895
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:25,070
like deepmind for example where they
they still they still publish in nature

8896
02:34:25,070 --> 02:34:25,080
they still they still publish in nature
 

8897
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:27,469
they still they still publish in nature
and these big prestigious I mean there's

8898
02:34:27,469 --> 02:34:27,479
and these big prestigious I mean there's
 

8899
02:34:27,479 --> 02:34:29,210
and these big prestigious I mean there's
still value as opposed to The Prestige

8900
02:34:29,210 --> 02:34:29,220
still value as opposed to The Prestige
 

8901
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:32,090
still value as opposed to The Prestige
that comes with these big venues but the

8902
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:32,100
that comes with these big venues but the
 

8903
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:34,250
that comes with these big venues but the
the result is that they they'll announce

8904
02:34:34,250 --> 02:34:34,260
the result is that they they'll announce
 

8905
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:36,290
the result is that they they'll announce
some breakthrough performance and it'll

8906
02:34:36,290 --> 02:34:36,300
some breakthrough performance and it'll
 

8907
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:39,110
some breakthrough performance and it'll
take like a year to actually publish the

8908
02:34:39,110 --> 02:34:39,120
take like a year to actually publish the
 

8909
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:42,889
take like a year to actually publish the
details I mean and those details in if

8910
02:34:42,889 --> 02:34:42,899
details I mean and those details in if
 

8911
02:34:42,899 --> 02:34:44,030
details I mean and those details in if
they were published immediately would

8912
02:34:44,030 --> 02:34:44,040
they were published immediately would
 

8913
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:46,190
they were published immediately would
Inspire the community to move in certain

8914
02:34:46,190 --> 02:34:46,200
Inspire the community to move in certain
 

8915
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:47,510
Inspire the community to move in certain
directions with that yeah it would speed

8916
02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:47,520
directions with that yeah it would speed
 

8917
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:48,950
directions with that yeah it would speed
up the rest of the community but I don't

8918
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:48,960
up the rest of the community but I don't
 

8919
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:50,690
up the rest of the community but I don't
know to what extent that's part of their

8920
02:34:50,690 --> 02:34:50,700
know to what extent that's part of their
 

8921
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:53,150
know to what extent that's part of their
objective function also that's true so

8922
02:34:53,150 --> 02:34:53,160
objective function also that's true so
 

8923
02:34:53,160 --> 02:34:54,650
objective function also that's true so
it's not just the prestige a little bit

8924
02:34:54,650 --> 02:34:54,660
it's not just the prestige a little bit

when you're at Stanford where like the

8944
02:35:18,830 --> 02:35:18,840
when you're at Stanford where like the
 

8945
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:21,410
when you're at Stanford where like the
world looks at you as the expert in AI

8946
02:35:21,410 --> 02:35:21,420
world looks at you as the expert in AI

learning when I was leaving Tesla after

8950
02:35:26,630 --> 02:35:26,640
learning when I was leaving Tesla after
 

8951
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:28,370
learning when I was leaving Tesla after
five years I spent a ton of time in

8952
02:35:28,370 --> 02:35:28,380
five years I spent a ton of time in
 

8953
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:30,950
five years I spent a ton of time in
meeting rooms uh and you know I would

8954
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:30,960
meeting rooms uh and you know I would
 

8955
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:32,510
meeting rooms uh and you know I would
read papers in the beginning when I

8956
02:35:32,510 --> 02:35:32,520
read papers in the beginning when I
 

8957
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:34,070
read papers in the beginning when I
joined Tesla I was writing code and then

8958
02:35:34,070 --> 02:35:34,080
joined Tesla I was writing code and then
 

8959
02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:35,510
joined Tesla I was writing code and then
I was writing lesson last code and I was

8960
02:35:35,510 --> 02:35:35,520
I was writing lesson last code and I was
 

8961
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:36,650
I was writing lesson last code and I was
reading code and then I was reading

8962
02:35:36,650 --> 02:35:36,660
reading code and then I was reading
 

8963
02:35:36,660 --> 02:35:38,510
reading code and then I was reading
lesson less code and so this is just a

8964
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:38,520
lesson less code and so this is just a
 

8965
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:40,010
lesson less code and so this is just a
natural progression that happens I think

8966
02:35:40,010 --> 02:35:40,020
natural progression that happens I think
 

8967
02:35:40,020 --> 02:35:42,050
natural progression that happens I think
and uh definitely I would say near the

8968
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:42,060
and uh definitely I would say near the
 

8969
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:43,550
and uh definitely I would say near the
tail end that's when it sort of like

8970
02:35:43,550 --> 02:35:43,560
tail end that's when it sort of like
 

8971
02:35:43,560 --> 02:35:44,690
tail end that's when it sort of like
starts to hit you a bit more that you're

8972
02:35:44,690 --> 02:35:44,700
starts to hit you a bit more that you're
 

8973
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:46,670
starts to hit you a bit more that you're
supposed to be an expert but actually

8974
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:46,680
supposed to be an expert but actually
 

8975
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:48,290
supposed to be an expert but actually
the source of Truth is the code that

8976
02:35:48,290 --> 02:35:48,300
the source of Truth is the code that
 

8977
02:35:48,300 --> 02:35:49,730
the source of Truth is the code that
people are writing the GitHub and the

8978
02:35:49,730 --> 02:35:49,740
people are writing the GitHub and the
 

8979
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:52,429
people are writing the GitHub and the
actual the actual code itself and you're

8980
02:35:52,429 --> 02:35:52,439
actual the actual code itself and you're
 

8981
02:35:52,439 --> 02:35:53,750
actual the actual code itself and you're
not as familiar with that as you used to

8982
02:35:53,750 --> 02:35:53,760
not as familiar with that as you used to
 

8983
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:56,030
not as familiar with that as you used to
be and so I would say maybe there's some

8984
02:35:56,030 --> 02:35:56,040
be and so I would say maybe there's some
 

8985
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:57,590
be and so I would say maybe there's some
like insecurity there yeah that's

8986
02:35:57,590 --> 02:35:57,600
like insecurity there yeah that's
 

8987
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:59,690
like insecurity there yeah that's
actually pretty profound that a lot of

8988
02:35:59,690 --> 02:35:59,700
actually pretty profound that a lot of
 

8989
02:35:59,700 --> 02:36:01,010
actually pretty profound that a lot of
the insecurity has to do with not

8990
02:36:01,010 --> 02:36:01,020
the insecurity has to do with not
 

8991
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:02,570
the insecurity has to do with not
writing the code in the computer science

8992
02:36:02,570 --> 02:36:02,580
writing the code in the computer science
 

8993
02:36:02,580 --> 02:36:04,370
writing the code in the computer science
space like that because that is the

8994
02:36:04,370 --> 02:36:04,380
space like that because that is the
 

8995
02:36:04,380 --> 02:36:06,530
space like that because that is the
truth that that right there code is the

8996
02:36:06,530 --> 02:36:06,540
truth that that right there code is the
 

8997
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:07,550
truth that that right there code is the
source of Truth the papers and

8998
02:36:07,550 --> 02:36:07,560
source of Truth the papers and
 

8999
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:09,110
source of Truth the papers and
everything else it's a high level

9000
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:09,120
everything else it's a high level
 

9001
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:11,929
everything else it's a high level
summary I don't uh yeah just a high

9002
02:36:11,929 --> 02:36:11,939
summary I don't uh yeah just a high
 

9003
02:36:11,939 --> 02:36:13,130
summary I don't uh yeah just a high
level summary but at the end of the day

9004
02:36:13,130 --> 02:36:13,140
level summary but at the end of the day
 

9005
02:36:13,140 --> 02:36:14,510
level summary but at the end of the day
you have to read code it's impossible to

9006
02:36:14,510 --> 02:36:14,520
you have to read code it's impossible to
 

9007
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:16,730
you have to read code it's impossible to
translate all that code into actual uh

9008
02:36:16,730 --> 02:36:16,740
translate all that code into actual uh
 

9009
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:19,790
translate all that code into actual uh
you know paper form uh so when when

9010
02:36:19,790 --> 02:36:19,800
you know paper form uh so when when
 

9011
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:20,929
you know paper form uh so when when
things come out especially when they

9012
02:36:20,929 --> 02:36:20,939
things come out especially when they
 

9013
02:36:20,939 --> 02:36:22,010
things come out especially when they
have a source code available that's my

9014
02:36:22,010 --> 02:36:22,020
have a source code available that's my
 

9015
02:36:22,020 --> 02:36:23,929
have a source code available that's my
favorite place to go so like I said

9016
02:36:23,929 --> 02:36:23,939
favorite place to go so like I said
 

9017
02:36:23,939 --> 02:36:25,790
favorite place to go so like I said
you're one of the greatest teachers of

9018
02:36:25,790 --> 02:36:25,800
you're one of the greatest teachers of
 

9019
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:30,410
you're one of the greatest teachers of
machine learning AI ever uh from cs231n

9020
02:36:30,410 --> 02:36:30,420
machine learning AI ever uh from cs231n
 

9021
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:33,290
machine learning AI ever uh from cs231n
to today what advice would you give to

9022
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:33,300
to today what advice would you give to
 

9023
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:34,790
to today what advice would you give to
beginners interested in getting into

9024
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:34,800
beginners interested in getting into
 

9025
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:36,290
beginners interested in getting into
machine learning

9026
02:36:36,290 --> 02:36:36,300
machine learning
 

9027
02:36:36,300 --> 02:36:40,130
machine learning
beginners are often focused on like what

9028
02:36:40,130 --> 02:36:40,140
beginners are often focused on like what
 

9029
02:36:40,140 --> 02:36:41,570
beginners are often focused on like what
to do and I think the focus should be

9030
02:36:41,570 --> 02:36:41,580
to do and I think the focus should be
 

9031
02:36:41,580 --> 02:36:44,210
to do and I think the focus should be
more like how much you do so I I'm kind

9032
02:36:44,210 --> 02:36:44,220
more like how much you do so I I'm kind
 

9033
02:36:44,220 --> 02:36:45,830
more like how much you do so I I'm kind
of like believer on a high level in this

9034
02:36:45,830 --> 02:36:45,840
of like believer on a high level in this
 

9035
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:48,050
of like believer on a high level in this
10 000 hours kind of concept where

9036
02:36:48,050 --> 02:36:48,060
10 000 hours kind of concept where
 

9037
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:49,550
10 000 hours kind of concept where
you just kind of have to just pick the

9038
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:49,560
you just kind of have to just pick the
 

9039
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:50,870
you just kind of have to just pick the
things where you can spend time and you

9040
02:36:50,870 --> 02:36:50,880
things where you can spend time and you
 

9041
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:52,190
things where you can spend time and you
you care about and you're interested in

9042
02:36:52,190 --> 02:36:52,200
you care about and you're interested in
 

9043
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:53,630
you care about and you're interested in
you literally have to put in 10 000

9044
02:36:53,630 --> 02:36:53,640
you literally have to put in 10 000
 

9045
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:54,830
you literally have to put in 10 000
hours of work

9046
02:36:54,830 --> 02:36:54,840
hours of work
 

9047
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:56,389
hours of work
um it doesn't even like matter as much

9048
02:36:56,389 --> 02:36:56,399
um it doesn't even like matter as much
 

9049
02:36:56,399 --> 02:36:58,010
um it doesn't even like matter as much
like where you put it and your you'll

9050
02:36:58,010 --> 02:36:58,020
like where you put it and your you'll
 

9051
02:36:58,020 --> 02:36:59,809
like where you put it and your you'll
iterate and you'll improve and you'll

9052
02:36:59,809 --> 02:36:59,819
iterate and you'll improve and you'll
 

9053
02:36:59,819 --> 02:37:01,190
iterate and you'll improve and you'll
waste some time I don't know if there's

9054
02:37:01,190 --> 02:37:01,200
waste some time I don't know if there's
 

9055
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:02,870
waste some time I don't know if there's
a better way you need to put in 10 000

9056
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:02,880
a better way you need to put in 10 000
 

9057
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:04,429
a better way you need to put in 10 000
hours but I think it's actually really

9058
02:37:04,429 --> 02:37:04,439
hours but I think it's actually really
 

9059
02:37:04,439 --> 02:37:05,450
hours but I think it's actually really
nice because I feel like there's some

9060
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:05,460
nice because I feel like there's some
 

9061
02:37:05,460 --> 02:37:07,969
nice because I feel like there's some
sense of determinism about uh being an

9062
02:37:07,969 --> 02:37:07,979
sense of determinism about uh being an
 

9063
02:37:07,979 --> 02:37:09,349
sense of determinism about uh being an
expert at a thing if you spend ten

9064
02:37:09,349 --> 02:37:09,359
expert at a thing if you spend ten
 

9065
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:11,570
expert at a thing if you spend ten
thousand hours you can literally pick an

9066
02:37:11,570 --> 02:37:11,580
thousand hours you can literally pick an
 

9067
02:37:11,580 --> 02:37:13,490
thousand hours you can literally pick an
arbitrary thing and I think if you spend

9068
02:37:13,490 --> 02:37:13,500
arbitrary thing and I think if you spend
 

9069
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:15,230
arbitrary thing and I think if you spend
ten thousand hours of deliberate effort

9070
02:37:15,230 --> 02:37:15,240
ten thousand hours of deliberate effort
 

9071
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:16,610
ten thousand hours of deliberate effort
and work you actually will become an

9072
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:16,620
and work you actually will become an
 

9073
02:37:16,620 --> 02:37:18,950
and work you actually will become an
expert at it and so I think it's kind of

9074
02:37:18,950 --> 02:37:18,960
expert at it and so I think it's kind of
 

9075
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:21,050
expert at it and so I think it's kind of
like a nice thought

9076
02:37:21,050 --> 02:37:21,060
like a nice thought
 

9077
02:37:21,060 --> 02:37:23,809
like a nice thought
um and so uh basically I would focus

9078
02:37:23,809 --> 02:37:23,819
um and so uh basically I would focus
 

9079
02:37:23,819 --> 02:37:25,490
um and so uh basically I would focus
more on like are you spending 10 000

9080
02:37:25,490 --> 02:37:25,500
more on like are you spending 10 000
 

9081
02:37:25,500 --> 02:37:28,070
more on like are you spending 10 000
hours that's what I focus on so and then

9082
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:28,080
hours that's what I focus on so and then
 

9083
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:29,690
hours that's what I focus on so and then
thinking about what kind of mechanisms

9084
02:37:29,690 --> 02:37:29,700
thinking about what kind of mechanisms
 

9085
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:31,849
thinking about what kind of mechanisms
maximize your likelihood of getting to

9086
02:37:31,849 --> 02:37:31,859
maximize your likelihood of getting to
 

9087
02:37:31,859 --> 02:37:34,130
maximize your likelihood of getting to
ten thousand dollars exactly which for

9088
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:34,140
ten thousand dollars exactly which for
 

9089
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:37,010
ten thousand dollars exactly which for
us silly humans means probably forming a

9090
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:37,020
us silly humans means probably forming a
 

9091
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:39,170
us silly humans means probably forming a
daily habit of like every single day

9092
02:37:39,170 --> 02:37:39,180
daily habit of like every single day
 

9093
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:40,849
daily habit of like every single day
actually doing the thing whatever helps

9094
02:37:40,849 --> 02:37:40,859
actually doing the thing whatever helps
 

9095
02:37:40,859 --> 02:37:42,650
actually doing the thing whatever helps
you so I do think to a large extent is a

9096
02:37:42,650 --> 02:37:42,660
you so I do think to a large extent is a
 

9097
02:37:42,660 --> 02:37:44,809
you so I do think to a large extent is a
psychological problem for yourself uh

9098
02:37:44,809 --> 02:37:44,819
psychological problem for yourself uh
 

9099
02:37:44,819 --> 02:37:46,550
psychological problem for yourself uh
one other thing that I help that I think

9100
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:46,560
one other thing that I help that I think
 

9101
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:48,290
one other thing that I help that I think
is helpful for the psychology of it is

9102
02:37:48,290 --> 02:37:48,300
is helpful for the psychology of it is
 

9103
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:49,849
is helpful for the psychology of it is
many times people compare themselves to

9104
02:37:49,849 --> 02:37:49,859
many times people compare themselves to
 

9105
02:37:49,859 --> 02:37:51,469
many times people compare themselves to
others in the area I think this is very

9106
02:37:51,469 --> 02:37:51,479
others in the area I think this is very
 

9107
02:37:51,479 --> 02:37:53,750
others in the area I think this is very
harmful only compare yourself to you

9108
02:37:53,750 --> 02:37:53,760
harmful only compare yourself to you
 

9109
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:55,849
harmful only compare yourself to you
from some time ago like say a year ago

9110
02:37:55,849 --> 02:37:55,859
from some time ago like say a year ago
 

9111
02:37:55,859 --> 02:37:58,309
from some time ago like say a year ago
are you better than you year ago this is

9112
02:37:58,309 --> 02:37:58,319
are you better than you year ago this is
 

9113
02:37:58,319 --> 02:37:59,929
are you better than you year ago this is
the only way to think

9114
02:37:59,929 --> 02:37:59,939
the only way to think
 

9115
02:37:59,939 --> 02:38:01,670
the only way to think
um and I think this then you can see

9116
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:01,680
um and I think this then you can see
 

9117
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:03,110
um and I think this then you can see
your progress and it's very motivating

9118
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:03,120
your progress and it's very motivating
 

9119
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:05,870
your progress and it's very motivating
that's so interesting that focus on the

9120
02:38:05,870 --> 02:38:05,880
that's so interesting that focus on the
 

9121
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:08,150
that's so interesting that focus on the
quantity of ours because I think a lot

9122
02:38:08,150 --> 02:38:08,160
quantity of ours because I think a lot
 

9123
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:10,309
quantity of ours because I think a lot
of people uh in the beginner stage but

9124
02:38:10,309 --> 02:38:10,319
of people uh in the beginner stage but
 

9125
02:38:10,319 --> 02:38:12,950
of people uh in the beginner stage but
actually throughout get paralyzed

9126
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:12,960
actually throughout get paralyzed
 

9127
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:17,090
actually throughout get paralyzed
uh by uh the choice like which one do I

9128
02:38:17,090 --> 02:38:17,100
uh by uh the choice like which one do I
 

9129
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:19,550
uh by uh the choice like which one do I
pick this path or this path yeah like

9130
02:38:19,550 --> 02:38:19,560
pick this path or this path yeah like
 

9131
02:38:19,560 --> 02:38:21,469
pick this path or this path yeah like
they'll literally get paralyzed by like

9132
02:38:21,469 --> 02:38:21,479
they'll literally get paralyzed by like
 

9133
02:38:21,479 --> 02:38:23,270
they'll literally get paralyzed by like
which ID to use well they're worried

9134
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:23,280
which ID to use well they're worried
 

9135
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:24,530
which ID to use well they're worried
yeah they're worried about all these

9136
02:38:24,530 --> 02:38:24,540
yeah they're worried about all these
 

9137
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:26,510
yeah they're worried about all these
things but the thing is some of the you

9138
02:38:26,510 --> 02:38:26,520
things but the thing is some of the you
 

9139
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:27,889
things but the thing is some of the you
you will waste time doing something

9140
02:38:27,889 --> 02:38:27,899
you will waste time doing something
 

9141
02:38:27,899 --> 02:38:29,330
you will waste time doing something
wrong yes you will eventually figure out

9142
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:29,340
wrong yes you will eventually figure out
 

9143
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:30,770
wrong yes you will eventually figure out
it's not right you will accumulate scar

9144
02:38:30,770 --> 02:38:30,780
it's not right you will accumulate scar
 

9145
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:32,990
it's not right you will accumulate scar
tissue and next time you'll grow

9146
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:33,000
tissue and next time you'll grow
 

9147
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,309
tissue and next time you'll grow
stronger because next time you'll have

9148
02:38:34,309 --> 02:38:34,319
stronger because next time you'll have
 

9149
02:38:34,319 --> 02:38:36,110
stronger because next time you'll have
the scar tissue and next time you'll

9150
02:38:36,110 --> 02:38:36,120
the scar tissue and next time you'll
 

9151
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:38,090
the scar tissue and next time you'll
learn from it and now next time you come

9152
02:38:38,090 --> 02:38:38,100
learn from it and now next time you come
 

9153
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:39,469
learn from it and now next time you come
into a similar situation you'll be like

9154
02:38:39,469 --> 02:38:39,479
into a similar situation you'll be like
 

9155
02:38:39,479 --> 02:38:40,550
into a similar situation you'll be like
all right

9156
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:40,560
all right
 

9157
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:42,889
all right
I messed up I've spent a lot of time

9158
02:38:42,889 --> 02:38:42,899
I messed up I've spent a lot of time
 

9159
02:38:42,899 --> 02:38:44,389
I messed up I've spent a lot of time
working on things that never materialize

9160
02:38:44,389 --> 02:38:44,399
working on things that never materialize
 

9161
02:38:44,399 --> 02:38:46,070
working on things that never materialize
into anything and I have all that scar

9162
02:38:46,070 --> 02:38:46,080
into anything and I have all that scar
 

9163
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:47,450
into anything and I have all that scar
tissue and I have some intuitions about

9164
02:38:47,450 --> 02:38:47,460
tissue and I have some intuitions about
 

9165
02:38:47,460 --> 02:38:49,429
tissue and I have some intuitions about
what was useful what wasn't useful how

9166
02:38:49,429 --> 02:38:49,439
what was useful what wasn't useful how
 

9167
02:38:49,439 --> 02:38:51,050
what was useful what wasn't useful how
things turned out uh so all those

9168
02:38:51,050 --> 02:38:51,060
things turned out uh so all those
 

9169
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:53,510
things turned out uh so all those
mistakes were uh were not dead work you

9170
02:38:53,510 --> 02:38:53,520
mistakes were uh were not dead work you
 

9171
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:55,429
mistakes were uh were not dead work you
know so I just think you should just

9172
02:38:55,429 --> 02:38:55,439
know so I just think you should just
 

9173
02:38:55,439 --> 02:38:57,770
know so I just think you should just
focus on working what have you done what

9174
02:38:57,770 --> 02:38:57,780
focus on working what have you done what
 

9175
02:38:57,780 --> 02:38:59,750
focus on working what have you done what
have you done last week

9176
02:38:59,750 --> 02:38:59,760
have you done last week
 

9177
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:01,910
have you done last week
uh that's a good question actually to

9178
02:39:01,910 --> 02:39:01,920
uh that's a good question actually to
 

9179
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:03,950
uh that's a good question actually to
ask for for a lot of things not just

9180
02:39:03,950 --> 02:39:03,960
ask for for a lot of things not just
 

9181
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:05,570
ask for for a lot of things not just
machine learning

9182
02:39:05,570 --> 02:39:05,580
machine learning
 

9183
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:08,090
machine learning
um it's a good way to cut the

9184
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:08,100
um it's a good way to cut the
 

9185
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:09,830
um it's a good way to cut the
the I forgot what the term will use but

9186
02:39:09,830 --> 02:39:09,840
the I forgot what the term will use but
 

9187
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:12,889
the I forgot what the term will use but
the fluff the blubber whatever the uh

9188
02:39:12,889 --> 02:39:12,899
the fluff the blubber whatever the uh
 

9189
02:39:12,899 --> 02:39:15,410
the fluff the blubber whatever the uh
the inefficiencies in life uh what do

9190
02:39:15,410 --> 02:39:15,420
the inefficiencies in life uh what do
 

9191
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:18,410
the inefficiencies in life uh what do

humans like when I teach yes I I
 

9205
02:39:31,260 --> 02:39:32,870

teaching but it's not like the act of
 

9209
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:36,650
teaching but it's not like the act of
teaching that I like it's it's that um

teaching and people appreciate it a lot
 

9217
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:46,550
teaching and people appreciate it a lot
yeah and uh so I'm just happy to try to

9218
02:39:46,550 --> 02:39:46,560
yeah and uh so I'm just happy to try to
 

9219
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:48,950
yeah and uh so I'm just happy to try to
be helpful and uh teaching itself is not

9220
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:48,960
be helpful and uh teaching itself is not
 

9221
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:51,290
be helpful and uh teaching itself is not
like the most I mean it's really it can

9222
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:51,300
like the most I mean it's really it can
 

9223
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:52,969
like the most I mean it's really it can
be really annoying frustrating I was

9224
02:39:52,969 --> 02:39:52,979
be really annoying frustrating I was
 

9225
02:39:52,979 --> 02:39:54,290
be really annoying frustrating I was
working on a bunch of lectures just now

9226
02:39:54,290 --> 02:39:54,300
working on a bunch of lectures just now
 

9227
02:39:54,300 --> 02:39:56,929
working on a bunch of lectures just now
I was reminded back to my days of 231

9228
02:39:56,929 --> 02:39:56,939
I was reminded back to my days of 231
 

9229
02:39:56,939 --> 02:39:58,610
I was reminded back to my days of 231
and just how much work it is to create

9230
02:39:58,610 --> 02:39:58,620
and just how much work it is to create
 

9231
02:39:58,620 --> 02:39:59,870
and just how much work it is to create
some of these materials and make them

9232
02:39:59,870 --> 02:39:59,880
some of these materials and make them
 

9233
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:01,670
some of these materials and make them
good the amount of iteration and thought

9234
02:40:01,670 --> 02:40:01,680
good the amount of iteration and thought
 

9235
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:03,530
good the amount of iteration and thought
and you go down blind alleys and just

9236
02:40:03,530 --> 02:40:03,540
and you go down blind alleys and just
 

9237
02:40:03,540 --> 02:40:05,450
and you go down blind alleys and just
how much you change it so creating

9238
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:05,460
how much you change it so creating
 

9239
02:40:05,460 --> 02:40:06,950
how much you change it so creating
something good

9240
02:40:06,950 --> 02:40:06,960
something good
 

9241
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:08,809
something good
um in terms of like educational value is

9242
02:40:08,809 --> 02:40:08,819
um in terms of like educational value is
 

9243
02:40:08,819 --> 02:40:12,110
um in terms of like educational value is
really hard and uh it's not fun it's

9244
02:40:12,110 --> 02:40:12,120
really hard and uh it's not fun it's
 

9245
02:40:12,120 --> 02:40:13,670
really hard and uh it's not fun it's
difficult so for people should

9246
02:40:13,670 --> 02:40:13,680
difficult so for people should
 

9247
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:15,469
difficult so for people should
definitely go watch your new stuff you

9248
02:40:15,469 --> 02:40:15,479
definitely go watch your new stuff you
 

9249
02:40:15,479 --> 02:40:17,570
definitely go watch your new stuff you
put out there are lectures where you're

9250
02:40:17,570 --> 02:40:17,580
put out there are lectures where you're
 

9251
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:18,889
put out there are lectures where you're
actually building the thing like from

9252
02:40:18,889 --> 02:40:18,899
actually building the thing like from
 

9253
02:40:18,899 --> 02:40:21,170
actually building the thing like from
like you said the coldest truth so

9254
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:21,180
like you said the coldest truth so
 

9255
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:23,990
like you said the coldest truth so
discussing back propagation by building

9256
02:40:23,990 --> 02:40:24,000
discussing back propagation by building
 

9257
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,090
discussing back propagation by building
it by looking through and just the whole

9258
02:40:26,090 --> 02:40:26,100
it by looking through and just the whole
 

9259
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:27,349
it by looking through and just the whole
thing so how difficult is that to

9260
02:40:27,349 --> 02:40:27,359
thing so how difficult is that to
 

9261
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:28,670
thing so how difficult is that to
prepare for I think that's a really

9262
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:28,680
prepare for I think that's a really
 

9263
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:30,889
prepare for I think that's a really
powerful way to teach how did you have

9264
02:40:30,889 --> 02:40:30,899
powerful way to teach how did you have
 

9265
02:40:30,899 --> 02:40:32,990
powerful way to teach how did you have
to prepare for that or are you just live

9266
02:40:32,990 --> 02:40:33,000
to prepare for that or are you just live
 

9267
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,510
to prepare for that or are you just live
thinking through it I will typically do

9268
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:35,520
thinking through it I will typically do
 

9269
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:37,130
thinking through it I will typically do
like say three takes and then I take

9270
02:40:37,130 --> 02:40:37,140
like say three takes and then I take
 

9271
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:39,410
like say three takes and then I take
like the the better take uh so I do

9272
02:40:39,410 --> 02:40:39,420
like the the better take uh so I do
 

9273
02:40:39,420 --> 02:40:40,610
like the the better take uh so I do
multiple takes and I take some of the

9274
02:40:40,610 --> 02:40:40,620
multiple takes and I take some of the
 

9275
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:41,809
multiple takes and I take some of the
better takes and then I just build out a

9276
02:40:41,809 --> 02:40:41,819
better takes and then I just build out a
 

9277
02:40:41,819 --> 02:40:43,849
better takes and then I just build out a
lecture that way uh sometimes I have to

9278
02:40:43,849 --> 02:40:43,859
lecture that way uh sometimes I have to
 

9279
02:40:43,859 --> 02:40:45,830
lecture that way uh sometimes I have to
delete 30 minutes of content because it

9280
02:40:45,830 --> 02:40:45,840
delete 30 minutes of content because it
 

9281
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:47,090
delete 30 minutes of content because it
just went down the Nelly that I didn't

9282
02:40:47,090 --> 02:40:47,100
just went down the Nelly that I didn't
 

9283
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:48,889
just went down the Nelly that I didn't
like too much there's about a bunch of

9284
02:40:48,889 --> 02:40:48,899
like too much there's about a bunch of
 

9285
02:40:48,899 --> 02:40:51,469
like too much there's about a bunch of
iteration and it probably takes me you

9286
02:40:51,469 --> 02:40:51,479
iteration and it probably takes me you
 

9287
02:40:51,479 --> 02:40:52,730
iteration and it probably takes me you
know somewhere around 10 hours to create

9288
02:40:52,730 --> 02:40:52,740
know somewhere around 10 hours to create
 

9289
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:54,410
know somewhere around 10 hours to create
one hour of content to give one hour

9290
02:40:54,410 --> 02:40:54,420
one hour of content to give one hour
 

9291
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:56,990
one hour of content to give one hour
it's interesting I mean is it difficult

9292
02:40:56,990 --> 02:40:57,000
it's interesting I mean is it difficult
 

9293
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,389
it's interesting I mean is it difficult
to go back to the like the basics do you

9294
02:40:59,389 --> 02:40:59,399
to go back to the like the basics do you
 

9295
02:40:59,399 --> 02:41:01,610
to go back to the like the basics do you
draw a lot of like wisdom from going

9296
02:41:01,610 --> 02:41:01,620
draw a lot of like wisdom from going
 

9297
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,230
draw a lot of like wisdom from going
back to the basics yeah going back to

9298
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:03,240
back to the basics yeah going back to
 

9299
02:41:03,240 --> 02:41:04,610
back to the basics yeah going back to
back propagation loss functions where

9300
02:41:04,610 --> 02:41:04,620
back propagation loss functions where
 

9301
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:05,929
back propagation loss functions where
they come from and one thing I like

9302
02:41:05,929 --> 02:41:05,939
they come from and one thing I like
 

9303
02:41:05,939 --> 02:41:08,030
they come from and one thing I like
about teaching a lot honestly is it

9304
02:41:08,030 --> 02:41:08,040
about teaching a lot honestly is it
 

9305
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:08,990
about teaching a lot honestly is it
definitely strengthens your

9306
02:41:08,990 --> 02:41:09,000
definitely strengthens your
 

9307
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,690
definitely strengthens your
understanding uh so it's not a purely

9308
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:11,700
understanding uh so it's not a purely
 

9309
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:13,429
understanding uh so it's not a purely
altruistic activity it's a way to learn

9310
02:41:13,429 --> 02:41:13,439
altruistic activity it's a way to learn
 

9311
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:15,530
altruistic activity it's a way to learn
if you have to explain something to

9312
02:41:15,530 --> 02:41:15,540
if you have to explain something to
 

9313
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:18,050
if you have to explain something to
someone uh you realize you have gaps in

9314
02:41:18,050 --> 02:41:18,060
someone uh you realize you have gaps in
 

9315
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:21,469
someone uh you realize you have gaps in
knowledge uh and so I even surprised

9316
02:41:21,469 --> 02:41:21,479
knowledge uh and so I even surprised
 

9317
02:41:21,479 --> 02:41:23,450
knowledge uh and so I even surprised
myself in those lectures like also the

9318
02:41:23,450 --> 02:41:23,460
myself in those lectures like also the
 

9319
02:41:23,460 --> 02:41:24,889
myself in those lectures like also the
result will obviously look at this and

9320
02:41:24,889 --> 02:41:24,899
result will obviously look at this and
 

9321
02:41:24,899 --> 02:41:26,030
result will obviously look at this and
then the result doesn't look like it and

9322
02:41:26,030 --> 02:41:26,040
then the result doesn't look like it and
 

9323
02:41:26,040 --> 02:41:27,710
then the result doesn't look like it and
I'm like okay I thought I understood

9324
02:41:27,710 --> 02:41:27,720
I'm like okay I thought I understood
 

9325
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:29,170
I'm like okay I thought I understood
this yeah

9326
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:29,180
this yeah
 

9327
02:41:29,180 --> 02:41:31,210
this yeah
but that's why it's really cool to

9328
02:41:31,210 --> 02:41:31,220
but that's why it's really cool to
 

9329
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:33,950
but that's why it's really cool to
literally code you run it in a notebook

9330
02:41:33,950 --> 02:41:33,960
literally code you run it in a notebook
 

9331
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:35,510
literally code you run it in a notebook
and it gives you a result and you're

9332
02:41:35,510 --> 02:41:35,520
and it gives you a result and you're
 

9333
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:37,730
and it gives you a result and you're
like oh wow and like actual numbers

9334
02:41:37,730 --> 02:41:37,740
like oh wow and like actual numbers
 

9335
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:39,830
like oh wow and like actual numbers
actual input act you know actual code

9336
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:39,840
actual input act you know actual code
 

9337
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:41,450
actual input act you know actual code
yeah it's not mathematical symbols Etc

9338
02:41:41,450 --> 02:41:41,460
yeah it's not mathematical symbols Etc
 

9339
02:41:41,460 --> 02:41:43,429
yeah it's not mathematical symbols Etc
the source of Truth is the code it's not

9340
02:41:43,429 --> 02:41:43,439
the source of Truth is the code it's not
 

9341
02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:45,770
the source of Truth is the code it's not
slides it's just like let's build it

9342
02:41:45,770 --> 02:41:45,780
slides it's just like let's build it
 

9343
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:47,870
slides it's just like let's build it
it's beautiful you're a rare human in

9344
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:47,880
it's beautiful you're a rare human in
 

9345
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:49,790
it's beautiful you're a rare human in
that sense uh what advice would you give

9346
02:41:49,790 --> 02:41:49,800
that sense uh what advice would you give
 

9347
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:53,809
that sense uh what advice would you give
to researchers uh trying to develop and

9348
02:41:53,809 --> 02:41:53,819
to researchers uh trying to develop and
 

9349
02:41:53,819 --> 02:41:55,730
to researchers uh trying to develop and
publish idea that have a big impact in

9350
02:41:55,730 --> 02:41:55,740
publish idea that have a big impact in
 

9351
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:58,849
publish idea that have a big impact in
the world of AI so maybe

9352
02:41:58,849 --> 02:41:58,859
the world of AI so maybe
 

9353
02:41:58,859 --> 02:42:01,190
the world of AI so maybe
um undergrads maybe early graduate

9354
02:42:01,190 --> 02:42:01,200
um undergrads maybe early graduate
 

9355
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:03,650
um undergrads maybe early graduate
students yep I mean I would say like

9356
02:42:03,650 --> 02:42:03,660
students yep I mean I would say like
 

9357
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:04,910
students yep I mean I would say like
they definitely have to be a little bit

9358
02:42:04,910 --> 02:42:04,920
they definitely have to be a little bit
 

9359
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:07,309
they definitely have to be a little bit
more strategic than I had to be as a PhD

9360
02:42:07,309 --> 02:42:07,319
more strategic than I had to be as a PhD
 

9361
02:42:07,319 --> 02:42:09,050
more strategic than I had to be as a PhD
student because of the way AI is

9362
02:42:09,050 --> 02:42:09,060
student because of the way AI is
 

9363
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:11,150
student because of the way AI is
evolving it's going the way of physics

9364
02:42:11,150 --> 02:42:11,160
evolving it's going the way of physics
 

9365
02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:13,250
evolving it's going the way of physics
where you know in physics you used to be

9366
02:42:13,250 --> 02:42:13,260
where you know in physics you used to be
 

9367
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:14,630
where you know in physics you used to be
able to do experiments on your benchtop

9368
02:42:14,630 --> 02:42:14,640
able to do experiments on your benchtop
 

9369
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:15,770
able to do experiments on your benchtop
and everything was great and you could

9370
02:42:15,770 --> 02:42:15,780
and everything was great and you could
 

9371
02:42:15,780 --> 02:42:18,050
and everything was great and you could
make progress and now you have to work

9372
02:42:18,050 --> 02:42:18,060
make progress and now you have to work
 

9373
02:42:18,060 --> 02:42:20,929
make progress and now you have to work
in like LHC or like CERN and

9374
02:42:20,929 --> 02:42:20,939
in like LHC or like CERN and
 

9375
02:42:20,939 --> 02:42:22,730
in like LHC or like CERN and
and so AI is going in that direction as

9376
02:42:22,730 --> 02:42:22,740
and so AI is going in that direction as
 

9377
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:23,570
and so AI is going in that direction as
well

9378
02:42:23,570 --> 02:42:23,580
well
 

9379
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:25,670
well
um so there's certain kinds of things

9380
02:42:25,670 --> 02:42:25,680
um so there's certain kinds of things
 

9381
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:26,990
um so there's certain kinds of things
that's just not possible to do on the

9382
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:27,000
that's just not possible to do on the
 

9383
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,690
that's just not possible to do on the
bench top anymore and uh

9384
02:42:29,690 --> 02:42:29,700
bench top anymore and uh
 

9385
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:32,090
bench top anymore and uh
I think um that didn't used to be the

9386
02:42:32,090 --> 02:42:32,100
I think um that didn't used to be the
 

9387
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:33,770
I think um that didn't used to be the
case at the time do you still think that

9388
02:42:33,770 --> 02:42:33,780
case at the time do you still think that
 

9389
02:42:33,780 --> 02:42:35,450
case at the time do you still think that
there's like

9390
02:42:35,450 --> 02:42:35,460
there's like
 

9391
02:42:35,460 --> 02:42:39,410
there's like
Gan type papers to be written where like

9392
02:42:39,410 --> 02:42:39,420
Gan type papers to be written where like
 

9393
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:42,530
Gan type papers to be written where like
uh like very simple idea that requires

9394
02:42:42,530 --> 02:42:42,540
uh like very simple idea that requires
 

9395
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:44,150
uh like very simple idea that requires
just one computer to illustrate a simple

9396
02:42:44,150 --> 02:42:44,160
just one computer to illustrate a simple
 

9397
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:45,770
just one computer to illustrate a simple
example I mean one example that's been

9398
02:42:45,770 --> 02:42:45,780
example I mean one example that's been
 

9399
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:47,330
example I mean one example that's been
very influential recently is diffusion

9400
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:47,340
very influential recently is diffusion
 

9401
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:49,429
very influential recently is diffusion
models diffusion models are amazing the

9402
02:42:49,429 --> 02:42:49,439
models diffusion models are amazing the
 

9403
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:52,130
models diffusion models are amazing the
fusion models are six years old for the

9404
02:42:52,130 --> 02:42:52,140
fusion models are six years old for the
 

9405
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:53,150
fusion models are six years old for the
longest time people were kind of

9406
02:42:53,150 --> 02:42:53,160
longest time people were kind of
 

9407
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:55,370
longest time people were kind of
ignoring them as far as I can tell and

9408
02:42:55,370 --> 02:42:55,380
ignoring them as far as I can tell and
 

9409
02:42:55,380 --> 02:42:57,110
ignoring them as far as I can tell and
they're an amazing generative model

9410
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:57,120
they're an amazing generative model
 

9411
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:59,510
they're an amazing generative model
especially in uh in images and so stable

9412
02:42:59,510 --> 02:42:59,520
especially in uh in images and so stable
 

9413
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:01,070
especially in uh in images and so stable
diffusion and so on it's all diffusion

9414
02:43:01,070 --> 02:43:01,080
diffusion and so on it's all diffusion
 

9415
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:03,469
diffusion and so on it's all diffusion
based the fusion is new it was not there

9416
02:43:03,469 --> 02:43:03,479
based the fusion is new it was not there
 

9417
02:43:03,479 --> 02:43:05,750
based the fusion is new it was not there
and came from well it came from Google

9418
02:43:05,750 --> 02:43:05,760
and came from well it came from Google
 

9419
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:07,370
and came from well it came from Google
but a researcher could have come up with

9420
02:43:07,370 --> 02:43:07,380
but a researcher could have come up with
 

9421
02:43:07,380 --> 02:43:09,230
but a researcher could have come up with
it in fact some of the first

9422
02:43:09,230 --> 02:43:09,240
it in fact some of the first
 

9423
02:43:09,240 --> 02:43:10,849
it in fact some of the first
actually no those came from Google as

9424
02:43:10,849 --> 02:43:10,859
actually no those came from Google as
 

9425
02:43:10,859 --> 02:43:13,130
actually no those came from Google as
well but a researcher could come up with

9426
02:43:13,130 --> 02:43:13,140
well but a researcher could come up with
 

9427
02:43:13,140 --> 02:43:15,050
well but a researcher could come up with
that in an academic Institution

9428
02:43:15,050 --> 02:43:15,060
that in an academic Institution
 

9429
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:16,730
that in an academic Institution
yeah what do you find Most Fascinating

9430
02:43:16,730 --> 02:43:16,740
yeah what do you find Most Fascinating
 

9431
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:19,910
yeah what do you find Most Fascinating
about diffusion models so from the

9432
02:43:19,910 --> 02:43:19,920
about diffusion models so from the
 

9433
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:21,889
about diffusion models so from the
societal impact to the the technical

9434
02:43:21,889 --> 02:43:21,899
societal impact to the the technical
 

9435
02:43:21,899 --> 02:43:23,270
societal impact to the the technical
architecture what I like about the

9436
02:43:23,270 --> 02:43:23,280
architecture what I like about the
 

9437
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:24,910
architecture what I like about the
fusion is it works so well

9438
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:24,920
fusion is it works so well
 

9439
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:27,889
fusion is it works so well
is that surprising to you the amount of

9440
02:43:27,889 --> 02:43:27,899
is that surprising to you the amount of
 

9441
02:43:27,899 --> 02:43:30,650
is that surprising to you the amount of
the variety almost the novelty of the

9442
02:43:30,650 --> 02:43:30,660
the variety almost the novelty of the
 

9443
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:33,230
the variety almost the novelty of the
synthetic data is generating yeah so the

9444
02:43:33,230 --> 02:43:33,240
synthetic data is generating yeah so the
 

9445
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:35,870
synthetic data is generating yeah so the
stable diffusion images are incredible

9446
02:43:35,870 --> 02:43:35,880
stable diffusion images are incredible
 

9447
02:43:35,880 --> 02:43:38,690
stable diffusion images are incredible
it's the speed of improvement in

9448
02:43:38,690 --> 02:43:38,700
it's the speed of improvement in
 

9449
02:43:38,700 --> 02:43:41,210
it's the speed of improvement in
generating images has been insane uh we

9450
02:43:41,210 --> 02:43:41,220
generating images has been insane uh we
 

9451
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:42,710
generating images has been insane uh we
went very quickly from generating like

9452
02:43:42,710 --> 02:43:42,720
went very quickly from generating like
 

9453
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:44,990
went very quickly from generating like
tiny digits to the tiny faces and it all

9454
02:43:44,990 --> 02:43:45,000
tiny digits to the tiny faces and it all
 

9455
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,309
tiny digits to the tiny faces and it all
looked messed up and now we have stable

9456
02:43:46,309 --> 02:43:46,319
looked messed up and now we have stable
 

9457
02:43:46,319 --> 02:43:47,870
looked messed up and now we have stable
diffusion and that happened very quickly

9458
02:43:47,870 --> 02:43:47,880
diffusion and that happened very quickly
 

9459
02:43:47,880 --> 02:43:49,370
diffusion and that happened very quickly
there's a lot that Academia can still

9460
02:43:49,370 --> 02:43:49,380
there's a lot that Academia can still
 

9461
02:43:49,380 --> 02:43:52,070
there's a lot that Academia can still
contribute you know for example um flash

9462
02:43:52,070 --> 02:43:52,080
contribute you know for example um flash
 

9463
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:54,650
contribute you know for example um flash
attention is a very efficient kernel for

9464
02:43:54,650 --> 02:43:54,660
attention is a very efficient kernel for
 

9465
02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:56,690
attention is a very efficient kernel for
running the attention operation inside

9466
02:43:56,690 --> 02:43:56,700
running the attention operation inside
 

9467
02:43:56,700 --> 02:43:59,090
running the attention operation inside
the Transformer that came from academic

9468
02:43:59,090 --> 02:43:59,100
the Transformer that came from academic
 

9469
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:00,650
the Transformer that came from academic
environment it's a very clever way to

9470
02:44:00,650 --> 02:44:00,660
environment it's a very clever way to
 

9471
02:44:00,660 --> 02:44:03,230
environment it's a very clever way to
structure the kernel uh that that's the

9472
02:44:03,230 --> 02:44:03,240
structure the kernel uh that that's the
 

9473
02:44:03,240 --> 02:44:04,790
structure the kernel uh that that's the
calculation so it doesn't materialize

9474
02:44:04,790 --> 02:44:04,800
calculation so it doesn't materialize
 

9475
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:06,830
calculation so it doesn't materialize
the attention Matrix

9476
02:44:06,830 --> 02:44:06,840
the attention Matrix
 

9477
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:08,270
the attention Matrix
um and so there's I think there's still

9478
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:08,280
um and so there's I think there's still
 

9479
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:09,469
um and so there's I think there's still
like lots of things to contribute but

9480
02:44:09,469 --> 02:44:09,479
like lots of things to contribute but
 

9481
02:44:09,479 --> 02:44:11,270
like lots of things to contribute but
you have to be just more strategic do

9482
02:44:11,270 --> 02:44:11,280
you have to be just more strategic do
 

9483
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:12,530
you have to be just more strategic do
you think neural networks could be made

9484
02:44:12,530 --> 02:44:12,540
you think neural networks could be made
 

9485
02:44:12,540 --> 02:44:14,210
you think neural networks could be made
to reason

9486
02:44:14,210 --> 02:44:14,220
to reason
 

9487
02:44:14,220 --> 02:44:15,950
to reason
uh yes

9488
02:44:15,950 --> 02:44:15,960
uh yes
 

9489
02:44:15,960 --> 02:44:17,929
uh yes
do you think they're already reason yes

9490
02:44:17,929 --> 02:44:17,939
do you think they're already reason yes
 

9491
02:44:17,939 --> 02:44:20,090
do you think they're already reason yes
what's your definition of reasoning

9492
02:44:20,090 --> 02:44:20,100
what's your definition of reasoning
 

9493
02:44:20,100 --> 02:44:23,950
what's your definition of reasoning
uh information processing

9494
02:44:23,950 --> 02:44:23,960
uh information processing
 

9495
02:44:23,960 --> 02:44:26,630
uh information processing
so in a way that humans think through a

9496
02:44:26,630 --> 02:44:26,640
so in a way that humans think through a
 

9497
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:30,950
so in a way that humans think through a
problem and come up with novel ideas

9498
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:30,960

 

9499
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:34,490

it it feels like a reasoning yeah so the

9500
02:44:34,490 --> 02:44:34,500
it it feels like a reasoning yeah so the
 

9501
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:36,670
it it feels like a reasoning yeah so the
the novelty

9502
02:44:36,670 --> 02:44:36,680
the novelty
 

9503
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:39,070
the novelty
I don't want to say but out of

9504
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:39,080
I don't want to say but out of
 

9505
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:41,809
I don't want to say but out of
distribution ideas

9506
02:44:41,809 --> 02:44:41,819
distribution ideas
 

9507
02:44:41,819 --> 02:44:44,330
distribution ideas
you think it's possible yes and I think

9508
02:44:44,330 --> 02:44:44,340
you think it's possible yes and I think
 

9509
02:44:44,340 --> 02:44:45,650
you think it's possible yes and I think
we're seeing that already in the current

9510
02:44:45,650 --> 02:44:45,660
we're seeing that already in the current
 

9511
02:44:45,660 --> 02:44:47,809
we're seeing that already in the current

what would uh illustrate to you holy

9530
02:45:08,150 --> 02:45:08,160
what would uh illustrate to you holy
 

9531
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:11,030
what would uh illustrate to you holy
[\h__\h] this thing is definitely thinking

[\h__\h] this thing is definitely thinking
 

9533
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:13,309
[\h__\h] this thing is definitely thinking
to me thinking or reasoning is just

02:45:13,309 --> 02:45:13,319
to me thinking or reasoning is just
 

9535
02:45:13,319 --> 02:45:14,630
to me thinking or reasoning is just
information processing and

9536
02:45:14,630 --> 02:45:14,640
information processing and
 

9537
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:16,250
information processing and
generalization and I think the neural

9538
02:45:16,250 --> 02:45:16,260
generalization and I think the neural
 

9539
02:45:16,260 --> 02:45:18,590
generalization and I think the neural
Nets already do that today so being able

02:45:18,590 --> 02:45:18,600
Nets already do that today so being able

yeah you're giving correct answers in

9550
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:30,960
yeah you're giving correct answers in
 

9551
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:32,750
yeah you're giving correct answers in
novel settings

9552
02:45:32,750 --> 02:45:32,760
novel settings
 

9553
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:35,090

by manipulating information you've

9554
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:35,100
by manipulating information you've
 

9555
02:45:35,100 --> 02:45:36,950
by manipulating information you've

doing just some kind of a lookup table

9558
02:45:38,090 --> 02:45:38,100
doing just some kind of a lookup table
 

9559
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:39,969
doing just some kind of a lookup table
and there's neighbor search

9560
02:45:39,969 --> 02:45:39,979
and there's neighbor search
 

9561
02:45:39,979 --> 02:45:42,830
and there's neighbor search
let me ask you about AGI what what are

9562
02:45:42,830 --> 02:45:42,840
let me ask you about AGI what what are
 

9563
02:45:42,840 --> 02:45:45,410
let me ask you about AGI what what are
some moonshot ideas you think might make

9564
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:45,420
some moonshot ideas you think might make
 

9565
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:48,290
some moonshot ideas you think might make
significant progress towards AGI or

9566
02:45:48,290 --> 02:45:48,300
significant progress towards AGI or
 

9567
02:45:48,300 --> 02:45:50,510
significant progress towards AGI or
maybe in other ways what are big

9568
02:45:50,510 --> 02:45:50,520
maybe in other ways what are big
 

9569
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:52,550
maybe in other ways what are big
blockers that we're missing now so

9570
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:52,560
blockers that we're missing now so
 

9571
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:54,290
blockers that we're missing now so
basically I am fairly bullish on our

9572
02:45:54,290 --> 02:45:54,300
basically I am fairly bullish on our
 

9573
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:57,889
basically I am fairly bullish on our
ability to build agis uh basically

9574
02:45:57,889 --> 02:45:57,899
ability to build agis uh basically
 

9575
02:45:57,899 --> 02:46:00,950
ability to build agis uh basically
automated systems that we can interact

9576
02:46:00,950 --> 02:46:00,960
automated systems that we can interact
 

9577
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:02,750
automated systems that we can interact
with and are very human-like and we can

9578
02:46:02,750 --> 02:46:02,760
with and are very human-like and we can
 

9579
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:04,309
with and are very human-like and we can
interact with them in a digital realm or

9580
02:46:04,309 --> 02:46:04,319
interact with them in a digital realm or
 

9581
02:46:04,319 --> 02:46:07,550
interact with them in a digital realm or
Physical Realm currently it seems most

9582
02:46:07,550 --> 02:46:07,560
Physical Realm currently it seems most
 

9583
02:46:07,560 --> 02:46:09,410
Physical Realm currently it seems most
of the models that sort of do these sort

9584
02:46:09,410 --> 02:46:09,420
of the models that sort of do these sort
 

9585
02:46:09,420 --> 02:46:12,230
of the models that sort of do these sort
of magical tasks are in a text Realm

9586
02:46:12,230 --> 02:46:12,240
of magical tasks are in a text Realm
 

9587
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:15,349
of magical tasks are in a text Realm
um I think uh as I mentioned I'm

9588
02:46:15,349 --> 02:46:15,359
um I think uh as I mentioned I'm
 

9589
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:17,270
um I think uh as I mentioned I'm
suspicious that the text realm is not

9590
02:46:17,270 --> 02:46:17,280
suspicious that the text realm is not
 

9591
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:18,530
suspicious that the text realm is not
enough to actually build full

9592
02:46:18,530 --> 02:46:18,540
enough to actually build full
 

9593
02:46:18,540 --> 02:46:20,870
enough to actually build full
understanding of the world I do actually

9594
02:46:20,870 --> 02:46:20,880
understanding of the world I do actually
 

9595
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:22,429
understanding of the world I do actually
think you need to go into pixels and

9596
02:46:22,429 --> 02:46:22,439
think you need to go into pixels and
 

9597
02:46:22,439 --> 02:46:24,230
think you need to go into pixels and
understand the physical world and how it

9598
02:46:24,230 --> 02:46:24,240
understand the physical world and how it
 

9599
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:26,030
understand the physical world and how it
works so I do think that we need to

9600
02:46:26,030 --> 02:46:26,040
works so I do think that we need to
 

9601
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:27,530
works so I do think that we need to
extend these models to consume images

9602
02:46:27,530 --> 02:46:27,540
extend these models to consume images
 

9603
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:30,170
extend these models to consume images
and videos and train on a lot more data

9604
02:46:30,170 --> 02:46:30,180
and videos and train on a lot more data
 

9605
02:46:30,180 --> 02:46:32,510
and videos and train on a lot more data
that is multimodal in that way

9606
02:46:32,510 --> 02:46:32,520
that is multimodal in that way
 

9607
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:33,950
that is multimodal in that way
if you think you need to touch the world

9608
02:46:33,950 --> 02:46:33,960
if you think you need to touch the world
 

9609
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:35,570
if you think you need to touch the world
to understand it also well that's the

9610
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:35,580
to understand it also well that's the
 

9611
02:46:35,580 --> 02:46:37,010
to understand it also well that's the
big open question I would say in my mind

9612
02:46:37,010 --> 02:46:37,020
big open question I would say in my mind
 

9613
02:46:37,020 --> 02:46:39,410
big open question I would say in my mind
is if you also require the embodiment

9614
02:46:39,410 --> 02:46:39,420
is if you also require the embodiment
 

9615
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:42,050
is if you also require the embodiment
and the ability to uh sort of interact

9616
02:46:42,050 --> 02:46:42,060
and the ability to uh sort of interact
 

9617
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:44,809
and the ability to uh sort of interact
with the world run experiments and have

9618
02:46:44,809 --> 02:46:44,819
with the world run experiments and have
 

9619
02:46:44,819 --> 02:46:46,070
with the world run experiments and have
a data of that form then you need to go

9620
02:46:46,070 --> 02:46:46,080
a data of that form then you need to go
 

9621
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:49,010
a data of that form then you need to go
to Optimus or something like that and so

9622
02:46:49,010 --> 02:46:49,020
to Optimus or something like that and so
 

9623
02:46:49,020 --> 02:46:50,690
to Optimus or something like that and so
I would say Optimus in some way is like

9624
02:46:50,690 --> 02:46:50,700
I would say Optimus in some way is like
 

9625
02:46:50,700 --> 02:46:52,150
I would say Optimus in some way is like
a hedge

9626
02:46:52,150 --> 02:46:52,160
a hedge
 

9627
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:56,389
a hedge
in AGI because it seems to me that it's

9628
02:46:56,389 --> 02:46:56,399
in AGI because it seems to me that it's
 

9629
02:46:56,399 --> 02:46:58,849
in AGI because it seems to me that it's
possible that just having data from the

9630
02:46:58,849 --> 02:46:58,859
possible that just having data from the
 

9631
02:46:58,859 --> 02:47:00,170
possible that just having data from the
internet is not enough

9632
02:47:00,170 --> 02:47:00,180
internet is not enough
 

9633
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:02,690
internet is not enough
if that is the case then Optimus may

9634
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:02,700
if that is the case then Optimus may
 

9635
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:06,170
if that is the case then Optimus may
lead to AGI because Optimus would I to

9636
02:47:06,170 --> 02:47:06,180
lead to AGI because Optimus would I to
 

9637
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:08,150
lead to AGI because Optimus would I to
me there's nothing Beyond optimism you

9638
02:47:08,150 --> 02:47:08,160
me there's nothing Beyond optimism you
 

9639
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:09,710
me there's nothing Beyond optimism you
have like this humanoid form factor that

9640
02:47:09,710 --> 02:47:09,720
have like this humanoid form factor that
 

9641
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:11,030
have like this humanoid form factor that
can actually like do stuff in the world

9642
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:11,040
can actually like do stuff in the world
 

9643
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:12,410
can actually like do stuff in the world
you can have millions of them

9644
02:47:12,410 --> 02:47:12,420
you can have millions of them
 

9645
02:47:12,420 --> 02:47:15,290
you can have millions of them
interacting with humans and so on and uh

9646
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:15,300
interacting with humans and so on and uh
 

9647
02:47:15,300 --> 02:47:17,270
interacting with humans and so on and uh
if that doesn't give a rise to AGI at

9648
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:17,280
if that doesn't give a rise to AGI at
 

9649
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:18,889
if that doesn't give a rise to AGI at
some point like not I'm not sure what

9650
02:47:18,889 --> 02:47:18,899
some point like not I'm not sure what
 

9651
02:47:18,899 --> 02:47:20,090
some point like not I'm not sure what
will

9652
02:47:20,090 --> 02:47:20,100
will
 

9653
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:22,190
will
um so from a completeness perspective I

9654
02:47:22,190 --> 02:47:22,200
um so from a completeness perspective I
 

9655
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:24,230
um so from a completeness perspective I
think that's the uh that's a really good

9656
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:24,240
think that's the uh that's a really good
 

9657
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:26,450
think that's the uh that's a really good
platform but it's a much harder platform

9658
02:47:26,450 --> 02:47:26,460
platform but it's a much harder platform
 

9659
02:47:26,460 --> 02:47:28,610
platform but it's a much harder platform
because uh you are dealing with atoms

9660
02:47:28,610 --> 02:47:28,620
because uh you are dealing with atoms
 

9661
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:29,809
because uh you are dealing with atoms
and you need to actually like build

9662
02:47:29,809 --> 02:47:29,819
and you need to actually like build
 

9663
02:47:29,819 --> 02:47:31,790
and you need to actually like build
these things and integrate them into

9664
02:47:31,790 --> 02:47:31,800
these things and integrate them into
 

9665
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:33,950
these things and integrate them into
society so I think that path takes

9666
02:47:33,950 --> 02:47:33,960
society so I think that path takes
 

9667
02:47:33,960 --> 02:47:36,889
society so I think that path takes
longer but it's much more certain and

9668
02:47:36,889 --> 02:47:36,899
longer but it's much more certain and
 

9669
02:47:36,899 --> 02:47:38,510
longer but it's much more certain and
then there's a path of the internet and

9670
02:47:38,510 --> 02:47:38,520
then there's a path of the internet and
 

9671
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:39,889
then there's a path of the internet and
just like training these compression

9672
02:47:39,889 --> 02:47:39,899
just like training these compression
 

9673
02:47:39,899 --> 02:47:42,770
just like training these compression
models effectively uh on uh trying to

9674
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:42,780
models effectively uh on uh trying to
 

9675
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:44,570
models effectively uh on uh trying to
compress all the internet

9676
02:47:44,570 --> 02:47:44,580
compress all the internet
 

9677
02:47:44,580 --> 02:47:47,570
compress all the internet
and that might also give these agents as

9678
02:47:47,570 --> 02:47:47,580
and that might also give these agents as
 

9679
02:47:47,580 --> 02:47:49,730
and that might also give these agents as
well compress the internet but also

9680
02:47:49,730 --> 02:47:49,740
well compress the internet but also
 

9681
02:47:49,740 --> 02:47:52,550
well compress the internet but also
interact with the internet yeah so it's

9682
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:52,560
interact with the internet yeah so it's
 

9683
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:54,050
interact with the internet yeah so it's
not obvious to me

9684
02:47:54,050 --> 02:47:54,060
not obvious to me
 

9685
02:47:54,060 --> 02:47:56,809
not obvious to me
in fact I suspect you can reach AGI

9686
02:47:56,809 --> 02:47:56,819
in fact I suspect you can reach AGI
 

9687
02:47:56,819 --> 02:48:00,110
in fact I suspect you can reach AGI
without ever entering the physical world

9688
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:00,120
without ever entering the physical world
 

9689
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:02,750
without ever entering the physical world
and which is a little bit more

9690
02:48:02,750 --> 02:48:02,760
and which is a little bit more
 

9691
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:05,270
and which is a little bit more
uh concerning because

9692
02:48:05,270 --> 02:48:05,280
uh concerning because
 

9693
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:07,670
uh concerning because
it might that results in it happening

9694
02:48:07,670 --> 02:48:07,680
it might that results in it happening
 

9695
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:08,690
it might that results in it happening
faster

9696
02:48:08,690 --> 02:48:08,700
faster
 

9697
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:11,150
faster
so it just feels like we're in again

9698
02:48:11,150 --> 02:48:11,160
so it just feels like we're in again
 

9699
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:13,070
so it just feels like we're in again
boiling water we won't know as it's

9700
02:48:13,070 --> 02:48:13,080
boiling water we won't know as it's
 

9701
02:48:13,080 --> 02:48:14,030
boiling water we won't know as it's
happening

9702
02:48:14,030 --> 02:48:14,040
happening
 

9703
02:48:14,040 --> 02:48:17,630
happening
I would like to I'm not afraid of AGI

9704
02:48:17,630 --> 02:48:17,640
I would like to I'm not afraid of AGI
 

9705
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:19,670
I would like to I'm not afraid of AGI
I'm excited about it there's always

9706
02:48:19,670 --> 02:48:19,680
I'm excited about it there's always
 

9707
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:22,010
I'm excited about it there's always
concerns but I would like to know when

9708
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:22,020
concerns but I would like to know when
 

9709
02:48:22,020 --> 02:48:23,530
concerns but I would like to know when
it happens

9710
02:48:23,530 --> 02:48:23,540
it happens
 

9711
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:26,450
it happens
yeah or and have like hints about when

9712
02:48:26,450 --> 02:48:26,460
yeah or and have like hints about when
 

9713
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:28,849
yeah or and have like hints about when
it happens like a year from now it will

9714
02:48:28,849 --> 02:48:28,859
it happens like a year from now it will
 

9715
02:48:28,859 --> 02:48:30,530
it happens like a year from now it will
happen that kind of thing yeah I just

9716
02:48:30,530 --> 02:48:30,540
happen that kind of thing yeah I just
 

9717
02:48:30,540 --> 02:48:32,090
happen that kind of thing yeah I just
feel like in the digital realm it just

9718
02:48:32,090 --> 02:48:32,100
feel like in the digital realm it just
 

9719
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:34,190
feel like in the digital realm it just
might happen yeah I think all we have

9720
02:48:34,190 --> 02:48:34,200
might happen yeah I think all we have
 

9721
02:48:34,200 --> 02:48:35,809
might happen yeah I think all we have
available to us because no one has built

9722
02:48:35,809 --> 02:48:35,819
available to us because no one has built
 

9723
02:48:35,819 --> 02:48:38,389
available to us because no one has built
AGI again so all we have available to us

9724
02:48:38,389 --> 02:48:38,399
AGI again so all we have available to us
 

9725
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:41,809
AGI again so all we have available to us
is uh is there enough for cow ground on

9726
02:48:41,809 --> 02:48:41,819
is uh is there enough for cow ground on
 

9727
02:48:41,819 --> 02:48:43,490
is uh is there enough for cow ground on
the periphery I would say yes and we

9728
02:48:43,490 --> 02:48:43,500
the periphery I would say yes and we
 

9729
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:45,230
the periphery I would say yes and we
have the progress so far which has been

9730
02:48:45,230 --> 02:48:45,240
have the progress so far which has been
 

9731
02:48:45,240 --> 02:48:47,929
have the progress so far which has been
very rapid and uh there are next steps

9732
02:48:47,929 --> 02:48:47,939
very rapid and uh there are next steps
 

9733
02:48:47,939 --> 02:48:49,610
very rapid and uh there are next steps
that are available and so

9734
02:48:49,610 --> 02:48:49,620
that are available and so
 

9735
02:48:49,620 --> 02:48:51,770
that are available and so
I would say uh yeah it's quite likely

9736
02:48:51,770 --> 02:48:51,780
I would say uh yeah it's quite likely
 

9737
02:48:51,780 --> 02:48:53,270
I would say uh yeah it's quite likely
that we'll be interacting with digital

9738
02:48:53,270 --> 02:48:53,280
that we'll be interacting with digital
 

9739
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:55,969
that we'll be interacting with digital
entities how will you know that

9740
02:48:55,969 --> 02:48:55,979
entities how will you know that
 

9741
02:48:55,979 --> 02:48:57,950

02:49:39,530 --> 02:49:39,540
um generative model sort of so
 

9787
02:49:39,540 --> 02:49:41,389
um generative model sort of so
um if you have a complex and Alpha World

9788
02:49:41,389 --> 02:49:41,399
um if you have a complex and Alpha World
 

9789
02:49:41,399 --> 02:49:44,389
um if you have a complex and Alpha World
model that understands the world then it

9790
02:49:44,389 --> 02:49:44,399
model that understands the world then it
 

9791
02:49:44,399 --> 02:49:46,550
model that understands the world then it
also understands its predicament in the

9792
02:49:46,550 --> 02:49:46,560
also understands its predicament in the
 

9793
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:49,010
also understands its predicament in the
world as being a language model which to

9794
02:49:49,010 --> 02:49:49,020
world as being a language model which to
 

9795
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:50,389
world as being a language model which to
me is a form of Consciousness or

9796
02:49:50,389 --> 02:49:50,399
me is a form of Consciousness or
 

9797
02:49:50,399 --> 02:49:52,910
me is a form of Consciousness or
self-awareness and so in order to

9798
02:49:52,910 --> 02:49:52,920
self-awareness and so in order to
 

9799
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:54,349
self-awareness and so in order to
understand the world deeply you probably

9800
02:49:54,349 --> 02:49:54,359
understand the world deeply you probably
 

9801
02:49:54,359 --> 02:49:55,969
understand the world deeply you probably
have to integrate yourself into the

9802
02:49:55,969 --> 02:49:55,979
have to integrate yourself into the
 

9803
02:49:55,979 --> 02:49:58,190
have to integrate yourself into the
world yeah and in order to interact with

9804
02:49:58,190 --> 02:49:58,200
world yeah and in order to interact with
 

9805
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:00,010
world yeah and in order to interact with
humans and other living beings

9806
02:50:00,010 --> 02:50:00,020
humans and other living beings
 

9807
02:50:00,020 --> 02:50:02,990

Consciousness is a very useful tool I

9808
02:50:02,990 --> 02:50:03,000
Consciousness is a very useful tool I
 

9809
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,370
Consciousness is a very useful tool I
think Consciousness is like a modeling

9810
02:50:04,370 --> 02:50:04,380
think Consciousness is like a modeling
 

9811
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:05,770
think Consciousness is like a modeling
insight

9812
02:50:05,770 --> 02:50:05,780
insight
 

9813
02:50:05,780 --> 02:50:08,809
insight
modeling Insight yeah it's a you have a

9814
02:50:08,809 --> 02:50:08,819
modeling Insight yeah it's a you have a
 

9815
02:50:08,819 --> 02:50:10,790
modeling Insight yeah it's a you have a
powerful enough model of understanding

9816
02:50:10,790 --> 02:50:10,800
powerful enough model of understanding
 

9817
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:11,750
powerful enough model of understanding
the world that you actually understand

9818
02:50:11,750 --> 02:50:11,760
the world that you actually understand
 

9819
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,790
the world that you actually understand
that you are an entity in it yeah but

9820
02:50:13,790 --> 02:50:13,800
that you are an entity in it yeah but
 

9821
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:16,370
that you are an entity in it yeah but
there's also this um perhaps just a

9822
02:50:16,370 --> 02:50:16,380
there's also this um perhaps just a
 

9823
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:18,530
there's also this um perhaps just a
narrative we tell ourselves there's a it

9824
02:50:18,530 --> 02:50:18,540
narrative we tell ourselves there's a it
 

9825
02:50:18,540 --> 02:50:20,210
narrative we tell ourselves there's a it
feels like something to experience the

9826
02:50:20,210 --> 02:50:20,220
feels like something to experience the
 

9827
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:22,250
feels like something to experience the
world the hard problem of Consciousness

9828
02:50:22,250 --> 02:50:22,260
world the hard problem of Consciousness
 

9829
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:23,750
world the hard problem of Consciousness
yeah but that could be just the

9830
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:23,760
yeah but that could be just the
 

9831
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:25,250
yeah but that could be just the
narrative that we tell ourselves yeah I

9832
02:50:25,250 --> 02:50:25,260
narrative that we tell ourselves yeah I
 

9833
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:26,450
narrative that we tell ourselves yeah I
don't think what yeah I think it will

9834
02:50:26,450 --> 02:50:26,460
don't think what yeah I think it will
 

9835
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:28,190
don't think what yeah I think it will
emerge I think it's going to be

9836
02:50:28,190 --> 02:50:28,200
emerge I think it's going to be
 

9837
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:30,410
emerge I think it's going to be
something uh very boring like we'll be

9838
02:50:30,410 --> 02:50:30,420
something uh very boring like we'll be
 

9839
02:50:30,420 --> 02:50:32,150
something uh very boring like we'll be
talking to these uh digital AIS they

9840
02:50:32,150 --> 02:50:32,160
talking to these uh digital AIS they
 

9841
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:33,770
talking to these uh digital AIS they
will claim they're conscious they will

9842
02:50:33,770 --> 02:50:33,780
will claim they're conscious they will
 

9843
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:35,809
will claim they're conscious they will
appear conscious they will do all the

9844
02:50:35,809 --> 02:50:35,819
appear conscious they will do all the
 

9845
02:50:35,819 --> 02:50:36,770
appear conscious they will do all the
things that you would expect of other

9846
02:50:36,770 --> 02:50:36,780
things that you would expect of other
 

9847
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:39,230
things that you would expect of other
humans and uh it's going to just be a

9848
02:50:39,230 --> 02:50:39,240
humans and uh it's going to just be a
 

9849
02:50:39,240 --> 02:50:41,510
humans and uh it's going to just be a
stalemate I I think there would be a lot

9850
02:50:41,510 --> 02:50:41,520
stalemate I I think there would be a lot
 

9851
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:44,110
stalemate I I think there would be a lot
of actual fascinating ethical questions

9852
02:50:44,110 --> 02:50:44,120
of actual fascinating ethical questions
 

9853
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:47,450
of actual fascinating ethical questions
like Supreme Court level questions

9854
02:50:47,450 --> 02:50:47,460
like Supreme Court level questions
 

9855
02:50:47,460 --> 02:50:50,690
like Supreme Court level questions
of whether you're allowed to turn off a

9856
02:50:50,690 --> 02:50:50,700
of whether you're allowed to turn off a
 

9857
02:50:50,700 --> 02:50:53,330
of whether you're allowed to turn off a
conscious AI if you're allowed to build

9858
02:50:53,330 --> 02:50:53,340
conscious AI if you're allowed to build
 

9859
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,030
conscious AI if you're allowed to build
the conscious AI

9860
02:50:55,030 --> 02:50:55,040
the conscious AI
 

9861
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:57,590
the conscious AI
maybe there would have to be the same

9862
02:50:57,590 --> 02:50:57,600
maybe there would have to be the same
 

9863
02:50:57,600 --> 02:51:01,010
maybe there would have to be the same
kind of debates that you have around

9864
02:51:01,010 --> 02:51:01,020
kind of debates that you have around
 

9865
02:51:01,020 --> 02:51:03,110
kind of debates that you have around
um sorry to bring up a political topic

9866
02:51:03,110 --> 02:51:03,120
um sorry to bring up a political topic
 

9867
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:06,590
um sorry to bring up a political topic
but you know abortion which is the

9868
02:51:06,590 --> 02:51:06,600
but you know abortion which is the
 

9869
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:08,770
but you know abortion which is the
deeper question with abortion

9870
02:51:08,770 --> 02:51:08,780
deeper question with abortion
 

9871
02:51:08,780 --> 02:51:12,469
deeper question with abortion
is what is life and the Deep question

9872
02:51:12,469 --> 02:51:12,479
is what is life and the Deep question
 

9873
02:51:12,479 --> 02:51:16,010
is what is life and the Deep question
with AI is also what is life and what is

9874
02:51:16,010 --> 02:51:16,020
with AI is also what is life and what is
 

9875
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:18,110
with AI is also what is life and what is
conscious and I think that'll be very

9876
02:51:18,110 --> 02:51:18,120
conscious and I think that'll be very
 

9877
02:51:18,120 --> 02:51:19,730
conscious and I think that'll be very
fascinating

9878
02:51:19,730 --> 02:51:19,740
fascinating
 

9879
02:51:19,740 --> 02:51:22,610
fascinating
to bring up it might become illegal to

9880
02:51:22,610 --> 02:51:22,620
to bring up it might become illegal to
 

9881
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:26,230
to bring up it might become illegal to
build systems that are capable that like

9882
02:51:26,230 --> 02:51:26,240
build systems that are capable that like
 

9883
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:28,910
build systems that are capable that like
of such a level of intelligence that

9884
02:51:28,910 --> 02:51:28,920
of such a level of intelligence that
 

9885
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:30,410
of such a level of intelligence that
Consciousness would emerge and therefore

9886
02:51:30,410 --> 02:51:30,420
Consciousness would emerge and therefore
 

9887
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:32,570
Consciousness would emerge and therefore
the capacity to suffer would emerge and

9888
02:51:32,570 --> 02:51:32,580
the capacity to suffer would emerge and
 

9889
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:35,150
the capacity to suffer would emerge and
some A system that says no please don't

9890
02:51:35,150 --> 02:51:35,160
some A system that says no please don't
 

9891
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:37,190
some A system that says no please don't
kill me well that's what the Lambda

02:51:37,190 --> 02:51:37,200
kill me well that's what the Lambda
 

9893
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:40,250
kill me well that's what the Lambda

um this Google engineer right like it it

9896
02:51:41,929 --> 02:51:41,939
um this Google engineer right like it it
 

9897
02:51:41,939 --> 02:51:44,150
um this Google engineer right like it it
was talking about not wanting to die or

9898
02:51:44,150 --> 02:51:44,160
was talking about not wanting to die or
 

9899
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:46,849
was talking about not wanting to die or
so on so that might become illegal to do

9900
02:51:46,849 --> 02:51:46,859
so on so that might become illegal to do
 

9901
02:51:46,859 --> 02:51:48,610
so on so that might become illegal to do
that right

9902
02:51:48,610 --> 02:51:48,620
that right
 

9903
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:51,410
that right
I because otherwise you might have a lot

9904
02:51:51,410 --> 02:51:51,420
I because otherwise you might have a lot
 

9905
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:53,330
I because otherwise you might have a lot
of a lot of creatures that don't want to

9906
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:53,340
of a lot of creatures that don't want to
 

9907
02:51:53,340 --> 02:51:56,150
of a lot of creatures that don't want to
die and they will uh you can just spawn

9908
02:51:56,150 --> 02:51:56,160
die and they will uh you can just spawn
 

9909
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:58,570
die and they will uh you can just spawn
Infinity of them on a cluster

9910
02:51:58,570 --> 02:51:58,580
Infinity of them on a cluster
 

9911
02:51:58,580 --> 02:52:00,830
Infinity of them on a cluster
and then that might lead to like

9912
02:52:00,830 --> 02:52:00,840
and then that might lead to like
 

9913
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:02,809
and then that might lead to like
horrible consequences because then there

9914
02:52:02,809 --> 02:52:02,819
horrible consequences because then there
 

9915
02:52:02,819 --> 02:52:04,370
horrible consequences because then there
might be a lot of people that secretly

9916
02:52:04,370 --> 02:52:04,380
might be a lot of people that secretly
 

9917
02:52:04,380 --> 02:52:06,349
might be a lot of people that secretly
love murder and they'll start practicing

9918
02:52:06,349 --> 02:52:06,359
love murder and they'll start practicing
 

9919
02:52:06,359 --> 02:52:08,090
love murder and they'll start practicing
murder on those systems I mean there's

9920
02:52:08,090 --> 02:52:08,100
murder on those systems I mean there's
 

9921
02:52:08,100 --> 02:52:10,910
murder on those systems I mean there's
just I to me all of this stuff just

9922
02:52:10,910 --> 02:52:10,920
just I to me all of this stuff just
 

9923
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:13,130
just I to me all of this stuff just
brings a beautiful mirror to The Human

9924
02:52:13,130 --> 02:52:13,140
brings a beautiful mirror to The Human
 

9925
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:15,469
brings a beautiful mirror to The Human
Condition and human nature we'll get to

9926
02:52:15,469 --> 02:52:15,479
Condition and human nature we'll get to
 

9927
02:52:15,479 --> 02:52:17,750
Condition and human nature we'll get to
explore it and that's what like the best

9928
02:52:17,750 --> 02:52:17,760
explore it and that's what like the best
 

9929
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:20,210
explore it and that's what like the best
of uh the Supreme Court of all the

9930
02:52:20,210 --> 02:52:20,220
of uh the Supreme Court of all the
 

9931
02:52:20,220 --> 02:52:22,429
of uh the Supreme Court of all the
different debates we have about ideas of

9932
02:52:22,429 --> 02:52:22,439
different debates we have about ideas of
 

9933
02:52:22,439 --> 02:52:24,050
different debates we have about ideas of
what it means to be human we get to ask

9934
02:52:24,050 --> 02:52:24,060
what it means to be human we get to ask
 

9935
02:52:24,060 --> 02:52:25,849
what it means to be human we get to ask
those deep questions that we've been

9936
02:52:25,849 --> 02:52:25,859
those deep questions that we've been
 

9937
02:52:25,859 --> 02:52:27,769
those deep questions that we've been
asking throughout human history there's

9938
02:52:27,769 --> 02:52:27,779
asking throughout human history there's
 

9939
02:52:27,779 --> 02:52:30,010
asking throughout human history there's
always been the other in human history

9940
02:52:30,010 --> 02:52:30,020
always been the other in human history
 

9941
02:52:30,020 --> 02:52:32,750
always been the other in human history
uh we're the good guys and that's the

9942
02:52:32,750 --> 02:52:32,760
uh we're the good guys and that's the
 

9943
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:34,969
uh we're the good guys and that's the
bad guys and we're going to uh you know

9944
02:52:34,969 --> 02:52:34,979
bad guys and we're going to uh you know
 

9945
02:52:34,979 --> 02:52:36,530
bad guys and we're going to uh you know
throughout human history let's murder

9946
02:52:36,530 --> 02:52:36,540
throughout human history let's murder
 

9947
02:52:36,540 --> 02:52:38,990
throughout human history let's murder
the bad guys and the same will probably

9948
02:52:38,990 --> 02:52:39,000
the bad guys and the same will probably
 

9949
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,330
the bad guys and the same will probably
happen with robots it'll be the other at

9950
02:52:41,330 --> 02:52:41,340
happen with robots it'll be the other at
 

9951
02:52:41,340 --> 02:52:42,530
happen with robots it'll be the other at
first and then we'll get to ask

9952
02:52:42,530 --> 02:52:42,540
first and then we'll get to ask
 

9953
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:43,910
first and then we'll get to ask
questions of what does it mean to be

9954
02:52:43,910 --> 02:52:43,920
questions of what does it mean to be
 

9955
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:45,830
questions of what does it mean to be
alive what does it mean to be conscious

9956
02:52:45,830 --> 02:52:45,840
alive what does it mean to be conscious
 

9957
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:47,929
alive what does it mean to be conscious
yeah and I think there's some Canary in

9958
02:52:47,929 --> 02:52:47,939
yeah and I think there's some Canary in
 

9959
02:52:47,939 --> 02:52:49,190
yeah and I think there's some Canary in
the coal mines even with what we have

9960
02:52:49,190 --> 02:52:49,200
the coal mines even with what we have
 

9961
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:49,969
the coal mines even with what we have
today

9962
02:52:49,969 --> 02:52:49,979
today
 

9963
02:52:49,979 --> 02:52:51,889
today
um and uh you know for example these

9964
02:52:51,889 --> 02:52:51,899
um and uh you know for example these
 

9965
02:52:51,899 --> 02:52:53,630
um and uh you know for example these
there's these like waifus that you like

9966
02:52:53,630 --> 02:52:53,640
there's these like waifus that you like
 

9967
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:55,010
there's these like waifus that you like
work with and some people are trying to

9968
02:52:55,010 --> 02:52:55,020
work with and some people are trying to

02:52:55,020 --> 02:52:56,630
work with and some people are trying to
like this company is going to shut down

9970
02:52:56,630 --> 02:52:56,640
like this company is going to shut down

definitely uh people will have feelings
 

9981
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:10,490
definitely uh people will have feelings
towards uh towards these um systems

9982
02:53:10,490 --> 02:53:10,500
towards uh towards these um systems
 

9983
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:12,050
towards uh towards these um systems
because in some sense they are like a

9984
02:53:12,050 --> 02:53:12,060
because in some sense they are like a
 

9985
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:14,690
because in some sense they are like a
mirror of humanity because they are like

9986
02:53:14,690 --> 02:53:14,700
mirror of humanity because they are like
 

9987
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:16,730
mirror of humanity because they are like
sort of like a big average of humanity

9988
02:53:16,730 --> 02:53:16,740
sort of like a big average of humanity
 

9989
02:53:16,740 --> 02:53:18,950
sort of like a big average of humanity
yeah in a way that it's trained but we

9990
02:53:18,950 --> 02:53:18,960
yeah in a way that it's trained but we
 

9991
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:21,410
yeah in a way that it's trained but we
can that average we can actually watch

9992
02:53:21,410 --> 02:53:21,420
can that average we can actually watch
 

9993
02:53:21,420 --> 02:53:23,870
can that average we can actually watch
it's nice to be able to interact with

9994
02:53:23,870 --> 02:53:23,880
it's nice to be able to interact with
 

9995
02:53:23,880 --> 02:53:25,730
it's nice to be able to interact with
the big average of humanity yeah and do

9996
02:53:25,730 --> 02:53:25,740
the big average of humanity yeah and do
 

9997
02:53:25,740 --> 02:53:28,370
the big average of humanity yeah and do
like a search query on it yeah yeah it's

9998
02:53:28,370 --> 02:53:28,380
like a search query on it yeah yeah it's
 

9999
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:31,010
like a search query on it yeah yeah it's
very fascinating and uh we can also of

10000
02:53:31,010 --> 02:53:31,020
very fascinating and uh we can also of
 

10001
02:53:31,020 --> 02:53:32,389
very fascinating and uh we can also of
course also like shape it it's not just

10002
02:53:32,389 --> 02:53:32,399
course also like shape it it's not just
 

10003
02:53:32,399 --> 02:53:34,130
course also like shape it it's not just
a pure average we can mess with the

10004
02:53:34,130 --> 02:53:34,140
a pure average we can mess with the
 

10005
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:35,330
a pure average we can mess with the
training data we can mess with the

10006
02:53:35,330 --> 02:53:35,340
training data we can mess with the
 

10007
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:36,590
training data we can mess with the
objective we can fine tune them in

10008
02:53:36,590 --> 02:53:36,600
objective we can fine tune them in
 

10009
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:38,990
objective we can fine tune them in
various ways so we have some

10010
02:53:38,990 --> 02:53:39,000
various ways so we have some
 

10011
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,929
various ways so we have some
um you know impact on what those systems

10012
02:53:41,929 --> 02:53:41,939
um you know impact on what those systems
 

10013
02:53:41,939 --> 02:53:45,769
um you know impact on what those systems
look like if you want to achieve AGI

10014
02:53:45,769 --> 02:53:45,779
look like if you want to achieve AGI
 

10015
02:53:45,779 --> 02:53:47,389
look like if you want to achieve AGI
um and you could have a conversation

10016
02:53:47,389 --> 02:53:47,399
um and you could have a conversation
 

10017
02:53:47,399 --> 02:53:50,389
um and you could have a conversation
with her and ask her uh talk about

10018
02:53:50,389 --> 02:53:50,399
with her and ask her uh talk about
 

10019
02:53:50,399 --> 02:53:52,130
with her and ask her uh talk about
anything maybe ask her a question what

10020
02:53:52,130 --> 02:53:52,140
anything maybe ask her a question what
 

10021
02:53:52,140 --> 02:53:54,469
anything maybe ask her a question what
kind of stuff would you would you ask I

10022
02:53:54,469 --> 02:53:54,479
kind of stuff would you would you ask I
 

10023
02:53:54,479 --> 02:53:55,610
kind of stuff would you would you ask I
would have some practical questions in

10024
02:53:55,610 --> 02:53:55,620
would have some practical questions in
 

10025
02:53:55,620 --> 02:53:58,790
would have some practical questions in
my mind like uh do I or my loved ones

10026
02:53:58,790 --> 02:53:58,800
my mind like uh do I or my loved ones
 

10027
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:00,650
my mind like uh do I or my loved ones
really have to die uh what can we do

10028
02:54:00,650 --> 02:54:00,660
really have to die uh what can we do
 

10029
02:54:00,660 --> 02:54:02,170
really have to die uh what can we do
about that

10030
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:02,180
about that
 

10031
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:04,849
about that
do you think it will answer clearly or

10032
02:54:04,849 --> 02:54:04,859
do you think it will answer clearly or
 

10033
02:54:04,859 --> 02:54:07,190
do you think it will answer clearly or
would it answer poetically

10034
02:54:07,190 --> 02:54:07,200
would it answer poetically
 

10035
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:09,230
would it answer poetically
I would expect it to give Solutions I

10036
02:54:09,230 --> 02:54:09,240
I would expect it to give Solutions I
 

10037
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:10,550
I would expect it to give Solutions I
would expect it to be like well I've

10038
02:54:10,550 --> 02:54:10,560
would expect it to be like well I've
 

10039
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:12,230
would expect it to be like well I've
read all of these textbooks and I know

10040
02:54:12,230 --> 02:54:12,240
read all of these textbooks and I know
 

10041
02:54:12,240 --> 02:54:13,490
read all of these textbooks and I know
all these things that you've produced

10042
02:54:13,490 --> 02:54:13,500
all these things that you've produced
 

10043
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:14,690
all these things that you've produced
and it seems to me like here are the

10044
02:54:14,690 --> 02:54:14,700
and it seems to me like here are the
 

10045
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:15,950
and it seems to me like here are the
experiments that I think it would be

10046
02:54:15,950 --> 02:54:15,960
experiments that I think it would be
 

10047
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:18,349
experiments that I think it would be
useful to run next and hear some Gene

10048
02:54:18,349 --> 02:54:18,359
useful to run next and hear some Gene
 

10049
02:54:18,359 --> 02:54:19,429
useful to run next and hear some Gene
therapies that I think would be helpful

10050
02:54:19,429 --> 02:54:19,439
therapies that I think would be helpful
 

10051
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:21,769
therapies that I think would be helpful
and uh here are the kinds of experiments

10052
02:54:21,769 --> 02:54:21,779
and uh here are the kinds of experiments
 

10053
02:54:21,779 --> 02:54:23,570
and uh here are the kinds of experiments
that you should run okay let's go over

10054
02:54:23,570 --> 02:54:23,580
that you should run okay let's go over
 

10055
02:54:23,580 --> 02:54:25,130
that you should run okay let's go over
the Start experiment okay

10056
02:54:25,130 --> 02:54:25,140
the Start experiment okay
 

10057
02:54:25,140 --> 02:54:29,929
the Start experiment okay
imagine that mortality is actually uh

10058
02:54:29,929 --> 02:54:29,939
imagine that mortality is actually uh
 

10059
02:54:29,939 --> 02:54:33,469
imagine that mortality is actually uh
like a prerequisite for happiness so if

10060
02:54:33,469 --> 02:54:33,479
like a prerequisite for happiness so if
 

10061
02:54:33,479 --> 02:54:35,809
like a prerequisite for happiness so if
we become immortal we'll actually become

10062
02:54:35,809 --> 02:54:35,819
we become immortal we'll actually become
 

10063
02:54:35,819 --> 02:54:38,510
we become immortal we'll actually become
deeply unhappy and the model is able to

10064
02:54:38,510 --> 02:54:38,520
deeply unhappy and the model is able to
 

10065
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:40,670
deeply unhappy and the model is able to
know that so what is this supposed to

10066
02:54:40,670 --> 02:54:40,680
know that so what is this supposed to
 

10067
02:54:40,680 --> 02:54:43,070
know that so what is this supposed to
tell you stupid human about it yes you

10068
02:54:43,070 --> 02:54:43,080
tell you stupid human about it yes you
 

10069
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:44,570
tell you stupid human about it yes you
can become a mortal but you will become

10070
02:54:44,570 --> 02:54:44,580
can become a mortal but you will become
 

10071
02:54:44,580 --> 02:54:46,070
can become a mortal but you will become
deeply unhappy

10072
02:54:46,070 --> 02:54:46,080
deeply unhappy
 

10073
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:49,790
deeply unhappy
if if the model is if the AGI system

10074
02:54:49,790 --> 02:54:49,800
if if the model is if the AGI system
 

10075
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:52,010
if if the model is if the AGI system
is trying to empathize with you human

10076
02:54:52,010 --> 02:54:52,020
is trying to empathize with you human
 

10077
02:54:52,020 --> 02:54:54,050
is trying to empathize with you human
what is this supposed to tell you that

10078
02:54:54,050 --> 02:54:54,060
what is this supposed to tell you that
 

10079
02:54:54,060 --> 02:54:56,269
what is this supposed to tell you that
yes you don't have to die but you're

10080
02:54:56,269 --> 02:54:56,279
yes you don't have to die but you're
 

10081
02:54:56,279 --> 02:54:58,429
yes you don't have to die but you're
really not going to like it because that

10082
02:54:58,429 --> 02:54:58,439
really not going to like it because that
 

10083
02:54:58,439 --> 02:55:00,050
really not going to like it because that
is it going to be deeply honest like

10084
02:55:00,050 --> 02:55:00,060
is it going to be deeply honest like
 

10085
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:02,630
is it going to be deeply honest like
there's a Interstellar what is it the AI

10086
02:55:02,630 --> 02:55:02,640
there's a Interstellar what is it the AI
 

10087
02:55:02,640 --> 02:55:07,330
there's a Interstellar what is it the AI
says like humans want 90 honesty

10088
02:55:07,330 --> 02:55:07,340
says like humans want 90 honesty
 

10089
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:10,070
says like humans want 90 honesty
so like you have to pick how honest I

10090
02:55:10,070 --> 02:55:10,080
so like you have to pick how honest I
 

10091
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:11,630
so like you have to pick how honest I
want to answer these practical questions

10092
02:55:11,630 --> 02:55:11,640
want to answer these practical questions
 

10093
02:55:11,640 --> 02:55:14,150
want to answer these practical questions
yeah I love Yeah Interstellar by the way

10094
02:55:14,150 --> 02:55:14,160
yeah I love Yeah Interstellar by the way
 

10095
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:16,190
yeah I love Yeah Interstellar by the way
I think it's like such a sidekick to the

10096
02:55:16,190 --> 02:55:16,200
I think it's like such a sidekick to the
 

10097
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:17,929
I think it's like such a sidekick to the
entire story but

10098
02:55:17,929 --> 02:55:17,939
entire story but
 

10099
02:55:17,939 --> 02:55:19,250
entire story but
at the same time it's like really

10100
02:55:19,250 --> 02:55:19,260
at the same time it's like really
 

10101
02:55:19,260 --> 02:55:21,410
at the same time it's like really
interesting it's kind of limited in

10102
02:55:21,410 --> 02:55:21,420
interesting it's kind of limited in
 

10103
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:23,269
interesting it's kind of limited in
certain ways right yeah it's limited and

10104
02:55:23,269 --> 02:55:23,279
certain ways right yeah it's limited and
 

10105
02:55:23,279 --> 02:55:24,830
certain ways right yeah it's limited and
I think that's totally fine by the way I

10106
02:55:24,830 --> 02:55:24,840
I think that's totally fine by the way I
 

10107
02:55:24,840 --> 02:55:26,990
I think that's totally fine by the way I
don't think uh I think it's

10108
02:55:26,990 --> 02:55:27,000
don't think uh I think it's
 

10109
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,210
don't think uh I think it's
find impossible to have a limited and

10110
02:55:29,210 --> 02:55:29,220
find impossible to have a limited and
 

10111
02:55:29,220 --> 02:55:32,090
find impossible to have a limited and

meant more like say you had infinite

10132
02:55:54,290 --> 02:55:54,300
meant more like say you had infinite
 

10133
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:56,389
meant more like say you had infinite
compute and it's still good to make

10134
02:55:56,389 --> 02:55:56,399
compute and it's still good to make
 

10135
02:55:56,399 --> 02:55:57,950
compute and it's still good to make
mistakes sometimes

10136
02:55:57,950 --> 02:55:57,960
mistakes sometimes
 

10137
02:55:57,960 --> 02:56:00,290
mistakes sometimes
like in order to integrate yourself like

10138
02:56:00,290 --> 02:56:00,300
like in order to integrate yourself like

Hunting uh Robin Williams character
 

10145
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:07,610

says like the human imperfections that's

10146
02:56:07,610 --> 02:56:07,620
says like the human imperfections that's
 

10147
02:56:07,620 --> 02:56:10,490
says like the human imperfections that's
the good stuff right isn't it isn't that

this like we don't want perfect we want
 

10151
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:16,969
this like we don't want perfect we want
flaws in part to form connections with

10152
02:56:16,969 --> 02:56:16,979
flaws in part to form connections with
 

10153
02:56:16,979 --> 02:56:18,290
flaws in part to form connections with
each other because it feels like

10154
02:56:18,290 --> 02:56:18,300
each other because it feels like
 

10155
02:56:18,300 --> 02:56:19,849
each other because it feels like
something you can attach your feelings

10156
02:56:19,849 --> 02:56:19,859
something you can attach your feelings
 

10157
02:56:19,859 --> 02:56:20,750
something you can attach your feelings
to

10158
02:56:20,750 --> 02:56:20,760
to
 

10159
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:24,290
to
the the flaws in that same way you want

10160
02:56:24,290 --> 02:56:24,300
the the flaws in that same way you want
 

10161
02:56:24,300 --> 02:56:27,170
the the flaws in that same way you want
an AI That's flawed I don't know I feel

10162
02:56:27,170 --> 02:56:27,180
an AI That's flawed I don't know I feel
 

10163
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:28,550
an AI That's flawed I don't know I feel
like perfectionist but then you're

10164
02:56:28,550 --> 02:56:28,560
like perfectionist but then you're
 

10165
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:31,190
like perfectionist but then you're
saying okay yeah but that's not AGI but

10166
02:56:31,190 --> 02:56:31,200
saying okay yeah but that's not AGI but
 

10167
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:33,710
saying okay yeah but that's not AGI but
see AGI would need to be intelligent

10168
02:56:33,710 --> 02:56:33,720
see AGI would need to be intelligent
 

10169
02:56:33,720 --> 02:56:35,630
see AGI would need to be intelligent
enough to give answers to humans that

10170
02:56:35,630 --> 02:56:35,640
enough to give answers to humans that
 

10171
02:56:35,640 --> 02:56:37,370
enough to give answers to humans that
humans don't understand and I think

10172
02:56:37,370 --> 02:56:37,380
humans don't understand and I think
 

10173
02:56:37,380 --> 02:56:39,290
humans don't understand and I think
perfect isn't something humans can't

10174
02:56:39,290 --> 02:56:39,300
perfect isn't something humans can't
 

10175
02:56:39,300 --> 02:56:41,389
perfect isn't something humans can't
understand because even science doesn't

10176
02:56:41,389 --> 02:56:41,399
understand because even science doesn't
 

10177
02:56:41,399 --> 02:56:43,969
understand because even science doesn't
give perfect answers there's always gabs

10178
02:56:43,969 --> 02:56:43,979
give perfect answers there's always gabs
 

10179
02:56:43,979 --> 02:56:47,570
give perfect answers there's always gabs
and Mysteries and I don't know I I don't

10180
02:56:47,570 --> 02:56:47,580
and Mysteries and I don't know I I don't
 

10181
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:49,849
and Mysteries and I don't know I I don't
know if humans want perfect

10182
02:56:49,849 --> 02:56:49,859
know if humans want perfect
 

10183
02:56:49,859 --> 02:56:52,370
know if humans want perfect
yeah I could imagine just uh having a

10184
02:56:52,370 --> 02:56:52,380
yeah I could imagine just uh having a
 

10185
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:53,870
yeah I could imagine just uh having a
conversation with this kind of Oracle

10186
02:56:53,870 --> 02:56:53,880
conversation with this kind of Oracle
 

10187
02:56:53,880 --> 02:56:56,570
conversation with this kind of Oracle
entity as you'd imagine them and uh yeah

10188
02:56:56,570 --> 02:56:56,580
entity as you'd imagine them and uh yeah
 

10189
02:56:56,580 --> 02:56:58,730
entity as you'd imagine them and uh yeah
maybe it can tell you about

10190
02:56:58,730 --> 02:56:58,740
maybe it can tell you about
 

10191
02:56:58,740 --> 02:57:00,410
maybe it can tell you about
you know based on my analysis of Human

10192
02:57:00,410 --> 02:57:00,420
you know based on my analysis of Human
 

10193
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:03,410
you know based on my analysis of Human
Condition uh you might not want this and

10194
02:57:03,410 --> 02:57:03,420
Condition uh you might not want this and
 

10195
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:04,610
Condition uh you might not want this and
here are some of the things that might

10196
02:57:04,610 --> 02:57:04,620
here are some of the things that might
 

10197
02:57:04,620 --> 02:57:08,090
here are some of the things that might
but every every dumb human will say yeah

10198
02:57:08,090 --> 02:57:08,100
but every every dumb human will say yeah
 

10199
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:11,630
but every every dumb human will say yeah
yeah trust me I can give me the truth I

10200
02:57:11,630 --> 02:57:11,640
yeah trust me I can give me the truth I
 

10201
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:13,250
yeah trust me I can give me the truth I
can handle it but that's the beauty a

10202
02:57:13,250 --> 02:57:13,260
can handle it but that's the beauty a
 

10203
02:57:13,260 --> 02:57:17,230
can handle it but that's the beauty a
lot of people can choose uh so but then

10204
02:57:17,230 --> 02:57:17,240
lot of people can choose uh so but then
 

10205
02:57:17,240 --> 02:57:19,969
lot of people can choose uh so but then
the old marshmallow test with the kids

10206
02:57:19,969 --> 02:57:19,979
the old marshmallow test with the kids
 

10207
02:57:19,979 --> 02:57:22,490
the old marshmallow test with the kids
and so on I feel like too many people

10208
02:57:22,490 --> 02:57:22,500
and so on I feel like too many people
 

10209
02:57:22,500 --> 02:57:25,429
and so on I feel like too many people
uh like it can't handle the truth

10210
02:57:25,429 --> 02:57:25,439
uh like it can't handle the truth
 

10211
02:57:25,439 --> 02:57:27,590
uh like it can't handle the truth
probably including myself like the Deep

10212
02:57:27,590 --> 02:57:27,600
probably including myself like the Deep
 

10213
02:57:27,600 --> 02:57:29,150
probably including myself like the Deep
truth of The Human Condition I don't I

10214
02:57:29,150 --> 02:57:29,160
truth of The Human Condition I don't I
 

10215
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:31,490
truth of The Human Condition I don't I
don't know if I can handle it like what

10216
02:57:31,490 --> 02:57:31,500
don't know if I can handle it like what
 

10217
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:33,650
don't know if I can handle it like what
if there's some dark stuff what if we

10218
02:57:33,650 --> 02:57:33,660
if there's some dark stuff what if we
 

10219
02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:36,170
if there's some dark stuff what if we
are an alien science experiment and it

10220
02:57:36,170 --> 02:57:36,180
are an alien science experiment and it
 

10221
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:38,750
are an alien science experiment and it
realizes that what if it had I mean

10222
02:57:38,750 --> 02:57:38,760
realizes that what if it had I mean
 

10223
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:40,910
realizes that what if it had I mean
I mean this is the Matrix you know the

10224
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:40,920
I mean this is the Matrix you know the
 

10225
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:42,429
I mean this is the Matrix you know the
middle over again

10226
02:57:42,429 --> 02:57:42,439
middle over again
 

10227
02:57:42,439 --> 02:57:45,769
middle over again
I don't know I would what would I talk

10228
02:57:45,769 --> 02:57:45,779
I don't know I would what would I talk
 

10229
02:57:45,779 --> 02:57:49,070
I don't know I would what would I talk
about I don't even yeah I

10230
02:57:49,070 --> 02:57:49,080
about I don't even yeah I
 

10231
02:57:49,080 --> 02:57:51,349
about I don't even yeah I
uh probably I will go with the save for

10232
02:57:51,349 --> 02:57:51,359
uh probably I will go with the save for
 

10233
02:57:51,359 --> 02:57:53,150
uh probably I will go with the save for
scientific questions at first that have

10234
02:57:53,150 --> 02:57:53,160
scientific questions at first that have
 

10235
02:57:53,160 --> 02:57:55,429
scientific questions at first that have
nothing to do with my own personal life

10236
02:57:55,429 --> 02:57:55,439
nothing to do with my own personal life
 

10237
02:57:55,439 --> 02:57:58,670
nothing to do with my own personal life
yeah immortality just like about physics

10238
02:57:58,670 --> 02:57:58,680
yeah immortality just like about physics
 

10239
02:57:58,680 --> 02:58:01,910
yeah immortality just like about physics
and so on yeah uh to build up like let's

10240
02:58:01,910 --> 02:58:01,920
and so on yeah uh to build up like let's
 

10241
02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:03,590
and so on yeah uh to build up like let's
see where it's at or maybe see if it has

10242
02:58:03,590 --> 02:58:03,600
see where it's at or maybe see if it has
 

10243
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:05,510
see where it's at or maybe see if it has
a sense of humor that's another question

10244
02:58:05,510 --> 02:58:05,520
a sense of humor that's another question
 

10245
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:08,030
a sense of humor that's another question
would it be able to uh presumably in

10246
02:58:08,030 --> 02:58:08,040
would it be able to uh presumably in
 

10247
02:58:08,040 --> 02:58:10,130
would it be able to uh presumably in
order to if it understands humans deeply

10248
02:58:10,130 --> 02:58:10,140
order to if it understands humans deeply
 

10249
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:12,250
order to if it understands humans deeply
would able to generate

10250
02:58:12,250 --> 02:58:12,260
would able to generate
 

10251
02:58:12,260 --> 02:58:16,010
would able to generate
uh yep to generate humor yeah I think

10252
02:58:16,010 --> 02:58:16,020
uh yep to generate humor yeah I think
 

10253
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:17,809
uh yep to generate humor yeah I think
that's actually a wonderful Benchmark

10254
02:58:17,809 --> 02:58:17,819
that's actually a wonderful Benchmark
 

10255
02:58:17,819 --> 02:58:19,969
that's actually a wonderful Benchmark
almost like is it able I think that's a

10256
02:58:19,969 --> 02:58:19,979
almost like is it able I think that's a
 

10257
02:58:19,979 --> 02:58:22,130
almost like is it able I think that's a
really good point basically to make you

10258
02:58:22,130 --> 02:58:22,140
really good point basically to make you
 

10259
02:58:22,140 --> 02:58:23,690
really good point basically to make you
laugh yeah if it's able to be like a

10260
02:58:23,690 --> 02:58:23,700
laugh yeah if it's able to be like a
 

10261
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:25,250
laugh yeah if it's able to be like a
very effective stand-up comedian that is

10262
02:58:25,250 --> 02:58:25,260
very effective stand-up comedian that is
 

10263
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:26,150
very effective stand-up comedian that is
doing something very interesting

10264
02:58:26,150 --> 02:58:26,160
doing something very interesting
 

10265
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:27,830
doing something very interesting
computationally I think being funny is

10266
02:58:27,830 --> 02:58:27,840
computationally I think being funny is
 

10267
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:30,290
computationally I think being funny is
extremely hard yeah

10268
02:58:30,290 --> 02:58:30,300
extremely hard yeah
 

10269
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:31,969
extremely hard yeah
because

10270
02:58:31,969 --> 02:58:31,979
because
 

10271
02:58:31,979 --> 02:58:35,210
because
it's hard in a way like a touring test

10272
02:58:35,210 --> 02:58:35,220
it's hard in a way like a touring test
 

10273
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:37,790
it's hard in a way like a touring test
the original intent of the touring test

10274
02:58:37,790 --> 02:58:37,800
the original intent of the touring test
 

10275
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:39,469
the original intent of the touring test
is hard because you have to convince

10276
02:58:39,469 --> 02:58:39,479
is hard because you have to convince
 

10277
02:58:39,479 --> 02:58:43,070
is hard because you have to convince
humans and there's nothing that's why

10278
02:58:43,070 --> 02:58:43,080
humans and there's nothing that's why
 

10279
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:45,230
humans and there's nothing that's why
that's why when comedians talk about

10280
02:58:45,230 --> 02:58:45,240
that's why when comedians talk about
 

10281
02:58:45,240 --> 02:58:47,630
that's why when comedians talk about
this like there's this is deeply honest

10282
02:58:47,630 --> 02:58:47,640
this like there's this is deeply honest
 

10283
02:58:47,640 --> 02:58:49,730
this like there's this is deeply honest
because if people can't help but laugh

10284
02:58:49,730 --> 02:58:49,740
because if people can't help but laugh
 

10285
02:58:49,740 --> 02:58:51,290
because if people can't help but laugh
and if they don't laugh that means

10286
02:58:51,290 --> 02:58:51,300
and if they don't laugh that means
 

10287
02:58:51,300 --> 02:58:52,910
and if they don't laugh that means
you're not funny they laugh that's funny

10288
02:58:52,910 --> 02:58:52,920
you're not funny they laugh that's funny
 

10289
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:54,530
you're not funny they laugh that's funny
and you're showing you need a lot of

10290
02:58:54,530 --> 02:58:54,540
and you're showing you need a lot of
 

10291
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:56,330
and you're showing you need a lot of
knowledge to create to create humor

10292
02:58:56,330 --> 02:58:56,340
knowledge to create to create humor
 

10293
02:58:56,340 --> 02:58:57,889
knowledge to create to create humor
about like the occupational Human

10294
02:58:57,889 --> 02:58:57,899
about like the occupational Human
 

10295
02:58:57,899 --> 02:58:59,150
about like the occupational Human
Condition and so on and then you need to

10296
02:58:59,150 --> 02:58:59,160
Condition and so on and then you need to
 

10297
02:58:59,160 --> 02:59:00,889
Condition and so on and then you need to
be clever with it

10298
02:59:00,889 --> 02:59:00,899
be clever with it
 

10299
02:59:00,899 --> 02:59:02,630
be clever with it
uh you mentioned a few movies you

10300
02:59:02,630 --> 02:59:02,640
uh you mentioned a few movies you
 

10301
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:04,790
uh you mentioned a few movies you
tweeted movies that I've seen five plus

and participate in it just figure out
 

10455
03:01:48,960 --> 03:01:51,050
and participate in it just figure out
how to deal with this transition I think

10456
03:01:51,050 --> 03:01:51,060
how to deal with this transition I think
 

10457
03:01:51,060 --> 03:01:52,670
how to deal with this transition I think
which is going to be interesting I draw

10458
03:01:52,670 --> 03:01:52,680
which is going to be interesting I draw
 

10459
03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:54,230
which is going to be interesting I draw
a lot of inspiration from nuclear

10460
03:01:54,230 --> 03:01:54,240
a lot of inspiration from nuclear
 

10461
03:01:54,240 --> 03:01:56,690
a lot of inspiration from nuclear
weapons because I sure thought it would

10462
03:01:56,690 --> 03:01:56,700
weapons because I sure thought it would
 

10463
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:59,150
weapons because I sure thought it would
be it would be [\h__\h] once they develop

10464
03:01:59,150 --> 03:01:59,160
be it would be [\h__\h] once they develop
 

10465
03:01:59,160 --> 03:02:01,250
be it would be [\h__\h] once they develop
nuclear weapons but like it's almost

10466
03:02:01,250 --> 03:02:01,260
nuclear weapons but like it's almost
 

10467
03:02:01,260 --> 03:02:02,650
nuclear weapons but like it's almost
like

10468
03:02:02,650 --> 03:02:02,660
like
 

10469
03:02:02,660 --> 03:02:06,170
like
uh when the when the systems are not so

10470
03:02:06,170 --> 03:02:06,180
uh when the when the systems are not so
 

10471
03:02:06,180 --> 03:02:07,250
uh when the when the systems are not so
dangerous they destroy human

10472
03:02:07,250 --> 03:02:07,260
dangerous they destroy human
 

10473
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:09,170
dangerous they destroy human
civilization we deploy them and learn

10474
03:02:09,170 --> 03:02:09,180
civilization we deploy them and learn
 

10475
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:12,230
civilization we deploy them and learn
the lessons and then we quickly if it's

10476
03:02:12,230 --> 03:02:12,240
the lessons and then we quickly if it's
 

10477
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:13,969
the lessons and then we quickly if it's
too dangerous we're quickly quicker we

10478
03:02:13,969 --> 03:02:13,979
too dangerous we're quickly quicker we
 

10479
03:02:13,979 --> 03:02:16,429
too dangerous we're quickly quicker we
might still deploy it uh but you very

10480
03:02:16,429 --> 03:02:16,439
might still deploy it uh but you very
 

10481
03:02:16,439 --> 03:02:18,110
might still deploy it uh but you very
quickly learn not to use them and so

10482
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:18,120
quickly learn not to use them and so
 

10483
03:02:18,120 --> 03:02:19,490
quickly learn not to use them and so
there'll be like this balance that you

10484
03:02:19,490 --> 03:02:19,500
there'll be like this balance that you
 

10485
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:22,070
there'll be like this balance that you
humans are very clever as a species it's

10486
03:02:22,070 --> 03:02:22,080
humans are very clever as a species it's
 

10487
03:02:22,080 --> 03:02:24,889
humans are very clever as a species it's
interesting we exploit the resources as

10488
03:02:24,889 --> 03:02:24,899
interesting we exploit the resources as
 

10489
03:02:24,899 --> 03:02:26,750
interesting we exploit the resources as
much as we can but we don't we avoid

10490
03:02:26,750 --> 03:02:26,760
much as we can but we don't we avoid
 

10491
03:02:26,760 --> 03:02:29,030
much as we can but we don't we avoid
destroying ourselves it seems like

10492
03:02:29,030 --> 03:02:29,040
destroying ourselves it seems like
 

10493
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:31,070
destroying ourselves it seems like
well I don't know about that actually I

10494
03:02:31,070 --> 03:02:31,080
well I don't know about that actually I
 

10495
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:32,570
well I don't know about that actually I
hope it continues

10496
03:02:32,570 --> 03:02:32,580
hope it continues
 

10497
03:02:32,580 --> 03:02:33,530
hope it continues
um

10498
03:02:33,530 --> 03:02:33,540
um
 

10499
03:02:33,540 --> 03:02:35,030
um
I mean I'm definitely like concerned

10500
03:02:35,030 --> 03:02:35,040
I mean I'm definitely like concerned
 

10501
03:02:35,040 --> 03:02:37,309
I mean I'm definitely like concerned
about nuclear weapons and so on not just

10502
03:02:37,309 --> 03:02:37,319
about nuclear weapons and so on not just
 

10503
03:02:37,319 --> 03:02:39,110
about nuclear weapons and so on not just
as a result of the recent conflict even

10504
03:02:39,110 --> 03:02:39,120
as a result of the recent conflict even
 

10505
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:41,570
as a result of the recent conflict even
before that uh that's probably like my

10506
03:02:41,570 --> 03:02:41,580
before that uh that's probably like my
 

10507
03:02:41,580 --> 03:02:43,849
before that uh that's probably like my
number one concern for society so if

10508
03:02:43,849 --> 03:02:43,859
number one concern for society so if
 

10509
03:02:43,859 --> 03:02:47,450
number one concern for society so if
Humanity uh destroys itself

10510
03:02:47,450 --> 03:02:47,460
Humanity uh destroys itself
 

10511
03:02:47,460 --> 03:02:50,809
Humanity uh destroys itself
or destroys you know 90 of people that

10512
03:02:50,809 --> 03:02:50,819
or destroys you know 90 of people that
 

10513
03:02:50,819 --> 03:02:53,990
or destroys you know 90 of people that
would be because of nukes I think so

10514
03:02:53,990 --> 03:02:54,000
would be because of nukes I think so
 

10515
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:55,309
would be because of nukes I think so
um and it's not even about full

10516
03:02:55,309 --> 03:02:55,319
um and it's not even about full
 

10517
03:02:55,319 --> 03:02:57,230
um and it's not even about full
destruction to me it's bad enough if we

10518
03:02:57,230 --> 03:02:57,240
destruction to me it's bad enough if we
 

10519
03:02:57,240 --> 03:02:58,550
destruction to me it's bad enough if we
reset society that would be like

10520
03:02:58,550 --> 03:02:58,560
reset society that would be like
 

10521
03:02:58,560 --> 03:03:00,590
reset society that would be like
terrible it would be really bad and I

10522
03:03:00,590 --> 03:03:00,600
terrible it would be really bad and I
 

10523
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:02,929
terrible it would be really bad and I
can't believe we're like so close to it

10524
03:03:02,929 --> 03:03:02,939
can't believe we're like so close to it
 

10525
03:03:02,939 --> 03:03:05,690
can't believe we're like so close to it
yeah it's like so crazy to me it feels

10526
03:03:05,690 --> 03:03:05,700
yeah it's like so crazy to me it feels
 

10527
03:03:05,700 --> 03:03:07,429
yeah it's like so crazy to me it feels
like we might be a few tweets away from

10528
03:03:07,429 --> 03:03:07,439
like we might be a few tweets away from
 

10529
03:03:07,439 --> 03:03:10,070
like we might be a few tweets away from
something like that yep basically it's

10530
03:03:10,070 --> 03:03:10,080
something like that yep basically it's
 

10531
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:12,590
something like that yep basically it's
extremely unnerving but and has been for

10532
03:03:12,590 --> 03:03:12,600
extremely unnerving but and has been for
 

10533
03:03:12,600 --> 03:03:14,090
extremely unnerving but and has been for
me for a long time

10534
03:03:14,090 --> 03:03:14,100
me for a long time
 

10535
03:03:14,100 --> 03:03:18,469
me for a long time
it seems unstable that world leaders

10536
03:03:18,469 --> 03:03:18,479
it seems unstable that world leaders
 

10537
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:20,630
it seems unstable that world leaders
just having a bad mood

10538
03:03:20,630 --> 03:03:20,640
just having a bad mood
 

10539
03:03:20,640 --> 03:03:22,730
just having a bad mood
can like um

10540
03:03:22,730 --> 03:03:22,740
can like um
 

10541
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:24,889
can like um
take one step towards a bad Direction

10542
03:03:24,889 --> 03:03:24,899
take one step towards a bad Direction
 

10543
03:03:24,899 --> 03:03:28,969
take one step towards a bad Direction
and it escalates yeah and because of a

10544
03:03:28,969 --> 03:03:28,979
and it escalates yeah and because of a
 

10545
03:03:28,979 --> 03:03:31,309
and it escalates yeah and because of a
collection of bad moods it can escalate

10546
03:03:31,309 --> 03:03:31,319
collection of bad moods it can escalate
 

10547
03:03:31,319 --> 03:03:32,990
collection of bad moods it can escalate
without being able to

10548
03:03:32,990 --> 03:03:33,000
without being able to
 

10549
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:34,429
without being able to
um stop

10550
03:03:34,429 --> 03:03:34,439
um stop
 

10551
03:03:34,439 --> 03:03:36,530
um stop
yeah it's just it's a huge amount of uh

10552
03:03:36,530 --> 03:03:36,540
yeah it's just it's a huge amount of uh
 

10553
03:03:36,540 --> 03:03:38,570
yeah it's just it's a huge amount of uh
Power and then also with the

10554
03:03:38,570 --> 03:03:38,580
Power and then also with the
 

10555
03:03:38,580 --> 03:03:40,370
Power and then also with the
proliferation and basically I don't I

10556
03:03:40,370 --> 03:03:40,380
proliferation and basically I don't I
 

10557
03:03:40,380 --> 03:03:42,230
proliferation and basically I don't I
don't actually really see I don't

10558
03:03:42,230 --> 03:03:42,240
don't actually really see I don't
 

10559
03:03:42,240 --> 03:03:43,309
don't actually really see I don't
actually know what the good outcomes are

10560
03:03:43,309 --> 03:03:43,319
actually know what the good outcomes are
 

10561
03:03:43,319 --> 03:03:44,110
actually know what the good outcomes are
here

10562
03:03:44,110 --> 03:03:44,120
here
 

10563
03:03:44,120 --> 03:03:46,130
here
uh so I'm definitely worried about that

10564
03:03:46,130 --> 03:03:46,140
uh so I'm definitely worried about that
 

10565
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:48,170
uh so I'm definitely worried about that
a lot and then AGI is not currently

10566
03:03:48,170 --> 03:03:48,180
a lot and then AGI is not currently
 

10567
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:50,030
a lot and then AGI is not currently
there but I think at some point we'll

10568
03:03:50,030 --> 03:03:50,040
there but I think at some point we'll
 

10569
03:03:50,040 --> 03:03:52,790
there but I think at some point we'll
more and more become uh something like

10570
03:03:52,790 --> 03:03:52,800
more and more become uh something like
 

10571
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:55,670
more and more become uh something like
it the danger with AGI even is that I

10572
03:03:55,670 --> 03:03:55,680
it the danger with AGI even is that I
 

10573
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:57,290
it the danger with AGI even is that I
think it's even less likely worse in a

10574
03:03:57,290 --> 03:03:57,300
think it's even less likely worse in a
 

10575
03:03:57,300 --> 03:03:58,610
think it's even less likely worse in a
sense that

10576
03:03:58,610 --> 03:03:58,620
sense that
 

10577
03:03:58,620 --> 03:04:01,670
sense that
uh there are good outcomes of AGI and

10578
03:04:01,670 --> 03:04:01,680
uh there are good outcomes of AGI and
 

10579
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:03,290
uh there are good outcomes of AGI and
then the bad outcomes are like an

10580
03:04:03,290 --> 03:04:03,300
then the bad outcomes are like an
 

10581
03:04:03,300 --> 03:04:05,630
then the bad outcomes are like an
absolute way like a tiny one way and so

10582
03:04:05,630 --> 03:04:05,640
absolute way like a tiny one way and so
 

10583
03:04:05,640 --> 03:04:08,090
absolute way like a tiny one way and so
I think um capitalism and humanity and

10584
03:04:08,090 --> 03:04:08,100
I think um capitalism and humanity and
 

10585
03:04:08,100 --> 03:04:10,130
I think um capitalism and humanity and
so on will drive for the positive

10586
03:04:10,130 --> 03:04:10,140
so on will drive for the positive
 

10587
03:04:10,140 --> 03:04:12,230
so on will drive for the positive
uh ways of using that technology but

10588
03:04:12,230 --> 03:04:12,240
uh ways of using that technology but
 

10589
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:13,670
uh ways of using that technology but
then if bad outcomes are just like a

10590
03:04:13,670 --> 03:04:13,680
then if bad outcomes are just like a
 

10591
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:16,670
then if bad outcomes are just like a
tiny like flipping minus sign away uh

10592
03:04:16,670 --> 03:04:16,680
tiny like flipping minus sign away uh
 

10593
03:04:16,680 --> 03:04:18,530
tiny like flipping minus sign away uh
that's a really bad position to be in a

10594
03:04:18,530 --> 03:04:18,540
that's a really bad position to be in a
 

10595
03:04:18,540 --> 03:04:20,630
that's a really bad position to be in a
tiny perturbation of the system results

10596
03:04:20,630 --> 03:04:20,640
tiny perturbation of the system results
 

10597
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:22,670
tiny perturbation of the system results
in the destruction of the human species

10598
03:04:22,670 --> 03:04:22,680
in the destruction of the human species
 

10599
03:04:22,680 --> 03:04:25,610
in the destruction of the human species
it's a weird line to walk yeah I think

10600
03:04:25,610 --> 03:04:25,620
it's a weird line to walk yeah I think
 

10601
03:04:25,620 --> 03:04:26,750
it's a weird line to walk yeah I think
in general what's really weird about

10602
03:04:26,750 --> 03:04:26,760
in general what's really weird about
 

10603
03:04:26,760 --> 03:04:28,309
in general what's really weird about
like the Dynamics of humanity and this

10604
03:04:28,309 --> 03:04:28,319
like the Dynamics of humanity and this
 

10605
03:04:28,319 --> 03:04:29,750
like the Dynamics of humanity and this
explosion was talked about is just like

10606
03:04:29,750 --> 03:04:29,760
explosion was talked about is just like
 

10607
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:31,790
explosion was talked about is just like
the insane coupling afforded by

10608
03:04:31,790 --> 03:04:31,800
the insane coupling afforded by
 

10609
03:04:31,800 --> 03:04:34,250
the insane coupling afforded by
technology yeah and uh just the

10610
03:04:34,250 --> 03:04:34,260
technology yeah and uh just the
 

10611
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:35,809
technology yeah and uh just the
instability of the whole dynamical

10612
03:04:35,809 --> 03:04:35,819
instability of the whole dynamical
 

10613
03:04:35,819 --> 03:04:37,910
instability of the whole dynamical
system I think it's just it doesn't look

10614
03:04:37,910 --> 03:04:37,920
system I think it's just it doesn't look
 

10615
03:04:37,920 --> 03:04:38,990
system I think it's just it doesn't look
good honestly

10616
03:04:38,990 --> 03:04:39,000
good honestly
 

10617
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,090
good honestly
yes that explosion could be destructive

10618
03:04:41,090 --> 03:04:41,100
yes that explosion could be destructive
 

10619
03:04:41,100 --> 03:04:42,530
yes that explosion could be destructive
and constructive and the probabilities

10620
03:04:42,530 --> 03:04:42,540
and constructive and the probabilities
 

10621
03:04:42,540 --> 03:04:45,349
and constructive and the probabilities
are non-zero in both both senses I'm

10622
03:04:45,349 --> 03:04:45,359
are non-zero in both both senses I'm
 

10623
03:04:45,359 --> 03:04:47,030
are non-zero in both both senses I'm
going to have to I do feel like I have

10624
03:04:47,030 --> 03:04:47,040
going to have to I do feel like I have
 

10625
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:48,830
going to have to I do feel like I have
to try to be optimistic and so on and

10626
03:04:48,830 --> 03:04:48,840
to try to be optimistic and so on and
 

10627
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:50,630
to try to be optimistic and so on and
yes I think even in this case I still am

10628
03:04:50,630 --> 03:04:50,640
yes I think even in this case I still am
 

10629
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:52,130
yes I think even in this case I still am
predominantly optimistic but there's

10630
03:04:52,130 --> 03:04:52,140
predominantly optimistic but there's
 

10631
03:04:52,140 --> 03:04:53,510
predominantly optimistic but there's
definitely

10632
03:04:53,510 --> 03:04:53,520
definitely
 

10633
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:55,910
definitely
me too uh do you think we'll become a

10634
03:04:55,910 --> 03:04:55,920
me too uh do you think we'll become a
 

10635
03:04:55,920 --> 03:04:58,550
me too uh do you think we'll become a
multiplayer species

10636
03:04:58,550 --> 03:04:58,560
multiplayer species
 

10637
03:04:58,560 --> 03:05:00,410
multiplayer species
probably yes but I don't know if it's

10638
03:05:00,410 --> 03:05:00,420
probably yes but I don't know if it's
 

10639
03:05:00,420 --> 03:05:03,250
probably yes but I don't know if it's
dominant feature of uh future Humanity

10640
03:05:03,250 --> 03:05:03,260
dominant feature of uh future Humanity
 

10641
03:05:03,260 --> 03:05:06,230
dominant feature of uh future Humanity
uh there might be some people on some

10642
03:05:06,230 --> 03:05:06,240
uh there might be some people on some
 

10643
03:05:06,240 --> 03:05:07,550
uh there might be some people on some
planets and so on but I'm not sure if

10644
03:05:07,550 --> 03:05:07,560
planets and so on but I'm not sure if
 

10645
03:05:07,560 --> 03:05:08,510
planets and so on but I'm not sure if
it's like

10646
03:05:08,510 --> 03:05:08,520
it's like
 

10647
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:10,790
it's like
yeah if it's like a major player in our

10648
03:05:10,790 --> 03:05:10,800
yeah if it's like a major player in our
 

10649
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:13,730
yeah if it's like a major player in our
culture and so on we still have to solve

10650
03:05:13,730 --> 03:05:13,740
culture and so on we still have to solve
 

10651
03:05:13,740 --> 03:05:16,130
culture and so on we still have to solve
the drivers of self-destruction here on

10652
03:05:16,130 --> 03:05:16,140
the drivers of self-destruction here on
 

10653
03:05:16,140 --> 03:05:18,590
the drivers of self-destruction here on
Earth so just having a backup on Mars is

10654
03:05:18,590 --> 03:05:18,600
Earth so just having a backup on Mars is
 

10655
03:05:18,600 --> 03:05:20,809
Earth so just having a backup on Mars is
not going to solve the problem so by the

10656
03:05:20,809 --> 03:05:20,819
not going to solve the problem so by the
 

10657
03:05:20,819 --> 03:05:22,190
not going to solve the problem so by the
way I love the backup on Mars I think

10658
03:05:22,190 --> 03:05:22,200
way I love the backup on Mars I think
 

10659
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:23,690
way I love the backup on Mars I think
that's amazing you should absolutely do

10660
03:05:23,690 --> 03:05:23,700
that's amazing you should absolutely do
 

10661
03:05:23,700 --> 03:05:26,990
that's amazing you should absolutely do
that yes and I'm so thankful uh and

10662
03:05:26,990 --> 03:05:27,000
that yes and I'm so thankful uh and
 

10663
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,870
that yes and I'm so thankful uh and
would you go to Mars uh personally no I

10664
03:05:29,870 --> 03:05:29,880
would you go to Mars uh personally no I
 

10665
03:05:29,880 --> 03:05:32,210
would you go to Mars uh personally no I
do like Earth quite a lot okay uh I'll

10666
03:05:32,210 --> 03:05:32,220
do like Earth quite a lot okay uh I'll
 

10667
03:05:32,220 --> 03:05:34,309
do like Earth quite a lot okay uh I'll
go to Mars I'll go for you unless I'll

10668
03:05:34,309 --> 03:05:34,319
go to Mars I'll go for you unless I'll
 

10669
03:05:34,319 --> 03:05:36,110
go to Mars I'll go for you unless I'll
tweet at you from there maybe eventually

10670
03:05:36,110 --> 03:05:36,120
tweet at you from there maybe eventually
 

10671
03:05:36,120 --> 03:05:38,030
tweet at you from there maybe eventually
I would once it's uh safe enough but I

10672
03:05:38,030 --> 03:05:38,040
I would once it's uh safe enough but I
 

10673
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:39,469
I would once it's uh safe enough but I
don't actually know if it's on my

10674
03:05:39,469 --> 03:05:39,479
don't actually know if it's on my
 

10675
03:05:39,479 --> 03:05:41,570
don't actually know if it's on my
lifetime scale unless I can extend it by

10676
03:05:41,570 --> 03:05:41,580
lifetime scale unless I can extend it by
 

10677
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:42,830
lifetime scale unless I can extend it by
a lot

10678
03:05:42,830 --> 03:05:42,840
a lot
 

10679
03:05:42,840 --> 03:05:44,389
a lot
I do think that for example a lot of

10680
03:05:44,389 --> 03:05:44,399
I do think that for example a lot of
 

10681
03:05:44,399 --> 03:05:46,250
I do think that for example a lot of
people might disappear into

10682
03:05:46,250 --> 03:05:46,260
people might disappear into
 

10683
03:05:46,260 --> 03:05:47,690
people might disappear into
um virtual realities and stuff like that

10684
03:05:47,690 --> 03:05:47,700
um virtual realities and stuff like that
 

10685
03:05:47,700 --> 03:05:48,830
um virtual realities and stuff like that
and I think that could be the major

10686
03:05:48,830 --> 03:05:48,840
and I think that could be the major
 

10687
03:05:48,840 --> 03:05:50,269
and I think that could be the major
thrust of

10688
03:05:50,269 --> 03:05:50,279
thrust of
 

10689
03:05:50,279 --> 03:05:51,650
thrust of
um sort of the cultural development of

10690
03:05:51,650 --> 03:05:51,660
um sort of the cultural development of
 

10691
03:05:51,660 --> 03:05:54,410
um sort of the cultural development of
humanity if it survives uh so it might

10692
03:05:54,410 --> 03:05:54,420
humanity if it survives uh so it might
 

10693
03:05:54,420 --> 03:05:56,330
humanity if it survives uh so it might
not be it's just really hard to work in

10694
03:05:56,330 --> 03:05:56,340
not be it's just really hard to work in
 

10695
03:05:56,340 --> 03:05:58,790
not be it's just really hard to work in
Physical Realm and go out there and I

10696
03:05:58,790 --> 03:05:58,800
Physical Realm and go out there and I
 

10697
03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:00,110
Physical Realm and go out there and I
think ultimately all your experiences

10698
03:06:00,110 --> 03:06:00,120
think ultimately all your experiences
 

10699
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:03,110
think ultimately all your experiences
are in your brain yeah and so it's much

10700
03:06:03,110 --> 03:06:03,120
are in your brain yeah and so it's much
 

10701
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:05,570
are in your brain yeah and so it's much
easier to disappear into digital Realm

10702
03:06:05,570 --> 03:06:05,580
easier to disappear into digital Realm
 

10703
03:06:05,580 --> 03:06:07,130
easier to disappear into digital Realm
and I think people will find them more

10704
03:06:07,130 --> 03:06:07,140
and I think people will find them more
 

10705
03:06:07,140 --> 03:06:09,769
and I think people will find them more
compelling easier safer

10706
03:06:09,769 --> 03:06:09,779
compelling easier safer
 

10707
03:06:09,779 --> 03:06:11,510
compelling easier safer
more interesting so you're a little bit

10708
03:06:11,510 --> 03:06:11,520
more interesting so you're a little bit
 

10709
03:06:11,520 --> 03:06:13,370
more interesting so you're a little bit
captivated by Virtual Reality by the

10710
03:06:13,370 --> 03:06:13,380
captivated by Virtual Reality by the
 

10711
03:06:13,380 --> 03:06:14,929
captivated by Virtual Reality by the
possible worlds whether it's the

10712
03:06:14,929 --> 03:06:14,939
possible worlds whether it's the
 

10713
03:06:14,939 --> 03:06:16,610
possible worlds whether it's the
metaverse or some other manifestation of

10714
03:06:16,610 --> 03:06:16,620
metaverse or some other manifestation of
 

10715
03:06:16,620 --> 03:06:18,110
metaverse or some other manifestation of
that yeah

10716
03:06:18,110 --> 03:06:18,120
that yeah
 

10717
03:06:18,120 --> 03:06:21,230
that yeah
yeah it's really interesting it's uh

10718
03:06:21,230 --> 03:06:21,240
yeah it's really interesting it's uh
 

10719
03:06:21,240 --> 03:06:24,170
yeah it's really interesting it's uh
I'm I'm interested just just talking a

10720
03:06:24,170 --> 03:06:24,180
I'm I'm interested just just talking a
 

10721
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:27,050
I'm I'm interested just just talking a
lot to Carmack where's the

10722
03:06:27,050 --> 03:06:27,060
lot to Carmack where's the
 

10723
03:06:27,060 --> 03:06:28,490
lot to Carmack where's the
where's the thing that's currently

10724
03:06:28,490 --> 03:06:28,500
where's the thing that's currently
 

10725
03:06:28,500 --> 03:06:30,710
where's the thing that's currently
preventing that yeah I mean to be clear

10726
03:06:30,710 --> 03:06:30,720
preventing that yeah I mean to be clear
 

10727
03:06:30,720 --> 03:06:32,030
preventing that yeah I mean to be clear
I think what's interesting about the

10728
03:06:32,030 --> 03:06:32,040
I think what's interesting about the
 

10729
03:06:32,040 --> 03:06:33,650
I think what's interesting about the
future is

10730
03:06:33,650 --> 03:06:33,660
future is
 

10731
03:06:33,660 --> 03:06:35,210
future is
um it's not that

10732
03:06:35,210 --> 03:06:35,220
um it's not that
 

10733
03:06:35,220 --> 03:06:36,769
um it's not that
I kind of feel like

10734
03:06:36,769 --> 03:06:36,779
I kind of feel like
 

10735
03:06:36,779 --> 03:06:38,150
I kind of feel like
the variance in The Human Condition

10736
03:06:38,150 --> 03:06:38,160
the variance in The Human Condition
 

10737
03:06:38,160 --> 03:06:39,950
the variance in The Human Condition
grows that's the primary thing that's

10738
03:06:39,950 --> 03:06:39,960
grows that's the primary thing that's
 

10739
03:06:39,960 --> 03:06:42,290
grows that's the primary thing that's
changing it's not as much the mean of

10740
03:06:42,290 --> 03:06:42,300
changing it's not as much the mean of
 

10741
03:06:42,300 --> 03:06:43,550
changing it's not as much the mean of
the distribution it's like the variance

10742
03:06:43,550 --> 03:06:43,560
the distribution it's like the variance
 

10743
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:44,929
the distribution it's like the variance
of it so there will probably be people

10744
03:06:44,929 --> 03:06:44,939
of it so there will probably be people
 

10745
03:06:44,939 --> 03:06:46,610
of it so there will probably be people
on Mars and there will be people in VR

10746
03:06:46,610 --> 03:06:46,620
on Mars and there will be people in VR
 

10747
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:47,750
on Mars and there will be people in VR
and they're all people here on Earth

10748
03:06:47,750 --> 03:06:47,760
and they're all people here on Earth
 

10749
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:49,190
and they're all people here on Earth
it's just like there will be so many

10750
03:06:49,190 --> 03:06:49,200
it's just like there will be so many
 

10751
03:06:49,200 --> 03:06:50,870
it's just like there will be so many
more ways of being

10752
03:06:50,870 --> 03:06:50,880
more ways of being
 

10753
03:06:50,880 --> 03:06:52,370
more ways of being
and so I kind of feel like I see it as

10754
03:06:52,370 --> 03:06:52,380
and so I kind of feel like I see it as
 

10755
03:06:52,380 --> 03:06:53,690
and so I kind of feel like I see it as
like a spreading out of a human

10756
03:06:53,690 --> 03:06:53,700
like a spreading out of a human
 

10757
03:06:53,700 --> 03:06:55,790
like a spreading out of a human
experience there's something about the

10758
03:06:55,790 --> 03:06:55,800
experience there's something about the
 

10759
03:06:55,800 --> 03:06:56,990
experience there's something about the
internet that allows you to discover

10760
03:06:56,990 --> 03:06:57,000

you you like when you travel across the
world I think you experience this too

10798
03:07:33,110 --> 03:07:33,120
world I think you experience this too
 

10799
03:07:33,120 --> 03:07:34,550
world I think you experience this too
there are certain cultures they're like

10800
03:07:34,550 --> 03:07:34,560
there are certain cultures they're like
 

10801

they have their own thing going on they
 

10803
03:07:36,240 --> 03:07:39,110
they have their own thing going on they
don't and so you can see that happening

10804
03:07:39,110 --> 03:07:39,120
don't and so you can see that happening
 

10805
03:07:39,120 --> 03:07:40,490
don't and so you can see that happening
more and more and more and more in the

10806
03:07:40,490 --> 03:07:40,500
more and more and more and more in the
 

10807
03:07:40,500 --> 03:07:42,410
more and more and more and more in the
future we have little communities yeah

10808
03:07:42,410 --> 03:07:42,420
future we have little communities yeah
 

10809
03:07:42,420 --> 03:07:44,269
future we have little communities yeah
yeah I think so that seems to be the

10810
03:07:44,269 --> 03:07:44,279
yeah I think so that seems to be the
 

10811
03:07:44,279 --> 03:07:46,250
yeah I think so that seems to be the
that seems to be how it's going right

10812
03:07:46,250 --> 03:07:46,260
that seems to be how it's going right
 

10813
03:07:46,260 --> 03:07:47,870
that seems to be how it's going right
now and I don't see that Trend like

10814
03:07:47,870 --> 03:07:47,880
now and I don't see that Trend like
 

10815
03:07:47,880 --> 03:07:49,490
now and I don't see that Trend like
really reversing I think people are

really reversing I think people are
diverse and they're able to choose their

10818
03:07:51,290 --> 03:07:51,300
diverse and they're able to choose their
 

10819
03:07:51,300 --> 03:07:53,450
diverse and they're able to choose their
own like path and existence and I sort

10820
03:07:53,450 --> 03:07:53,460
own like path and existence and I sort
 

10821
03:07:53,460 --> 03:07:55,309
own like path and existence and I sort
of like celebrate that

10822
03:07:55,309 --> 03:07:55,319
of like celebrate that
 

10823
03:07:55,319 --> 03:07:57,650
of like celebrate that

um and so will you spend so much time in
the meters in the virtual reality or

10826
03:08:00,170 --> 03:08:00,180
the meters in the virtual reality or
 

10827

potentially uh representative as like a
 

10915
03:09:40,380 --> 03:09:41,630
potentially uh representative as like a
summary

10916
03:09:41,630 --> 03:09:41,640
summary
 

10917
03:09:41,640 --> 03:09:43,429
summary
of a lot of the things he's been talking

10918
03:09:43,429 --> 03:09:43,439
of a lot of the things he's been talking
 

10919
03:09:43,439 --> 03:09:45,650
of a lot of the things he's been talking
about I was very impacted by the selfish

10920
03:09:45,650 --> 03:09:45,660
about I was very impacted by the selfish
 

10921
03:09:45,660 --> 03:09:47,389
about I was very impacted by the selfish
Gene I thought that was a really good

10922
03:09:47,389 --> 03:09:47,399
Gene I thought that was a really good
 

10923
03:09:47,399 --> 03:09:49,250
Gene I thought that was a really good
book that helped me understand altruism

10924
03:09:49,250 --> 03:09:49,260
book that helped me understand altruism
 

10925
03:09:49,260 --> 03:09:50,690
book that helped me understand altruism
as an example and where it comes from

10926
03:09:50,690 --> 03:09:50,700
as an example and where it comes from
 

10927
03:09:50,700 --> 03:09:52,250
as an example and where it comes from
and just realizing that you know the

10928
03:09:52,250 --> 03:09:52,260
and just realizing that you know the
 

10929
03:09:52,260 --> 03:09:53,809
and just realizing that you know the
selection is in the level of genes was a

10930
03:09:53,809 --> 03:09:53,819
selection is in the level of genes was a
 

10931
03:09:53,819 --> 03:09:55,550
selection is in the level of genes was a
huge insight for me at the time and it

10932
03:09:55,550 --> 03:09:55,560
huge insight for me at the time and it
 

10933
03:09:55,560 --> 03:09:56,630
huge insight for me at the time and it
sort of like cleared up a lot of things

10934
03:09:56,630 --> 03:09:56,640
sort of like cleared up a lot of things
 

10935
03:09:56,640 --> 03:09:58,490
sort of like cleared up a lot of things
for me what do you think about

10936
03:09:58,490 --> 03:09:58,500
for me what do you think about
 

10937
03:09:58,500 --> 03:10:01,550
for me what do you think about
the the idea that ideas of the organisms

10938
03:10:01,550 --> 03:10:01,560
the the idea that ideas of the organisms
 

10939
03:10:01,560 --> 03:10:05,750
the the idea that ideas of the organisms
the means yes love it 100

10940
03:10:05,750 --> 03:10:05,760

 

10941
03:10:05,760 --> 03:10:07,730

are you able to walk around with that

10942
03:10:07,730 --> 03:10:07,740
are you able to walk around with that
 

10943
03:10:07,740 --> 03:10:10,849
are you able to walk around with that
notion for a while that that there is an

10944
03:10:10,849 --> 03:10:10,859
notion for a while that that there is an
 

10945
03:10:10,859 --> 03:10:12,769
notion for a while that that there is an
evolutionary kind of process with ideas

10946
03:10:12,769 --> 03:10:12,779
evolutionary kind of process with ideas
 

10947
03:10:12,779 --> 03:10:14,269
evolutionary kind of process with ideas
as well there absolutely is there's

10948
03:10:14,269 --> 03:10:14,279
as well there absolutely is there's
 

10949
03:10:14,279 --> 03:10:16,490
as well there absolutely is there's
memes just like genes and they compete

10950
03:10:16,490 --> 03:10:16,500
memes just like genes and they compete
 

10951
03:10:16,500 --> 03:10:18,590
memes just like genes and they compete
and they live in our brains it's

10952
03:10:18,590 --> 03:10:18,600
and they live in our brains it's
 

10953
03:10:18,600 --> 03:10:21,050
and they live in our brains it's
beautiful are we silly humans thinking

10954
03:10:21,050 --> 03:10:21,060
beautiful are we silly humans thinking
 

10955
03:10:21,060 --> 03:10:22,730
beautiful are we silly humans thinking
that we're the organisms is it possible

10956
03:10:22,730 --> 03:10:22,740
that we're the organisms is it possible
 

10957
03:10:22,740 --> 03:10:24,250
that we're the organisms is it possible
that the primary

10958
03:10:24,250 --> 03:10:24,260
that the primary
 

10959
03:10:24,260 --> 03:10:26,990
that the primary
organisms are the ideas

10960
03:10:26,990 --> 03:10:27,000
organisms are the ideas
 

10961
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:28,969
organisms are the ideas
yeah I would say like the the ideas kind

10962
03:10:28,969 --> 03:10:28,979
yeah I would say like the the ideas kind
 

10963
03:10:28,979 --> 03:10:30,769
yeah I would say like the the ideas kind
of live in the software of like our

10964
03:10:30,769 --> 03:10:30,779
of live in the software of like our
 

10965
03:10:30,779 --> 03:10:33,469
of live in the software of like our
civilization in the in the minds and so

10966
03:10:33,469 --> 03:10:33,479
civilization in the in the minds and so
 

10967
03:10:33,479 --> 03:10:35,929
civilization in the in the minds and so
on we think as humans that the hardware

10968
03:10:35,929 --> 03:10:35,939
on we think as humans that the hardware
 

10969
03:10:35,939 --> 03:10:39,469
on we think as humans that the hardware
is the fundamental thing I human is a

10970
03:10:39,469 --> 03:10:39,479
is the fundamental thing I human is a
 

10971
03:10:39,479 --> 03:10:41,750
is the fundamental thing I human is a
hardware entity yeah but it could be the

10972
03:10:41,750 --> 03:10:41,760
hardware entity yeah but it could be the
 

10973
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:44,510
hardware entity yeah but it could be the
software right yeah

10974
03:10:44,510 --> 03:10:44,520
software right yeah
 

10975
03:10:44,520 --> 03:10:46,250
software right yeah
yeah I would say like there needs to be

10976
03:10:46,250 --> 03:10:46,260
yeah I would say like there needs to be
 

10977
03:10:46,260 --> 03:10:47,929
yeah I would say like there needs to be
some grounding at some point to like a

10978
03:10:47,929 --> 03:10:47,939
some grounding at some point to like a
 

10979
03:10:47,939 --> 03:10:50,090
some grounding at some point to like a
physical reality yeah but if we clone an

10980
03:10:50,090 --> 03:10:50,100
physical reality yeah but if we clone an
 

10981
03:10:50,100 --> 03:10:52,309
physical reality yeah but if we clone an
Andre

10982
03:10:52,309 --> 03:10:52,319

 

10983
03:10:52,319 --> 03:10:54,469

the software is the thing

10984
03:10:54,469 --> 03:10:54,479
the software is the thing
 

10985
03:10:54,479 --> 03:10:56,990
the software is the thing
like is this thing that makes that thing

10986
03:10:56,990 --> 03:10:57,000
like is this thing that makes that thing
 

10987
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:58,790
like is this thing that makes that thing
special right yeah I guess I you're

10988
03:10:58,790 --> 03:10:58,800
special right yeah I guess I you're
 

10989
03:10:58,800 --> 03:11:00,410
special right yeah I guess I you're
right but then cloning might be

10990
03:11:00,410 --> 03:11:00,420
right but then cloning might be
 

10991
03:11:00,420 --> 03:11:02,150
right but then cloning might be
exceptionally difficult like there might

10992
03:11:02,150 --> 03:11:02,160
exceptionally difficult like there might
 

10993
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:03,410
exceptionally difficult like there might
be a deep integration between the

10994
03:11:03,410 --> 03:11:03,420
be a deep integration between the
 

10995
03:11:03,420 --> 03:11:05,210
be a deep integration between the
software and the hardware in ways we

10996
03:11:05,210 --> 03:11:05,220
software and the hardware in ways we
 

10997
03:11:05,220 --> 03:11:06,769
software and the hardware in ways we
don't quite understand well from the

10998
03:11:06,769 --> 03:11:06,779
don't quite understand well from the
 

10999
03:11:06,779 --> 03:11:08,150
don't quite understand well from the
evolution point of view like what makes

11000
03:11:08,150 --> 03:11:08,160
evolution point of view like what makes
 

11001
03:11:08,160 --> 03:11:10,370
evolution point of view like what makes
me special is more like the the gang of

11002
03:11:10,370 --> 03:11:10,380
me special is more like the the gang of
 

11003
03:11:10,380 --> 03:11:12,710
me special is more like the the gang of
genes that are writing in my chromosomes

11004
03:11:12,710 --> 03:11:12,720
genes that are writing in my chromosomes
 

11005
03:11:12,720 --> 03:11:14,210
genes that are writing in my chromosomes
I suppose right like they're the they're

11006
03:11:14,210 --> 03:11:14,220
I suppose right like they're the they're
 

11007
03:11:14,220 --> 03:11:16,309
I suppose right like they're the they're
the replicating unit I suppose and no

11008
03:11:16,309 --> 03:11:16,319
the replicating unit I suppose and no
 

11009
03:11:16,319 --> 03:11:18,050
the replicating unit I suppose and no
but that's just for you the thing that

11010
03:11:18,050 --> 03:11:18,060
but that's just for you the thing that
 

11011
03:11:18,060 --> 03:11:21,769
but that's just for you the thing that
makes you special sure wow

11012
03:11:21,769 --> 03:11:21,779
makes you special sure wow
 

11013
03:11:21,779 --> 03:11:25,309
makes you special sure wow
the reality is what makes you special is

11014
03:11:25,309 --> 03:11:25,319
the reality is what makes you special is
 

11015
03:11:25,319 --> 03:11:28,250
the reality is what makes you special is
your ability to survive

11016
03:11:28,250 --> 03:11:28,260
your ability to survive
 

11017
03:11:28,260 --> 03:11:31,190
your ability to survive
based on the software that runs on the

11018
03:11:31,190 --> 03:11:31,200
based on the software that runs on the
 

11019
03:11:31,200 --> 03:11:34,010
based on the software that runs on the
hardware that was built by the genes

11020
03:11:34,010 --> 03:11:34,020
hardware that was built by the genes
 

11021
03:11:34,020 --> 03:11:35,330
hardware that was built by the genes
um so the software is the thing that

11022
03:11:35,330 --> 03:11:35,340
um so the software is the thing that
 

11023
03:11:35,340 --> 03:11:37,190
um so the software is the thing that
makes you survive not the hardware

11024
03:11:37,190 --> 03:11:37,200
makes you survive not the hardware
 

11025
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:39,830
makes you survive not the hardware
all right yeah it's just like a second

11026
03:11:39,830 --> 03:11:39,840
all right yeah it's just like a second
 

11027
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:41,690
all right yeah it's just like a second
layer it's a new second layer that

11028
03:11:41,690 --> 03:11:41,700
layer it's a new second layer that
 

11029
03:11:41,700 --> 03:11:43,130
layer it's a new second layer that
hasn't been there before the brain they

11030
03:11:43,130 --> 03:11:43,140
hasn't been there before the brain they
 

11031
03:11:43,140 --> 03:11:44,870
hasn't been there before the brain they
both they both coexist but there's also

11032
03:11:44,870 --> 03:11:44,880
both they both coexist but there's also
 

11033
03:11:44,880 --> 03:11:47,150
both they both coexist but there's also
layers of the software I mean it's it's

11034
03:11:47,150 --> 03:11:47,160
layers of the software I mean it's it's
 

11035
03:11:47,160 --> 03:11:50,630
layers of the software I mean it's it's
not it's a it's a abstraction that's uh

11036
03:11:50,630 --> 03:11:50,640
not it's a it's a abstraction that's uh
 

11037
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:52,969
not it's a it's a abstraction that's uh
on top of abstractions but okay so

11038
03:11:52,969 --> 03:11:52,979
on top of abstractions but okay so
 

11039
03:11:52,979 --> 03:11:56,150
on top of abstractions but okay so
selfish Gene um a neckline I would say

11040
03:11:56,150 --> 03:11:56,160
selfish Gene um a neckline I would say
 

11041
03:11:56,160 --> 03:11:58,429
selfish Gene um a neckline I would say
sometimes books are like not sufficient

11042
03:11:58,429 --> 03:11:58,439
sometimes books are like not sufficient
 

11043
03:11:58,439 --> 03:12:01,309
sometimes books are like not sufficient
I like to reach for textbooks sometimes

11044
03:12:01,309 --> 03:12:01,319
I like to reach for textbooks sometimes
 

11045
03:12:01,319 --> 03:12:03,469
I like to reach for textbooks sometimes
um I kind of feel like books are for too

11046
03:12:03,469 --> 03:12:03,479
um I kind of feel like books are for too
 

11047
03:12:03,479 --> 03:12:04,910
um I kind of feel like books are for too
much of a general consumption sometime

11048
03:12:04,910 --> 03:12:04,920
much of a general consumption sometime
 

11049
03:12:04,920 --> 03:12:07,190
much of a general consumption sometime
and they just kind of like uh they're

11050
03:12:07,190 --> 03:12:07,200
and they just kind of like uh they're
 

11051
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:08,450
and they just kind of like uh they're
too high up in the level of abstraction

11052
03:12:08,450 --> 03:12:08,460
too high up in the level of abstraction
 

11053
03:12:08,460 --> 03:12:10,370
too high up in the level of abstraction
and it's not good enough yeah so I like

11054
03:12:10,370 --> 03:12:10,380
and it's not good enough yeah so I like
 

11055
03:12:10,380 --> 03:12:12,950
and it's not good enough yeah so I like
textbooks I like the cell I think the

11056
03:12:12,950 --> 03:12:12,960
textbooks I like the cell I think the
 

11057
03:12:12,960 --> 03:12:14,330
textbooks I like the cell I think the
cell was pretty cool

11058
03:12:14,330 --> 03:12:14,340
cell was pretty cool
 

11059
03:12:14,340 --> 03:12:17,030
cell was pretty cool
uh that's why also I like the writing of

11060
03:12:17,030 --> 03:12:17,040
uh that's why also I like the writing of
 

11061
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:19,250
uh that's why also I like the writing of
uh McLean is because he's pretty willing

11062
03:12:19,250 --> 03:12:19,260
uh McLean is because he's pretty willing
 

11063
03:12:19,260 --> 03:12:23,030
uh McLean is because he's pretty willing
to step one level down and he doesn't uh

11064
03:12:23,030 --> 03:12:23,040
to step one level down and he doesn't uh
 

11065
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:24,650
to step one level down and he doesn't uh
yeah he's sort of he's willing to go

11066
03:12:24,650 --> 03:12:24,660
yeah he's sort of he's willing to go
 

11067
03:12:24,660 --> 03:12:25,490
yeah he's sort of he's willing to go
there

11068
03:12:25,490 --> 03:12:25,500
there
 

11069
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:27,170
there
but he's also willing to sort of be

11070
03:12:27,170 --> 03:12:27,180
but he's also willing to sort of be
 

11071
03:12:27,180 --> 03:12:28,610
but he's also willing to sort of be
throughout the stack so he'll go down to

11072
03:12:28,610 --> 03:12:28,620
throughout the stack so he'll go down to
 

11073
03:12:28,620 --> 03:12:30,290
throughout the stack so he'll go down to
a lot of detail but then he will come

11074
03:12:30,290 --> 03:12:30,300
a lot of detail but then he will come
 

11075
03:12:30,300 --> 03:12:32,809
a lot of detail but then he will come
back up and I think he has a yeah

11076
03:12:32,809 --> 03:12:32,819
back up and I think he has a yeah
 

11077
03:12:32,819 --> 03:12:34,490
back up and I think he has a yeah
basically I really appreciate that

11078
03:12:34,490 --> 03:12:34,500
basically I really appreciate that
 

11079
03:12:34,500 --> 03:12:36,469
basically I really appreciate that
that's why I love college early college

11080
03:12:36,469 --> 03:12:36,479
that's why I love college early college
 

11081
03:12:36,479 --> 03:12:38,750
that's why I love college early college
even high school but just textbooks on

11082
03:12:38,750 --> 03:12:38,760
even high school but just textbooks on
 

11083
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:41,450
even high school but just textbooks on
the basics yeah of Computer Science and

11084
03:12:41,450 --> 03:12:41,460
the basics yeah of Computer Science and
 

11085
03:12:41,460 --> 03:12:44,090
the basics yeah of Computer Science and
Mathematics of of biology of chemistry

11086
03:12:44,090 --> 03:12:44,100
Mathematics of of biology of chemistry
 

11087
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:47,870
Mathematics of of biology of chemistry
yes those are they condense down like uh

11088
03:12:47,870 --> 03:12:47,880
yes those are they condense down like uh
 

11089
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:50,210
yes those are they condense down like uh
uh it's sufficiently General that you

11090
03:12:50,210 --> 03:12:50,220
uh it's sufficiently General that you
 

11091
03:12:50,220 --> 03:12:51,590
uh it's sufficiently General that you
can understand the both the philosophy

11092
03:12:51,590 --> 03:12:51,600
can understand the both the philosophy
 

11093
03:12:51,600 --> 03:12:53,269
can understand the both the philosophy
and the details but also like you get

11094
03:12:53,269 --> 03:12:53,279
and the details but also like you get
 

11095
03:12:53,279 --> 03:12:55,730
and the details but also like you get
homework problems and you you get to

11096
03:12:55,730 --> 03:12:55,740
homework problems and you you get to
 

11097
03:12:55,740 --> 03:12:57,769
homework problems and you you get to
play with it as much as you would if you

11098
03:12:57,769 --> 03:12:57,779
play with it as much as you would if you
 

11099
03:12:57,779 --> 03:13:00,230
play with it as much as you would if you
weren't yeah programming stuff yeah and

11100
03:13:00,230 --> 03:13:00,240
weren't yeah programming stuff yeah and
 

11101
03:13:00,240 --> 03:13:01,550
weren't yeah programming stuff yeah and
then I'm also suspicious of textbooks

11102
03:13:01,550 --> 03:13:01,560
then I'm also suspicious of textbooks
 

11103
03:13:01,560 --> 03:13:03,469
then I'm also suspicious of textbooks
honestly because as an example in deep

11104
03:13:03,469 --> 03:13:03,479
honestly because as an example in deep
 

11105
03:13:03,479 --> 03:13:05,389
honestly because as an example in deep
learning uh there's no like amazing

11106
03:13:05,389 --> 03:13:05,399
learning uh there's no like amazing
 

11107
03:13:05,399 --> 03:13:06,769
learning uh there's no like amazing
textbooks and I feel this changing very

11108
03:13:06,769 --> 03:13:06,779
textbooks and I feel this changing very
 

11109
03:13:06,779 --> 03:13:08,690
textbooks and I feel this changing very
quickly I imagine the same is true and

11110
03:13:08,690 --> 03:13:08,700
quickly I imagine the same is true and
 

11111
03:13:08,700 --> 03:13:11,750
quickly I imagine the same is true and
say uh synthetic biology and so on these

11112
03:13:11,750 --> 03:13:11,760
say uh synthetic biology and so on these
 

11113
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:13,130
say uh synthetic biology and so on these
books like this cell are kind of

11114
03:13:13,130 --> 03:13:13,140
books like this cell are kind of
 

11115
03:13:13,140 --> 03:13:14,690
books like this cell are kind of
outdated they're still high level like

11116
03:13:14,690 --> 03:13:14,700
outdated they're still high level like
 

11117
03:13:14,700 --> 03:13:16,250
outdated they're still high level like
what is the actual real source of truth

11118
03:13:16,250 --> 03:13:16,260
what is the actual real source of truth
 

11119
03:13:16,260 --> 03:13:18,469
what is the actual real source of truth
it's people in wet Labs working with

11120
03:13:18,469 --> 03:13:18,479
it's people in wet Labs working with
 

11121
03:13:18,479 --> 03:13:20,990
it's people in wet Labs working with
cells yeah you know sequencing genomes

11122
03:13:20,990 --> 03:13:21,000
cells yeah you know sequencing genomes
 

11123
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:22,670
cells yeah you know sequencing genomes
and

11124
03:13:22,670 --> 03:13:22,680
and
 

11125
03:13:22,680 --> 03:13:24,530
and
yeah actually working with working with

11126
03:13:24,530 --> 03:13:24,540
yeah actually working with working with
 

11127
03:13:24,540 --> 03:13:26,450
yeah actually working with working with
it and uh I don't have that much

11128
03:13:26,450 --> 03:13:26,460
it and uh I don't have that much
 

11129
03:13:26,460 --> 03:13:27,950
it and uh I don't have that much
exposure to that or what that looks like

11130
03:13:27,950 --> 03:13:27,960
exposure to that or what that looks like
 

11131
03:13:27,960 --> 03:13:29,750
exposure to that or what that looks like
so I sold them fully I'm reading through

11132
03:13:29,750 --> 03:13:29,760
so I sold them fully I'm reading through
 

11133
03:13:29,760 --> 03:13:30,950
so I sold them fully I'm reading through
the cell and it's kind of interesting

11134
03:13:30,950 --> 03:13:30,960
the cell and it's kind of interesting
 

11135
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:32,269
the cell and it's kind of interesting
and I'm learning but it's still not

11136
03:13:32,269 --> 03:13:32,279
and I'm learning but it's still not
 

11137
03:13:32,279 --> 03:13:33,769
and I'm learning but it's still not
sufficient I would say in terms of

11138
03:13:33,769 --> 03:13:33,779
sufficient I would say in terms of
 

11139
03:13:33,779 --> 03:13:35,929
sufficient I would say in terms of
understanding well it's a clean

11140
03:13:35,929 --> 03:13:35,939
understanding well it's a clean
 

11141
03:13:35,939 --> 03:13:37,550
understanding well it's a clean
summarization of the mainstream

11142
03:13:37,550 --> 03:13:37,560
summarization of the mainstream
 

11143
03:13:37,560 --> 03:13:38,570
summarization of the mainstream
narrative

11144
03:13:38,570 --> 03:13:38,580
narrative
 

11145
03:13:38,580 --> 03:13:40,849
narrative
yeah but you have to learn that before

11146
03:13:40,849 --> 03:13:40,859
yeah but you have to learn that before
 

11147
03:13:40,859 --> 03:13:43,429
yeah but you have to learn that before
you break out yeah towards The Cutting

11148
03:13:43,429 --> 03:13:43,439
you break out yeah towards The Cutting
 

11149
03:13:43,439 --> 03:13:45,230
you break out yeah towards The Cutting
Edge yeah what is the actual process of

11150
03:13:45,230 --> 03:13:45,240
Edge yeah what is the actual process of
 

11151
03:13:45,240 --> 03:13:46,429
Edge yeah what is the actual process of
working with these cells and growing

11152
03:13:46,429 --> 03:13:46,439
working with these cells and growing
 

11153
03:13:46,439 --> 03:13:48,590
working with these cells and growing
them and incubating them and you know

11154
03:13:48,590 --> 03:13:48,600
them and incubating them and you know
 

11155
03:13:48,600 --> 03:13:49,730
them and incubating them and you know
it's kind of like a massive cooking

11156
03:13:49,730 --> 03:13:49,740
it's kind of like a massive cooking
 

11157
03:13:49,740 --> 03:13:51,650
it's kind of like a massive cooking
recipe so making sure your self slows

11158
03:13:51,650 --> 03:13:51,660
recipe so making sure your self slows
 

11159
03:13:51,660 --> 03:13:52,670
recipe so making sure your self slows
and proliferate and then you're

11160
03:13:52,670 --> 03:13:52,680
and proliferate and then you're
 

11161
03:13:52,680 --> 03:13:54,410
and proliferate and then you're
sequencing them running experiments and

11162
03:13:54,410 --> 03:13:54,420
sequencing them running experiments and
 

11163
03:13:54,420 --> 03:13:56,570
sequencing them running experiments and
uh just how that works I think is kind

11164
03:13:56,570 --> 03:13:56,580
uh just how that works I think is kind
 

11165
03:13:56,580 --> 03:13:58,070
uh just how that works I think is kind
of like the source of truth of at the

11166
03:13:58,070 --> 03:13:58,080
of like the source of truth of at the
 

11167
03:13:58,080 --> 03:13:59,750
of like the source of truth of at the
end of the day what's really useful in

11168
03:13:59,750 --> 03:13:59,760
end of the day what's really useful in
 

11169
03:13:59,760 --> 03:14:01,670
end of the day what's really useful in
terms of creating therapies and so on

11170
03:14:01,670 --> 03:14:01,680
terms of creating therapies and so on
 

11171
03:14:01,680 --> 03:14:04,309
terms of creating therapies and so on
yeah I wonder in the future AI textbooks

11172
03:14:04,309 --> 03:14:04,319
yeah I wonder in the future AI textbooks
 

11173
03:14:04,319 --> 03:14:05,809
yeah I wonder in the future AI textbooks
will be because you know there's a

11174
03:14:05,809 --> 03:14:05,819
will be because you know there's a
 

11175
03:14:05,819 --> 03:14:07,309
will be because you know there's a
artificial intelligence a modern

11176
03:14:07,309 --> 03:14:07,319
artificial intelligence a modern
 

11177
03:14:07,319 --> 03:14:09,590
artificial intelligence a modern
approach I actually haven't read if it's

11178
03:14:09,590 --> 03:14:09,600
approach I actually haven't read if it's
 

11179
03:14:09,600 --> 03:14:11,690
approach I actually haven't read if it's
come out the recent version the recent

11180
03:14:11,690 --> 03:14:11,700
come out the recent version the recent
 

11181
03:14:11,700 --> 03:14:13,910
come out the recent version the recent
there's been a recent Edition I also saw

11182
03:14:13,910 --> 03:14:13,920
there's been a recent Edition I also saw
 

11183
03:14:13,920 --> 03:14:15,769
there's been a recent Edition I also saw
there's a science a deep learning book

11184
03:14:15,769 --> 03:14:15,779
there's a science a deep learning book
 

11185
03:14:15,779 --> 03:14:17,389
there's a science a deep learning book
I'm waiting for textbooks that worth

11186
03:14:17,389 --> 03:14:17,399
I'm waiting for textbooks that worth
 

11187
03:14:17,399 --> 03:14:19,309
I'm waiting for textbooks that worth
recommending worth reading it's It's

11188
03:14:19,309 --> 03:14:19,319
recommending worth reading it's It's
 

11189
03:14:19,319 --> 03:14:22,010
recommending worth reading it's It's
tricky because it's like papers

11190
03:14:22,010 --> 03:14:22,020
tricky because it's like papers
 

11191
03:14:22,020 --> 03:14:25,370
tricky because it's like papers
and code code honestly papers are quite

11192
03:14:25,370 --> 03:14:25,380
and code code honestly papers are quite
 

11193
03:14:25,380 --> 03:14:27,110
and code code honestly papers are quite
good I especially like the appendix

11194
03:14:27,110 --> 03:14:27,120
good I especially like the appendix
 

11195
03:14:27,120 --> 03:14:29,090
good I especially like the appendix
appendix of any paper as well it's like

11196
03:14:29,090 --> 03:14:29,100
appendix of any paper as well it's like
 

11197
03:14:29,100 --> 03:14:32,469
appendix of any paper as well it's like
it's like the most detail it can have

11198
03:14:32,469 --> 03:14:32,479
it's like the most detail it can have
 

11199
03:14:32,479 --> 03:14:35,090
it's like the most detail it can have
it doesn't have to be cohesive to

11200
03:14:35,090 --> 03:14:35,100
it doesn't have to be cohesive to
 

11201
03:14:35,100 --> 03:14:36,290
it doesn't have to be cohesive to
connected to anything else you just

11202
03:14:36,290 --> 03:14:36,300
connected to anything else you just
 

11203
03:14:36,300 --> 03:14:38,030
connected to anything else you just
describe me a very specific way you

11204
03:14:38,030 --> 03:14:38,040
describe me a very specific way you
 

11205
03:14:38,040 --> 03:14:39,530
describe me a very specific way you
solved a particular thing yeah many

11206
03:14:39,530 --> 03:14:39,540
solved a particular thing yeah many
 

11207
03:14:39,540 --> 03:14:40,790
solved a particular thing yeah many
times papers can be actually quite

11208
03:14:40,790 --> 03:14:40,800
times papers can be actually quite
 

11209
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:42,830
times papers can be actually quite
readable not always but sometimes the

11210
03:14:42,830 --> 03:14:42,840
readable not always but sometimes the
 

11211
03:14:42,840 --> 03:14:44,210
readable not always but sometimes the
introduction in the abstract is readable

11212
03:14:44,210 --> 03:14:44,220
introduction in the abstract is readable
 

11213
03:14:44,220 --> 03:14:46,309
introduction in the abstract is readable
even for someone outside of the field uh

11214
03:14:46,309 --> 03:14:46,319
even for someone outside of the field uh
 

11215
03:14:46,319 --> 03:14:47,990
even for someone outside of the field uh
not this is not always true and

11216
03:14:47,990 --> 03:14:48,000
not this is not always true and
 

11217
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:49,130
not this is not always true and
sometimes I think unfortunately

11218
03:14:49,130 --> 03:14:49,140
sometimes I think unfortunately
 

11219
03:14:49,140 --> 03:14:51,410
sometimes I think unfortunately
scientists use complex terms even when

11220
03:14:51,410 --> 03:14:51,420
scientists use complex terms even when
 

11221
03:14:51,420 --> 03:14:53,210
scientists use complex terms even when
it's not necessary I think that's

11222
03:14:53,210 --> 03:14:53,220
it's not necessary I think that's
 

11223
03:14:53,220 --> 03:14:55,250
it's not necessary I think that's
harmful I think there there's no reason

11224
03:14:55,250 --> 03:14:55,260
harmful I think there there's no reason
 

11225
03:14:55,260 --> 03:14:57,830
harmful I think there there's no reason
for that and papers sometimes are longer

11226
03:14:57,830 --> 03:14:57,840
for that and papers sometimes are longer
 

11227
03:14:57,840 --> 03:14:59,389
for that and papers sometimes are longer
than they need to be in this in the

11228
03:14:59,389 --> 03:14:59,399
than they need to be in this in the
 

11229
03:14:59,399 --> 03:15:00,410
than they need to be in this in the
parts that

11230
03:15:00,410 --> 03:15:00,420
parts that
 

11231
03:15:00,420 --> 03:15:03,349
parts that
don't matter yeah appendix would be long

11232
03:15:03,349 --> 03:15:03,359
don't matter yeah appendix would be long
 

11233
03:15:03,359 --> 03:15:05,210
don't matter yeah appendix would be long
but then the paper itself you know look

11234
03:15:05,210 --> 03:15:05,220
but then the paper itself you know look
 

11235
03:15:05,220 --> 03:15:06,950
but then the paper itself you know look
at Einstein make it simple

11236
03:15:06,950 --> 03:15:06,960
at Einstein make it simple
 

11237
03:15:06,960 --> 03:15:08,210
at Einstein make it simple
yeah but certainly I've come across

11238
03:15:08,210 --> 03:15:08,220
yeah but certainly I've come across
 

11239
03:15:08,220 --> 03:15:09,889
yeah but certainly I've come across
papers I would say in say like synthetic

11240
03:15:09,889 --> 03:15:09,899
papers I would say in say like synthetic
 

11241
03:15:09,899 --> 03:15:11,389
papers I would say in say like synthetic
biology or something that I thought were

11242
03:15:11,389 --> 03:15:11,399
biology or something that I thought were
 

11243
03:15:11,399 --> 03:15:12,769
biology or something that I thought were
quite readable for the abstract and the

11244
03:15:12,769 --> 03:15:12,779
quite readable for the abstract and the
 

11245
03:15:12,779 --> 03:15:14,150
quite readable for the abstract and the
introduction and then you're reading the

11246
03:15:14,150 --> 03:15:14,160
introduction and then you're reading the
 

11247
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:15,530
introduction and then you're reading the
rest of it and you don't fully

11248
03:15:15,530 --> 03:15:15,540
rest of it and you don't fully
 

11249
03:15:15,540 --> 03:15:16,910
rest of it and you don't fully
understand but you kind of are getting a

11250
03:15:16,910 --> 03:15:16,920
understand but you kind of are getting a
 

11251
03:15:16,920 --> 03:15:19,690
understand but you kind of are getting a
gist and I think it's cool

11252
03:15:19,690 --> 03:15:19,700
gist and I think it's cool
 

11253
03:15:19,700 --> 03:15:23,150
gist and I think it's cool
what uh advice you give advice to folks

11254
03:15:23,150 --> 03:15:23,160
what uh advice you give advice to folks
 

11255
03:15:23,160 --> 03:15:24,830
what uh advice you give advice to folks
interested in machine learning and

11256
03:15:24,830 --> 03:15:24,840
interested in machine learning and
 

11257
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:27,290
interested in machine learning and
research but in General Life advice to a

11258
03:15:27,290 --> 03:15:27,300
research but in General Life advice to a
 

11259
03:15:27,300 --> 03:15:29,809
research but in General Life advice to a
young person High School

11260
03:15:29,809 --> 03:15:29,819
young person High School
 

11261
03:15:29,819 --> 03:15:32,030
young person High School
um Early College about how to have a

11262
03:15:32,030 --> 03:15:32,040
um Early College about how to have a
 

11263
03:15:32,040 --> 03:15:33,710
um Early College about how to have a
career they can be proud of or a life

11264
03:15:33,710 --> 03:15:33,720
career they can be proud of or a life
 

11265
03:15:33,720 --> 03:15:35,450
career they can be proud of or a life
they can be proud of

11266
03:15:35,450 --> 03:15:35,460
they can be proud of
 

11267
03:15:35,460 --> 03:15:37,370
they can be proud of
yeah I think I'm very hesitant to give

11268
03:15:37,370 --> 03:15:37,380
yeah I think I'm very hesitant to give
 

11269
03:15:37,380 --> 03:15:38,809
yeah I think I'm very hesitant to give
general advice I think it's really hard

11270
03:15:38,809 --> 03:15:38,819
general advice I think it's really hard
 

11271
03:15:38,819 --> 03:15:40,070
general advice I think it's really hard
I've mentioned like some of the stuff

11272
03:15:40,070 --> 03:15:40,080
I've mentioned like some of the stuff
 

11273
03:15:40,080 --> 03:15:41,690
I've mentioned like some of the stuff
I've mentioned is fairly General I think

11274
03:15:41,690 --> 03:15:41,700
I've mentioned is fairly General I think
 

11275
03:15:41,700 --> 03:15:43,250
I've mentioned is fairly General I think
like focus on just the amount of work

11276
03:15:43,250 --> 03:15:43,260
like focus on just the amount of work
 

11277
03:15:43,260 --> 03:15:45,349
like focus on just the amount of work
you're spending on like a thing

11278
03:15:45,349 --> 03:15:45,359
you're spending on like a thing
 

11279
03:15:45,359 --> 03:15:47,510
you're spending on like a thing
uh compare yourself only to yourself not

11280
03:15:47,510 --> 03:15:47,520
uh compare yourself only to yourself not
 

11281
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:49,130
uh compare yourself only to yourself not
to others that's good I think those are

11282
03:15:49,130 --> 03:15:49,140
to others that's good I think those are
 

11283
03:15:49,140 --> 03:15:51,769
to others that's good I think those are
fairly General how do you pick the thing

11284
03:15:51,769 --> 03:15:51,779
fairly General how do you pick the thing
 

11285
03:15:51,779 --> 03:15:53,809
fairly General how do you pick the thing
uh you just have like a deep interest in

11286
03:15:53,809 --> 03:15:53,819
uh you just have like a deep interest in
 

11287
03:15:53,819 --> 03:15:56,450
uh you just have like a deep interest in
something uh or like try to like find

11288
03:15:56,450 --> 03:15:56,460
something uh or like try to like find
 

11289
03:15:56,460 --> 03:15:58,429
something uh or like try to like find
the art Max over like the things that

11290
03:15:58,429 --> 03:15:58,439
the art Max over like the things that
 

11291
03:15:58,439 --> 03:15:59,929
the art Max over like the things that
you're interested in ARG Max at that

11292
03:15:59,929 --> 03:15:59,939
you're interested in ARG Max at that
 

11293
03:15:59,939 --> 03:16:01,610
you're interested in ARG Max at that
moment and stick with it how do you not

11294
03:16:01,610 --> 03:16:01,620
moment and stick with it how do you not
 

11295
03:16:01,620 --> 03:16:04,130
moment and stick with it how do you not
get distracted and switch to another

11296
03:16:04,130 --> 03:16:04,140
get distracted and switch to another
 

11297
03:16:04,140 --> 03:16:07,910
get distracted and switch to another
thing uh you can if you like

11298
03:16:07,910 --> 03:16:07,920
thing uh you can if you like
 

11299
03:16:07,920 --> 03:16:10,190
thing uh you can if you like
um well if you do an ARG Max repeatedly

11300
03:16:10,190 --> 03:16:10,200
um well if you do an ARG Max repeatedly
 

11301
03:16:10,200 --> 03:16:12,530
um well if you do an ARG Max repeatedly
every week it doesn't converge it

11302
03:16:12,530 --> 03:16:12,540
every week it doesn't converge it
 

11303
03:16:12,540 --> 03:16:13,910
every week it doesn't converge it
doesn't it's a problem yeah you can like

11304
03:16:13,910 --> 03:16:13,920
doesn't it's a problem yeah you can like
 

11305
03:16:13,920 --> 03:16:15,889
doesn't it's a problem yeah you can like
low pass filter yourself uh in terms of

11306
03:16:15,889 --> 03:16:15,899
low pass filter yourself uh in terms of
 

11307
03:16:15,899 --> 03:16:17,870
low pass filter yourself uh in terms of
like what has consistently been true for

11308
03:16:17,870 --> 03:16:17,880
like what has consistently been true for
 

11309
03:16:17,880 --> 03:16:19,070
like what has consistently been true for
you

11310
03:16:19,070 --> 03:16:19,080
you
 

11311
03:16:19,080 --> 03:16:21,830
you
um but yeah I definitely see how it can

11312
03:16:21,830 --> 03:16:21,840
um but yeah I definitely see how it can
 

11313
03:16:21,840 --> 03:16:23,090
um but yeah I definitely see how it can
be hard but I would say like you're

11314
03:16:23,090 --> 03:16:23,100
be hard but I would say like you're
 

11315
03:16:23,100 --> 03:16:24,469
be hard but I would say like you're
going to work the hardest on the thing

11316
03:16:24,469 --> 03:16:24,479
going to work the hardest on the thing
 

11317
03:16:24,479 --> 03:16:26,809
going to work the hardest on the thing
that you care about the most also a low

11318
03:16:26,809 --> 03:16:26,819
that you care about the most also a low
 

11319
03:16:26,819 --> 03:16:28,010
that you care about the most also a low
pass filter yourself and really

11320
03:16:28,010 --> 03:16:28,020
pass filter yourself and really
 

11321
03:16:28,020 --> 03:16:30,410
pass filter yourself and really
introspect in your past were the things

11322
03:16:30,410 --> 03:16:30,420
introspect in your past were the things
 

11323
03:16:30,420 --> 03:16:31,670
introspect in your past were the things
that gave you energy and what are the

11324
03:16:31,670 --> 03:16:31,680
that gave you energy and what are the
 

11325
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:33,290
that gave you energy and what are the
things that took energy away from you

11326
03:16:33,290 --> 03:16:33,300
things that took energy away from you
 

11327
03:16:33,300 --> 03:16:36,110
things that took energy away from you
concrete examples and usually uh from

11328
03:16:36,110 --> 03:16:36,120
concrete examples and usually uh from
 

11329
03:16:36,120 --> 03:16:37,190
concrete examples and usually uh from
those concrete examples sometimes

11330
03:16:37,190 --> 03:16:37,200
those concrete examples sometimes
 

11331
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:39,889
those concrete examples sometimes
patterns can merge I like I like it when

11332
03:16:39,889 --> 03:16:39,899
patterns can merge I like I like it when
 

11333
03:16:39,899 --> 03:16:41,030
patterns can merge I like I like it when
things look like this when I'm these

11334
03:16:41,030 --> 03:16:41,040
things look like this when I'm these
 

11335
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:42,530
things look like this when I'm these
positions so that's not necessarily the

11336
03:16:42,530 --> 03:16:42,540
positions so that's not necessarily the
 

11337
03:16:42,540 --> 03:16:44,030
positions so that's not necessarily the
field but the kind of stuff you're doing

11338
03:16:44,030 --> 03:16:44,040
field but the kind of stuff you're doing
 

11339
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:46,250
field but the kind of stuff you're doing
in a particular field so for you it

11340
03:16:46,250 --> 03:16:46,260
in a particular field so for you it
 

11341
03:16:46,260 --> 03:16:48,110
in a particular field so for you it
seems like you were energized by

11342
03:16:48,110 --> 03:16:48,120
seems like you were energized by
 

11343
03:16:48,120 --> 03:16:49,969
seems like you were energized by
implementing stuff building actual

11344
03:16:49,969 --> 03:16:49,979
implementing stuff building actual
 

11345
03:16:49,979 --> 03:16:52,910
implementing stuff building actual
things yeah being low level learning and

11346
03:16:52,910 --> 03:16:52,920
things yeah being low level learning and
 

11347
03:16:52,920 --> 03:16:55,250
things yeah being low level learning and
then also uh communicating so that

11348
03:16:55,250 --> 03:16:55,260
then also uh communicating so that
 

11349
03:16:55,260 --> 03:16:56,330
then also uh communicating so that
others can go through the same

11350
03:16:56,330 --> 03:16:56,340
others can go through the same
 

11351
03:16:56,340 --> 03:16:58,910
others can go through the same
realizations and shortening that Gap

11352
03:16:58,910 --> 03:16:58,920
realizations and shortening that Gap
 

11353
03:16:58,920 --> 03:17:00,530
realizations and shortening that Gap
um because I usually have to do way too

11354
03:17:00,530 --> 03:17:00,540
um because I usually have to do way too
 

11355
03:17:00,540 --> 03:17:01,969
um because I usually have to do way too
much work to understand the thing and

11356
03:17:01,969 --> 03:17:01,979
much work to understand the thing and
 

11357
03:17:01,979 --> 03:17:03,290
much work to understand the thing and
then I'm like okay this is actually like

11358
03:17:03,290 --> 03:17:03,300
then I'm like okay this is actually like
 

11359
03:17:03,300 --> 03:17:05,210
then I'm like okay this is actually like
okay I think I get it and like why was

11360
03:17:05,210 --> 03:17:05,220
okay I think I get it and like why was
 

11361
03:17:05,220 --> 03:17:07,610
okay I think I get it and like why was
it so much work it should have been much

11362
03:17:07,610 --> 03:17:07,620
it so much work it should have been much
 

11363
03:17:07,620 --> 03:17:10,070
it so much work it should have been much
less work and that gives me a lot of

11364
03:17:10,070 --> 03:17:10,080
less work and that gives me a lot of
 

11365
03:17:10,080 --> 03:17:11,630
less work and that gives me a lot of
frustration and that's why I sometimes

11366
03:17:11,630 --> 03:17:11,640
frustration and that's why I sometimes
 

11367
03:17:11,640 --> 03:17:13,849
frustration and that's why I sometimes
go teach so aside from the teaching

11368
03:17:13,849 --> 03:17:13,859
go teach so aside from the teaching
 

11369
03:17:13,859 --> 03:17:16,630
go teach so aside from the teaching
you're doing now uh putting out videos

11370
03:17:16,630 --> 03:17:16,640
you're doing now uh putting out videos
 

11371
03:17:16,640 --> 03:17:20,510
you're doing now uh putting out videos
aside from a potential uh Godfather part

11376
03:17:24,889 --> 03:17:24,899
uh with the AGI at Tesla and Beyond uh
 

11377
03:17:24,899 --> 03:17:26,750
uh with the AGI at Tesla and Beyond uh
what does the future for Android kapati

11378
03:17:26,750 --> 03:17:26,760
what does the future for Android kapati
 

11379
03:17:26,760 --> 03:17:28,610
what does the future for Android kapati
hold have you figured that out yet or no

11380
03:17:28,610 --> 03:17:28,620
hold have you figured that out yet or no
 

11381
03:17:28,620 --> 03:17:31,670
hold have you figured that out yet or no
I mean uh as you see through the fog of

11382
03:17:31,670 --> 03:17:31,680
I mean uh as you see through the fog of
 

11383
03:17:31,680 --> 03:17:35,090
I mean uh as you see through the fog of
war that is all of our future

11384
03:17:35,090 --> 03:17:35,100
war that is all of our future
 

11385
03:17:35,100 --> 03:17:37,010
war that is all of our future
um do you do you start seeing

11386
03:17:37,010 --> 03:17:37,020
um do you do you start seeing
 

11387
03:17:37,020 --> 03:17:38,630
um do you do you start seeing
silhouettes of the what that possible

11388
03:17:38,630 --> 03:17:38,640
silhouettes of the what that possible
 

11389
03:17:38,640 --> 03:17:40,790
silhouettes of the what that possible
future could look like

11390
03:17:40,790 --> 03:17:40,800
future could look like
 

11391
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:42,230
future could look like
the consistent thing I've been always

11392
03:17:42,230 --> 03:17:42,240
the consistent thing I've been always
 

11393
03:17:42,240 --> 03:17:44,450
the consistent thing I've been always
interested in for me at least is is AI

11394
03:17:44,450 --> 03:17:44,460
interested in for me at least is is AI
 

11395
03:17:44,460 --> 03:17:46,309
interested in for me at least is is AI
and um

11396
03:17:46,309 --> 03:17:46,319
and um
 

11397
03:17:46,319 --> 03:17:48,290
and um
uh that's probably where I'm spending my

11398
03:17:48,290 --> 03:17:48,300
uh that's probably where I'm spending my
 

11399
03:17:48,300 --> 03:17:49,969
uh that's probably where I'm spending my
rest of my life on because I just care

11400
03:17:49,969 --> 03:17:49,979
rest of my life on because I just care
 

11401
03:17:49,979 --> 03:17:51,889
rest of my life on because I just care
about a lot and I actually care about

11402
03:17:51,889 --> 03:17:51,899
about a lot and I actually care about
 

11403
03:17:51,899 --> 03:17:53,630
about a lot and I actually care about
like many other problems as well like

11404
03:17:53,630 --> 03:17:53,640
like many other problems as well like
 

11405
03:17:53,640 --> 03:17:55,550
like many other problems as well like
say aging which I basically view as

11406
03:17:55,550 --> 03:17:55,560
say aging which I basically view as
 

11407
03:17:55,560 --> 03:17:58,190
say aging which I basically view as
disease and uh

11408
03:17:58,190 --> 03:17:58,200
disease and uh
 

11409
03:17:58,200 --> 03:17:59,450
disease and uh
um I care about that as well but I don't

11410
03:17:59,450 --> 03:17:59,460
um I care about that as well but I don't
 

11411
03:17:59,460 --> 03:18:01,370
um I care about that as well but I don't
think it's a good idea to go after it

11412
03:18:01,370 --> 03:18:01,380
think it's a good idea to go after it
 

11413
03:18:01,380 --> 03:18:03,650
think it's a good idea to go after it
specifically I don't actually think that

11414
03:18:03,650 --> 03:18:03,660
specifically I don't actually think that
 

11415
03:18:03,660 --> 03:18:05,630
specifically I don't actually think that
humans will be able to come up with the

11416
03:18:05,630 --> 03:18:05,640
humans will be able to come up with the
 

11417
03:18:05,640 --> 03:18:07,309
humans will be able to come up with the
answer I think the correct thing to do

11418
03:18:07,309 --> 03:18:07,319
answer I think the correct thing to do
 

11419
03:18:07,319 --> 03:18:09,290
answer I think the correct thing to do
is to ignore those problems and you

11420
03:18:09,290 --> 03:18:09,300
is to ignore those problems and you
 

11421
03:18:09,300 --> 03:18:10,969
is to ignore those problems and you
solve Ai and then use that to solve

11422
03:18:10,969 --> 03:18:10,979
solve Ai and then use that to solve
 

11423
03:18:10,979 --> 03:18:12,469
solve Ai and then use that to solve
everything else and I think there's a

11424
03:18:12,469 --> 03:18:12,479
everything else and I think there's a
 

11425
03:18:12,479 --> 03:18:13,610
everything else and I think there's a
chance that this will work I think it's

11426
03:18:13,610 --> 03:18:13,620
chance that this will work I think it's
 

11427
03:18:13,620 --> 03:18:16,190
chance that this will work I think it's
a very high chance and uh that's kind of

11428
03:18:16,190 --> 03:18:16,200
a very high chance and uh that's kind of
 

11429
03:18:16,200 --> 03:18:18,710
a very high chance and uh that's kind of
like the the way I'm betting at least so

11430
03:18:18,710 --> 03:18:18,720
like the the way I'm betting at least so
 

11431
03:18:18,720 --> 03:18:20,510
like the the way I'm betting at least so
when you think about AI are you

11432
03:18:20,510 --> 03:18:20,520
when you think about AI are you
 

11433
03:18:20,520 --> 03:18:22,910
when you think about AI are you
interested in all kinds of applications

11434
03:18:22,910 --> 03:18:22,920
interested in all kinds of applications
 

11435
03:18:22,920 --> 03:18:26,389
interested in all kinds of applications
all kinds of domains and any domain you

11436
03:18:26,389 --> 03:18:26,399
all kinds of domains and any domain you
 

11437
03:18:26,399 --> 03:18:28,670
all kinds of domains and any domain you
focus on will allow you to get insights

11438
03:18:28,670 --> 03:18:28,680
focus on will allow you to get insights
 

11439
03:18:28,680 --> 03:18:30,469
focus on will allow you to get insights
to the big problem of AGI yeah for me

11440
03:18:30,469 --> 03:18:30,479
to the big problem of AGI yeah for me
 

11441
03:18:30,479 --> 03:18:32,150
to the big problem of AGI yeah for me
it's the ultimate mental problem I don't

11442
03:18:32,150 --> 03:18:32,160
it's the ultimate mental problem I don't
 

11443
03:18:32,160 --> 03:18:33,469
it's the ultimate mental problem I don't
want to work on any one specific problem

11444
03:18:33,469 --> 03:18:33,479
want to work on any one specific problem
 

11445
03:18:33,479 --> 03:18:35,030
want to work on any one specific problem
there's too many problems so how can you

11446
03:18:35,030 --> 03:18:35,040
there's too many problems so how can you
 

11447
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:36,830
there's too many problems so how can you
work on all problems simultaneously you

11448
03:18:36,830 --> 03:18:36,840
work on all problems simultaneously you
 

11449
03:18:36,840 --> 03:18:38,809
work on all problems simultaneously you
solve The Meta problem which to me is

11450
03:18:38,809 --> 03:18:38,819
solve The Meta problem which to me is
 

11451
03:18:38,819 --> 03:18:40,750
solve The Meta problem which to me is
just intelligence and how do you

11452
03:18:40,750 --> 03:18:40,760
just intelligence and how do you
 

11453
03:18:40,760 --> 03:18:44,030
just intelligence and how do you
automate it is there cool small projects

11454
03:18:44,030 --> 03:18:44,040
automate it is there cool small projects
 

11455
03:18:44,040 --> 03:18:47,269
automate it is there cool small projects
like archive sanity and and so on that

11456
03:18:47,269 --> 03:18:47,279
like archive sanity and and so on that
 

11457
03:18:47,279 --> 03:18:49,610
like archive sanity and and so on that
you're thinking about the the the the

11458
03:18:49,610 --> 03:18:49,620
you're thinking about the the the the
 

11459
03:18:49,620 --> 03:18:52,969
you're thinking about the the the the
world the ml world can anticipate

11460
03:18:52,969 --> 03:18:52,979
world the ml world can anticipate
 

11461
03:18:52,979 --> 03:18:54,530
world the ml world can anticipate
there's some always like some fun side

11462
03:18:54,530 --> 03:18:54,540
there's some always like some fun side
 

11463
03:18:54,540 --> 03:18:56,590
there's some always like some fun side
projects yeah um archive sanity is one

11464
03:18:56,590 --> 03:18:56,600
projects yeah um archive sanity is one
 

11465
03:18:56,600 --> 03:18:58,250
projects yeah um archive sanity is one
basically like there's way too many

11466
03:18:58,250 --> 03:18:58,260
basically like there's way too many
 

11467
03:18:58,260 --> 03:19:00,650
basically like there's way too many
archive papers how can I organize it and

11468
03:19:00,650 --> 03:19:00,660
archive papers how can I organize it and
 

11469
03:19:00,660 --> 03:19:02,929
archive papers how can I organize it and
recommend papers and so on uh I

11470
03:19:02,929 --> 03:19:02,939
recommend papers and so on uh I
 

11471
03:19:02,939 --> 03:19:04,790
recommend papers and so on uh I
transcribed all of your yeah podcasts

11472
03:19:04,790 --> 03:19:04,800
transcribed all of your yeah podcasts
 

11473
03:19:04,800 --> 03:19:06,230
transcribed all of your yeah podcasts
what did you learn from that experience

11474
03:19:06,230 --> 03:19:06,240
what did you learn from that experience
 

11475
03:19:06,240 --> 03:19:10,070
what did you learn from that experience
uh from transcribing the process of like

11476
03:19:10,070 --> 03:19:10,080
uh from transcribing the process of like
 

11477
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:11,870
uh from transcribing the process of like
you like consuming audiobooks and and

11478
03:19:11,870 --> 03:19:11,880
you like consuming audiobooks and and
 

11479
03:19:11,880 --> 03:19:13,790
you like consuming audiobooks and and
podcasts and so on and here's the

11480
03:19:13,790 --> 03:19:13,800
podcasts and so on and here's the
 

11481
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:16,250
podcasts and so on and here's the
process that achieves

11482
03:19:16,250 --> 03:19:16,260
process that achieves
 

11483
03:19:16,260 --> 03:19:18,530
process that achieves
um closer to human level performance and

11484
03:19:18,530 --> 03:19:18,540
um closer to human level performance and
 

11485
03:19:18,540 --> 03:19:20,570
um closer to human level performance and
annotation yeah well I definitely was

11486
03:19:20,570 --> 03:19:20,580
annotation yeah well I definitely was
 

11487
03:19:20,580 --> 03:19:22,250
annotation yeah well I definitely was
like surprised that uh transcription

11488
03:19:22,250 --> 03:19:22,260
like surprised that uh transcription
 

11489
03:19:22,260 --> 03:19:24,710
like surprised that uh transcription
with opening eyes whisper was working so

11490
03:19:24,710 --> 03:19:24,720
with opening eyes whisper was working so
 

11491
03:19:24,720 --> 03:19:26,389
with opening eyes whisper was working so
well compared to what I'm familiar with

11492
03:19:26,389 --> 03:19:26,399
well compared to what I'm familiar with
 

11493
03:19:26,399 --> 03:19:28,969
well compared to what I'm familiar with
from Siri and like a few other systems I

11494
03:19:28,969 --> 03:19:28,979
from Siri and like a few other systems I
 

11495
03:19:28,979 --> 03:19:31,429
from Siri and like a few other systems I
guess it works so well and

11496
03:19:31,429 --> 03:19:31,439
guess it works so well and
 

11497
03:19:31,439 --> 03:19:33,769
guess it works so well and
uh that's what gave me some energy to

11498
03:19:33,769 --> 03:19:33,779
uh that's what gave me some energy to
 

11499
03:19:33,779 --> 03:19:35,330
uh that's what gave me some energy to
like try it out and I thought it could

11500
03:19:35,330 --> 03:19:35,340
like try it out and I thought it could
 

11501
03:19:35,340 --> 03:19:37,370
like try it out and I thought it could
be fun to random podcasts it's kind of

11502
03:19:37,370 --> 03:19:37,380
be fun to random podcasts it's kind of
 

11503
03:19:37,380 --> 03:19:40,490
be fun to random podcasts it's kind of
not obvious to me why whisper is so much

11504
03:19:40,490 --> 03:19:40,500
not obvious to me why whisper is so much
 

11505
03:19:40,500 --> 03:19:41,510
not obvious to me why whisper is so much
better compared to anything else because

11506
03:19:41,510 --> 03:19:41,520
better compared to anything else because
 

11507
03:19:41,520 --> 03:19:42,650
better compared to anything else because
I feel like there should be a lot of

11508
03:19:42,650 --> 03:19:42,660
I feel like there should be a lot of
 

11509
03:19:42,660 --> 03:19:43,910
I feel like there should be a lot of
incentive for a lot of companies to

11510
03:19:43,910 --> 03:19:43,920
incentive for a lot of companies to
 

11511
03:19:43,920 --> 03:19:45,349
incentive for a lot of companies to
produce transcription systems and that

11512
03:19:45,349 --> 03:19:45,359
produce transcription systems and that
 

11513
03:19:45,359 --> 03:19:47,090
produce transcription systems and that
they've done so over a long time whisper

11514
03:19:47,090 --> 03:19:47,100
they've done so over a long time whisper
 

11515
03:19:47,100 --> 03:19:48,830
they've done so over a long time whisper
is not a super exotic model it's a

11516
03:19:48,830 --> 03:19:48,840
is not a super exotic model it's a
 

11517
03:19:48,840 --> 03:19:51,710
is not a super exotic model it's a
Transformer it takes smell spectrograms

11518
03:19:51,710 --> 03:19:51,720
Transformer it takes smell spectrograms
 

11519
03:19:51,720 --> 03:19:54,110
Transformer it takes smell spectrograms
and you know just outputs tokens of text

11520
03:19:54,110 --> 03:19:54,120
and you know just outputs tokens of text
 

11521
03:19:54,120 --> 03:19:56,269
and you know just outputs tokens of text
it's not crazy uh the model and

11522
03:19:56,269 --> 03:19:56,279
it's not crazy uh the model and
 

11523
03:19:56,279 --> 03:19:57,230
it's not crazy uh the model and
everything has been around for a long

11524
03:19:57,230 --> 03:19:57,240
everything has been around for a long
 

11525
03:19:57,240 --> 03:19:58,309
everything has been around for a long
time

11526
03:19:58,309 --> 03:19:58,319
time
 

11527
03:19:58,319 --> 03:20:00,590
time
I'm not actually 100 sure why yeah it's

11528
03:20:00,590 --> 03:20:00,600
I'm not actually 100 sure why yeah it's
 

11529
03:20:00,600 --> 03:20:03,050
I'm not actually 100 sure why yeah it's
not obvious to me either it makes me

11530
03:20:03,050 --> 03:20:03,060
not obvious to me either it makes me
 

11531
03:20:03,060 --> 03:20:04,550
not obvious to me either it makes me
feel like I'm missing something I'm

11532
03:20:04,550 --> 03:20:04,560
feel like I'm missing something I'm
 

11533
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:06,889
feel like I'm missing something I'm
missing something yeah because there's a

11534
03:20:06,889 --> 03:20:06,899
missing something yeah because there's a
 

11535
03:20:06,899 --> 03:20:09,710
missing something yeah because there's a
huge even at Google and so on YouTube uh

11536
03:20:09,710 --> 03:20:09,720
huge even at Google and so on YouTube uh
 

11537
03:20:09,720 --> 03:20:11,330
huge even at Google and so on YouTube uh
transcription yeah

11538
03:20:11,330 --> 03:20:11,340
transcription yeah
 

11539
03:20:11,340 --> 03:20:13,429
transcription yeah
um yeah it's unclear but some of it is

11540
03:20:13,429 --> 03:20:13,439
um yeah it's unclear but some of it is
 

11541
03:20:13,439 --> 03:20:15,190
um yeah it's unclear but some of it is
also integrating into a bigger system

11542
03:20:15,190 --> 03:20:15,200
also integrating into a bigger system
 

11543
03:20:15,200 --> 03:20:18,769
also integrating into a bigger system
yeah that so the user interface how it's

11544
03:20:18,769 --> 03:20:18,779
yeah that so the user interface how it's
 

11545
03:20:18,779 --> 03:20:19,849
yeah that so the user interface how it's
deployed and all that kind of stuff

11546
03:20:19,849 --> 03:20:19,859
deployed and all that kind of stuff
 

11547
03:20:19,859 --> 03:20:22,550
deployed and all that kind of stuff
maybe running it as an independent thing

11548
03:20:22,550 --> 03:20:22,560
maybe running it as an independent thing
 

11549
03:20:22,560 --> 03:20:24,769
maybe running it as an independent thing
is eat much easier like an order of

11550
03:20:24,769 --> 03:20:24,779
is eat much easier like an order of
 

11551
03:20:24,779 --> 03:20:26,389
is eat much easier like an order of
magnitude easier than deploying to a

11552
03:20:26,389 --> 03:20:26,399
magnitude easier than deploying to a
 

11553
03:20:26,399 --> 03:20:28,429
magnitude easier than deploying to a
large integrated system like YouTube

11554
03:20:28,429 --> 03:20:28,439
large integrated system like YouTube
 

11555
03:20:28,439 --> 03:20:30,769
large integrated system like YouTube
transcription or

11556
03:20:30,769 --> 03:20:30,779
transcription or
 

11557
03:20:30,779 --> 03:20:32,690
transcription or
um anything like meetings like Zoom has

11558
03:20:32,690 --> 03:20:32,700
um anything like meetings like Zoom has
 

11559
03:20:32,700 --> 03:20:35,750
um anything like meetings like Zoom has
trans transcription that's kind of

11560
03:20:35,750 --> 03:20:35,760
trans transcription that's kind of
 

11561
03:20:35,760 --> 03:20:38,269
trans transcription that's kind of
crappy but creating uh interface where

11562
03:20:38,269 --> 03:20:38,279
crappy but creating uh interface where
 

11563
03:20:38,279 --> 03:20:39,590
crappy but creating uh interface where
it detects the different individual

11564
03:20:39,590 --> 03:20:39,600
it detects the different individual
 

11565
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:42,290
it detects the different individual
speakers it's able to

11566
03:20:42,290 --> 03:20:42,300
speakers it's able to
 

11567
03:20:42,300 --> 03:20:42,950
speakers it's able to
um

11568
03:20:42,950 --> 03:20:42,960
um
 

11569
03:20:42,960 --> 03:20:46,309
um
display it in compelling ways Run in

11570
03:20:46,309 --> 03:20:46,319
display it in compelling ways Run in
 

11571
03:20:46,319 --> 03:20:47,870
display it in compelling ways Run in
real time all that kind of stuff maybe

11572
03:20:47,870 --> 03:20:47,880
real time all that kind of stuff maybe
 

11573
03:20:47,880 --> 03:20:50,510
real time all that kind of stuff maybe
that's difficult but that's the only

11574
03:20:50,510 --> 03:20:50,520
that's difficult but that's the only
 

11575
03:20:50,520 --> 03:20:52,910
that's difficult but that's the only
explanation I have because like um

11576
03:20:52,910 --> 03:20:52,920
explanation I have because like um
 

11577
03:20:52,920 --> 03:20:55,849
explanation I have because like um
I'm currently paying uh quite a bit for

11578
03:20:55,849 --> 03:20:55,859
I'm currently paying uh quite a bit for
 

11579
03:20:55,859 --> 03:20:58,130
I'm currently paying uh quite a bit for
human uh transcription human caption

11580
03:20:58,130 --> 03:20:58,140
human uh transcription human caption
 

11581
03:20:58,140 --> 03:21:01,550
human uh transcription human caption
right annotation and like it seems like

11582
03:21:01,550 --> 03:21:01,560
right annotation and like it seems like
 

11583
03:21:01,560 --> 03:21:03,590
right annotation and like it seems like
uh there's a huge incentive to automate

11584
03:21:03,590 --> 03:21:03,600
uh there's a huge incentive to automate
 

11585
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:05,330
uh there's a huge incentive to automate
that yeah it's very confusing and I

11586
03:21:05,330 --> 03:21:05,340
that yeah it's very confusing and I
 

11587
03:21:05,340 --> 03:21:06,530
that yeah it's very confusing and I
think I mean I don't know if you looked

11588
03:21:06,530 --> 03:21:06,540
think I mean I don't know if you looked
 

11589
03:21:06,540 --> 03:21:07,969
think I mean I don't know if you looked
at some of the whisper transcripts but

11590
03:21:07,969 --> 03:21:07,979
at some of the whisper transcripts but
 

11591
03:21:07,979 --> 03:21:10,429
at some of the whisper transcripts but
they're quite good they're good and

11592
03:21:10,429 --> 03:21:10,439
they're quite good they're good and
 

11593
03:21:10,439 --> 03:21:12,710
they're quite good they're good and
especially in tricky cases yeah I've

11594
03:21:12,710 --> 03:21:12,720
especially in tricky cases yeah I've
 

11595
03:21:12,720 --> 03:21:13,570
especially in tricky cases yeah I've
seen

11596
03:21:13,570 --> 03:21:13,580
seen
 

11597
03:21:13,580 --> 03:21:16,429
seen
uh Whispers performance on like super

11598
03:21:16,429 --> 03:21:16,439
uh Whispers performance on like super
 

11599
03:21:16,439 --> 03:21:18,410
uh Whispers performance on like super
tricky cases and it does incredibly well

11600
03:21:18,410 --> 03:21:18,420
tricky cases and it does incredibly well
 

11601
03:21:18,420 --> 03:21:20,570
tricky cases and it does incredibly well
so I don't know a podcast is pretty

11602
03:21:20,570 --> 03:21:20,580
so I don't know a podcast is pretty
 

11603
03:21:20,580 --> 03:21:23,870
so I don't know a podcast is pretty
simple it's like high quality audio and

11604
03:21:23,870 --> 03:21:23,880
simple it's like high quality audio and
 

11605
03:21:23,880 --> 03:21:26,150
simple it's like high quality audio and
you're speaking usually pretty clearly

11606
03:21:26,150 --> 03:21:26,160
you're speaking usually pretty clearly
 

11607
03:21:26,160 --> 03:21:29,090
you're speaking usually pretty clearly
and so I don't know it uh I don't know

11608
03:21:29,090 --> 03:21:29,100
and so I don't know it uh I don't know
 

11609
03:21:29,100 --> 03:21:32,269
and so I don't know it uh I don't know
what open ai's plans are yeah either but

11610
03:21:32,269 --> 03:21:32,279
what open ai's plans are yeah either but
 

11611
03:21:32,279 --> 03:21:33,769
what open ai's plans are yeah either but
yeah there's always like fun fun

11612
03:21:33,769 --> 03:21:33,779
yeah there's always like fun fun
 

11613
03:21:33,779 --> 03:21:35,750
yeah there's always like fun fun
projects basically and stable diffusion

11614
03:21:35,750 --> 03:21:35,760
projects basically and stable diffusion
 

11615
03:21:35,760 --> 03:21:37,429
projects basically and stable diffusion
also is opening up a huge amount of

11616
03:21:37,429 --> 03:21:37,439
also is opening up a huge amount of
 

11617
03:21:37,439 --> 03:21:38,690
also is opening up a huge amount of
experimentation I would say in the

11618
03:21:38,690 --> 03:21:38,700
experimentation I would say in the
 

11619
03:21:38,700 --> 03:21:40,309
experimentation I would say in the
visual realm and generate generating

11620
03:21:40,309 --> 03:21:40,319
visual realm and generate generating
 

11621
03:21:40,319 --> 03:21:43,730
visual realm and generate generating
images and videos and movies videos now

11622
03:21:43,730 --> 03:21:43,740
images and videos and movies videos now
 

11623
03:21:43,740 --> 03:21:44,990
images and videos and movies videos now
and so that's going to be pretty crazy

11624
03:21:44,990 --> 03:21:45,000
and so that's going to be pretty crazy
 

11625
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:46,849
and so that's going to be pretty crazy
uh that's going to that's going to

11626
03:21:46,849 --> 03:21:46,859
uh that's going to that's going to
 

11627
03:21:46,859 --> 03:21:49,070
uh that's going to that's going to
almost certainly work and it's going to

11628
03:21:49,070 --> 03:21:49,080
almost certainly work and it's going to
 

11629
03:21:49,080 --> 03:21:50,990
almost certainly work and it's going to
be really interesting when the cost of

11630
03:21:50,990 --> 03:21:51,000
be really interesting when the cost of
 

11631
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:52,309
be really interesting when the cost of
content creation is going to fall to

11632
03:21:52,309 --> 03:21:52,319
content creation is going to fall to
 

11633
03:21:52,319 --> 03:21:54,349
content creation is going to fall to
zero you used to need a painter for a

11634
03:21:54,349 --> 03:21:54,359
zero you used to need a painter for a
 

11635
03:21:54,359 --> 03:21:56,030
zero you used to need a painter for a
few months to paint a thing and now it's

11636
03:21:56,030 --> 03:21:56,040
few months to paint a thing and now it's
 

11637
03:21:56,040 --> 03:21:58,010
few months to paint a thing and now it's
going to be speak to your phone to get

11638
03:21:58,010 --> 03:21:58,020
going to be speak to your phone to get
 

11639
03:21:58,020 --> 03:22:00,469
going to be speak to your phone to get
your video so if Hollywood will start

11640
03:22:00,469 --> 03:22:00,479
your video so if Hollywood will start
 

11641
03:22:00,479 --> 03:22:03,730
your video so if Hollywood will start
using that to generate scene means

11642
03:22:03,730 --> 03:22:03,740
using that to generate scene means
 

11643
03:22:03,740 --> 03:22:06,469
using that to generate scene means
which completely opens up yeah so you

11644
03:22:06,469 --> 03:22:06,479
which completely opens up yeah so you
 

11645
03:22:06,479 --> 03:22:09,130
which completely opens up yeah so you
can make a like a movie like Avatar

11646
03:22:09,130 --> 03:22:09,140
can make a like a movie like Avatar
 

11647
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:11,929
can make a like a movie like Avatar
eventually for under a million dollars

11648
03:22:11,929 --> 03:22:11,939
eventually for under a million dollars
 

11649
03:22:11,939 --> 03:22:14,150
eventually for under a million dollars
much less maybe just by talking to your

11650
03:22:14,150 --> 03:22:14,160
much less maybe just by talking to your
 

11651
03:22:14,160 --> 03:22:15,830
much less maybe just by talking to your
phone I mean I know it sounds kind of

11652
03:22:15,830 --> 03:22:15,840
phone I mean I know it sounds kind of
 

11653
03:22:15,840 --> 03:22:16,870
phone I mean I know it sounds kind of
crazy

11654
03:22:16,870 --> 03:22:16,880
crazy
 

11655
03:22:16,880 --> 03:22:18,889
crazy
and then there'd be some voting

11656
03:22:18,889 --> 03:22:18,899
and then there'd be some voting
 

11657
03:22:18,899 --> 03:22:20,809
and then there'd be some voting
mechanism like how do you have a like

11658
03:22:20,809 --> 03:22:20,819
mechanism like how do you have a like
 

11659
03:22:20,819 --> 03:22:22,730
mechanism like how do you have a like
would there be a show on Netflix that's

11660
03:22:22,730 --> 03:22:22,740
would there be a show on Netflix that's
 

11661
03:22:22,740 --> 03:22:25,630
would there be a show on Netflix that's
generated completely uh automatedly

11662
03:22:25,630 --> 03:22:25,640
generated completely uh automatedly
 

11663
03:22:25,640 --> 03:22:28,130
generated completely uh automatedly
potentially yeah and what does it look

11664
03:22:28,130 --> 03:22:28,140
potentially yeah and what does it look
 

11665
03:22:28,140 --> 03:22:29,870
potentially yeah and what does it look
like also when you can just generate It

11666
03:22:29,870 --> 03:22:29,880
like also when you can just generate It
 

11667
03:22:29,880 --> 03:22:32,870
like also when you can just generate It
On Demand and it's uh and there's

11668
03:22:32,870 --> 03:22:32,880
On Demand and it's uh and there's
 

11669
03:22:32,880 --> 03:22:35,650
On Demand and it's uh and there's
Infinity of it yeah

11670
03:22:35,650 --> 03:22:35,660
Infinity of it yeah
 

11671
03:22:35,660 --> 03:22:37,969
Infinity of it yeah
oh man

11672
03:22:37,969 --> 03:22:37,979
oh man
 

11673
03:22:37,979 --> 03:22:39,889
oh man
all the synthetic content I mean it's

11674
03:22:39,889 --> 03:22:39,899
all the synthetic content I mean it's
 

11675
03:22:39,899 --> 03:22:42,110
all the synthetic content I mean it's
humbling because we we treat ourselves

11676
03:22:42,110 --> 03:22:42,120
humbling because we we treat ourselves
 

11677
03:22:42,120 --> 03:22:43,730
humbling because we we treat ourselves
as special for being able to generate

11678
03:22:43,730 --> 03:22:43,740
as special for being able to generate
 

11679
03:22:43,740 --> 03:22:45,849
as special for being able to generate
art and ideas and all that kind of stuff

11680
03:22:45,849 --> 03:22:45,859
art and ideas and all that kind of stuff
 

11681
03:22:45,859 --> 03:22:48,830
art and ideas and all that kind of stuff
if that can be done in an automated Way

11682
03:22:48,830 --> 03:22:48,840
if that can be done in an automated Way
 

11683
03:22:48,840 --> 03:22:51,710
if that can be done in an automated Way
by AI yeah I think it's fascinating to

11684
03:22:51,710 --> 03:22:51,720
by AI yeah I think it's fascinating to
 

11685
03:22:51,720 --> 03:22:53,929
by AI yeah I think it's fascinating to
me how these uh the predictions of AI

11686
03:22:53,929 --> 03:22:53,939
me how these uh the predictions of AI
 

11687
03:22:53,939 --> 03:22:54,950
me how these uh the predictions of AI
and what it's going to look like and

11688
03:22:54,950 --> 03:22:54,960
and what it's going to look like and
 

11689
03:22:54,960 --> 03:22:56,090
and what it's going to look like and
what it's going to be capable of are

11690
03:22:56,090 --> 03:22:56,100
what it's going to be capable of are
 

11691
03:22:56,100 --> 03:22:58,130
what it's going to be capable of are
completely inverted and wrong and the

11692
03:22:58,130 --> 03:22:58,140
completely inverted and wrong and the
 

11693
03:22:58,140 --> 03:23:00,110
completely inverted and wrong and the
Sci-Fi of 50s and 60s was just like

11694
03:23:00,110 --> 03:23:00,120
Sci-Fi of 50s and 60s was just like
 

11695
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:02,330
Sci-Fi of 50s and 60s was just like
totally not bright they imagined AI is

11696
03:23:02,330 --> 03:23:02,340
totally not bright they imagined AI is
 

11697
03:23:02,340 --> 03:23:04,730
totally not bright they imagined AI is
like super calculating theore improvers

11698
03:23:04,730 --> 03:23:04,740
like super calculating theore improvers
 

11699
03:23:04,740 --> 03:23:06,050
like super calculating theore improvers
and we're getting things that can talk

it's just like weird are you excited
 

11705

it's just like weird are you excited
about that feature just ai's like hybrid

I think it's uh it's going to be

11718
03:23:27,410 --> 03:23:27,420
I think it's uh it's going to be
 

11719
03:23:27,420 --> 03:23:30,170
I think it's uh it's going to be
interesting for sure and I think I'm

11720
03:23:30,170 --> 03:23:30,180
interesting for sure and I think I'm
 

11721
03:23:30,180 --> 03:23:32,150

03:23:35,510 --> 03:23:35,520
well the sad thing is your brain and
 

11727
03:23:35,520 --> 03:23:39,889
well the sad thing is your brain and
mine developed in a time where

03:23:39,889 --> 03:23:39,899
mine developed in a time where
 

11729
03:23:39,899 --> 03:23:42,530

um before Twitter before the before the

11730
03:23:42,530 --> 03:23:42,540
um before Twitter before the before the
 

11731
03:23:42,540 --> 03:23:44,330
um before Twitter before the before the
internet so I wonder people that are

11732
03:23:44,330 --> 03:23:44,340
internet so I wonder people that are
 

11733
03:23:44,340 --> 03:23:46,250
internet so I wonder people that are
born inside of it might have a different

11734
03:23:46,250 --> 03:23:46,260
born inside of it might have a different
 

11735
03:23:46,260 --> 03:23:47,690

experience
 

11737
03:23:47,700 --> 03:23:50,450
experience
um like I maybe you can will still

11738
03:23:50,450 --> 03:23:50,460
um like I maybe you can will still
 

11739
03:23:50,460 --> 03:23:53,330
um like I maybe you can will still
resist it uh and the people born now

11740
03:23:53,330 --> 03:23:53,340
resist it uh and the people born now
 

11741
03:23:53,340 --> 03:23:54,590
resist it uh and the people born now
will not

11742
03:23:54,590 --> 03:23:54,600
will not
 

11743
03:23:54,600 --> 03:23:56,269
will not
well I do feel like humans are extremely

11744
03:23:56,269 --> 03:23:56,279
well I do feel like humans are extremely
 

11745
03:23:56,279 --> 03:23:58,250
well I do feel like humans are extremely
malleable yeah

11746
03:23:58,250 --> 03:23:58,260
malleable yeah
 

11747
03:23:58,260 --> 03:24:00,769
malleable yeah
and uh you're probably right

11748
03:24:00,769 --> 03:24:00,779
and uh you're probably right
 

11749
03:24:00,779 --> 03:24:04,210
and uh you're probably right
what is the meaning of life Andre

11750
03:24:04,210 --> 03:24:04,220
what is the meaning of life Andre
 

11751
03:24:04,220 --> 03:24:07,190
what is the meaning of life Andre
we we talked about sort of

11752
03:24:07,190 --> 03:24:07,200
we we talked about sort of
 

11753
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:09,170
we we talked about sort of
the universe having a conversation with

11754
03:24:09,170 --> 03:24:09,180
the universe having a conversation with
 

11755
03:24:09,180 --> 03:24:12,110
the universe having a conversation with
us humans or with the systems we create

11756
03:24:12,110 --> 03:24:12,120
us humans or with the systems we create
 

11757
03:24:12,120 --> 03:24:15,830
us humans or with the systems we create
to try to answer for the university for

11758
03:24:15,830 --> 03:24:15,840
to try to answer for the university for
 

11759
03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:17,510
to try to answer for the university for
the creator of the universe to notice us

11760
03:24:17,510 --> 03:24:17,520
the creator of the universe to notice us
 

11761
03:24:17,520 --> 03:24:20,030
the creator of the universe to notice us
we're trying to create systems that are

11762
03:24:20,030 --> 03:24:20,040
we're trying to create systems that are
 

11763
03:24:20,040 --> 03:24:21,170
we're trying to create systems that are
loud enough

11764
03:24:21,170 --> 03:24:21,180
loud enough
 

11765
03:24:21,180 --> 03:24:23,570
loud enough
just answer back

11766
03:24:23,570 --> 03:24:23,580
just answer back
 

11767
03:24:23,580 --> 03:24:24,830
just answer back
I don't know if that's the meaning of

11768
03:24:24,830 --> 03:24:24,840
I don't know if that's the meaning of
 

11769
03:24:24,840 --> 03:24:26,210
I don't know if that's the meaning of
life that's like meaning of life for

11770
03:24:26,210 --> 03:24:26,220
life that's like meaning of life for
 

11771
03:24:26,220 --> 03:24:28,010
life that's like meaning of life for
some people the first level answer I

11772
03:24:28,010 --> 03:24:28,020
some people the first level answer I
 

11773
03:24:28,020 --> 03:24:29,809
some people the first level answer I
would say is anyone can choose their own

11774
03:24:29,809 --> 03:24:29,819
would say is anyone can choose their own
 

11775
03:24:29,819 --> 03:24:31,250
would say is anyone can choose their own
meaning of life because we are conscious

11776
03:24:31,250 --> 03:24:31,260
meaning of life because we are conscious
 

11777
03:24:31,260 --> 03:24:34,490
meaning of life because we are conscious
entity and it's beautiful number one but

11778
03:24:34,490 --> 03:24:34,500
entity and it's beautiful number one but
 

11779
03:24:34,500 --> 03:24:36,830
entity and it's beautiful number one but
uh I do think that like a deeper meaning

11780
03:24:36,830 --> 03:24:36,840
uh I do think that like a deeper meaning
 

11781
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:39,050
uh I do think that like a deeper meaning
of life if someone is interested is uh

11782
03:24:39,050 --> 03:24:39,060
of life if someone is interested is uh
 

11783
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:40,729
of life if someone is interested is uh
or along the lines of like what the hell

11784
03:24:40,729 --> 03:24:40,739
or along the lines of like what the hell
 

11785
03:24:40,739 --> 03:24:44,690
or along the lines of like what the hell
is All This and like why and if you look

11786
03:24:44,690 --> 03:24:44,700
is All This and like why and if you look
 

11787
03:24:44,700 --> 03:24:46,429
is All This and like why and if you look
at the into fundamental physics and the

11788
03:24:46,429 --> 03:24:46,439
at the into fundamental physics and the
 

11789
03:24:46,439 --> 03:24:47,630
at the into fundamental physics and the
quantum field Theory and a standard

11790
03:24:47,630 --> 03:24:47,640
quantum field Theory and a standard
 

11791
03:24:47,640 --> 03:24:50,870
quantum field Theory and a standard
model they're like very complicated and

11792
03:24:50,870 --> 03:24:50,880
model they're like very complicated and
 

11793
03:24:50,880 --> 03:24:51,590
model they're like very complicated and
um

11794
03:24:51,590 --> 03:24:51,600
um
 

11795
03:24:51,600 --> 03:24:53,450
um
there's this like you know 19 free

11796
03:24:53,450 --> 03:24:53,460
there's this like you know 19 free
 

11797
03:24:53,460 --> 03:24:55,849
there's this like you know 19 free
parameter parameters of our universe and

11798
03:24:55,849 --> 03:24:55,859
parameter parameters of our universe and
 

11799
03:24:55,859 --> 03:24:57,410
parameter parameters of our universe and
like what's going on with all this stuff

11800
03:24:57,410 --> 03:24:57,420
like what's going on with all this stuff
 

11801
03:24:57,420 --> 03:24:59,809
like what's going on with all this stuff
and why is it here and can I hack it can

11802
03:24:59,809 --> 03:24:59,819
and why is it here and can I hack it can
 

11803
03:24:59,819 --> 03:25:01,309
and why is it here and can I hack it can
I work with it is there a message for me

11804
03:25:01,309 --> 03:25:01,319
I work with it is there a message for me
 

11805
03:25:01,319 --> 03:25:03,229
I work with it is there a message for me
am I supposed to create a message

11806
03:25:03,229 --> 03:25:03,239
am I supposed to create a message
 

11807
03:25:03,239 --> 03:25:04,670
am I supposed to create a message
and so I think there's some fundamental

11808
03:25:04,670 --> 03:25:04,680
and so I think there's some fundamental
 

11809
03:25:04,680 --> 03:25:06,229
and so I think there's some fundamental
answers there but I think there's

11810
03:25:06,229 --> 03:25:06,239
answers there but I think there's
 

11811
03:25:06,239 --> 03:25:08,330
answers there but I think there's
actually even like you can't actually

11812
03:25:08,330 --> 03:25:08,340
actually even like you can't actually
 

11813
03:25:08,340 --> 03:25:10,550
actually even like you can't actually
really make dent in those without more

11814
03:25:10,550 --> 03:25:10,560
really make dent in those without more
 

11815
03:25:10,560 --> 03:25:12,650
really make dent in those without more
time and so to me also there's a big

11816
03:25:12,650 --> 03:25:12,660
time and so to me also there's a big
 

11817
03:25:12,660 --> 03:25:14,570
time and so to me also there's a big
question around just getting more time

11818
03:25:14,570 --> 03:25:14,580
question around just getting more time
 

11819
03:25:14,580 --> 03:25:15,830
question around just getting more time
honestly

11820
03:25:15,830 --> 03:25:15,840
honestly
 

11821
03:25:15,840 --> 03:25:16,969
honestly
yeah that's kind of like what I think

11822
03:25:16,969 --> 03:25:16,979
yeah that's kind of like what I think
 

11823
03:25:16,979 --> 03:25:19,849
yeah that's kind of like what I think
about quite a bit as well so kind of the

11824
03:25:19,849 --> 03:25:19,859
about quite a bit as well so kind of the
 

11825
03:25:19,859 --> 03:25:21,110
about quite a bit as well so kind of the
ultimate

11826
03:25:21,110 --> 03:25:21,120
ultimate
 

11827
03:25:21,120 --> 03:25:23,510
ultimate
or at least first way to sneak up to the

11828
03:25:23,510 --> 03:25:23,520
or at least first way to sneak up to the
 

11829
03:25:23,520 --> 03:25:27,490
or at least first way to sneak up to the
why question is to try to escape

11830
03:25:27,490 --> 03:25:27,500
why question is to try to escape
 

11831
03:25:27,500 --> 03:25:30,889
why question is to try to escape
uh the system the universe yeah and then

11832
03:25:30,889 --> 03:25:30,899
uh the system the universe yeah and then
 

11833
03:25:30,899 --> 03:25:34,250
uh the system the universe yeah and then
for that you sort of uh backtrack and

11834
03:25:34,250 --> 03:25:34,260
for that you sort of uh backtrack and
 

11835
03:25:34,260 --> 03:25:35,690
for that you sort of uh backtrack and
say okay for that that's going to be

11836
03:25:35,690 --> 03:25:35,700
say okay for that that's going to be
 

11837
03:25:35,700 --> 03:25:37,309
say okay for that that's going to be
take a very long time so the why

11838
03:25:37,309 --> 03:25:37,319
take a very long time so the why
 

11839
03:25:37,319 --> 03:25:39,650
take a very long time so the why
question boils down from an engineering

11840
03:25:39,650 --> 03:25:39,660
question boils down from an engineering
 

11841
03:25:39,660 --> 03:25:41,630
question boils down from an engineering
perspective to how do we extend yeah I

11842
03:25:41,630 --> 03:25:41,640
perspective to how do we extend yeah I
 

11843
03:25:41,640 --> 03:25:42,650
perspective to how do we extend yeah I
think that's the question number one

11844
03:25:42,650 --> 03:25:42,660
think that's the question number one
 

11845
03:25:42,660 --> 03:25:44,150
think that's the question number one
practically speaking because you can't

11846
03:25:44,150 --> 03:25:44,160
practically speaking because you can't
 

11847
03:25:44,160 --> 03:25:46,130
practically speaking because you can't
uh you're not gonna calculate the answer

11848
03:25:46,130 --> 03:25:46,140
uh you're not gonna calculate the answer
 

11849
03:25:46,140 --> 03:25:48,530
uh you're not gonna calculate the answer
to the deeper questions in the time you

11850
03:25:48,530 --> 03:25:48,540
to the deeper questions in the time you
 

11851
03:25:48,540 --> 03:25:50,269
to the deeper questions in the time you
have and that could be extending your

11852
03:25:50,269 --> 03:25:50,279
have and that could be extending your
 

11853
03:25:50,279 --> 03:25:51,950
have and that could be extending your
own lifetime or extending just the

11854
03:25:51,950 --> 03:25:51,960
own lifetime or extending just the
 

11855
03:25:51,960 --> 03:25:53,990
own lifetime or extending just the
lifetime of human civilization of

11856
03:25:53,990 --> 03:25:54,000
lifetime of human civilization of
 

11857
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:55,969
lifetime of human civilization of
whoever wants to not many people might

11858
03:25:55,969 --> 03:25:55,979
whoever wants to not many people might
 

11859
03:25:55,979 --> 03:25:58,610
whoever wants to not many people might
not want that but I think people who do

11860
03:25:58,610 --> 03:25:58,620
not want that but I think people who do
 

11861
03:25:58,620 --> 03:26:00,889
not want that but I think people who do
want that I think um I think it's

11862
03:26:00,889 --> 03:26:00,899
want that I think um I think it's
 

11863
03:26:00,899 --> 03:26:03,229
want that I think um I think it's
probably possible uh and I don't I don't

11864
03:26:03,229 --> 03:26:03,239
probably possible uh and I don't I don't
 

11865
03:26:03,239 --> 03:26:04,370
probably possible uh and I don't I don't
know that people

11866
03:26:04,370 --> 03:26:04,380
know that people
 

11867
03:26:04,380 --> 03:26:06,170
know that people
fully realize this I kind of feel like

11868
03:26:06,170 --> 03:26:06,180
fully realize this I kind of feel like
 

11869
03:26:06,180 --> 03:26:07,429
fully realize this I kind of feel like
people think of death as an

11870
03:26:07,429 --> 03:26:07,439
people think of death as an
 

11871
03:26:07,439 --> 03:26:09,889
people think of death as an
inevitability but at the end of the day

11872
03:26:09,889 --> 03:26:09,899
inevitability but at the end of the day
 

11873
03:26:09,899 --> 03:26:11,750
inevitability but at the end of the day
this is a physical system some things go

11874
03:26:11,750 --> 03:26:11,760
this is a physical system some things go
 

11875
03:26:11,760 --> 03:26:14,690
this is a physical system some things go
wrong uh it makes sense why things like

11876
03:26:14,690 --> 03:26:14,700
wrong uh it makes sense why things like
 

11877
03:26:14,700 --> 03:26:17,210
wrong uh it makes sense why things like
this happen evolutionarily speaking and

11878
03:26:17,210 --> 03:26:17,220
this happen evolutionarily speaking and
 

11879
03:26:17,220 --> 03:26:19,490
this happen evolutionarily speaking and
uh there's most certainly interventions

11880
03:26:19,490 --> 03:26:19,500
uh there's most certainly interventions
 

11881
03:26:19,500 --> 03:26:21,889
uh there's most certainly interventions
that uh that mitigate it that would be

11882
03:26:21,889 --> 03:26:21,899
that uh that mitigate it that would be
 

11883
03:26:21,899 --> 03:26:23,510
that uh that mitigate it that would be
interesting if death is eventually

11884
03:26:23,510 --> 03:26:23,520
interesting if death is eventually
 

11885
03:26:23,520 --> 03:26:24,710
interesting if death is eventually
looked at as

11886
03:26:24,710 --> 03:26:24,720
looked at as
 

11887
03:26:24,720 --> 03:26:27,469
looked at as
as a fascinating thing that used to

11888
03:26:27,469 --> 03:26:27,479
as a fascinating thing that used to
 

11889
03:26:27,479 --> 03:26:29,570
as a fascinating thing that used to
happen to humans I don't think it's

11890
03:26:29,570 --> 03:26:29,580
happen to humans I don't think it's
 

11891
03:26:29,580 --> 03:26:31,490
happen to humans I don't think it's
unlikely I think it's I think it's

11892
03:26:31,490 --> 03:26:31,500
unlikely I think it's I think it's
 

11893
03:26:31,500 --> 03:26:33,110
unlikely I think it's I think it's
likely

11894
03:26:33,110 --> 03:26:33,120
likely
 

11895
03:26:33,120 --> 03:26:36,889
likely
and it's up to our imagination to try to

11896
03:26:36,889 --> 03:26:36,899
and it's up to our imagination to try to
 

11897
03:26:36,899 --> 03:26:38,510
and it's up to our imagination to try to
predict what the world without death

11898
03:26:38,510 --> 03:26:38,520
predict what the world without death
 

11899
03:26:38,520 --> 03:26:41,630
predict what the world without death
looks like yeah it's hard to I think the

11900
03:26:41,630 --> 03:26:41,640
looks like yeah it's hard to I think the
 

11901
03:26:41,640 --> 03:26:44,330
looks like yeah it's hard to I think the
values will completely change

11902
03:26:44,330 --> 03:26:44,340
values will completely change
 

11903
03:26:44,340 --> 03:26:46,790
values will completely change
could be I don't I don't really buy all

11904
03:26:46,790 --> 03:26:46,800
could be I don't I don't really buy all
 

11905
03:26:46,800 --> 03:26:49,550
could be I don't I don't really buy all
these ideas that oh without that there's

11906
03:26:49,550 --> 03:26:49,560
these ideas that oh without that there's
 

11907
03:26:49,560 --> 03:26:52,429
these ideas that oh without that there's
no meaning there's nothing as

11908
03:26:52,429 --> 03:26:52,439
no meaning there's nothing as
 

11909
03:26:52,439 --> 03:26:53,990
no meaning there's nothing as
I don't intuitively buy all those

11910
03:26:53,990 --> 03:26:54,000
I don't intuitively buy all those
 

11911
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:56,030
I don't intuitively buy all those
arguments I think there's plenty of

11912
03:26:56,030 --> 03:26:56,040
arguments I think there's plenty of
 

11913
03:26:56,040 --> 03:26:57,170
arguments I think there's plenty of
meaning plenty of things to learn

11914
03:26:57,170 --> 03:26:57,180
meaning plenty of things to learn
 

11915
03:26:57,180 --> 03:26:58,729
meaning plenty of things to learn
they're interesting exciting I want to

11916
03:26:58,729 --> 03:26:58,739
they're interesting exciting I want to
 

11917
03:26:58,739 --> 03:27:01,010
they're interesting exciting I want to
know I want to calculate uh I want to

11918
03:27:01,010 --> 03:27:01,020
know I want to calculate uh I want to
 

11919
03:27:01,020 --> 03:27:03,349
know I want to calculate uh I want to
improve the condition of

11920
03:27:03,349 --> 03:27:03,359
improve the condition of
 

11921
03:27:03,359 --> 03:27:05,090
improve the condition of
all the humans and organisms that are

11922
03:27:05,090 --> 03:27:05,100
all the humans and organisms that are
 

11923
03:27:05,100 --> 03:27:07,429
all the humans and organisms that are
alive yet the way we find meaning might

11924
03:27:07,429 --> 03:27:07,439
alive yet the way we find meaning might
 

11925
03:27:07,439 --> 03:27:09,769
alive yet the way we find meaning might
change we there is a lot of humans

11926
03:27:09,769 --> 03:27:09,779
change we there is a lot of humans
 

11927
03:27:09,779 --> 03:27:12,110
change we there is a lot of humans
probably including myself that finds

11928
03:27:12,110 --> 03:27:12,120
probably including myself that finds
 

11929
03:27:12,120 --> 03:27:14,990
probably including myself that finds
meaning in the finiteness of things but

11930
03:27:14,990 --> 03:27:15,000
meaning in the finiteness of things but
 

11931
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:16,250
meaning in the finiteness of things but
that doesn't mean that's the only source

11932
03:27:16,250 --> 03:27:16,260
that doesn't mean that's the only source
 

11933
03:27:16,260 --> 03:27:18,290
that doesn't mean that's the only source
of meaning yeah I do think many people

11934
03:27:18,290 --> 03:27:18,300
of meaning yeah I do think many people
 

11935
03:27:18,300 --> 03:27:20,389
of meaning yeah I do think many people
will will go with that which I think is

11936
03:27:20,389 --> 03:27:20,399
will will go with that which I think is
 

11937
03:27:20,399 --> 03:27:22,370
will will go with that which I think is
great I love the idea that people can

11938
03:27:22,370 --> 03:27:22,380
great I love the idea that people can
 

11939
03:27:22,380 --> 03:27:24,590
great I love the idea that people can
just choose their own adventure like you

11940
03:27:24,590 --> 03:27:24,600
just choose their own adventure like you
 

11941
03:27:24,600 --> 03:27:26,389
just choose their own adventure like you
you are born as a conscious free entity

11942
03:27:26,389 --> 03:27:26,399
you are born as a conscious free entity
 

11943
03:27:26,399 --> 03:27:29,929
you are born as a conscious free entity
by default I'd like to think and um you

11944
03:27:29,929 --> 03:27:29,939
by default I'd like to think and um you
 

11945
03:27:29,939 --> 03:27:33,290
by default I'd like to think and um you
have your unalienable rights for Life uh

11946
03:27:33,290 --> 03:27:33,300
have your unalienable rights for Life uh
 

11947
03:27:33,300 --> 03:27:35,690
have your unalienable rights for Life uh
in the pursuit of happiness I don't know

11948
03:27:35,690 --> 03:27:35,700
in the pursuit of happiness I don't know
 

11949
03:27:35,700 --> 03:27:38,210
in the pursuit of happiness I don't know
if you have that in the nature the

11950
03:27:38,210 --> 03:27:38,220
if you have that in the nature the
 

11951
03:27:38,220 --> 03:27:40,250
if you have that in the nature the
landscape of happiness you can choose

11952
03:27:40,250 --> 03:27:40,260
landscape of happiness you can choose
 

11953
03:27:40,260 --> 03:27:42,229
landscape of happiness you can choose
your own adventure mostly and that's not

11954
03:27:42,229 --> 03:27:42,239
your own adventure mostly and that's not
 

11955
03:27:42,239 --> 03:27:44,570
your own adventure mostly and that's not
it's not fully true but I still am

11956
03:27:44,570 --> 03:27:44,580
it's not fully true but I still am
 

11957
03:27:44,580 --> 03:27:47,630
it's not fully true but I still am
pretty sure I'm an NPC but

11958
03:27:47,630 --> 03:27:47,640
pretty sure I'm an NPC but
 

11959
03:27:47,640 --> 03:27:50,929
pretty sure I'm an NPC but
um an NPC can't know it's an NPC

11960
03:27:50,929 --> 03:27:50,939
um an NPC can't know it's an NPC
 

11961
03:27:50,939 --> 03:27:52,969
um an NPC can't know it's an NPC
there could be different degrees and

11962
03:27:52,969 --> 03:27:52,979
there could be different degrees and
 

11963
03:27:52,979 --> 03:27:54,950
there could be different degrees and
levels of consciousness I don't think

11964
03:27:54,950 --> 03:27:54,960
levels of consciousness I don't think
 

11965
03:27:54,960 --> 03:27:57,790
levels of consciousness I don't think
there's a more beautiful way to end it

11966
03:27:57,790 --> 03:27:57,800
there's a more beautiful way to end it
 

11967
03:27:57,800 --> 03:28:00,590
there's a more beautiful way to end it
uh Andre you're an incredible person I'm

learning world for the AI world
 

11975
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:08,090

to just inspire people to educate

11976
03:28:08,090 --> 03:28:08,100
to just inspire people to educate
 

11977
