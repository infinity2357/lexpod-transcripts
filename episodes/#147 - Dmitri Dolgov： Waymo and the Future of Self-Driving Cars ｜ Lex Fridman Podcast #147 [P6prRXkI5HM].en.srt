149
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,309

was

150
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
was
 

151
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,750
was
in the late 80s uh

152
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
in the late 80s uh
 

153
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,830
in the late 80s uh
when we got our first computer i think

154
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
when we got our first computer i think
 

155
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,350
when we got our first computer i think
was an

156
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
was an
 

157
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,949

around
 

199
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,390
around
and trying to figure out how to make the

200
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
and trying to figure out how to make the
 

201
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,350
and trying to figure out how to make the
thing

do other stuff got into
 

205
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,830
do other stuff got into
exploring know programming and a couple

206
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
exploring know programming and a couple
 

207
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,630
exploring know programming and a couple
of years

208
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
of years
 

209
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,070
of years
later i got to a point where um i

japanese game developer
actually offered to buy it for me for

218
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
actually offered to buy it for me for
 

219

stupidity yes that was not the most

232
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
stupidity yes that was not the most
 

233
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,509
stupidity yes that was not the most
acute financial move that i made in my

234
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
acute financial move that i made in my
 

235
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,190
acute financial move that i made in my
life you know looking back at it now

236
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
life you know looking back at it now
 

237
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,030
life you know looking back at it now
uh i instead put it well you know i had

238
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
uh i instead put it well you know i had
 

239
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,110
uh i instead put it well you know i had
a reason i i put it online

240
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
a reason i i put it online
 

241
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,350
a reason i i put it online
uh it was what did you call it back in

242
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
uh it was what did you call it back in
 

243
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,630
uh it was what did you call it back in
the days it was a freeware i think

244
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
the days it was a freeware i think
 

245
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,390
the days it was a freeware i think
right it was not open source but you

246
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
right it was not open source but you
 

247
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,750
right it was not open source but you
could upload the binaries you put the

248
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
could upload the binaries you put the
 

249
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,190
could upload the binaries you put the
game online and the idea was that you

250
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
game online and the idea was that you
 

251
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,869
game online and the idea was that you
know people like it and then they you

252
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
know people like it and then they you
 

253
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,190
know people like it and then they you
know

254
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
know
 

255
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,310
know
contribute and they send you little

256
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
contribute and they send you little
 

257
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,909
contribute and they send you little
donations right so i did my quick math

258
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
donations right so i did my quick math
 

259
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,990
donations right so i did my quick math
of like you know my of course you know

260
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
of like you know my of course you know
 

261
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,110
of like you know my of course you know
thousands and millions of people are

262
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
thousands and millions of people are
 

263
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,310
thousands and millions of people are
going to play my game send me a couple

264
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
going to play my game send me a couple
 

265
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,430
going to play my game send me a couple
of bucks a piece you know

266
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
of bucks a piece you know
 

267
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,390
of bucks a piece you know
should definitely do that as i said not

268
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
should definitely do that as i said not
 

269
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,749
should definitely do that as i said not
not the best

270
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759

 

271
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,350

remember what language it was what

272
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
remember what language it was what
 

273
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,590
remember what language it was what
programming it was about

274
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
programming it was about
 

275
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,749
programming it was about
which what pascal pascal and they had a

276
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
which what pascal pascal and they had a
 

277
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,710
which what pascal pascal and they had a
graphical component

278
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
graphical component
 

279
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,430
graphical component
so that text based yeah yeah it was uh

280
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
so that text based yeah yeah it was uh
 

281
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,469
so that text based yeah yeah it was uh
like

282
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
like
 

283
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,909
like
i think 320 by 200 whatever it was

284
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
i think 320 by 200 whatever it was
 

285
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,189
i think 320 by 200 whatever it was
i think that kind of the earlier that's

286
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
i think that kind of the earlier that's
 

287
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,110
i think that kind of the earlier that's
the cga resolution right

288
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
the cga resolution right
 

289
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,710
the cga resolution right
and i actually think the reason why this

290
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
and i actually think the reason why this
 

291
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,990
and i actually think the reason why this
company wanted to buy it is not like the

292
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
company wanted to buy it is not like the
 

293
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,990
company wanted to buy it is not like the
fancy graphics or the implementation

294
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
fancy graphics or the implementation
 

295
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,790
fancy graphics or the implementation
it was maybe the idea uh of my actual

296
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
it was maybe the idea uh of my actual
 

297
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,189
it was maybe the idea uh of my actual
game

298
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
game
 

299
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,150
game
the idea of the game okay well one of

300
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
the idea of the game okay well one of
 

301
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,950
the idea of the game okay well one of
the things

302
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
the things
 

303
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,390
the things
it's so funny i used to play this game

304
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
it's so funny i used to play this game
 

305
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,230
it's so funny i used to play this game
called golden axe

306
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
called golden axe
 

307
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,590
called golden axe
and the simplicity of the graphics

308
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
and the simplicity of the graphics
 

309
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,749
and the simplicity of the graphics
and something about the simplicity of

310
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
and something about the simplicity of
 

311
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,590
and something about the simplicity of
the music like

312
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
the music like
 

313
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,590
the music like
it still haunts me i don't know if

314
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
it still haunts me i don't know if
 

315
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,029
it still haunts me i don't know if
that's a childhood thing i don't know if

316
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
that's a childhood thing i don't know if
 

317
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,469
that's a childhood thing i don't know if
that's the same thing for call of duty

318
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
that's the same thing for call of duty
 

319
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,909
that's the same thing for call of duty
these days for young kids

320
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
these days for young kids
 

321
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,270
these days for young kids
but i still think that the

322
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
but i still think that the
 

323
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,790
but i still think that the
simple one the games are simple that

324
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
simple one the games are simple that
 

325
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,070
simple one the games are simple that
simple purity makes for

326
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
simple purity makes for
 

327
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,909
simple purity makes for
like allows your imagination to take

back in the 80s and you know in russia i
you probably are familiar with that legs

498
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
you probably are familiar with that legs
 

499
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,710
you probably are familiar with that legs
they had these

500
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
they had these
 

501
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,189
they had these
uh you know police officers they would

502
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
uh you know police officers they would
 

503
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,309
uh you know police officers they would
stand in the middle of an intersection

504
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
stand in the middle of an intersection
 

505
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:20,790
stand in the middle of an intersection
all day

506
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
all day
 

507
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,230
all day
and they would have their like striped

508
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
and they would have their like striped
 

509
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,909
and they would have their like striped
black and white batons that they would

510
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
black and white batons that they would
 

511
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,270
black and white batons that they would
use to you know control the flow of

512
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
use to you know control the flow of
 

513
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,070
use to you know control the flow of
traffic

514
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
traffic
 

515
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,950
traffic
and you know for whatever reason i was

516
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
and you know for whatever reason i was
 

517
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,550
and you know for whatever reason i was
strangely infatuated with this whole

518
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
strangely infatuated with this whole
 

519
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,630
strangely infatuated with this whole
process and like that that was my dream

520
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
process and like that that was my dream
 

521
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,149
process and like that that was my dream
uh that's what i wanted to do when i

522
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
uh that's what i wanted to do when i
 

523
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,909
uh that's what i wanted to do when i
grew up and you know my

524
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
grew up and you know my
 

525
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,829
grew up and you know my
parents uh both physics profs by the way

526
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
parents uh both physics profs by the way
 

527
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,949
parents uh both physics profs by the way
i think we're

528
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
i think we're
 

529
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,709
i think we're
you know a little concerned uh with that

530
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
you know a little concerned uh with that
 

531
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,389
you know a little concerned uh with that
level of ambition coming from their

532
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
level of ambition coming from their
 

533
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:44,790
level of ambition coming from their
child

534
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
child
 

535
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,910
child
yeah uh you know that age well that it's

536
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
yeah uh you know that age well that it's
 

537
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,110
yeah uh you know that age well that it's
an interesting i don't know if

538
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
an interesting i don't know if
 

539
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,910
an interesting i don't know if
you can relate but i very much love that

540
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
you can relate but i very much love that
 

541
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,710
you can relate but i very much love that
idea

542
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
idea
 

543
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,430
idea
i have a ocd nature that i think lends

544
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
i have a ocd nature that i think lends
 

545
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,870
i have a ocd nature that i think lends

itself
 

547
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,829
itself
very close to the engineering mindset

548
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
very close to the engineering mindset
 

549
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,870
very close to the engineering mindset
which is you want to kind of

550
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
which is you want to kind of
 

551
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,990
which is you want to kind of
optimize you know solve a problem by

552
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
optimize you know solve a problem by
 

553
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,550
optimize you know solve a problem by
create creating an automated

554
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
create creating an automated
 

555
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,350
create creating an automated
solution like like a set of rules the

556
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
solution like like a set of rules the
 

557
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,949
solution like like a set of rules the

set of rules you could follow
 

559
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,190
set of rules you could follow
and then thereby make it ultra efficient

560
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
and then thereby make it ultra efficient
 

561
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,310
and then thereby make it ultra efficient
i don't know if that's

562
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
i don't know if that's
 

563
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,470
i don't know if that's
it was it of that nature i certainly

564
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
it was it of that nature i certainly
 

565
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,910
it was it of that nature i certainly
have that there's like fact

566
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
have that there's like fact
 

567
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,550
have that there's like fact
like simcity and factory building games

568
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
like simcity and factory building games
 

569
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,910
like simcity and factory building games
all those kinds of things

570
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
all those kinds of things
 

571
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,590
all those kinds of things
kind of speak to that engineering

572
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
kind of speak to that engineering
 

573
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,910
kind of speak to that engineering
mindset or did you just like the uniform

574
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
mindset or did you just like the uniform
 

575
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,430
mindset or did you just like the uniform
i think it was more of the latter i

576
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
i think it was more of the latter i
 

577
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,110
i think it was more of the latter i
think it was the uniform and

578
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
think it was the uniform and
 

579
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,910
think it was the uniform and
you know the the striped baton that made

580
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
you know the the striped baton that made
 

581
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,269
you know the the striped baton that made
cars go

582
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
cars go
 

583
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,670
cars go
in the right direction but i guess you

584
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
in the right direction but i guess you
 

585
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,790
in the right direction but i guess you
know it is

586
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
know it is
 

587
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,910
know it is
i did end up uh i guess uh you know

588
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
i did end up uh i guess uh you know
 

589
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,590
i did end up uh i guess uh you know
working on the transportation industry

590
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
working on the transportation industry
 

591
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,430
working on the transportation industry
one way or another no uniform though but

592
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
one way or another no uniform though but
 

593
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,269
one way or another no uniform though but
that's right

594
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
that's right
 

595
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,670
that's right
maybe it was my you know deep inner

596
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
maybe it was my you know deep inner
 

597
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,949
maybe it was my you know deep inner
infatuation with

598
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
infatuation with
 

599
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,190
infatuation with
the you know traffic control batons that

600
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
the you know traffic control batons that
 

601
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,710
the you know traffic control batons that
led to this

602
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
led to this
 

603
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,990
led to this
career okay what uh when did you

604
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
career okay what uh when did you
 

605
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,990
career okay what uh when did you
when was the leap from programming to

606
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
when was the leap from programming to
 

607
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,829
when was the leap from programming to
robotics that happened later that was

608
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
robotics that happened later that was
 

609
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,030
robotics that happened later that was
after grad school

610
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
after grad school
 

611
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,949
after grad school
uh after and actually the most

612
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
uh after and actually the most
 

613
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,590
uh after and actually the most
self-driving cars was i think my first

614
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
self-driving cars was i think my first
 

615
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,470
self-driving cars was i think my first
real hands-on introduction to robotics

616
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
real hands-on introduction to robotics
 

617
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,750
real hands-on introduction to robotics
but i i never

618
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
but i i never
 

619
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,910
but i i never
really had that much hands-on experience

620
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
really had that much hands-on experience
 

621
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,750
really had that much hands-on experience
in school and training i you know worked

622
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
in school and training i you know worked
 

623
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,630
in school and training i you know worked
on applied math

624
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
on applied math
 

625
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,910
on applied math
and physics then in college i did more

626
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
and physics then in college i did more
 

627
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,069
and physics then in college i did more
of abstract computer science

628
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
of abstract computer science
 

629
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,030
of abstract computer science
and it was after grad school that i

630
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
and it was after grad school that i
 

631
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,670
and it was after grad school that i
really got

632
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
really got
 

633
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,430
really got
involved in robotics which was actually

634
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
involved in robotics which was actually
 

635
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,190
involved in robotics which was actually
self-driving cars and

636
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
self-driving cars and
 

637
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,509
self-driving cars and
you know that was a big big flip what uh

638
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
you know that was a big big flip what uh
 

639
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,630
you know that was a big big flip what uh
well grad school

640
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
well grad school
 

641
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,150
well grad school
so i went to grad school in michigan and

642
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
so i went to grad school in michigan and
 

643
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,670
so i went to grad school in michigan and
then i did a postdoc at stanford uh

644
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
then i did a postdoc at stanford uh
 

645
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,470
then i did a postdoc at stanford uh
which is

646
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
which is
 

647
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,110
which is
that was the postdoc where i got to play

648
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
that was the postdoc where i got to play
 

649
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,870
that was the postdoc where i got to play
with celebrating cars

650
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
with celebrating cars
 

651
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,030
with celebrating cars
yeah so we'll return there let's go back

652
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
yeah so we'll return there let's go back
 

653
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,590
yeah so we'll return there let's go back
to uh to moscow so i

654
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
to uh to moscow so i
 

655
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,430
to uh to moscow so i
you know for episode 100 i talked to my

656
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
you know for episode 100 i talked to my
 

657
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,910
you know for episode 100 i talked to my
dad and also i grew up with my dad

658
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
dad and also i grew up with my dad
 

659
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,269
dad and also i grew up with my dad
i guess uh

660
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,389
from from a certain perspective
autonomous vehicles is a funny world

828
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
autonomous vehicles is a funny world
 

829
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,990
autonomous vehicles is a funny world
in a certain circle of people everybody

830
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
in a certain circle of people everybody
 

831
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,069
in a certain circle of people everybody
knows everything and then a certain

832
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
knows everything and then a certain
 

833
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:42,790
knows everything and then a certain
circle

834
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
circle
 

835
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,670
circle
uh nobody knows anything in terms of

836
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
uh nobody knows anything in terms of
 

837
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,470
uh nobody knows anything in terms of
general public

838
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
general public
 

839
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,269
general public
so it's interesting it's it's a good

840
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
so it's interesting it's it's a good
 

841
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,790
so it's interesting it's it's a good
question what to talk about but

842
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
question what to talk about but
 

843
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,069
question what to talk about but
i do think that the urban challenge is

844
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
i do think that the urban challenge is
 

845
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,870
i do think that the urban challenge is
worth revisiting it's a fun little

846
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
worth revisiting it's a fun little
 

847
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,430
worth revisiting it's a fun little
challenge

848
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
challenge
 

849
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,829
challenge
one that in first it like sparked so

850
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
one that in first it like sparked so
 

851
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,350
one that in first it like sparked so
much so many incredible

852
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
much so many incredible
 

853
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,509
much so many incredible
minds to focus on one of the hardest

854
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
minds to focus on one of the hardest
 

855
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,949
minds to focus on one of the hardest
problems of our time

856
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
problems of our time
 

857
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,710
problems of our time
in artificial intelligence so that's

858
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
in artificial intelligence so that's
 

859
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,790
in artificial intelligence so that's
it's a success from a perspective of a

860
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
it's a success from a perspective of a
 

861
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,550
it's a success from a perspective of a
single little challenge

862
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
single little challenge
 

863
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,389
single little challenge
but can you talk about like what did the

864
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
but can you talk about like what did the
 

865
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,590
but can you talk about like what did the
challenge involve

866
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
challenge involve
 

867
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,590
challenge involve
so were there pedestrians were there

868
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
so were there pedestrians were there
 

869
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,870
so were there pedestrians were there
other cars

870
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
other cars
 

871
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,150
other cars
what was the goal uh who was on the team

872
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
what was the goal uh who was on the team
 

873
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,670
what was the goal uh who was on the team
how long did it take any fun fun sort of

874
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
how long did it take any fun fun sort of
 

875
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,870
how long did it take any fun fun sort of
specs sure so the way the

876
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
specs sure so the way the
 

877
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,790
specs sure so the way the
the challenge was constructed in just a

878
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
the challenge was constructed in just a
 

879
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,069
the challenge was constructed in just a
little bit of background and as i

880
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
little bit of background and as i
 

881
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,350
little bit of background and as i
mentioned this was the

882
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
mentioned this was the
 

883
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,230
mentioned this was the
third uh competition in that series the

884
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
third uh competition in that series the
 

885
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,910
third uh competition in that series the
first two uh were the grand challenge

886
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
first two uh were the grand challenge
 

887
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,189
first two uh were the grand challenge
called the grand challenge the goal

888
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
called the grand challenge the goal
 

889
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,150
called the grand challenge the goal
there was to just

890
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
there was to just
 

891
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,069
there was to just
drive in a completely static environment

892
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
drive in a completely static environment
 

893
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,829
drive in a completely static environment
you know you had to drive in the desert

894
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
you know you had to drive in the desert
 

895
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,870
you know you had to drive in the desert
uh

896
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
uh
 

897
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,389
uh
that was very successful so then darpa

898
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
that was very successful so then darpa
 

899
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,030
that was very successful so then darpa
followed

900
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
followed
 

901
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,470
followed
with what they called the urban

902
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
with what they called the urban
 

903
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,509
with what they called the urban
challenge where the goal was to have you

904
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
challenge where the goal was to have you
 

905
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,430
challenge where the goal was to have you
know build vehicles that could operate

906
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
know build vehicles that could operate
 

907
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,509
know build vehicles that could operate
in more dynamic environments and share

908
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
in more dynamic environments and share
 

909
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,790
in more dynamic environments and share
them with other vehicles there were no

910
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
them with other vehicles there were no
 

911
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,670
them with other vehicles there were no
pedestrians

912
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
pedestrians
 

913
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,750
pedestrians
there but what darpa did is they took

914
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
there but what darpa did is they took
 

915
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,189
there but what darpa did is they took
over an abandoned

916
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
over an abandoned
 

917
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,670
over an abandoned
air force base and it was kind of like a

918
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
air force base and it was kind of like a
 

919
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,870
air force base and it was kind of like a
little fake city

920
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
little fake city
 

921
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,990
little fake city
that they built out there and they had

922
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
that they built out there and they had
 

923
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,110
that they built out there and they had
a bunch of uh robots uh you know cars

924
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
a bunch of uh robots uh you know cars
 

925
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,949
a bunch of uh robots uh you know cars
that were autonomous uh in there all at

926
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
that were autonomous uh in there all at
 

927
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,269
that were autonomous uh in there all at
the same time uh mixed in

928
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
the same time uh mixed in
 

929
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,110
the same time uh mixed in
with other vehicles driven by

930
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
with other vehicles driven by
 

931
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,949
with other vehicles driven by
professional uh drivers

932
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
professional uh drivers
 

933
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,310
professional uh drivers
and each car had a mission and so

934
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
and each car had a mission and so
 

935
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,949
and each car had a mission and so
there's a crude map that they received

936
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
there's a crude map that they received
 

937
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,389
there's a crude map that they received
at the beginning and they had a mission

938
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
at the beginning and they had a mission
 

939
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,990
at the beginning and they had a mission
and go you know here and then there and

940
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
and go you know here and then there and
 

941
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,870
and go you know here and then there and
over here

942
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
over here
 

943
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,069
over here
um and they kind of all were sharing

944
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
um and they kind of all were sharing
 

945
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,269
um and they kind of all were sharing
this environment at the same time they

946
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
this environment at the same time they
 

947
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,629
this environment at the same time they
interact to interact with each other

948
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
interact to interact with each other
 

949
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,749
interact to interact with each other
they had to interact with the human

950
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
they had to interact with the human
 

951
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,310
they had to interact with the human

953
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,350
drivers
there's this very first very rudimentary

954
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
there's this very first very rudimentary
 

955
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,030
there's this very first very rudimentary
um version of uh a self-driving car

956
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
um version of uh a self-driving car
 

957
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,230
um version of uh a self-driving car
that you know could operate on and on

958
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
that you know could operate on and on
 

959
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,069
that you know could operate on and on
yeah in an environment you know shared

960
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
yeah in an environment you know shared
 

961
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,430
yeah in an environment you know shared
with other dynamic actors

962
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
with other dynamic actors
 

963
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,230
with other dynamic actors
that as you said you're really in many

964
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
that as you said you're really in many
 

965
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,710
that as you said you're really in many
ways

966
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
ways
 

967
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,749
ways
you know kick started this whole

968
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
you know kick started this whole
 

969
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,910
you know kick started this whole
industry okay so

970
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
industry okay so
 

971
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,470
industry okay so
who was on the team and how did you do i

972
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
who was on the team and how did you do i
 

973
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,550
who was on the team and how did you do i
forget

974
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
forget
 

975
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,590
forget
uh we came in second uh

976
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
uh we came in second uh
 

977
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,870
uh we came in second uh
perhaps that was my contribution to the

978
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
perhaps that was my contribution to the
 

979
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,230
perhaps that was my contribution to the
team i think the stanford team came in

980
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
team i think the stanford team came in
 

981
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,990
team i think the stanford team came in
first in the darpa challenge uh but then

982
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
first in the darpa challenge uh but then
 

983
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,269
first in the darpa challenge uh but then
i joined the team and you know

984
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
i joined the team and you know
 

985
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,710
i joined the team and you know
you were the one with the bug in the

986
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
you were the one with the bug in the
 

987
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,189
you were the one with the bug in the
code i mean do you have sort of memories

988
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
code i mean do you have sort of memories
 

989
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,430
code i mean do you have sort of memories
of some particularly challenging things

990
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
of some particularly challenging things
 

991
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,509
of some particularly challenging things
or

992
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
or
 

993
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,030
or
you know one of the cool things it's not

994
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
you know one of the cool things it's not
 

995
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,030
you know one of the cool things it's not
a you know this isn't a product this

996
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
a you know this isn't a product this
 

997
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,310
a you know this isn't a product this
isn't the thing that

998
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,320
isn't the thing that
 

999
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,030
isn't the thing that
uh you know it there's you have a little

1000
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
uh you know it there's you have a little
 

1001
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,629
uh you know it there's you have a little
bit more freedom to experiment so you

1002
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
bit more freedom to experiment so you
 

1003
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,069
bit more freedom to experiment so you
can take risks and there's

1004
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
can take risks and there's
 

1005
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,949
can take risks and there's
uh so you can make mistakes uh so is

1006
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
uh so you can make mistakes uh so is
 

1007
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,870
uh so you can make mistakes uh so is
there interesting mistakes

1008
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
there interesting mistakes
 

1009
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,310
there interesting mistakes
is there interesting challenges that

1010
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
is there interesting challenges that
 

1011
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,310
is there interesting challenges that
stand out to you or some like taught you

1012
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
stand out to you or some like taught you
 

1013
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,430
stand out to you or some like taught you
um a good technical lesson or a good

1014
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
um a good technical lesson or a good
 

1015
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,110
um a good technical lesson or a good
philosophical lesson

1016
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
philosophical lesson
 

1017
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,189
philosophical lesson
from that time yeah uh you know

1018
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
from that time yeah uh you know
 

1019
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,389
from that time yeah uh you know
definitely definitely a very

1020
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
definitely definitely a very
 

1021
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,310
definitely definitely a very
memorable time not really a challenge

1022
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
memorable time not really a challenge
 

1023
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,470
memorable time not really a challenge
but like one of the

1024
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
but like one of the
 

1025
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,949
but like one of the
most vivid memories that i have from the

1026
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
most vivid memories that i have from the
 

1027
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,910
most vivid memories that i have from the
time

1028
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
time
 

1029
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,189
time
and i think that was actually one of the

1030
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
and i think that was actually one of the
 

1031
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,550
and i think that was actually one of the
days that

1032
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
days that
 

1033
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,030
days that
really got me hooked on this whole field

1034
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
really got me hooked on this whole field
 

1035
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,710
really got me hooked on this whole field
was

1036
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
was
 

1037
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,150
was
the first time i got to run my software

1038
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
the first time i got to run my software
 

1039
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,669
the first time i got to run my software
on the car and i was working on a part

1040
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
on the car and i was working on a part
 

1041
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,069
on the car and i was working on a part
of

1042
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
of
 

1043
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,710
of
our planning algorithm uh that had to

1044
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
our planning algorithm uh that had to
 

1045
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,230
our planning algorithm uh that had to
navigate in parking lots so it's you

1046
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
navigate in parking lots so it's you
 

1047
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,350
navigate in parking lots so it's you
know something that you know called free

1048
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
know something that you know called free
 

1049
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,829
know something that you know called free
space

1050
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
space
 

1051
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,429
space
motion planning so the very first

1052
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
motion planning so the very first
 

1053
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,270
motion planning so the very first
version of that uh

1054
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
version of that uh
 

1055
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,029
version of that uh
you know we tried on the car it was on

1056
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
you know we tried on the car it was on
 

1057
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,549
you know we tried on the car it was on
stanford's campus uh

1058
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
stanford's campus uh
 

1059
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,909
stanford's campus uh
in the middle of the night and you know

1060
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
in the middle of the night and you know
 

1061
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,429
in the middle of the night and you know
i had this little you know course

1062
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
i had this little you know course
 

1063
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,549
i had this little you know course
constructed with cones

1064
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
constructed with cones
 

1065
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,390
constructed with cones
uh in the middle of a parking lot so

1066
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
uh in the middle of a parking lot so
 

1067
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,909
uh in the middle of a parking lot so
we're there like 3 a.m you know by the

1068
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
we're there like 3 a.m you know by the
 

1069
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,430
we're there like 3 a.m you know by the
time we got the code to

1070
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
time we got the code to
 

1071
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,630
time we got the code to
you know you know compile and turn over

1072
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
you know you know compile and turn over
 

1073
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,549
you know you know compile and turn over
and you know it drove like i actually

1074
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
and you know it drove like i actually
 

1075
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,070
and you know it drove like i actually
did something quite reasonable

1076
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
did something quite reasonable
 

1077
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,190
did something quite reasonable
and you know it was of course very buggy

1078
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
and you know it was of course very buggy
 

1079
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,990
and you know it was of course very buggy
at the time

1080
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
at the time
 

1081
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,990
at the time
and had all kinds of problems but it was

1082
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
and had all kinds of problems but it was
 

1083
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,789
and had all kinds of problems but it was
pretty darn magical i remember going

1084
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
pretty darn magical i remember going
 

1085

silence right each iron had its own
personality if you will so you know off

1154
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
personality if you will so you know off
 

1155

personality if you will so you know off
they go and you don't see them you just

1156
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
they go and you don't see them you just
 

1157
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,909
they go and you don't see them you just
kind of and then every once in a while

1158
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
kind of and then every once in a while
 

1159
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,190
kind of and then every once in a while
they you know come a little bit closer

1160
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
they you know come a little bit closer
 

1161
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,950
they you know come a little bit closer
to where

1162
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
to where
 

1163
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,549
to where
the audience is and you can kind of hear

1164
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
the audience is and you can kind of hear
 

1165
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,230
the audience is and you can kind of hear
you know the sound of your car and you

1166
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
you know the sound of your car and you
 

1167
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,669
you know the sound of your car and you
know it seems to be moving along so that

1168
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
know it seems to be moving along so that
 

1169
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,630
know it seems to be moving along so that
you know gives you hope

1170
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
you know gives you hope
 

1171
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,470
you know gives you hope
and then you know it goes away and you

1172
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
and then you know it goes away and you
 

1173
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,750
and then you know it goes away and you
can't hear it for too long you start

1174
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:01,760
can't hear it for too long you start
 

1175
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,789
can't hear it for too long you start
getting anxious right just a little bit

1176
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
getting anxious right just a little bit
 

1177
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,669
getting anxious right just a little bit
like you know sending your kids to

1178
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
like you know sending your kids to
 

1179
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,549
like you know sending your kids to
college and like you know

1180
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
college and like you know
 

1181
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,990
college and like you know
kind of you invested in them you hope

1182
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
kind of you invested in them you hope
 

1183
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,390
kind of you invested in them you hope
you you you you you build it properly

1184
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
you you you you you build it properly
 

1185
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,789
you you you you you build it properly
but

1186
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
but
 

1187
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,909
but
like it's still anxiety-inducing uh so

1188
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
like it's still anxiety-inducing uh so
 

1189
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,390
like it's still anxiety-inducing uh so
that was

1190
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,400
that was
 

1191
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,750
that was
an incredibly uh fun few days

1192
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
an incredibly uh fun few days
 

1193
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,750
an incredibly uh fun few days
in terms of you know bugs as you

1194
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
in terms of you know bugs as you
 

1195
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,870
in terms of you know bugs as you
mentioned you know one

1196
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
mentioned you know one
 

1197
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,430
mentioned you know one
that was my bug that caused us the loss

1198
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
that was my bug that caused us the loss
 

1199
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,630
that was my bug that caused us the loss
of the first place

1200
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
of the first place
 

1201
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,870
of the first place
is still a debate that you occasionally

1202
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
is still a debate that you occasionally
 

1203
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,310
is still a debate that you occasionally
have with people on the cmu team scene

1204
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
have with people on the cmu team scene
 

1205
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,190
have with people on the cmu team scene
you came first

1206
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
you came first
 

1207
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,070
you came first
i should mention uh that you haven't

1208
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
i should mention uh that you haven't
 

1209
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,710
i should mention uh that you haven't
heard of them

1210
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
heard of them
 

1211
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,470
heard of them
but yeah no it's something you know it's

1212
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
but yeah no it's something you know it's
 

1213
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,630
but yeah no it's something you know it's
a small school it's it's

1214
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
a small school it's it's
 

1215
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,070
a small school it's it's
really a glitch that you know they

1216
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
really a glitch that you know they
 

1217
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,830
really a glitch that you know they
happen to succeed at something robotics

1218
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
happen to succeed at something robotics
 

1219
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,510
happen to succeed at something robotics
related very scenic though

1220
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
related very scenic though
 

1221
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,070
related very scenic though
most people go there for the scenery um

1222
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
most people go there for the scenery um
 

1223
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,549
most people go there for the scenery um
yeah

1224
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
yeah
 

1225
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,909
yeah
that's right it's a beautiful campus

1226
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919

 

1227
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,990

unlike stanford so for people yeah

1228
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
unlike stanford so for people yeah
 

1229
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,430
unlike stanford so for people yeah
that's true i like stanford for people

navigating parking lots

1246
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
navigating parking lots
 

1247
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,390
navigating parking lots
and the way you know that part of the

1248
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
and the way you know that part of the
 

1249
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,909
and the way you know that part of the
mission worked is

1250
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
mission worked is
 

1251
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,870
mission worked is
yeah you in a parking lot you would get

1252
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
yeah you in a parking lot you would get
 

1253
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,149
yeah you in a parking lot you would get
from darpa

1254
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
from darpa
 

1255
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,390
from darpa
an outline of the map you can get this

1256
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
an outline of the map you can get this
 

1257
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,750
an outline of the map you can get this
you know giant polygon

1258
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
you know giant polygon
 

1259
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,190
you know giant polygon
that defined the perimeter of the

1260
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
that defined the perimeter of the
 

1261
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,950
that defined the perimeter of the
parking lot uh and there would be an

1262
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
parking lot uh and there would be an
 

1263
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,390
parking lot uh and there would be an
entrance and you know so maybe

1264
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
entrance and you know so maybe
 

1265
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,830
entrance and you know so maybe
multiple entries or access to it and

1266
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
multiple entries or access to it and
 

1267
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,870
multiple entries or access to it and
then you would get a goal

1268
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
then you would get a goal
 

1269
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,390
then you would get a goal
within that open space xy

1270
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
within that open space xy
 

1271
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,230
within that open space xy
you know heading where the car had to

1272
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
you know heading where the car had to
 

1273
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,990
you know heading where the car had to
park it had no information about the

1274
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
park it had no information about the
 

1275
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,669
park it had no information about the
optical selling obstacles that

1276
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
optical selling obstacles that
 

1277
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,190
optical selling obstacles that
the car might encounter there so it had

1278
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
the car might encounter there so it had
 

1279
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,029
the car might encounter there so it had
to navigate uh kind of completely free

1280
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,039
to navigate uh kind of completely free
 

1281
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,590
to navigate uh kind of completely free
space

1282
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
space
 

1283
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,990
space
from the entrance to the parking lot

1284
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
from the entrance to the parking lot
 

1285
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,710
from the entrance to the parking lot
into

1286
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
into
 

1287
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,750
into
that parking space and then uh

1288
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
that parking space and then uh
 

1289
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,789
that parking space and then uh
once parked there it had to

1290
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:48,799
once parked there it had to
 

1291
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,870
once parked there it had to
exit the parking lot while of course

1292
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
exit the parking lot while of course
 

1293
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,310
exit the parking lot while of course
encountering and reasoning about all the

1294
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
encountering and reasoning about all the
 

1295
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,549
encountering and reasoning about all the
obstacles that it encounters in real

1296
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
obstacles that it encounters in real
 

1297
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,190
obstacles that it encounters in real
time

1298
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
time
 

1299
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,470
time
so uh

1300
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480

 

1301
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,590

our interpretation or at least my

1302
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
our interpretation or at least my
 

1303
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,350
our interpretation or at least my
interpretation of the rules was that you

1304
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
interpretation of the rules was that you
 

1305
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,390
interpretation of the rules was that you
had to reverse

1306
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
had to reverse
 

1307
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,549
had to reverse
out of the parking spot and that's what

1308
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
out of the parking spot and that's what
 

1309
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,390
out of the parking spot and that's what
our cars did even if there's no optical

1310
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
our cars did even if there's no optical
 

1311
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,950
our cars did even if there's no optical
in front

1312
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
in front
 

1313
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,190
in front
that's not what seam used car did and it

1314
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
that's not what seam used car did and it
 

1315
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,070
that's not what seam used car did and it
just kind of

1316
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
just kind of
 

1317
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,070
just kind of
drove right through so there's still a

1318
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
drove right through so there's still a
 

1319
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,430
drove right through so there's still a
debate and of course you know if you

1320
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
debate and of course you know if you
 

1321
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,190
debate and of course you know if you
stop and then reverse out and go out the

1322
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
stop and then reverse out and go out the
 

1323
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,870
stop and then reverse out and go out the
different way that cost you some time

1324
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
different way that cost you some time
 

1325
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,149
different way that cost you some time
right so there's still

1326
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
right so there's still
 

1327
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,990
right so there's still
a debate whether you know it was my poor

1328
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
a debate whether you know it was my poor
 

1329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,909
a debate whether you know it was my poor
implementation that cost us extra time

1330
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
implementation that cost us extra time
 

1331
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:22,630
implementation that cost us extra time
or whether

1332
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
or whether
 

1333
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,230
or whether
it was you know cmu violating

1334
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
it was you know cmu violating
 

1335
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,750
it was you know cmu violating
an important rule of the competition and

1336
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
an important rule of the competition and
 

1337
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,070
an important rule of the competition and
you know i have my own uh opinion here

1338
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
you know i have my own uh opinion here
 

1339
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,070
you know i have my own uh opinion here
in terms of other bugs and like i i have

1340
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
in terms of other bugs and like i i have
 

1341
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,590
in terms of other bugs and like i i have
to apologize to mike montemerla

1342
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
to apologize to mike montemerla
 

1343
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,549
to apologize to mike montemerla
uh for sharing this on air but it is

1344
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
uh for sharing this on air but it is
 

1345
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,230
uh for sharing this on air but it is
actually uh one of the more memorable

1346
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
actually uh one of the more memorable
 

1347
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,870
actually uh one of the more memorable
ones

1348
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
ones
 

1349
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,950
ones
uh and it's something that's kind of

1350
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
uh and it's something that's kind of
 

1351
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,710
uh and it's something that's kind of
become a bit of a

1352
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
become a bit of a
 

1353
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,029
become a bit of a
a metaphor had a label in the industry

1354
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
a metaphor had a label in the industry
 

1355
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,149
a metaphor had a label in the industry
uh since then i think

1356
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
uh since then i think
 

1357
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,669
uh since then i think
at least in some circles it's called the

1358
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
at least in some circles it's called the
 

1359
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,590
at least in some circles it's called the
victory circle or victory lap

1360
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:49,600
victory circle or victory lap
 

1361
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,029
victory circle or victory lap
um and uh our cars

1362
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
um and uh our cars
 

1363
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,750
um and uh our cars
did that so in one of the missions in

1364
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
did that so in one of the missions in
 

1365
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,270
did that so in one of the missions in
the urban challenge in one of the

1366
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
the urban challenge in one of the
 

1367
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,110
the urban challenge in one of the
courses uh there was this big

1368
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
courses uh there was this big
 

1369
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,310
courses uh there was this big
oval right by the start and finish of

1370
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
oval right by the start and finish of
 

1371
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,669
oval right by the start and finish of
the race so darpa had

1372
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
the race so darpa had
 

1373
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,190
the race so darpa had
a lot of the missions would finish kind

1374
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
a lot of the missions would finish kind
 

1375
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,029
a lot of the missions would finish kind
of in that same location

1376
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
of in that same location
 

1377
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,549
of in that same location
and it was pretty cool because you could

1378
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
and it was pretty cool because you could
 

1379
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,310
and it was pretty cool because you could
see the cars come by and kind of finish

1380
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
see the cars come by and kind of finish
 

1381
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,909
see the cars come by and kind of finish
that part lag of the trip without that

1382
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
that part lag of the trip without that
 

1383
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,190
that part lag of the trip without that
leg of the mission and then you know go

1384
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
leg of the mission and then you know go
 

1385
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,590
leg of the mission and then you know go
on

1386
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
on
 

1387
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,350
on
and you know finish the rest of it uh

1388
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
and you know finish the rest of it uh
 

1389
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,549
and you know finish the rest of it uh
and other vehicles would you know come

1390
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
and other vehicles would you know come
 

1391
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:20,950
and other vehicles would you know come
hit

1392
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
hit
 

1393
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,830
hit
their waypoint and you know exit the

1394
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
their waypoint and you know exit the
 

1395
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,549
their waypoint and you know exit the
oval and

1396
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559
oval and
 

1397
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,549
oval and
off they would go our car in the hand

1398
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
off they would go our car in the hand
 

1399
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,909
off they would go our car in the hand
which hit the checkpoint

1400
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
which hit the checkpoint
 

1401
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,830
which hit the checkpoint
and then it would do an extra lap around

1402
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
and then it would do an extra lap around
 

1403
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,669
and then it would do an extra lap around
the awful and only then you know

1404
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:31,679
the awful and only then you know
 

1405
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,190
the awful and only then you know
leave and go on its merry way so over

1406
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
leave and go on its merry way so over
 

1407
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,390
leave and go on its merry way so over
the course of you know the full day it

1408
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
the course of you know the full day it
 

1409
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,029
the course of you know the full day it
accumulated

1410
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
accumulated
 

1411
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,950
accumulated
uh some extra time and the problem was

1412
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
uh some extra time and the problem was
 

1413
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,149
uh some extra time and the problem was
that we had a bug where

1414
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159
that we had a bug where
 

1415
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,590
that we had a bug where
it wouldn't you know start reasoning

1416
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
it wouldn't you know start reasoning
 

1417
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,510
it wouldn't you know start reasoning
about the next waypoint and plan around

1418
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
about the next waypoint and plan around
 

1419
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,950
about the next waypoint and plan around
to get to that next point until it hit

1420
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
to get to that next point until it hit
 

1421
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,549
to get to that next point until it hit
the previous one and in that particular

1422
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,559
the previous one and in that particular
 

1423
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,070
the previous one and in that particular
case by the time you hit the

1424
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
case by the time you hit the
 

1425
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,149
case by the time you hit the
that that one it was too late for us to

1426
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
that that one it was too late for us to
 

1427
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,510
that that one it was too late for us to
consider the next one and kind of

1428
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
consider the next one and kind of
 

1429
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,710
consider the next one and kind of
make a lane change so that every time it

1430
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
make a lane change so that every time it
 

1431
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,590
make a lane change so that every time it
would do like an extra lap so

1432
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
would do like an extra lap so
 

1433
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,990
would do like an extra lap so
that's the the stanford victory lap

1434
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000

 

1435
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,510

oh there's there's i feel like there's

1436
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
oh there's there's i feel like there's
 

1437
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,110
oh there's there's i feel like there's
something philosophically profound in

1438
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
something philosophically profound in
 

1439
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,549
something philosophically profound in
there somehow but uh

1440
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
there somehow but uh
 

1441
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,870
there somehow but uh
i mean ultimately everybody is a winner

1442
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:04,880
i mean ultimately everybody is a winner
 

1443
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,190
i mean ultimately everybody is a winner
in that kind of competition

1444
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
in that kind of competition
 

1445
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,190
in that kind of competition
and it led to sort of famously to the

1446
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
and it led to sort of famously to the
 

1447
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,029
and it led to sort of famously to the
creation of uh

1448
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
creation of uh
 

1449
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,510
creation of uh
google self-driving car project and now

1450
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
google self-driving car project and now

waymo
 

1453
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,750
waymo
so can we uh give an overview of how is

1454
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
so can we uh give an overview of how is
 

1455
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,110
so can we uh give an overview of how is
way more born

1456
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
way more born
 

1457
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,950
way more born
how's the google self-driving car

1458
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
how's the google self-driving car
 

1459
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,950
how's the google self-driving car
project born what's the what is the

1460
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
project born what's the what is the
 

1461
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,590
project born what's the what is the
mission

1462

what is the hope what is it is the
engineering kind of uh set of milestones

1466
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
engineering kind of uh set of milestones
 

1467
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,669
engineering kind of uh set of milestones
that it seeks to accomplish there's a

1468
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
that it seeks to accomplish there's a
 

1469
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,789
that it seeks to accomplish there's a
lot of questions in there

1470
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
lot of questions in there
 

1471
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,510
lot of questions in there
uh yeah i think you're right it kind of

1472
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
uh yeah i think you're right it kind of
 

1473
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:39,990
uh yeah i think you're right it kind of

in the technology
 

1495
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,669
in the technology
so now the google self-driving car

1496
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
so now the google self-driving car
 

1497
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,029
so now the google self-driving car
project was born

1498
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
project was born
 

1499
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,230
project was born
you know at that time and we started in

1500
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
you know at that time and we started in
 

1501
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,990
you know at that time and we started in
2009 it was a pretty small

1502
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
2009 it was a pretty small
 

1503
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,310
2009 it was a pretty small
group of us about a dozen people who

1504
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
group of us about a dozen people who
 

1505
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,190
group of us about a dozen people who
came together

1506
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
came together
 

1507
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,909
came together
uh to to work on on this project at

1508
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
uh to to work on on this project at
 

1509
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,630
uh to to work on on this project at
google

1510
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:10,640
google
 

1511
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,149
google
at that time we saw an

1512
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
at that time we saw an
 

1513
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,750
at that time we saw an
you know that incredible early result

1514
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
you know that incredible early result
 

1515
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,430
you know that incredible early result
in the darpa urban challenge i think

1516
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
in the darpa urban challenge i think
 

1517
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,350
in the darpa urban challenge i think
we're all incredibly excited

1518
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
we're all incredibly excited
 

1519
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,029
we're all incredibly excited
about where we got to and we believed in

1520
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
about where we got to and we believed in
 

1521
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,710
about where we got to and we believed in
the future of the technology but we

1522
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
the future of the technology but we
 

1523
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,630
the future of the technology but we
still had a very

1524
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,640
still had a very
 

1525
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,470
still had a very
rudimentary understanding of the problem

1526
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
rudimentary understanding of the problem
 

1527
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,390
rudimentary understanding of the problem
space so the

1528
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400
space so the
 

1529
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,830
space so the
first goal of this project in 2009 was

1530
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
first goal of this project in 2009 was
 

1531
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,029
first goal of this project in 2009 was
to really

1532
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
to really
 

1533
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,750
to really
better understand what we're up against

1534
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
better understand what we're up against
 

1535
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,870
better understand what we're up against
and you know with that

1536
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
and you know with that
 

1537
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,590
and you know with that
goal in mind when we started the project

1538
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
goal in mind when we started the project
 

1539
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,870
goal in mind when we started the project
we created a few milestones for

1540
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:44,880
we created a few milestones for
 

1541
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,070
we created a few milestones for
ourselves

1542
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
ourselves
 

1543
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,510
ourselves
that maximized learnings

1544
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
that maximized learnings
 

1545
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,070
that maximized learnings
well the two milestones were you know uh

1546
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
well the two milestones were you know uh
 

1547
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,149
well the two milestones were you know uh
one was to drive a hundred thousand

1548
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
one was to drive a hundred thousand
 

1549
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,630
one was to drive a hundred thousand
miles

1550
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
miles
 

1551
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,549
miles
in autonomous mode which was at that

1552
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
in autonomous mode which was at that
 

1553
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,190
in autonomous mode which was at that
time you know orders of magnitude that

1554
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
time you know orders of magnitude that
 

1555
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,350
time you know orders of magnitude that
more than anybody has ever done and the

1556
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
more than anybody has ever done and the
 

1557
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,909
more than anybody has ever done and the
second milestone was to drive

1558
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:03,919
second milestone was to drive
 

1559
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,390
second milestone was to drive
10 routes uh each one was 100 miles long

1560
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
10 routes uh each one was 100 miles long
 

1561
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,430
10 routes uh each one was 100 miles long
they were specifically chosen to become

00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
they were specifically chosen to become
 

1563
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,950
they were specifically chosen to become
extra spicy you know extra complicated

1564
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960

1565
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,870
extra spicy you know extra complicated
and sample the full complexity

1566
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
and sample the full complexity
 

1567
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,710
and sample the full complexity
of the that that domain

of the that that domain
 

1569
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,990
of the that that domain
um and you had to drive each one

1570
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
um and you had to drive each one
 

1571
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,750
um and you had to drive each one
from beginning to end with no

you get to the beginning of the course
 

1577
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,110
you get to the beginning of the course
uh you

1578
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
uh you
 

1579
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,110
uh you
you press the the button that include

1580
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
you press the the button that include

engage in autonomy
 

1583
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,870
engage in autonomy
and you had to you know go for 100 miles

1584
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
and you had to you know go for 100 miles
 

1585

you know beginning to end
 

1587
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,190
you know beginning to end
uh with no interventions um and

1588
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
uh with no interventions um and
 

1589
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,830
uh with no interventions um and
it sampled again the full complexity of

driving conditions
 

1593
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,750
driving conditions
some were on freeways we had one route

1594
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
some were on freeways we had one route
 

1595
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,110
some were on freeways we had one route
that went all through all the freeways

1596
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
that went all through all the freeways
 

1597
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,830
that went all through all the freeways
and all the

1598
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
and all the
 

1599
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,230
and all the
bridges in the bay area you know we had

1600
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,240
bridges in the bay area you know we had
 

1601
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,990
bridges in the bay area you know we had
some that went around lake tahoe and

1602
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,000
some that went around lake tahoe and
 

1603
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,430
some that went around lake tahoe and
kind of mountainous

1604

kind of mountainous
 

1605
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,230
kind of mountainous
roads we had some that drove through

1606
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
roads we had some that drove through
 

1607
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,029
roads we had some that drove through
dense urban

1608
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
dense urban
 

1609
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,350
dense urban
um environments like in downtown palo

1610
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
um environments like in downtown palo
 

1611
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,070
um environments like in downtown palo
alto

1612
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,080
alto
 

1613
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,669
alto
and through san francisco so it was

1614
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:00,679
and through san francisco so it was
 

1615
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,070
and through san francisco so it was
incredibly

1616
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
incredibly
 

1617
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,190
incredibly
uh interesting uh to work on

1618
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
uh interesting uh to work on
 

1619
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,549
uh interesting uh to work on
and it uh it took us

1620
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
and it uh it took us
 

1621
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,950
and it uh it took us
just under two years about a year and a

1622
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
just under two years about a year and a
 

1623
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,070
just under two years about a year and a
half a little bit more

1624
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
half a little bit more
 

1625
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,950
half a little bit more
to finish both of these milestones and

1626
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:14,960
to finish both of these milestones and
 

1627
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,470
to finish both of these milestones and
in that process

1628
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
in that process
 

1629
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,070
in that process
uh yeah hey it was an incredible amount

1630
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
uh yeah hey it was an incredible amount
 

1631
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,110
uh yeah hey it was an incredible amount
of fun probably the most

1632
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
of fun probably the most
 

1633
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,669
of fun probably the most
fun i had in my professional career and

1634
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
fun i had in my professional career and
 

1635
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,110
fun i had in my professional career and
because you're just learning so much you

1636
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,120
because you're just learning so much you
 

1637
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,390
because you're just learning so much you
are you know the goal here is to learn

1638
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
are you know the goal here is to learn
 

1639
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,990
are you know the goal here is to learn
and prototype you're not yet starting to

1640
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
and prototype you're not yet starting to
 

1641
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,590
and prototype you're not yet starting to
build a production system right so you

1642
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,600
build a production system right so you
 

1643
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,070
build a production system right so you
just

1644
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
just
 

1645
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,669
just
you were you know this is when you're

1646
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679
you were you know this is when you're
 

1647
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,909
you were you know this is when you're
kind of you know working 24 7 and you're

1648
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
kind of you know working 24 7 and you're
 

1649
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,350
kind of you know working 24 7 and you're
hacking things together and you also

1650
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,360
hacking things together and you also
 

1651
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,149
hacking things together and you also
don't know

1652
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
don't know
 

1653
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,029
don't know
how hard this is i mean it's the point

1654
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
how hard this is i mean it's the point
 

1655
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,750
how hard this is i mean it's the point
like

1656
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
like
 

1657
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,669
like
so i mean that's an ambitious if i put

1658
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
so i mean that's an ambitious if i put
 

1659
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,230
so i mean that's an ambitious if i put
myself in that mindset even still

1660
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
myself in that mindset even still
 

1661
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,870
myself in that mindset even still
that's a really ambitious set of goals

1662
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
that's a really ambitious set of goals
 

1663
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,149
that's a really ambitious set of goals
like just those two

1664
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:48,159
like just those two
 

1665
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,789
like just those two
picking picking 10 different

1666
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
picking picking 10 different
 

1667
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,870
picking picking 10 different
difficult spicy challenges

1668
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
difficult spicy challenges
 

1669
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,909
difficult spicy challenges
and then having zero interventions so

1670
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
and then having zero interventions so
 

1671
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,710
and then having zero interventions so
like not saying gradually we're going to

1672
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720
like not saying gradually we're going to
 

1673
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,710
like not saying gradually we're going to
like you know over a period of 10 years

1674
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
like you know over a period of 10 years
 

1675
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,549
like you know over a period of 10 years
we're going to have a bunch of roots and

1676
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:08,559
we're going to have a bunch of roots and
 

1677
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,990
we're going to have a bunch of roots and
gradually reduce the number of

1678
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
gradually reduce the number of
 

1679
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,870
gradually reduce the number of
interventions

1680
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
interventions
 

1681
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,470
interventions
you know would that literally says like

1682
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
you know would that literally says like
 

1683
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,110
you know would that literally says like
by as soon as possible we want to have

1684
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
by as soon as possible we want to have
 

1685
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,470
by as soon as possible we want to have
zero

1686
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
zero
 

1687
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,590
zero
and on hard roads so like to me if i was

1688
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
and on hard roads so like to me if i was
 

1689
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,710
and on hard roads so like to me if i was
facing that

1690
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
facing that
 

1691
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,669
facing that
it's unclear that whether that takes two

1692
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
it's unclear that whether that takes two
 

1693
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,549
it's unclear that whether that takes two
years or whether that takes 20 years

1694
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:26,559
years or whether that takes 20 years
 

1695
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,029
years or whether that takes 20 years
i mean under two i guess that speaks to

1696
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
i mean under two i guess that speaks to
 

1697
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,549
i mean under two i guess that speaks to
a really big

1698
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:30,559
a really big
 

1699
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,669
a really big
difference between doing something once

1700
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:33,679
difference between doing something once
 

1701
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,110
difference between doing something once
and having a prototype

1702
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
and having a prototype
 

1703
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,750
and having a prototype
uh where you are going after you know

1704
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
uh where you are going after you know
 

1705
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,350
uh where you are going after you know
learning about the problem

1706
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
learning about the problem
 

1707
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,909
learning about the problem
versus how you go about engineering a

1708
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
versus how you go about engineering a
 

1709
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:42,549

product

1710
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
product
 

1711
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,510
product
that you know where you look at uh you

1712
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520
that you know where you look at uh you
 

1713
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,070
that you know where you look at uh you
know you

1714
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
know you
 

1715
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,510
know you
properly do evaluation you look at

1716
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:47,520
properly do evaluation you look at
 

1717
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,029
properly do evaluation you look at
metrics you you know drive down and

1718
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
metrics you you know drive down and
 

1719
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,310
metrics you you know drive down and
you're confident that you can do that at

1720
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
you're confident that you can do that at
 

1721
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,630
you're confident that you can do that at
home

1722

home
 

1723
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,750
home
and i guess that's the you know why it

1724
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:51,760
and i guess that's the you know why it
 

1725
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,070
and i guess that's the you know why it
took a dozen people

1726
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
took a dozen people
 

1727
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,950
took a dozen people
uh you know 16 months or a little bit

1728
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960
uh you know 16 months or a little bit
 

1729
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,669
uh you know 16 months or a little bit
more than that

1730
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:57,679
more than that
 

1731
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,710
more than that
uh back in 2009 and 2010

1732
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
uh back in 2009 and 2010
 

1733
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,789
uh back in 2009 and 2010
and with the technology of you know the

1734
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799
and with the technology of you know the
 

1735
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,470
and with the technology of you know the
more than a decade ago

more than a decade ago
 

1737
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,190
more than a decade ago
that amount of time to achieve that

1738
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,200
that amount of time to achieve that
 

1739
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,990

1745
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,590

and you know it

1746
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
and you know it
 

1747
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,669
and you know it
took us a little bit longer to get to

1748
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
took us a little bit longer to get to
 

1749
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,630
took us a little bit longer to get to
you know a full

you know a full

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,789
you know a full

driverless product that customers use
 

1753
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,149
driverless product that customers use
that's another really important moment

1754
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
that's another really important moment
 

1755
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,630
that's another really important moment
is there some

1756
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,640
is there some
 

1757
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,110
is there some
memories of technical lessons or just

1758
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
memories of technical lessons or just
 

1759
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,630
memories of technical lessons or just
one like what did you learn about the

1760
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
one like what did you learn about the
 

1761
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,269
one like what did you learn about the
problem of driving from that experience

1762
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
problem of driving from that experience
 

1763
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,190
problem of driving from that experience
i mean we could we can now talk about

1764
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
i mean we could we can now talk about
 

1765
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,950
i mean we could we can now talk about
like what you learned from

1766
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
like what you learned from
 

1767
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,830
like what you learned from
modern day waymo but i feel like you may

1768
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
modern day waymo but i feel like you may
 

1769
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,990
modern day waymo but i feel like you may
have learned some profound things

1770
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
have learned some profound things
 

1771
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,669
have learned some profound things
in those early days even more so

1772
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:45,679
in those early days even more so
 

1773
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,990
in those early days even more so
because it feels like what waymo is now

1774
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000
because it feels like what waymo is now
 

1775
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,269
because it feels like what waymo is now
is to trying to

1776
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
is to trying to
 

1777
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,950
is to trying to
you know how to do scale how to make

1778
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
you know how to do scale how to make
 

1779
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,389
you know how to do scale how to make
sure you create a product how to make

1780
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
sure you create a product how to make
 

1781
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,830
sure you create a product how to make
sure it's like safety and all those

1782
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
sure it's like safety and all those
 

1783
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,630
sure it's like safety and all those
things which is

1784
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:54,640
things which is
 

1785
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,190
things which is
all fascinating challenges but like you

1786
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
all fascinating challenges but like you
 

1787
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,830
all fascinating challenges but like you
were facing the more fundamental

1788
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
were facing the more fundamental
 

1789
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,870
were facing the more fundamental
philosophical problem of driving in

1790
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
philosophical problem of driving in
 

1791
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,389
philosophical problem of driving in
those early days like

1792
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
those early days like
 

1793
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,190
those early days like
what the hell is driving as an

1794
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,200
what the hell is driving as an
 

1795
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,830
what the hell is driving as an
autonomous

1796
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:07,840
autonomous
 

1797
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,389
autonomous
or maybe i'm again romanticizing it but

1798
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
or maybe i'm again romanticizing it but
 

1799
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,990
or maybe i'm again romanticizing it but
is it

1800
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
is it
 

1801
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,269
is it
is there uh is there some valuable

1802
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:15,279
is there uh is there some valuable
 

1803
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,710
is there uh is there some valuable
lessons you picked up over there

1804
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
lessons you picked up over there
 

1805
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,230
lessons you picked up over there
at those two years uh a ton

1806
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
at those two years uh a ton
 

1807
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,909
at those two years uh a ton
the most important one is probably that

1808
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
the most important one is probably that
 

1809
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,789
the most important one is probably that
we believe that it's doable and we've

1810
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
we believe that it's doable and we've
 

1811
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,430
we believe that it's doable and we've
gotten

1812
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
gotten
 

1813
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,549
gotten
uh far enough into the problem that uh

1814
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:30,559
uh far enough into the problem that uh
 

1815
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:30,870
uh far enough into the problem that uh
you know

1816
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
you know
 

1817
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,590
you know
we had a i think only a glimpse of the

1818
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
we had a i think only a glimpse of the
 

1819
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,590
we had a i think only a glimpse of the
true complexity uh

1820
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:35,600
true complexity uh
 

1821
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,710
true complexity uh
of the the domain yeah it's a little bit

1822
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
of the the domain yeah it's a little bit
 

1823
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,990
of the the domain yeah it's a little bit
like you know climbing a mountain where

1824
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
like you know climbing a mountain where
 

1825
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,630
like you know climbing a mountain where
you kind of

1826
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,640
you kind of
 

1827
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,310
you kind of
see the next peak and you think that's

1828
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
see the next peak and you think that's
 

1829
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,510
see the next peak and you think that's
kind of the summit but then you get to

1830
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
kind of the summit but then you get to
 

1831
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,029
kind of the summit but then you get to
that and you kind of see that that this

1832
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
that and you kind of see that that this
 

1833
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:45,510
that and you kind of see that that this
is just

1834
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
is just
 

1835
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,070
is just
the start of the journey uh but we've

1836
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
the start of the journey uh but we've
 

1837
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,630
the start of the journey uh but we've
tried

1838
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
tried
 

1839
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,310
tried
we've sampled enough of the problem

1840
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,320
we've sampled enough of the problem
 

1841
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,990
we've sampled enough of the problem
space and we've made

1842
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
space and we've made
 

1843
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,549
space and we've made
enough rapid uh success even you know

1844
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
enough rapid uh success even you know
 

1845
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,430
enough rapid uh success even you know
with technology

1846
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
with technology
 

1847
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,590
with technology
of 2009 2010 that it gave us confidence

1848
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,600
of 2009 2010 that it gave us confidence
 

1849
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,630
of 2009 2010 that it gave us confidence
to then you know pursue this as

1850
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:02,640
to then you know pursue this as
 

1851
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,950
to then you know pursue this as
a real product so okay so the next step

1852
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
a real product so okay so the next step
 

1853
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,029
a real product so okay so the next step
you mentioned the the milestones that

1854
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039
you mentioned the the milestones that
 

1855
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,990
you mentioned the the milestones that
you had in the

1856
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,000
you had in the
 

1857
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,389
you had in the
in those two years what are the next

1858
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
in those two years what are the next
 

1859
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,310
in those two years what are the next
milestones that then led to the creation

1860
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320
milestones that then led to the creation
 

1861
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,909
milestones that then led to the creation
of waymo and beyond

1862
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
of waymo and beyond
 

1863
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,070
of waymo and beyond
now it was a really interesting journey

1864
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
now it was a really interesting journey
 

1865
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,029
now it was a really interesting journey
and

1866
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,039
and
 

1867
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,149
and
waymo came a little bit later uh

1868
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:22,159
waymo came a little bit later uh
 

1869
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,230
waymo came a little bit later uh
then you know we completed those

1870
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
then you know we completed those
 

1871
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,310
then you know we completed those
milestones in 2010

1872
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,320
milestones in 2010
 

1873
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,269
milestones in 2010
that was the pivot when we decided to

1874
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
that was the pivot when we decided to
 

1875
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:29,909
that was the pivot when we decided to
focus

1876
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:29,919
focus
 

1877
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,750
focus
on actually building a product yeah

1878
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:31,760
on actually building a product yeah
 

1879
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,269
on actually building a product yeah
using this technology

1880
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
using this technology
 

1881
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,230
using this technology
uh the initial couple years after that

1882
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
uh the initial couple years after that
 

1883
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,510
uh the initial couple years after that
we were focused

1884
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
we were focused
 

1885
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,350
we were focused
on a freeway you know what you would

1886
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
on a freeway you know what you would
 

1887
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,549
on a freeway you know what you would
call a driver assist

1888
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:40,559
call a driver assist
 

1889
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,830
call a driver assist
uh maybe an l3 driver assist uh

1890
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:43,840
uh maybe an l3 driver assist uh
 

1891
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,269
uh maybe an l3 driver assist uh
program then around 2013 we've learned

1892
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
program then around 2013 we've learned
 

1893
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,590
program then around 2013 we've learned
enough uh about the space and the

1894
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,600
enough uh about the space and the
 

1895
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,630
enough uh about the space and the
thought

1896
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
thought
 

1897
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,230
thought
more deeply about you know the

1898
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
more deeply about you know the
 

1899
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,669
more deeply about you know the
product that we wanted to build that we

1900
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
product that we wanted to build that we
 

1901
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,230
product that we wanted to build that we
pivoted uh we pivoted towards

1902
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
pivoted uh we pivoted towards
 

1903
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,029
pivoted uh we pivoted towards
of this vision of you know building a

1904
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
of this vision of you know building a
 

1905
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:01,909
of this vision of you know building a
driver

1906
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
driver
 

1907
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,750
driver
and deploying it fully driverless

1908
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
and deploying it fully driverless
 

1909
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,029
and deploying it fully driverless
vehicles without a person and that

1910
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
vehicles without a person and that
 

1911
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,230
vehicles without a person and that
that's the path that we've been

1912
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
that's the path that we've been
 

1913
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,430
that's the path that we've been
on since then and uh very it was exactly

1914
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
on since then and uh very it was exactly
 

1915
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,470
on since then and uh very it was exactly
the right decision for us

1916
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,480
the right decision for us
 

1917
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,310
the right decision for us
so there was a moment where you also

1918
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,320
so there was a moment where you also
 

1919
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,590
so there was a moment where you also
considered like what is the right

1920
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
considered like what is the right
 

1921
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,789
considered like what is the right
trajectory here

1922
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
trajectory here
 

1923
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,789
trajectory here
what is the right role of automation in

1924
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:16,799
what is the right role of automation in
 

1925
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,470
what is the right role of automation in
the in the task of driving there's still

1926
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,480
the in the task of driving there's still
 

1927
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,310
the in the task of driving there's still
it wasn't from the early days obviously

1928
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
it wasn't from the early days obviously
 

1929
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,070
it wasn't from the early days obviously
you want to go fully autonomous

1930
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,080
you want to go fully autonomous
 

1931
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,350
you want to go fully autonomous
from the early days it was not i think

1932
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:25,360
from the early days it was not i think
 

1933
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,549
from the early days it was not i think
it was in 20 around 2013 maybe

1934
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
it was in 20 around 2013 maybe
 

1935
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,590
it was in 20 around 2013 maybe
that we've that became very clear

1936
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
that we've that became very clear
 

1937
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,870
that we've that became very clear
and we made that pivot and it also

1938
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:32,880
and we made that pivot and it also
 

1939
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,630
and we made that pivot and it also
became very clear uh

1940
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
became very clear uh
 

1941
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,110
became very clear uh
and that it's even the way you go

1942
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,120
and that it's even the way you go
 

1943
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,669
and that it's even the way you go
building

1944
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
building
 

1945
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,630
building
a driver assist system is you know

1946
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:40,640
a driver assist system is you know
 

1947
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,070
a driver assist system is you know
fundamentally different from how you go

1948
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
fundamentally different from how you go
 

1949
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,669
fundamentally different from how you go
building a fully driverless vehicle so

1950
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:43,679
building a fully driverless vehicle so
 

1951
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,389
building a fully driverless vehicle so
you know we've

1952
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
you know we've
 

1953
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,669
you know we've
uh pivoted towards the ladder

1954
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
uh pivoted towards the ladder
 

1955
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,269
uh pivoted towards the ladder
and that's what we've been working on

1956
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
and that's what we've been working on
 

1957
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,430
and that's what we've been working on
ever since and

1958
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
ever since and
 

1959

there's sequence of really meaningful
 

1963
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,110
there's sequence of really meaningful
for us really important

for us really important
 

1965
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,149
for us really important

2019
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,909
time we're only it took a tremendous
amount of engineering it took a

2020
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:57,919
amount of engineering it took a
 

2021
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,350
amount of engineering it took a
tremendous amount of validation

2022
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,360
tremendous amount of validation
 

2023
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,149
tremendous amount of validation
uh to get to that point uh but you know

2024

it was not kind of a controlled
 

2033
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,470
it was not kind of a controlled
environment but it was a fixed route and

2034
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,480
environment but it was a fixed route and
 

2035
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,070
environment but it was a fixed route and
we only did a few times

2036

we only did a few times
 

2037
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,149
we only did a few times
uh then uh in

2038

we started it was october
 

2075
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,149
we started it was october
of 2017. where when we

2076

of 2017. where when we
 

2077
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,350
of 2017. where when we
started regular uh driverless

2078
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
started regular uh driverless
 

2079
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,669
started regular uh driverless
operations on public roads that first

2080
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
operations on public roads that first
 

2081
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,909
operations on public roads that first
day of operations we drove

2082
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
day of operations we drove
 

2083
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,070
day of operations we drove
uh in one day and that first day 100

2084
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,080
uh in one day and that first day 100
 

2085
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,190
uh in one day and that first day 100
miles and

2086
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,200
miles and
 

2087
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,549
miles and
you know driverless fashion and then

2088
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:06,559
you know driverless fashion and then
 

2089
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,149
you know driverless fashion and then
we've the most the most important thing

2090
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
we've the most the most important thing
 

2091
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,430
we've the most the most important thing
about that milestone was not that you

2092
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:09,440
about that milestone was not that you
 

2093
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,869
about that milestone was not that you
know 100 miles in one day

2094
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:10,879
know 100 miles in one day
 

2095
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,109
know 100 miles in one day
but that it was the start of kind of

2096
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,119
but that it was the start of kind of
 

2097
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,310
but that it was the start of kind of
regular ongoing

2098
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
regular ongoing
 

2099
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,829
regular ongoing
driverless operations can we say

2100
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:15,839
driverless operations can we say
 

2101
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,349
driverless operations can we say
driverless it means no driver

2102
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:19,359
driverless it means no driver
 

2103
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,710
driverless it means no driver
that's exactly right so on that first

2104
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:20,720
that's exactly right so on that first
 

2105
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,550
that's exactly right so on that first
day we actually had a mix and

2106
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,560
day we actually had a mix and
 

2107
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,669
day we actually had a mix and
up uh in some uh we didn't want to like

2108
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
up uh in some uh we didn't want to like
 

2109
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,109
up uh in some uh we didn't want to like
you know be on youtube on twitter that

2110
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
you know be on youtube on twitter that
 

2111
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,389
you know be on youtube on twitter that
same day so in

2112
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
same day so in
 

2113
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,829
same day so in
uh and many of the rides we had somebody

2114
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:31,839
uh and many of the rides we had somebody
 

2115
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,270
uh and many of the rides we had somebody
in the driver's seat but they could not

2116
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
in the driver's seat but they could not

disengage like the car

2118
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
disengage like the car
 

2119
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,430
disengage like the car
it's not disengaged but actually on that

2120
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,440
it's not disengaged but actually on that
 

2121
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,069
it's not disengaged but actually on that
first day

2122
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,079
first day
 

2123
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,710
first day
uh some of the miles were driven and

2124
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:40,720
uh some of the miles were driven and
 

2125
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,750
uh some of the miles were driven and
just completely

2126
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:41,760
just completely
 

2127
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,550
just completely
empty driver's seat and this is the key

2128
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
empty driver's seat and this is the key
 

2129
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,069
empty driver's seat and this is the key
distinction that i think people don't

2130
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
distinction that i think people don't
 

2131
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:46,710
distinction that i think people don't
realize

2132
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:46,720
realize
 

2133
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,510
realize
it's you know that oftentimes when you

2134
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:49,520
it's you know that oftentimes when you
 

2135
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,470
it's you know that oftentimes when you
talk about autonomous vehicles

2136
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:52,480
talk about autonomous vehicles
 

2137
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,470
talk about autonomous vehicles
you're there's often a driver in the

2138
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
you're there's often a driver in the
 

2139
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,990
you're there's often a driver in the
seat that's ready to

2140
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,000
seat that's ready to
 

2141
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,510
seat that's ready to
uh to take over uh what's called a

2142
00:34:59,510 --> 00:34:59,520
uh to take over uh what's called a
 

2143
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,950
uh to take over uh what's called a
safety driver

2144
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
safety driver
 

2145
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,630
safety driver
and then waymo is really one of the

2146
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
and then waymo is really one of the
 

2147
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,470
and then waymo is really one of the
only companies that i'm aware of or at

2148
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
only companies that i'm aware of or at
 

2149
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,030
only companies that i'm aware of or at
least as like boldly and

2150
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
least as like boldly and
 

2151
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,349
least as like boldly and
carefully and all and all that is

2152
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
carefully and all and all that is
 

2153
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,310
carefully and all and all that is
actually has

2154
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
actually has
 

2155
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,390
actually has
cases and now we'll talk about more and

2156
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
cases and now we'll talk about more and
 

2157
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,829
cases and now we'll talk about more and
more where there is

2158
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:15,839
more where there is
 

2159
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,550
more where there is
literally no driver so that that's

2160
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:18,560
literally no driver so that that's
 

2161
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,589
literally no driver so that that's
another

2162
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
another
 

2163
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,109
another
the the interesting case of where the

2164
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:21,119
the the interesting case of where the
 

2165
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,470
the the interesting case of where the
driver is not supposed to disengage

2166
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,480
driver is not supposed to disengage
 

2167
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,109
driver is not supposed to disengage
that's like a

2168
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:23,119
that's like a
 

2169
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,710
that's like a
nice middle ground if they're still

2170
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
nice middle ground if they're still
 

2171
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,069
nice middle ground if they're still
there but they're not supposed to

2172
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
there but they're not supposed to
 

2173
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,870
there but they're not supposed to
disengage

2174
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
disengage
 

2175
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,030
disengage
but really there's the case when there's

2176
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,040
but really there's the case when there's
 

2177
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,310
but really there's the case when there's
no

2178
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
no
 

2179
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,030
no
okay there's something magical about

2180
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,040
okay there's something magical about
 

2181
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,390
okay there's something magical about
there being nobody in the driver's seat

2182
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,400
there being nobody in the driver's seat
 

2183
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,470
there being nobody in the driver's seat
like just like to me you mentioned um

2184
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
like just like to me you mentioned um
 

2185
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,870
like just like to me you mentioned um
the first time you wrote some code for

2186
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
the first time you wrote some code for
 

2187
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,190
the first time you wrote some code for
free space navigation of the parking lot

2188
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
free space navigation of the parking lot
 

2189
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,109
free space navigation of the parking lot
that was like a magical moment

2190
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
that was like a magical moment
 

2191
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,630
that was like a magical moment
to me just sort of an as an observer of

2192
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
to me just sort of an as an observer of
 

2193
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,829
to me just sort of an as an observer of
robots

2194
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
robots
 

2195
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,870
robots
the first magical moment is

2196
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:54,880
the first magical moment is
 

2197
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,910
the first magical moment is
seeing an autonomous vehicle turn like

2198
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:57,920
seeing an autonomous vehicle turn like
 

2199
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,390
seeing an autonomous vehicle turn like
make a

2200
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,400
make a
 

2201
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,750
make a
left turn like apply

2202
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
left turn like apply
 

2203
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,710
left turn like apply
sufficient torque to the steering wheel

2204
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:04,720
sufficient torque to the steering wheel
 

2205
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,109
sufficient torque to the steering wheel
to where like there's a lot of rotation

2206
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:07,119
to where like there's a lot of rotation
 

2207
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,870
to where like there's a lot of rotation
and for some reason and there's nobody

2208
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:08,880
and for some reason and there's nobody
 

2209
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,550
and for some reason and there's nobody
in the driver's seat

2210
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,560
in the driver's seat
 

2211
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,910
in the driver's seat
for some reason that that communicates

2212
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:13,920
for some reason that that communicates
 

2213
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,950
for some reason that that communicates
that here's a being with power

2214
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:16,960
that here's a being with power
 

2215
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,470
that here's a being with power
that makes a decision there's something

2216
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
that makes a decision there's something
 

2217
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,310
that makes a decision there's something
about like the steering wheel because

2218
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,320
about like the steering wheel because
 

2219
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,230
about like the steering wheel because
we perhaps romanticize the notion of the

2220
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,240
we perhaps romanticize the notion of the
 

2221
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,390
we perhaps romanticize the notion of the
steering wheel it's so essential to the

2222
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:24,400
steering wheel it's so essential to the
 

2223
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,589
steering wheel it's so essential to the
our conception

2224
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:25,599
our conception
 

2225
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,230
our conception
our 20th century conception of a car and

2226
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,240
our 20th century conception of a car and
 

2227
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,790
our 20th century conception of a car and
it

2228
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:28,800
it
 

2229
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,470
it
turning the steering wheel with nobody

2230
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,480
turning the steering wheel with nobody
 

2231
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,069
turning the steering wheel with nobody
in driver's seat

2232
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:32,079
in driver's seat
 

2233
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,190
in driver's seat
that to me i think maybe to others

2234
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,200
that to me i think maybe to others
 

2235
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,349
that to me i think maybe to others
it's really powerful like this thing is

2236
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:37,359
it's really powerful like this thing is
 

2237
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,470
it's really powerful like this thing is
in control

2238
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:38,480
in control
 

2239
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,310
in control
and then there's this leap of trust that

2240
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
and then there's this leap of trust that
 

2241
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,630
and then there's this leap of trust that
you give like i'm gonna put my life

2242
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:42,640
you give like i'm gonna put my life
 

2243
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,910
you give like i'm gonna put my life
in the hands of this thing that's in

2244
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
in the hands of this thing that's in
 

2245
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,670
in the hands of this thing that's in
control so in that sense

2246
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
control so in that sense
 

2247
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,310
control so in that sense
when there's no but no driver in the

2248
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
when there's no but no driver in the
 

2249
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,030
when there's no but no driver in the
driver's seat

2250
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,040
driver's seat
 

2251
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,150
driver's seat
that's a magical moment for robots so i

2252
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,160
that's a magical moment for robots so i
 

2253
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,109
that's a magical moment for robots so i
i'm i gotten a chance to uh last year to

2254
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
i'm i gotten a chance to uh last year to
 

2255
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:55,750
i'm i gotten a chance to uh last year to
take a ride

2256
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:55,760
take a ride
 

2257
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,390
take a ride
in in a waymo vehicle and that that was

2258
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:58,400
in in a waymo vehicle and that that was
 

2259
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,230
in in a waymo vehicle and that that was
the magical moment there's like

2260
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
the magical moment there's like
 

2261
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,430
the magical moment there's like
nobody in the driver's seat it's it's

2262
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:03,440
nobody in the driver's seat it's it's
 

2263
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,030
nobody in the driver's seat it's it's
like the little details you would think

2264
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,040
like the little details you would think
 

2265
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,550
like the little details you would think
it doesn't matter whether it's a driver

2266
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:06,560
it doesn't matter whether it's a driver
 

2267
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,510
it doesn't matter whether it's a driver
or not

2268
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
or not
 

2269
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,990
or not
but like if there's no driver and the

2270
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,000
but like if there's no driver and the
 

2271
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,470
but like if there's no driver and the
steering wheel is turning on its own

2272
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
steering wheel is turning on its own
 

2273
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,589
steering wheel is turning on its own
i don't know that's magical it's

2274
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:15,599
i don't know that's magical it's
 

2275
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,470
i don't know that's magical it's
absolutely magical

2276
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480
absolutely magical
 

2277

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
you call it on your cell phone it pulls
 

2285
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,670
you call it on your cell phone it pulls
up you get in

2286
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
up you get in
 

2287
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,230
up you get in
it takes you on its way there's nobody

2288
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
it takes you on its way there's nobody
 

2289
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,510
it takes you on its way there's nobody
uh in the car

2290
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
uh in the car
 

2291
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,190
uh in the car
but you right that's something called

2292
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
but you right that's something called
 

2293
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,030
but you right that's something called
you know fully driverless

2294
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
you know fully driverless
 

2295
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,470
you know fully driverless
our rider only mode of operation

2296
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
our rider only mode of operation
 

2297
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,750
our rider only mode of operation
uh yeah it it is

2298
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
uh yeah it it is
 

2299
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,109
uh yeah it it is
magical it is uh transformative this is

2300
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
magical it is uh transformative this is
 

2301
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,390
magical it is uh transformative this is
what we hear from our

2302
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
what we hear from our
 

2303
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,270
what we hear from our
uh writers it really changes your

2304
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
uh writers it really changes your
 

2305
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,950
uh writers it really changes your
experience and not like that that really

2306
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
experience and not like that that really
 

2307
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,550
experience and not like that that really
is what unlocks

2308
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
is what unlocks
 

2309
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,430
is what unlocks
the real potential of this technology uh

2310
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
the real potential of this technology uh
 

2311
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,910
the real potential of this technology uh
but you know

2312
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:53,920
but you know
 

2313
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,990
but you know
coming back to our journey uh you know

2314
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
coming back to our journey uh you know
 

2315
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,069
coming back to our journey uh you know
that was 2017 when we started

2316
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:58,079
that was 2017 when we started
 

2317
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,430
that was 2017 when we started
uh truly driverless operations then in

2318
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:01,440
uh truly driverless operations then in
 

2319
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,589
uh truly driverless operations then in
2018 we've launched our

2320
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:05,599
2018 we've launched our
 

2321
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,670
2018 we've launched our
public commercial service that we call

2322
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:07,680
public commercial service that we call
 

2323

waymo one
 

2325
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,829
waymo one
in phoenix in 2019 we started

2326
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:13,839
in phoenix in 2019 we started
 

2327
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,710
in phoenix in 2019 we started
offering truly driverless rider only

2328
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:16,720
offering truly driverless rider only
 

2329

rights
 

2331
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,470
rights
to our early writer population

00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,480
to our early writer population
 

2333
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,550
to our early writer population
of users and then you know 2020

2334
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
of users and then you know 2020
 

2335
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,270
of users and then you know 2020
has also been a pretty interesting year

2336
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,280
has also been a pretty interesting year
 

2337
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,390
has also been a pretty interesting year
uh one of the first ones

2338
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,400
uh one of the first ones
 

2339
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,990
uh one of the first ones
less about technology but more about the

2340
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
less about technology but more about the
 

2341
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,310
less about technology but more about the
maturing and the growth of

2342
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
maturing and the growth of
 

2343
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,310
maturing and the growth of
waymo as a company we raised our

2344
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,320
waymo as a company we raised our
 

2345
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,790
waymo as a company we raised our
first round of external financing uh

2346
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:38,800
first round of external financing uh
 

2347
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,829
first round of external financing uh
this year you know we were part of

2348
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:39,839
this year you know we were part of
 

2349
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,430
this year you know we were part of
alphabet so obviously we have

2350
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:41,440
alphabet so obviously we have
 

2351
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,470
alphabet so obviously we have
access to you know significant resources

2352
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,480
access to you know significant resources
 

2353
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,550
access to you know significant resources
but as kind of on the journey of waymo

2354
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,560
but as kind of on the journey of waymo
 

2355
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,069
but as kind of on the journey of waymo
maturing as a company it made sense for

2356
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:48,079
maturing as a company it made sense for
 

2357
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,990
maturing as a company it made sense for
us to you know partially go externally

2358
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,000
us to you know partially go externally
 

2359
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,710
us to you know partially go externally
uh uh and in this round so you know we

2360
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:52,720
uh uh and in this round so you know we
 

2361
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,589
uh uh and in this round so you know we
raised uh

2362
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599
raised uh
 

2363
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,550
raised uh
about 3.2 billion dollars uh with from

2364
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,560
about 3.2 billion dollars uh with from
 

2365
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,069
about 3.2 billion dollars uh with from
you know that round

2366
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,079
you know that round
 

2367
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,109
you know that round
uh we've also you know uh started

2368
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,119
uh we've also you know uh started
 

2369
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:01,670
uh we've also you know uh started
putting

2370
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:01,680
putting
 

2371
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,630
putting
our fifth generation of our driver our

2372

hardware
 

2375
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,510
hardware
uh uh that is on the new vehicle but

2376
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,520
uh uh that is on the new vehicle but
 

2377
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,829
uh uh that is on the new vehicle but
it's also a qualitatively different

2378
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:09,839
it's also a qualitatively different
 

2379
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,790
it's also a qualitatively different
set of uh self-driving hardware uh

2380
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:12,800
set of uh self-driving hardware uh
 

2381
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,510
set of uh self-driving hardware uh
that's all

2382
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:13,520
that's all
 

2383
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,710
that's all
uh that is now on the jlr pace so that

2384
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:16,720
uh that is now on the jlr pace so that
 

2385
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,670
uh that is now on the jlr pace so that
was a very

2386
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:17,680
was a very
 

2387
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,470
was a very
important step for us the hardware specs

2388
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,480
important step for us the hardware specs
 

2389
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,550
important step for us the hardware specs
fifth generation

2390
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,560
fifth generation
 

2391
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,430
fifth generation
i think it'd be fun to maybe i apologize

2392
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
i think it'd be fun to maybe i apologize
 

2393
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,510
i think it'd be fun to maybe i apologize
if i'm interrupting but

2394
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:27,520
if i'm interrupting but
 

2395
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,950
if i'm interrupting but
maybe talk about maybe the generations

2396
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
maybe talk about maybe the generations
 

2397
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,270
maybe talk about maybe the generations
with a focus on what we're talking about

2398
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,280
with a focus on what we're talking about
 

2399
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,550
with a focus on what we're talking about
in the fifth generation in terms of

2400
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:34,560
in the fifth generation in terms of
 

2401
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,670
in the fifth generation in terms of
hardware specs

2402
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:35,680
hardware specs
 

2403
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,950
hardware specs
like what's on this car sure so we

2404
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:38,960
like what's on this car sure so we
 

2405
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,550
like what's on this car sure so we
separated out the actual car

2406
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,560
separated out the actual car
 

2407
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,230
separated out the actual car
that we are driving from the

2408
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
that we are driving from the
 

2409
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,069
that we are driving from the
self-driving hardware we put on it

2410
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:44,079
self-driving hardware we put on it
 

2411
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,390
self-driving hardware we put on it
um right now we have so this is as i

2412
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,400
um right now we have so this is as i
 

2413
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,910
um right now we have so this is as i
mentioned the fifth generation and we've

2414
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
mentioned the fifth generation and we've
 

2415
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,109
mentioned the fifth generation and we've
gone

2416
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:49,119
gone
 

2417
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,670
gone
through we started you know building our

2418
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,680
through we started you know building our
 

2419
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,390
through we started you know building our
own

and
 

2425
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,910
and
that firefly vehicle also had

2426
00:39:59,910 --> 00:39:59,920
that firefly vehicle also had
 

2427
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,829
that firefly vehicle also had
the hardware suite that was mostly

2428
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
the hardware suite that was mostly
 

2429
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,309
the hardware suite that was mostly
designed engineered and built in-house

2430
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:04,319
designed engineered and built in-house
 

2431
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,230
designed engineered and built in-house
lidars are of one of the more important

2432
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,240
lidars are of one of the more important
 

2433
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,230
lidars are of one of the more important
components that we design and build from

2434
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
components that we design and build from
 

2435
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,270
components that we design and build from
the ground up

2436
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:11,280
the ground up
 

2437
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,470
the ground up
uh so on the fifth generation uh of

2438
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
uh so on the fifth generation uh of
 

2439
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,670
uh so on the fifth generation uh of
our uh drivers uh of our driving

2440
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
our uh drivers uh of our driving
 

2441
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,950
our uh drivers uh of our driving
hardware that we're

2442
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
hardware that we're
 

2443
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,150
hardware that we're
switching to right now uh we have

2444
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
switching to right now uh we have
 

2445
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,390
switching to right now uh we have
uh as with previous generations in terms

2446
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,400
uh as with previous generations in terms
 

2447
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,589
uh as with previous generations in terms
of sensing we have

2448
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:25,599
of sensing we have
 

2449
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,390
of sensing we have
lidars cameras and radars and when you

2450
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
lidars cameras and radars and when you
 

2451
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,790
lidars cameras and radars and when you
have

2452
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:28,800
have
 

2453
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,790
have
a pretty beefy computer that processes

2454
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:30,800
a pretty beefy computer that processes
 

2455
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,150
a pretty beefy computer that processes
all that information and makes you know

2456
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
all that information and makes you know
 

2457
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,790
all that information and makes you know
decisions

2458
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
decisions
 

2459
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,230
decisions
in real time on on board the car uh so

2460
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240
in real time on on board the car uh so
 

2461
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,510
in real time on on board the car uh so
in all of the and it's really a

2462
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
in all of the and it's really a
 

2463
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,309
in all of the and it's really a
qualitative uh jump forward in terms of

2464
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:42,319
qualitative uh jump forward in terms of
 

2465
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,430
qualitative uh jump forward in terms of
the capabilities

2466
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,440
the capabilities
 

2467
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,829
the capabilities
and uh the various parameters and the

2468
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
and uh the various parameters and the
 

2469
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,870
and uh the various parameters and the
specs of the hardware

2470
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:46,880
specs of the hardware
 

2471
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,390
specs of the hardware
compared to what we had before and

2472
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
compared to what we had before and
 

2473
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,309
compared to what we had before and
compared to what you can kind of get off

2474
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:50,319
compared to what you can kind of get off
 

2475
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:50,710
compared to what you can kind of get off
the

2476
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:50,720
the
 

2477
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,550
the
of the shelf in the market today meaning

2478
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
of the shelf in the market today meaning
 

2479
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,710

from fifth to fourth or from fifth to
 

2481
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,109
from fifth to fourth or from fifth to
first definitely from uh first to fifth

00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
first definitely from uh first to fifth
 

2483
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,150
first definitely from uh first to fifth
but also from the other

2484
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
but also from the other
 

2485
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,470
but also from the other
world's dumbest question definitely

2486
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:00,480
world's dumbest question definitely
 

2487
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,150
world's dumbest question definitely
definitely from fourth to fifth okay

2488
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,160
definitely from fourth to fifth okay
 

2489
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,349
definitely from fourth to fifth okay
as well as uh uh there's the

2490
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:05,359
as well as uh uh there's the
 

2491
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,750
as well as uh uh there's the
the last step is a big step forward so

2492
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:07,760
the last step is a big step forward so
 

2493
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,030
the last step is a big step forward so
everything's in-house

2494
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
everything's in-house
 

2495
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,550
everything's in-house
so like lidar's built in house and

2496
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
so like lidar's built in house and
 

2497
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,829
so like lidar's built in house and
and cameras are built in-house uh you

2498
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:15,839
and cameras are built in-house uh you
 

2499
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:16,230
and cameras are built in-house uh you
know it's

2500
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,240
know it's
 

2501
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,990
know it's
different you know we work with partners

2502
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,000
different you know we work with partners
 

2503
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,430
different you know we work with partners
there are some components uh

2504
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:19,440
there are some components uh
 

2505
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,309
there are some components uh
that you know we get from our

2506
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
that you know we get from our
 

2507
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,990
that you know we get from our
manufacturing and you know supply chain

2508
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
manufacturing and you know supply chain
 

2509
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,790

partners
 

2511
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,309
partners
uh what exactly is in-house is a bit

2512
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319
uh what exactly is in-house is a bit
 

2513
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,510
uh what exactly is in-house is a bit
different if you

2514
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
different if you
 

2515
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,470
different if you
we we do a lot of you know custom uh

2516
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:32,480
we we do a lot of you know custom uh
 

2517
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,270
we we do a lot of you know custom uh
design on

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,309
radars cameras
you know exactly there's lighters are

2524
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:40,319
you know exactly there's lighters are
 

2525
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,109
you know exactly there's lighters are
almost exclusively in-house and some of

2526
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:43,119
almost exclusively in-house and some of
 

2527
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,470
almost exclusively in-house and some of
the technologies that we have some of

2528
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:44,480
the technologies that we have some of
 

2529
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,990
the technologies that we have some of
the fundamental technologies there

2530
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,000
the fundamental technologies there
 

2531
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,109
the fundamental technologies there
are completely unique uh to weima uh

2532
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:49,119
are completely unique uh to weima uh
 

2533
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,430
are completely unique uh to weima uh
that is also largely true about radars

2534
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,440
that is also largely true about radars
 

2535
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,190
that is also largely true about radars
and cameras it's a little bit more of a

2536
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,200
and cameras it's a little bit more of a
 

2537
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,589
and cameras it's a little bit more of a
a mix in terms of what we do ourselves

2538
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:55,599
a mix in terms of what we do ourselves
 

2539
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,870
a mix in terms of what we do ourselves
versus what we get from

2540
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880
versus what we get from
 

2541
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,589
versus what we get from
uh partners is there something uh super

2542
00:41:59,589 --> 00:41:59,599
uh partners is there something uh super
 

2543
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,270
uh partners is there something uh super
sexy about the computer that you can

2544
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,280
sexy about the computer that you can
 

2545
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,430
sexy about the computer that you can
mention that's not top secret

2546
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
mention that's not top secret
 

2547
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,349
mention that's not top secret
like uh for people who enjoy computers

2548
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:07,359
like uh for people who enjoy computers
 

2549
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,470
like uh for people who enjoy computers
for i mean uh so there's there's a lot

2550
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
for i mean uh so there's there's a lot
 

2551
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,109
for i mean uh so there's there's a lot
of

2552
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
of
 

2553
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,550
of
machine learning involved but there's a

2554
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
machine learning involved but there's a
 

2555
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,390
machine learning involved but there's a
lot of just basic compute there's

2556
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
lot of just basic compute there's
 

2557
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,870
lot of just basic compute there's
you have to uh probably do a lot of

2558
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:16,880
you have to uh probably do a lot of
 

2559
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,710
you have to uh probably do a lot of
signal processing on all the different

2560
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
signal processing on all the different
 

2561
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,790
signal processing on all the different
sensors you have to integrate everything

2562
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,800
sensors you have to integrate everything
 

2563
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,470
sensors you have to integrate everything
has to be in real time there's probably

2564
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480
has to be in real time there's probably
 

2565
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,150
has to be in real time there's probably
some kind of redundancy type of

2566
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,160
some kind of redundancy type of
 

2567
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,430
some kind of redundancy type of
situation

2568

situation
 

2569
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,109
situation
is there something interesting you can

2570
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
is there something interesting you can
 

2571
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,950
is there something interesting you can
say about the computer for the people

2572
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
say about the computer for the people
 

2573
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,150
say about the computer for the people
who love

2574
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
who love
 

2575
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,910
who love
hardware it does have all of the

you just mentioned
 

2581
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,230
you just mentioned
uh redundancy uh very beefy compute

2582
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,240
uh redundancy uh very beefy compute
 

2583
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,870
uh redundancy uh very beefy compute
for general processing as well as you

2584
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:40,880
for general processing as well as you
 

2585
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,750
for general processing as well as you
know inference

2586
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:41,760
know inference
 

2587
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,230
know inference
and ml models it is some of the more

00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,240
and ml models it is some of the more
 

2589
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,430

sensitive stuff that you know i don't
 

2591
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,270
sensitive stuff that you know i don't
want to get into for ip reasons but

want to get into for ip reasons but
yeah it can be shared a little bit

2594
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:50,319
yeah it can be shared a little bit
 

2595
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,069
yeah it can be shared a little bit
uh in terms of the specs of the sensors

2596
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:54,079
uh in terms of the specs of the sensors
 

2597
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,589
uh in terms of the specs of the sensors
that we have on the car you know we

2598
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:55,599
that we have on the car you know we
 

2599
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,069
that we have on the car you know we
actually shared some videos of

2600
00:42:58,069 --> 00:42:58,079
actually shared some videos of
 

2601
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,270
actually shared some videos of
what our lighter seas lighters

2602
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,280
what our lighter seas lighters
 

2603
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,990
what our lighter seas lighters
see in the world we have 29 cameras we

2604
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
see in the world we have 29 cameras we
 

2605
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,470
see in the world we have 29 cameras we
have

2606
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:04,480
have
 

2607
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,790
have
five lighters we have six raiders on

2608
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,800
five lighters we have six raiders on
 

2609
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,910
five lighters we have six raiders on
these vehicles

2610
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
these vehicles
 

2611
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,510
these vehicles
and you can kind of get a feel for the

2612
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:09,520
and you can kind of get a feel for the
 

2613
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,750
and you can kind of get a feel for the
amount of data that they're producing

2614
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
amount of data that they're producing
 

2615
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,430
amount of data that they're producing
that all has to be processed in real

2616
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,440
that all has to be processed in real
 

2617
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:13,990
that all has to be processed in real
time

2618
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:14,000
time
 

2619
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,470
time
uh to you know do perception to do

2620
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,480
uh to you know do perception to do
 

2621
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,510
uh to you know do perception to do
complex reasoning

2622
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
complex reasoning
 

2623
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,790
complex reasoning
and kind of gives you some idea of how

2624
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:18,800
and kind of gives you some idea of how
 

2625
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,550
and kind of gives you some idea of how
beefy those computers are but i don't

2626
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:20,560
beefy those computers are but i don't
 

2627
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,150
beefy those computers are but i don't
want to get into specifics of exactly

2628
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
want to get into specifics of exactly
 

2629
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,109
want to get into specifics of exactly
how we build them

2630
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:23,119
how we build them
 

2631
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,790
how we build them
okay well let me try some more questions

2632
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:24,800
okay well let me try some more questions
 

2633
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,710
okay well let me try some more questions
that you can't get into the specifics of

2634
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,720
that you can't get into the specifics of
 

2635
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,910
that you can't get into the specifics of
like gpu wise

2636
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
like gpu wise
 

2637
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,750
like gpu wise
is that something you can get into you

2638
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:29,760
is that something you can get into you
 

2639
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,270
is that something you can get into you
know i know that google works

2640
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
know i know that google works
 

2641
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,349
know i know that google works
with tpus and so on i mean for machine

2642
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
with tpus and so on i mean for machine
 

2643
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,390
with tpus and so on i mean for machine
learning folks

2644
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
learning folks
 

2645
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,790
learning folks
it's kind of interesting or is there no

2646
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800

 

2647
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,270

how do i ask it uh i've been talking to

2648
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
how do i ask it uh i've been talking to
 

2649
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,309
how do i ask it uh i've been talking to
people

2650
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:42,319
people
 

2651
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,150
people
in the government about ufos and they

2652
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,160
in the government about ufos and they
 

2653
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,069
in the government about ufos and they
don't answer any questions so this is

2654
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
don't answer any questions so this is
 

2655
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,510
don't answer any questions so this is
this is how i feel right now asking

2656
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
this is how i feel right now asking
 

2657
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,710
this is how i feel right now asking
about gpus

2658
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
about gpus
 

2659
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,390
about gpus
[Laughter]

2660
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
[Laughter]
 

2661
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,150
[Laughter]
but is there something interesting they

2662
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,160
but is there something interesting they
 

2663
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,750
but is there something interesting they
could reveal

2664
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
could reveal
 

2665
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,870
could reveal
or is it just you know uh yeah or would

2666
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:56,880
or is it just you know uh yeah or would
 

2667
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,550
or is it just you know uh yeah or would
leave it up to our imagination some of

2668
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,560
leave it up to our imagination some of
 

2669
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,390
leave it up to our imagination some of
the some of the compute is there any

2670
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
the some of the compute is there any
 

2671
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,270
the some of the compute is there any
i guess is there any fun trickery like i

2672
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
i guess is there any fun trickery like i
 

2673
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:03,829
i guess is there any fun trickery like i
talked to

2674
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:03,839
talked to
 

2675
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,829
talked to
chris lattner for a second time and he

2676
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
chris lattner for a second time and he
 

2677
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,870
chris lattner for a second time and he
was a key

2678
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
was a key
 

2679
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,870
was a key
person about tpus and there's a lot of

2680
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:08,880
person about tpus and there's a lot of
 

2681
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,230
person about tpus and there's a lot of
fun stuff going on in

to process all that data
 

2743
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,870
to process all that data
and this is where we're finding that

2744
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:16,880
and this is where we're finding that
 

2745
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,990
and this is where we're finding that
having a lot of control

of that that hardware part of the stack
 

2749
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,030
of that that hardware part of the stack
is

2750
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
is
 

2751
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,950
is
really advantageous one of the

2752
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:22,960
really advantageous one of the
 

2753
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,349
really advantageous one of the
fascinating magical places to me

2754
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:25,359
fascinating magical places to me
 

2755
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,750
fascinating magical places to me
again might not be able to speak to the

2756
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,760
again might not be able to speak to the
 

2757
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,030
again might not be able to speak to the
details but

2758
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,040
details but
 

2759
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,270
details but
is the it is the other compute which is

2760
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
is the it is the other compute which is
 

2761
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,710
is the it is the other compute which is
like you know this we're just talking

2762
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:32,720
like you know this we're just talking
 

2763
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,309
like you know this we're just talking
about a single car

2764
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
about a single car
 

2765
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,349
about a single car
but the you know

2766
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:37,359
but the you know
 

2767
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,109
but the you know
the driving experience is a source of a

2768
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119
the driving experience is a source of a
 

2769
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,550
the driving experience is a source of a
lot of fascinating data

2770
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:40,560
lot of fascinating data
 

2771
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,069
lot of fascinating data
and you have a huge amount of data

2772
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:42,079
and you have a huge amount of data
 

2773
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,309
and you have a huge amount of data
coming in on the car on the car

2774
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
coming in on the car on the car
 

2775
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,109
coming in on the car on the car
and you know the infrastructure of

2776
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:47,119
and you know the infrastructure of
 

2777
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,950
and you know the infrastructure of
storing some of that data

2778
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
storing some of that data
 

2779
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,069
storing some of that data
to then train or to analyze or so on

2780
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:52,079
to then train or to analyze or so on
 

2781
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,670
to then train or to analyze or so on
that's a fascinating like piece of it

2782
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
that's a fascinating like piece of it
 

2783
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,230
that's a fascinating like piece of it
that that i understand a single car i

2784
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:58,240
that that i understand a single car i
 

2785
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,589
that that i understand a single car i
don't understand how you pull it all

2786
00:45:59,589 --> 00:45:59,599
don't understand how you pull it all
 

2787
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,950
don't understand how you pull it all
together in a nice way

2788
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
together in a nice way
 

2789
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,390
together in a nice way
is that something that you could speak

2790
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
is that something that you could speak
 

2791
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,670
is that something that you could speak
to in terms of the challenges of um

2792
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:05,680
to in terms of the challenges of um
 

2793
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,470
to in terms of the challenges of um
of seeing the network of cars and then

2794
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,480
of seeing the network of cars and then
 

2795
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,750
of seeing the network of cars and then
bringing the data back

2796
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
bringing the data back
 

2797
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,349
bringing the data back
and analyzing things that weren't that

2798
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:11,359
and analyzing things that weren't that
 

2799
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,069
and analyzing things that weren't that
like like edge cases of driving be able

2800
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:14,079
like like edge cases of driving be able
 

2801
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,750
like like edge cases of driving be able
to learn on them to improve the system

2883
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,109

essentially i mean through perhaps

2884
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,119
essentially i mean through perhaps
 

2885
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,630
essentially i mean through perhaps
through a centralized point

2886

through a centralized point
 

2887
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,670
through a centralized point
but what uh that's fascinating too how

2888
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:41,680
but what uh that's fascinating too how
 

2889
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,430
but what uh that's fascinating too how
much does that help you like if you

00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
much does that help you like if you
 

2891
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,309
much does that help you like if you
imagine

2892
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
imagine
 

2893
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,910
imagine
like you know right now the number of

2894
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
like you know right now the number of
 

2895
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,589
like you know right now the number of
way more vehicles is

2896
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:47,599
way more vehicles is
 

2897
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,910
way more vehicles is
whatever x i don't know if you can talk

2898
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
whatever x i don't know if you can talk
 

2899
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,030
whatever x i don't know if you can talk
to what that number

2900
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
to what that number
 

2901
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,549
to what that number
but it's it's not in the hundreds of

2902
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:52,559
but it's it's not in the hundreds of
 

2903
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,150
but it's it's not in the hundreds of
millions yet

2904
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:54,160
millions yet
 

2905
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,710
millions yet
and imagine if the whole world is way

2906
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:56,720
and imagine if the whole world is way
 

2907
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,390
and imagine if the whole world is way
more vehicles

2908
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
more vehicles
 

2909
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,910
more vehicles
uh like that changes potentially the

2910
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
uh like that changes potentially the
 

2911
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,990
uh like that changes potentially the
power of connectivity like the more cars

2912
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
power of connectivity like the more cars
 

2913
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,710
power of connectivity like the more cars
you have

2914
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720
you have
 

2915
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,710
you have
i guess actually if you look at phoenix

2916
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
i guess actually if you look at phoenix
 

2917
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,549
i guess actually if you look at phoenix
because there's enough vehicles

2918
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:08,559
because there's enough vehicles
 

2919
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,950
because there's enough vehicles
there's enough when there's like some

2920
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,960
there's enough when there's like some
 

2921
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,390
there's enough when there's like some
level of density

2922
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:12,400
level of density
 

2923
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,990
level of density
you can start to probably do some really

2924
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,000
you can start to probably do some really
 

2925
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,430
you can start to probably do some really
interesting stuff with

2926
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,440
interesting stuff with
 

2927
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,589
interesting stuff with
the fact that cars can negotiate can

2928
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:19,599
the fact that cars can negotiate can
 

2929
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,670
the fact that cars can negotiate can
be uh can communicate with each other

2930
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:21,680
be uh can communicate with each other
 

2931
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,349
be uh can communicate with each other
and thereby make decisions

2932
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:23,359
and thereby make decisions
 

2933
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,910
and thereby make decisions
is there something interesting there

2934
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:25,920
is there something interesting there
 

2935
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,829
is there something interesting there
that you can talk to about like how does

2936
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:27,839
that you can talk to about like how does
 

2937
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,589
that you can talk to about like how does
that help with the driving problem

2938
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:29,599
that help with the driving problem
 

2939
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,230
that help with the driving problem
from as compared to just a single car

2940
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
from as compared to just a single car
 

2941
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,430
from as compared to just a single car
solving the driving problem by itself

2942
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:35,440
solving the driving problem by itself
 

2943
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,390
solving the driving problem by itself
uh yeah it's it's a spectrum i uh first

2944
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,400
uh yeah it's it's a spectrum i uh first
 

2945
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,670
uh yeah it's it's a spectrum i uh first
to say that yeah

2946
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:39,680
to say that yeah
 

2947
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,109
to say that yeah
it's it helps uh and it helps in various

2948
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:43,119
it's it helps uh and it helps in various
 

2949
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,470
it's it helps uh and it helps in various
ways but it's not required

2950
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:44,480
ways but it's not required
 

2951
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,230
ways but it's not required
uh right now the way we build our system

2952
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,240
uh right now the way we build our system
 

2953
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,990
uh right now the way we build our system
engaged cars can operate independently

2954
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
engaged cars can operate independently
 

2955
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,150
engaged cars can operate independently
they can operate with no connectivity uh

2956
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
they can operate with no connectivity uh
 

2957
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,150
they can operate with no connectivity uh
so i think it is important that you know

2958
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,160
so i think it is important that you know
 

2959
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,030
so i think it is important that you know
you have

2960
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,040
you have
 

2961
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,349
you have
a fully uh autonomous you know fully

2962
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:55,359
a fully uh autonomous you know fully
 

2963
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,150
a fully uh autonomous you know fully
capable

2964
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:56,160
capable
 

2965
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,589
capable
uh driver uh that

2966
00:48:59,589 --> 00:48:59,599
uh driver uh that
 

2967
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,309
uh driver uh that
computerized driver that each car has

2968
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:02,319
computerized driver that each car has
 

2969
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,589
computerized driver that each car has
then you know they do

2970
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:03,599
then you know they do
 

2971
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,670
then you know they do
share information and they share

2972
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:05,680
share information and they share
 

2973
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,870
share information and they share
information in real time it really

2974
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:06,880
information in real time it really
 

2975
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,670
information in real time it really
really helps right so the way we

2976
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:09,680
really helps right so the way we
 

2977
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,790
really helps right so the way we
do this today is uh you know whenever

2978
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:12,800
do this today is uh you know whenever
 

2979
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,230
do this today is uh you know whenever
one car

2980
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
one car
 

2981
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,670
one car
encounters something interesting in the

2982
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:15,680
encounters something interesting in the
 

2983
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,670
encounters something interesting in the
world whether it might be an accident or

2984
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
world whether it might be an accident or
 

2985
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,589
world whether it might be an accident or
a new construction zone that information

2986
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
a new construction zone that information
 

2987
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:20,710
a new construction zone that information
immediately gets

2988
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:20,720
immediately gets
 

2989
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,349
immediately gets
uh you know uploaded over the air and is

2990
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:23,359
uh you know uploaded over the air and is
 

2991
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,030
uh you know uploaded over the air and is
propagated to the rest of the fleet

2992
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
propagated to the rest of the fleet
 

2993
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,710
propagated to the rest of the fleet
so and that's kind of how we think about

2994
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:26,720
so and that's kind of how we think about
 

2995
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,950
so and that's kind of how we think about
maps as priors

2996
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:28,960
maps as priors
 

2997
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,710
maps as priors
in terms of the knowledge of our drivers

2998
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
in terms of the knowledge of our drivers
 

2999
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,230
in terms of the knowledge of our drivers
of our fleet of drivers that is

3000
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:36,240
of our fleet of drivers that is
 

3001
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,630
of our fleet of drivers that is
distributed across the fleet and it's

3002
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
distributed across the fleet and it's
 

3003
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,349
distributed across the fleet and it's
updated

3004
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
updated
 

3005
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,390
updated
in real time so that's one use case

3006
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
in real time so that's one use case
 

3007
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,870
in real time so that's one use case
you know you can imagine as the you know

3008
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
you know you can imagine as the you know
 

3009
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,549
you know you can imagine as the you know
the the density

3010
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
the the density
 

3011
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,790
the the density
of these vehicles go up that they can

3012
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:48,800
of these vehicles go up that they can
 

3013
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,069
of these vehicles go up that they can
exchange more information

3014
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
exchange more information
 

3015
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,829
exchange more information
in terms of what they're planning to do

3016
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:51,839
in terms of what they're planning to do
 

3017
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,349
in terms of what they're planning to do
uh and uh start

3018
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
uh and uh start
 

3019
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,030
uh and uh start
uh influencing how they interact with

3020
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,040
uh influencing how they interact with
 

3021
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,829
uh influencing how they interact with
each other uh as well as you know

3022
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:56,839
each other uh as well as you know
 

3023
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:57,990
each other uh as well as you know
potentially

3024
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,000
potentially
 

3025
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,990
potentially
sharing some observations right to help

3026
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
sharing some observations right to help
 

3027
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,829
sharing some observations right to help
with if you have enough density of these

3028
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:01,839
with if you have enough density of these
 

3029
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,430
with if you have enough density of these
vehicles where you know one car might be

3030
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,440
vehicles where you know one car might be
 

3031
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,790
vehicles where you know one car might be
seeing something that another is

3032
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,800
seeing something that another is
 

3033
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,230
seeing something that another is
relevant to another car

3034
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,240
relevant to another car
 

3035
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,750
relevant to another car
that is very dynamic you know it's not

3036
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:07,760
that is very dynamic you know it's not
 

3037
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,030
that is very dynamic you know it's not
part of kind of you're updating your

3038
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,040
part of kind of you're updating your
 

3039
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,069
part of kind of you're updating your
static prior

3040
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:10,079
static prior
 

3041
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,430
static prior
of the map of the world but it's more of

3042
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
of the map of the world but it's more of
 

3043
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,630
of the map of the world but it's more of
a dynamic information that could be

3044
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:12,640
a dynamic information that could be
 

3045
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,750
a dynamic information that could be
relevant to the

3046
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:13,760
relevant to the
 

3047
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,430
relevant to the
decisions that another cars make in real

3048
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
decisions that another cars make in real
 

3049
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,950
decisions that another cars make in real
time so you can see them exchanging that

3050
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:16,960
time so you can see them exchanging that
 

3051
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,670
time so you can see them exchanging that
information

3052
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:17,680
information
 

3053
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,750
information
and you can build on that but again i i

3054
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:19,760
and you can build on that but again i i
 

3055
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,950
and you can build on that but again i i
see that as

3056
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:20,960
see that as
 

3057
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,670
see that as
an advantage but it's you know not a

3058
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,680
an advantage but it's you know not a
 

3059
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,950
an advantage but it's you know not a
requirement

3060
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
requirement
 

3061
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,910
requirement
so what about the human in the loop so

3062
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
so what about the human in the loop so
 

3063
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,670
so what about the human in the loop so
uh when i got a chance to drive with a

3064
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
uh when i got a chance to drive with a
 

3065
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,030
uh when i got a chance to drive with a
ride in a waymo you know there's

3066
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:35,040
ride in a waymo you know there's
 

3067
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,340
ride in a waymo you know there's
customer service

3068
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,350
customer service
 

3069
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,230
customer service
[Laughter]

3070
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240
[Laughter]
 

3071
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,790
[Laughter]
so like is somebody that's able to

3072
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:40,800
so like is somebody that's able to
 

3073
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,630
so like is somebody that's able to
dynamically

3074
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
dynamically
 

3075
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,870
dynamically
like tune in and uh help you out

3076
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:46,880
like tune in and uh help you out
 

3077
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,750
like tune in and uh help you out
what uh what role does the human play in

3078
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,760
what uh what role does the human play in
 

3079
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,910
what uh what role does the human play in
that picture that's a fascinating like

3080
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:51,920
that picture that's a fascinating like
 

3081
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,670
that picture that's a fascinating like
you know the idea of teleoperation be

3082
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
you know the idea of teleoperation be
 

3083
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,069
you know the idea of teleoperation be
able to remotely control a vehicle

3084
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:56,079
able to remotely control a vehicle
 

3085
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,549
able to remotely control a vehicle
so here what we're talking about is like

out i don't know if they're able to
 

3095
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,710
out i don't know if they're able to
actually control the vehicle

3096
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:10,720
actually control the vehicle
 

3097
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,470
actually control the vehicle
is that something you could talk to uh

3098
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
is that something you could talk to uh
 

3099

yes okay uh to be clear
we don't do teleportation i'm going to

3102
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,000
we don't do teleportation i'm going to
 

3103
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,270
we don't do teleportation i'm going to
believe in teleoperation

3104
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,280
believe in teleoperation
 

3105
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,190
believe in teleoperation
for rare reasons that's not what we have

3106
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
for rare reasons that's not what we have
 

3107
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,630
for rare reasons that's not what we have
on our cars

3108
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
on our cars
 

3109
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,230
on our cars
we do as you mentioned have you know

3110
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,240
we do as you mentioned have you know
 

3111
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,910
we do as you mentioned have you know
version of you know customer support

3112
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:23,920
version of you know customer support
 

3113
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,270
version of you know customer support
uh you know we call it live health in

3114
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
uh you know we call it live health in
 

3115
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,190
uh you know we call it live health in
fact we find it that it's very

3116
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
fact we find it that it's very
 

3117
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,829
fact we find it that it's very
uh important for our rider experience

3118
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
uh important for our rider experience
 

3119
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,790
uh important for our rider experience
especially

3120
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:30,800
especially
 

3121
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,549
especially
if it's your first trip you've never

3122
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:32,559
if it's your first trip you've never
 

3123
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,630
if it's your first trip you've never
been in a fully driverless rider only

3124
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
been in a fully driverless rider only
 

3125
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,150
been in a fully driverless rider only
way more vehicle you get in there's

3126
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,160
way more vehicle you get in there's
 

3127
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,950
way more vehicle you get in there's
nobody there

3128
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:36,960
nobody there
 

3129
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,390
nobody there
right so you can imagine having all

3130
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:38,400
right so you can imagine having all
 

3131
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,390
right so you can imagine having all
kinds of you know questions in your head

3132
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:40,400
kinds of you know questions in your head
 

3133
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,829
kinds of you know questions in your head
like how this thing works

3134
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:41,839
like how this thing works
 

3135
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,349
like how this thing works
so we've put a lot of thought into kind

3136
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:43,359
so we've put a lot of thought into kind
 

3137
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,750
so we've put a lot of thought into kind
of guiding our

3138
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:45,760
of guiding our
 

3139
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,349
of guiding our
our writers our customers through that

3140
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359
our writers our customers through that
 

3141
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,030
our writers our customers through that
experience especially for the first time

3142
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:49,040
experience especially for the first time
 

3143
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,549
experience especially for the first time
they get some information on the phone

3144
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:50,559
they get some information on the phone
 

3145
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,750
they get some information on the phone
uh if the fully driverless vehicle

3146
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:53,760
uh if the fully driverless vehicle
 

3147
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,470
uh if the fully driverless vehicle
is used to service their trip uh when

3148
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:56,480
is used to service their trip uh when
 

3149
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,829
is used to service their trip uh when
you get into the car

3150
00:51:57,829 --> 00:51:57,839
you get into the car
 

3151
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,230
you get into the car
we have an in-car you know screen and

3152
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,240
we have an in-car you know screen and
 

3153
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,750
we have an in-car you know screen and
audio that kind of guides them and

3154
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:01,760
audio that kind of guides them and
 

3155
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,470
audio that kind of guides them and
explains

3156
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,480
explains
 

3157
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,349
explains
uh what to expect they also have a

3158
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
uh what to expect they also have a
 

3159
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:05,829
uh what to expect they also have a
button

3160
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:05,839
button
 

3161
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,230
button
that they can push that will connect

3162
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:08,240
that they can push that will connect
 

3163
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,190
that they can push that will connect
them to

3164
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,200
them to
 

3165
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,430
them to
you know a real life human being that

3166
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:11,440
you know a real life human being that
 

3167
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,390
you know a real life human being that
they can talk to

3168
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,400
they can talk to
 

3169
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,150
they can talk to
all right about this whole process so

3170
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
all right about this whole process so
 

3171
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,150
all right about this whole process so
that's one aspect of it um there is

3172
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,160
that's one aspect of it um there is
 

3173
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,190
that's one aspect of it um there is
i should mention that there is uh

3174
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:19,200
i should mention that there is uh
 

3175
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,150
i should mention that there is uh
another function that uh humans provide

3176
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
another function that uh humans provide
 

3177
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:22,870
another function that uh humans provide
uh to our

3178
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
uh to our
 

3179
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,710
uh to our
cars but it's not tele operation you can

3180
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
cars but it's not tele operation you can
 

3181
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,150
cars but it's not tele operation you can
think of it a little bit more like you

3182
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,160
think of it a little bit more like you
 

3183
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,270
think of it a little bit more like you
know fleet assistance

3184
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,280
know fleet assistance
 

3185
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,270
know fleet assistance
kind of like you know traffic control uh

kind of like you know traffic control uh
 

3187
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,630
kind of like you know traffic control uh
that that you have

3188

that that you have
 

3189
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,230
that that you have
where our cars again they're responsible

3190

where our cars again they're responsible
 

3191
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,309
where our cars again they're responsible
on their own for making all of the

decisions all the driving decisions that
 

3195
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,430
decisions all the driving decisions that
don't require connectivity

3196
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:39,440
don't require connectivity
 

3197
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,829
don't require connectivity
they you know anything that is safety or

on board uh our on onboard system uh but
 

3207
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,630
on board uh our on onboard system uh but
there are situations where you know if

00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
uh can a car encounters a particularly
 

3213
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,950

do their best
 

3221
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,190
do their best
they will recognize that it's an off

you know with the right interpretation
 

3229
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,230
you know with the right interpretation
the best course of action in that

3230
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,240
the best course of action in that
 

3231
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,589
the best course of action in that
scenario but if connectivity is

scenario but if connectivity is
 

3233
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,870
scenario but if connectivity is
available they can ask

3234
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
available they can ask
 

3235
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,109
available they can ask
for confirmation from you know here mode

assistant to kind of confirm those
actions and perhaps

3242
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:19,599
actions and perhaps
 

3243
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,270
actions and perhaps
provide a little bit of kind of

3244
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:21,280
provide a little bit of kind of
 

3245
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,950
provide a little bit of kind of
contextual information and guidance

3246
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
contextual information and guidance
 

3247
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,750
contextual information and guidance
so october 8th was when you're talking

00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
so this is a legitimate like that's a
 

3409
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,630
so this is a legitimate like that's a
paid service that's right

3410
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
paid service that's right
 

3411
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,950
paid service that's right
and the idea is you use the app to go

3412
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
and the idea is you use the app to go
 

3413
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,230
and the idea is you use the app to go
from point a to point b

3414
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
from point a to point b
 

3415
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,309
from point a to point b
and then what what are the a's what are

3416
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:00,319
and then what what are the a's what are
 

3417
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,390
and then what what are the a's what are
the what's the freedom of the

3418
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400
the what's the freedom of the
 

3419
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,910
the what's the freedom of the
of the starting and ending places it's

3420
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
of the starting and ending places it's
 

3421
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,309
of the starting and ending places it's
an area of geography where that service

3422
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319
an area of geography where that service
 

3423

an area of geography where that service
is enabled it's a

3569
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,950
like how do you get
the richest possible user feedback

3570
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:16,960
the richest possible user feedback
 

3571
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,589
the richest possible user feedback
like to improve what's what are the

3572
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:19,599
like to improve what's what are the
 

3573
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:20,470
like to improve what's what are the
channels that

3574
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,480
channels that
 

3575
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,829
channels that
you use to measure because like you're

3576
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:23,839
you use to measure because like you're
 

3577
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,190
you use to measure because like you're
you're no longer that's one of the

3578
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
you're no longer that's one of the
 

3579
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,109
you're no longer that's one of the
magical things about autonomous vehicles

3580
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:29,119
magical things about autonomous vehicles
 

3581
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,510
magical things about autonomous vehicles
is it's not like it's frictionless

3582
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,520
is it's not like it's frictionless
 

3583
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,270
is it's not like it's frictionless
interaction with the human so like you

3584
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:33,280
interaction with the human so like you
 

3585
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,950
interaction with the human so like you
don't get to

3586
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
don't get to
 

3587
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,430
don't get to
you know it's just giving a ride so like

3588
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:37,440
you know it's just giving a ride so like
 

3589
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,190
you know it's just giving a ride so like
how do you get feedback from people to

3590
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
how do you get feedback from people to
 

3591
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,549
how do you get feedback from people to
in order to improve

3592
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:40,559
in order to improve
 

3593

mechanisms uh so as part of the
 

3597
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,109
mechanisms uh so as part of the
normal flow we ask people for feedback

3598
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119
normal flow we ask people for feedback
 

3599
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,030

you know where we want to pull over and
 

3729
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,109
you know where we want to pull over and
how that you know uh get in

3730
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
how that you know uh get in
 

3731
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,309
how that you know uh get in
and get out um uh process works uh

3732
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:48,319
and get out um uh process works uh

01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:48,960
provides
 

3735
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,270
provides
very uh useful feedback in terms of you

3736
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,280
very uh useful feedback in terms of you
 

3737
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,789
very uh useful feedback in terms of you
know what makes a good

3738
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:52,799
know what makes a good
 

3739
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,190
know what makes a good
uh pickup and drop-off location uh we

3740
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,200
uh pickup and drop-off location uh we
 

3741
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,190
uh pickup and drop-off location uh we
get really valuable feedback

3742
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,200
get really valuable feedback
 

3743
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,470
get really valuable feedback
and in fact we had to um uh do some

3744
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
and in fact we had to um uh do some
 

3745
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,230
and in fact we had to um uh do some
really interesting work with

3746
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:02,240
really interesting work with
 

3747
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,190
really interesting work with
high definition maps and uh thinking

3748
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,200
high definition maps and uh thinking
 

3749
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:05,990
high definition maps and uh thinking
about

3750
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,000
about
 

3751
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,829
about
walking directions if you imagine you're

3752
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:07,839
walking directions if you imagine you're
 

3753
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,990
walking directions if you imagine you're
in a store right in some giant space

3754
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
in a store right in some giant space
 

3755
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,270
in a store right in some giant space
and then you know you want to be picked

3756
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:11,280
and then you know you want to be picked
 

3757
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,349
and then you know you want to be picked
up somewhere like if you just drop

3758
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
up somewhere like if you just drop
 

3759
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,109
up somewhere like if you just drop
a pin in the current location which is

3760
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
a pin in the current location which is
 

3761
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,549
a pin in the current location which is
maybe in the middle of a shopping mall

3762
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:16,559
maybe in the middle of a shopping mall
 

3763
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:17,910
maybe in the middle of a shopping mall
like what's the best

3764
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:17,920
like what's the best
 

3765
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,910
like what's the best
location for the car to come pick you up

3766
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:19,920
location for the car to come pick you up
 

3767
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,589
location for the car to come pick you up
and you can have simple heuristics where

3768
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
and you can have simple heuristics where
 

3769
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:22,870
and you can have simple heuristics where
you just kind of take your you know your

3770
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:22,880
you just kind of take your you know your
 

3771
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,470
you just kind of take your you know your
cleaning distance uh and find the

3772
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:24,480
cleaning distance uh and find the
 

3773
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,109
cleaning distance uh and find the
nearest

3774
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
nearest

3777
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,789
uh spot where the car can't pull over
that's closest to you but oftentimes

01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:28,799
that's closest to you but oftentimes
 

3779
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:29,910
that's closest to you but oftentimes
that's not the most convenient one you

3780
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:29,920
that's not the most convenient one you
 

3781
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,270
that's not the most convenient one you
know i have many anecdotes where that

3782
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:31,280
know i have many anecdotes where that

you know uh dropped off uh and
 

3793
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,270
you know uh dropped off uh and
phoenix uh and you know we car picked a

01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:45,280
phoenix uh and you know we car picked a
 

3795
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,390
phoenix uh and you know we car picked a

location
 

3797
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,190

uh that was close the closest to their
 

3799
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,030
uh that was close the closest to their
you know where the pin was dropped

3800
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:51,040
you know where the pin was dropped
 

3801
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,309
you know where the pin was dropped
on the map in terms of you know latitude

3802
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
on the map in terms of you know latitude
 

3803
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,190
on the map in terms of you know latitude
and longitude but it happened to be

01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
and longitude but it happened to be
 

3805
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,670
and longitude but it happened to be
on the other side of a parking lot that

3806
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:57,680
on the other side of a parking lot that
 

3807
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,270
on the other side of a parking lot that
had this row of cacti

3808
01:01:59,270 --> 01:01:59,280
had this row of cacti
 

3809
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,029
had this row of cacti
and poor person had to like walk all

3810
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:01,039
and poor person had to like walk all
 

3811
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,470
and poor person had to like walk all
around the parking lot to get to where

3812
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:02,480
around the parking lot to get to where
 

3813
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,349
around the parking lot to get to where
they wanted to be

they wanted to be
 

3815
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,510
they wanted to be
in 110 degree heat so that you know that

3816
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:05,520
in 110 degree heat so that you know that
 

3817
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,109
in 110 degree heat so that you know that
was about so then you know we took all

3818
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:07,119
was about so then you know we took all
 

3819
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,190
was about so then you know we took all
take all of these um all that feedback

yeah and improve it
 

3827
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,829
yeah and improve it
yeah i feel like that's like requires

3828
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:15,839
yeah i feel like that's like requires
 

3829
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,670
yeah i feel like that's like requires
agi to solve the problem

3830
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:17,680
agi to solve the problem
 

3831
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,990
agi to solve the problem
of like when you're which is a very

3832
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
of like when you're which is a very
 

3833
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,069
of like when you're which is a very
common case when you're in a big space

3834
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:22,079
common case when you're in a big space
 

3835
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,430
common case when you're in a big space
of some kind

3836
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:23,440
of some kind
 

3837
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,710
of some kind
like apartment building it doesn't

3838
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:24,720
like apartment building it doesn't
 

3839
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,870
like apartment building it doesn't
matter it's not some large space

3840
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:26,880
matter it's not some large space
 

3841
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,829
matter it's not some large space
and then you call the like the waymo

3842
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:29,839
and then you call the like the waymo
 

3843
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:30,549
and then you call the like the waymo
from there

3844
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:30,559
from there
 

3845
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,150
from there
right like so and you whatever it

3846
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:32,160
right like so and you whatever it
 

3847
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,670
right like so and you whatever it
doesn't matter right your

3848
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:33,680
doesn't matter right your
 

3849
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,029
doesn't matter right your
vehicle and like where is the pin

3850
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:37,039
vehicle and like where is the pin
 

3851
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,309
vehicle and like where is the pin
supposed to drop i feel like that's i

3852
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:40,319
supposed to drop i feel like that's i
 

3853
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,150
supposed to drop i feel like that's i
you don't think i think that requires a

3854
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:42,160
you don't think i think that requires a
 

3855
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,230
you don't think i think that requires a
gi i'm gonna

3856
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:44,240
gi i'm gonna
 

3857
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,270
gi i'm gonna
in order okay the alternative

3858
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:47,280
in order okay the alternative
 

3859
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,349
in order okay the alternative
which i think the google search engine

3860
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:49,359
which i think the google search engine
 

3861
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:50,630
which i think the google search engine
has taught

3862
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,640
has taught
 

3863
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,029
has taught
is like there's something really

3864
01:02:53,029 --> 01:02:53,039
is like there's something really
 

3865
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,789
is like there's something really
valuable about

3866
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:54,799
valuable about
 

3867
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,589
valuable about
the perhaps slightly dumb answer but a

3868
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:57,599
the perhaps slightly dumb answer but a
 

3869
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,589
the perhaps slightly dumb answer but a
really powerful one which is like

3870
01:02:59,589 --> 01:02:59,599
really powerful one which is like
 

3871
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,549
really powerful one which is like
what was done in the past by others like

3872
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559
what was done in the past by others like
 

3873
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,470
what was done in the past by others like
what was the choice made by others

3874
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,480
what was the choice made by others
 

3875
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,270
what was the choice made by others
that seems to be like in terms of google

3876
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:07,280
that seems to be like in terms of google
 

3877
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,630
that seems to be like in terms of google
search when you have like billions of

suggest based on
not some machine learning thing which

3890
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
not some machine learning thing which
 

3891
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,630
not some machine learning thing which
they also do but like on what

3892
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640
they also do but like on what
 

3893
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,630
they also do but like on what
was successful for others in the past

3894
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:22,640
was successful for others in the past
 

3895
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,150
was successful for others in the past
and finding a thing that they were happy

3896
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,160
and finding a thing that they were happy
 

3897
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:24,710
and finding a thing that they were happy
with

3898
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:24,720
with
 

3899
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,270
with
is that integrated at all with waymo

3900
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:27,280
is that integrated at all with waymo
 

3901
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:27,829
is that integrated at all with waymo
like

3902
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
like
 

3903
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,390
like
what what pickups worked for others it

3904
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:30,400
what what pickups worked for others it
 

3905
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,029
what what pickups worked for others it
is

3906
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
is
 

3907
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,309
is
i i think you're exactly right so

3908
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:32,319
i i think you're exactly right so
 

3909
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,230
i i think you're exactly right so
there's uh real it's an interesting

3910
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:34,240
there's uh real it's an interesting
 

3911
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:34,870
there's uh real it's an interesting
problem

3912
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:34,880
problem
 

3913
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,870
problem
uh naive solutions uh

3914
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
uh naive solutions uh
 

3915
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,390
uh naive solutions uh
have uh interesting failure modes

3916
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:42,400
have uh interesting failure modes
 

3917
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,670
have uh interesting failure modes
uh so there's definitely

3918
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
uh so there's definitely
 

3919
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,789
uh so there's definitely
lots of things that can be done to

3920
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:48,799
lots of things that can be done to
 

3921
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:49,750
lots of things that can be done to
improve

3922
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:49,760
improve
 

3923
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,950
improve

01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,029
environment and you know
richer maps but you're absolutely right

01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:03,039
richer maps but you're absolutely right
 

3937
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,630
richer maps but you're absolutely right
that there's something and there's some

3938
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
that there's something and there's some
 

3939
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,309
that there's something and there's some
properties of solutions that

3940
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:06,319
properties of solutions that
 

3941
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,390
properties of solutions that
uh in terms of the effect that they have

3942
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
uh in terms of the effect that they have
 

3943
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,990
uh in terms of the effect that they have
on users so much much much much better

3944
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,000
on users so much much much much better
 

3945
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,670
on users so much much much much better
than others right unpredictability

3946
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:11,680
than others right unpredictability
 

3947
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,750
than others right unpredictability
and understandability is important so

3948
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:13,760
and understandability is important so
 

3949
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,270
and understandability is important so
you can have maybe something that is not

3950
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,280
you can have maybe something that is not
 

3951
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,390
you can have maybe something that is not
quite as optimal but

3952
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:16,400
quite as optimal but
 

3953
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,549
quite as optimal but
is very natural and predictable to the

3954
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:18,559
is very natural and predictable to the
 

3955
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,430
is very natural and predictable to the
user and kind of works the same way

3956
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:21,440
user and kind of works the same way
 

3957
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,670
user and kind of works the same way
all the time and that matters that

3958
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:23,680
all the time and that matters that
 

3959
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,910
all the time and that matters that
matters a lot for the user experience

3960
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920
matters a lot for the user experience
 

3961
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,710
matters a lot for the user experience
and but you know to get to the basics

3962
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
and but you know to get to the basics
 

3963
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,750
and but you know to get to the basics
the pretty fundamental property

3964
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:31,760
the pretty fundamental property
 

3965
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,029
the pretty fundamental property
is that the car actually arrives

3966
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:35,039
is that the car actually arrives
 

3967
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,390
is that the car actually arrives
where you told it right like you can

3968
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:36,400
where you told it right like you can
 

3969
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,589
where you told it right like you can
always you know change it see it on the

3970
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:37,599
always you know change it see it on the
 

3971
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:38,870
always you know change it see it on the
map and you can move it around if you

3972
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
map and you can move it around if you
 

3973
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,230
map and you can move it around if you
don't like it and

3974
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,240
don't like it and
 

3975
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,309
don't like it and
but like that property that the car

3976
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:42,319
but like that property that the car
 

3977
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,150
but like that property that the car
actually shows up reliably

3978
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
actually shows up reliably
 

3979
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,349
actually shows up reliably
yeah is critical which you know where uh

3980
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:47,359
yeah is critical which you know where uh
 

3981
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,309
yeah is critical which you know where uh
compared to some of the human uh driven

3982
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:50,319
compared to some of the human uh driven
 

3983
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,109
compared to some of the human uh driven
yes

3984
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
yes
 

3985
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,190
yes
analogs i think you know you can have

3986
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,200
analogs i think you know you can have
 

3987
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,230
analogs i think you know you can have
more unpredictability

3988
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:54,240
more unpredictability
 

3989
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,470
more unpredictability
it's actually uh the fact uh if if i

3990
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
it's actually uh the fact uh if if i
 

3991
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,270
it's actually uh the fact uh if if i
have uh

3992
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:57,280
have uh
 

3993
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,950
have uh
might do a little bit of a detail here

3994
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:58,960
might do a little bit of a detail here
 

3995
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,870
might do a little bit of a detail here
uh i think the fact that it's

3996
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:00,880
uh i think the fact that it's
 

3997
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,549
uh i think the fact that it's
you know your phone and the cars two

3998
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:02,559
you know your phone and the cars two
 

3999
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,390
you know your phone and the cars two
computers talking to each other uh can

4000
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:04,400
computers talking to each other uh can
 

4001
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,270
computers talking to each other uh can
lead to some

4002
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:05,280
lead to some
 

4003
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,430
lead to some
really interesting things we can do in

4004
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:07,440
really interesting things we can do in
 

4005
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,029
really interesting things we can do in
terms of the user interfaces

4006
01:05:09,029 --> 01:05:09,039
terms of the user interfaces
 

4007
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,029
terms of the user interfaces
both in terms of function uh like the

4008
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:11,039
both in terms of function uh like the
 

4009
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,150
both in terms of function uh like the
car actually shows up

4010
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
car actually shows up
 

4011
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,390
car actually shows up
exactly where you told it uh you want it

4012
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,400
exactly where you told it uh you want it
 

4013
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,150
exactly where you told it uh you want it
to be but also some you know really

4014
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,160
to be but also some you know really
 

4015
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,670
to be but also some you know really
interesting things on the user interface

4016
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:17,680
interesting things on the user interface
 

4017
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,190
interesting things on the user interface
right as the car is driving as you

4018
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:19,200
right as the car is driving as you
 

4019
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,789
right as the car is driving as you
you know call it and it's on the way to

4020
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:20,799
you know call it and it's on the way to
 

4021
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,150
you know call it and it's on the way to
come and pick you up and of course you

4022
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:22,160
come and pick you up and of course you
 

4023
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,270
come and pick you up and of course you
get the position of the car

4024
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
get the position of the car
 

4025
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,990
get the position of the car
and the route on the map uh but and they

4026
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,000
and the route on the map uh but and they
 

4027
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,430
and the route on the map uh but and they
actually follow that route of course

4028
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
actually follow that route of course
 

4029
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,270
actually follow that route of course
uh but it can also share some really

4030
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:29,280
uh but it can also share some really
 

4031
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,390
uh but it can also share some really
interesting information about what it's

4032
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:30,400
interesting information about what it's
 

4033
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:30,950
interesting information about what it's
doing

01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
doing
 

4035
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,230
doing
so uh you know our cars uh as

01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:11,280
if maybe there's a sport analogy there
 

4535
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,790
if maybe there's a sport analogy there
right yeah you can

4536
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:12,800
right yeah you can
 

4537
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,030
right yeah you can
do in very many sports the

4538
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:17,040
do in very many sports the
 

4539
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,910
do in very many sports the
true professionals are very efficient in

4540
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:19,920
true professionals are very efficient in
 

4541
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,630
true professionals are very efficient in
their movements

4542
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:20,640
their movements
 

4543
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,430
their movements
right they don't do like you know hectic

4544
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:23,440
right they don't do like you know hectic
 

4545
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:23,990
right they don't do like you know hectic
uh

4546
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,000
uh
 

4547
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,790
uh
flailing right they're you know smooth

4548
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:26,800
flailing right they're you know smooth
 

4549
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,590
flailing right they're you know smooth
and

4550
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
and
 

4551
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,270
and
precise right and they get the best

4552
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:29,280
precise right and they get the best
 

4553
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,310
precise right and they get the best
results so that's the kind of driver

4554
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:30,320
results so that's the kind of driver
 

4555
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,430
results so that's the kind of driver
that we want to build

4556
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
that we want to build
 

4557
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,870
that we want to build
in terms of you know aggressiveness yeah

4558
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:32,880
in terms of you know aggressiveness yeah
 

4559
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,229
in terms of you know aggressiveness yeah
you can like you know roll through the

4560
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:34,239
you can like you know roll through the
 

4561
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,470
you can like you know roll through the
stop signs you can do crazy lane changes

4562
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
stop signs you can do crazy lane changes
 

4563
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,990
stop signs you can do crazy lane changes
uh it typically doesn't get you to your

4564
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:38,000
uh it typically doesn't get you to your
 

4565
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,910
uh it typically doesn't get you to your
destination faster typically not the

4566
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
destination faster typically not the
 

4567
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,110
destination faster typically not the
safest or most predictable uh

4568
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,120
safest or most predictable uh
 

4569
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,590
safest or most predictable uh
very most comfortable thing to do and uh

4570
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600
very most comfortable thing to do and uh
 

4571
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,709
very most comfortable thing to do and uh
but there is

4572
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:46,719
but there is
 

4573
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,110
but there is
a way to do both and that that that

4574
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
a way to do both and that that that
 

4575
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,390
a way to do both and that that that
that's what we're doing we're trying to

4576
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:50,400
that's what we're doing we're trying to
 

4577
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,910
that's what we're doing we're trying to
build a driver that is

4578
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
build a driver that is
 

4579
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,510
build a driver that is
uh safe comfortable smooth

4580
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:55,520
uh safe comfortable smooth
 

4581
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,470
uh safe comfortable smooth
and predictable yeah that's a really

4582
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480
and predictable yeah that's a really
 

4583
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,830
and predictable yeah that's a really
interesting distinction i think in the

4584
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840
interesting distinction i think in the
 

4585
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,149
interesting distinction i think in the
early days of autonomous vehicles

4586
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
early days of autonomous vehicles
 

4587
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,149
early days of autonomous vehicles
the vehicles felt cautious as opposed to

4588
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:04,159
the vehicles felt cautious as opposed to
 

4589
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,590
the vehicles felt cautious as opposed to
efficient

4590
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:05,600
efficient
 

4591
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,110
efficient
and and still probably but when i rode

4592
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,120
and and still probably but when i rode
 

4593
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,550
and and still probably but when i rode
in the waymo i mean there was

4594
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
in the waymo i mean there was
 

4595
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,910
in the waymo i mean there was
it was it was quite assertive it moved

4596
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:15,920
it was it was quite assertive it moved
 

4597
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,350
it was it was quite assertive it moved
pretty quickly

4598
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
pretty quickly
 

4599
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,070
pretty quickly
like um yeah and he's one of the

4600
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:20,080
like um yeah and he's one of the
 

4601
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,630
like um yeah and he's one of the
surprising feelings was that it actually

4602
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:22,640
surprising feelings was that it actually
 

4603
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,030
surprising feelings was that it actually
it went fast and it didn't feel like

4604
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,040
it went fast and it didn't feel like
 

4605
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,790
it went fast and it didn't feel like
awkwardly cautious than autonomous

4606
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:28,800
awkwardly cautious than autonomous
 

4607
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,390
awkwardly cautious than autonomous
vehicle like

4608
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
vehicle like
 

4609
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,310
vehicle like
like so i've also programmed autonomous

4610
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:32,320
like so i've also programmed autonomous
 

4611
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,990
like so i've also programmed autonomous
vehicles and everything i've ever

4612
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,000
vehicles and everything i've ever
 

4613
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,430
vehicles and everything i've ever
built was felt awkwardly either overly

4614
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
built was felt awkwardly either overly
 

4615
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,470
built was felt awkwardly either overly
aggressive

4616
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,480
aggressive
 

4617
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,750
aggressive
okay especially when it was my code or

4618
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:41,760
okay especially when it was my code or
 

4619
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,950
okay especially when it was my code or
uh like awkwardly cautious is the way i

4620
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:44,960
uh like awkwardly cautious is the way i
 

4621
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,149
uh like awkwardly cautious is the way i
would put it

4622
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:46,159
would put it
 

4623
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:51,110
would put it
and the waymo's vehicle felt

4624
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:51,120
and the waymo's vehicle felt
 

4625
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,229
and the waymo's vehicle felt
like uh assertive and i think efficient

4626
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:54,239
like uh assertive and i think efficient
 

4627
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,470
like uh assertive and i think efficient
as

4628
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
as
 

4629
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,669
as
like the right terminology here it

4630
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:57,679
like the right terminology here it
 

4631
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,630
like the right terminology here it
wasn't uh

4632
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:58,640
wasn't uh
 

4633
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,709
wasn't uh
and i also like the professional limo

4634
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
and i also like the professional limo
 

4635
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,189
and i also like the professional limo
driver because we often think like

4636
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:03,199
driver because we often think like
 

4637
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:07,030
driver because we often think like
you know an uber driver or a bus driver

4638
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:07,040
you know an uber driver or a bus driver
 

4639
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:07,910
you know an uber driver or a bus driver
or a taxi

4640
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:07,920
or a taxi
 

4641
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,990
or a taxi
this is the funny thing is people think

4642
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,000
this is the funny thing is people think
 

4643
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,149
this is the funny thing is people think
that taxi drivers are professionals

4644
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:14,159
that taxi drivers are professionals
 

4645
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,189
that taxi drivers are professionals
they i mean it's it's like that that's

4646
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:17,199
they i mean it's it's like that that's
 

4647
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:17,990
they i mean it's it's like that that's
like saying

4648
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,000
like saying
 

4649
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,750
like saying
me i'm a professional walker just

4650
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:19,760
me i'm a professional walker just
 

4651
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,830
me i'm a professional walker just
because i've been walking all my life

4652
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
because i've been walking all my life
 

4653
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,870
because i've been walking all my life
i think there's an art to it right

4654
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:24,880
i think there's an art to it right
 

4655
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,630
i think there's an art to it right
and if you take it seriously as an art

4656
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:26,640
and if you take it seriously as an art
 

4657
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,070
and if you take it seriously as an art
form

4658
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:28,080
form
 

4659
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,270
form
then there's a certain way that mastery

4660
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
then there's a certain way that mastery
 

4661
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,470
then there's a certain way that mastery
looks like

4662
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:32,480
looks like
 

4663
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,910
looks like
it's interesting to think about what

4664
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:33,920
it's interesting to think about what
 

4665
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,790
it's interesting to think about what
does mastery look like in driving

4666
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:36,800
does mastery look like in driving
 

4667
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,390
does mastery look like in driving
and perhaps what we associate with like

4668
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:40,400
and perhaps what we associate with like
 

4669
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,510
and perhaps what we associate with like
aggressiveness

4670
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
aggressiveness
 

4671
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,510
aggressiveness
is unnecessary like it's not part of the

4672
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:45,520
is unnecessary like it's not part of the
 

4673
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,590
is unnecessary like it's not part of the
experience of driving it's like

4674
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,600
experience of driving it's like
 

4675
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,830
experience of driving it's like
unnecessary fluff

4676
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
unnecessary fluff
 

4677
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,870
unnecessary fluff
that efficiency you could you can be

4678
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880

 

4679
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,830

you can create a good driving experience

4680
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:57,840
you can create a good driving experience
 

4681
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,390
you can create a good driving experience
within the rules

4682
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:00,400
within the rules
 

4683
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,390
within the rules
that's uh i mean you're the first person

4684
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:02,400
that's uh i mean you're the first person
 

4685
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,910
that's uh i mean you're the first person
to tell me this so it's it's kind of

4686
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
to tell me this so it's it's kind of
 

4687
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,590
to tell me this so it's it's kind of
interesting i need to think about this

4688
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:05,600
interesting i need to think about this
 

4689
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,110
interesting i need to think about this
but that's exactly what it felt like

4690
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:07,120
but that's exactly what it felt like
 

4691
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,030
but that's exactly what it felt like
with waymo i kind of had this intuition

4692
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
with waymo i kind of had this intuition
 

4693
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,310
with waymo i kind of had this intuition
maybe it's the russian thing i don't

4694
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:10,320
maybe it's the russian thing i don't
 

4695
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,270
maybe it's the russian thing i don't
know

4696
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:11,280
know
 

4697
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,350
know
that you have to break the rules in life

4698
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:13,360
that you have to break the rules in life
 

4699
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,070
that you have to break the rules in life
to get anywhere

4700
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:16,080
to get anywhere
 

4701
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,470
to get anywhere
but maybe maybe it's possible that

4702
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:18,480
but maybe maybe it's possible that
 

4703
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,110
but maybe maybe it's possible that
that's not the case

4704
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:21,120
that's not the case
 

4705
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,110
that's not the case
in driving i have to think about that

4706
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:23,120
in driving i have to think about that
 

4707
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,790
in driving i have to think about that
but it certainly felt that way on the

4708
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:24,800
but it certainly felt that way on the
 

4709
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,550
but it certainly felt that way on the
streets of phoenix when i was there in

4710
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:26,560
streets of phoenix when i was there in
 

4711
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,750
streets of phoenix when i was there in
in waymo that

4712
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760
in waymo that
 

4713
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,350
in waymo that
that that that was a very pleasant

4714
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:29,360
that that that was a very pleasant
 

4715
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,110
that that that was a very pleasant
experience and it wasn't frustrating in

4716
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,120
experience and it wasn't frustrating in
 

4717
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,149
experience and it wasn't frustrating in
that like

4718
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:32,159
that like
 

4719
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,310
that like
come on move already kind of feeling it

4720
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,320
come on move already kind of feeling it
 

4721
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,070
come on move already kind of feeling it
wasn't it that wasn't there

4722
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:36,080
wasn't it that wasn't there
 

4723
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,510
wasn't it that wasn't there
yeah i mean that's what that's what

4724
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:37,520
yeah i mean that's what that's what
 

4725
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,189
yeah i mean that's what that's what
we're going after yeah i don't think you

4726
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
we're going after yeah i don't think you
 

4727
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,709
we're going after yeah i don't think you
have to pick one i think

4728
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:40,719
have to pick one i think
 

4729
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,669
have to pick one i think
truly good driving and gives you both

4730
01:17:43,669 --> 01:17:43,679
truly good driving and gives you both
 

4731
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,270
truly good driving and gives you both
efficiency assertiveness but also

4732
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:45,280
efficiency assertiveness but also
 

4733
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,709
efficiency assertiveness but also
comfort and predictability and you know

4734
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
comfort and predictability and you know
 

4735
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:47,750
comfort and predictability and you know
safety

4736
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:47,760
safety
 

4737
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,270
safety
uh and you know it's that's what

4738
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:51,280
uh and you know it's that's what
 

4739
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,630
uh and you know it's that's what
fundamental improvements in the

4740
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:54,640
fundamental improvements in the
 

4741
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,149
fundamental improvements in the
core capabilities truly unlock and

4742
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
core capabilities truly unlock and
 

4743
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,350
core capabilities truly unlock and
you can kind of think of it as you know

4744
01:17:59,350 --> 01:17:59,360
you can kind of think of it as you know
 

4745
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,510
you can kind of think of it as you know
a precision and recall trade-off you

4746
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:01,520
a precision and recall trade-off you
 

4747
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,110
a precision and recall trade-off you
have certain capabilities of your model

4748
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:03,120
have certain capabilities of your model
 

4749
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,550
have certain capabilities of your model
and then it's very easy when you know

4750
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
and then it's very easy when you know
 

4751
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,990
and then it's very easy when you know
you have some curve of precision and

4752
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:06,000
you have some curve of precision and
 

4753
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,270
you have some curve of precision and
recoil you can move things around and

4754
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:07,280
recoil you can move things around and
 

4755
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,470
recoil you can move things around and
you can choose your operating point in

4756
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:08,480
you can choose your operating point in
 

4757
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,070
you can choose your operating point in
your training of precision versus recall

4758
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
your training of precision versus recall
 

4759
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,990
your training of precision versus recall
false positives versus false negatives

4760
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:12,000
false positives versus false negatives
 

4761
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,470
false positives versus false negatives
right but then and you know you can tune

4762
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
right but then and you know you can tune
 

4763
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,229
right but then and you know you can tune
things on that curve and be kind of more

4764
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
things on that curve and be kind of more
 

4765
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,669
things on that curve and be kind of more
cautious or more aggressive but then

4766
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
cautious or more aggressive but then
 

4767
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,270
cautious or more aggressive but then
aggressive is bad or you know cautious

4768
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
aggressive is bad or you know cautious
 

4769
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:19,750
aggressive is bad or you know cautious
is bad

4770
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:19,760
is bad
 

4771
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,910
is bad
but true capabilities come from actually

4772
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:21,920
but true capabilities come from actually
 

4773
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,950
but true capabilities come from actually
moving the whole curve

4774
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:22,960
moving the whole curve
 

4775
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,750
moving the whole curve
up right and then you are kind of on a

4776
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:25,760
up right and then you are kind of on a
 

4777
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,229
up right and then you are kind of on a
very

4778
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:26,239
very
 

4779
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,430
very
different plane of those trade-offs and

4780
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:29,440
different plane of those trade-offs and
 

4781
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,870
different plane of those trade-offs and
that that's what you know we're

4782
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:30,880
that that's what you know we're
 

4783
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,149
that that's what you know we're
trying to do here is to move the whole

4784
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
trying to do here is to move the whole
 

4785
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,630
trying to do here is to move the whole
curve up before i forget let's talk

4786
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:34,640
curve up before i forget let's talk
 

4787
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,910
curve up before i forget let's talk
about trucks

4788
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:35,920
about trucks
 

4789
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,950
about trucks
a little bit uh so i also got a chance

4790
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:38,960
a little bit uh so i also got a chance
 

4791
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,470
a little bit uh so i also got a chance
to check out some of the waymo truck

4792
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:40,480
to check out some of the waymo truck
 

4793
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,590
to check out some of the waymo truck
uh trucks i'm not sure if uh we want to

4794
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:43,600
uh trucks i'm not sure if uh we want to
 

4795
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,149
uh trucks i'm not sure if uh we want to
go

4796
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:44,159
go
 

4797
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:46,070
go
too much into that space but it's a

4798
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,080
too much into that space but it's a
 

4799
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,590
too much into that space but it's a
fascinating one so maybe we can mention

4800
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:47,600
fascinating one so maybe we can mention
 

4801
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,669
fascinating one so maybe we can mention
at least briefly

4802
01:18:49,669 --> 01:18:49,679
at least briefly
 

4803
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,189
at least briefly
you know waymo is also not doing

4804
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:51,199
you know waymo is also not doing
 

4805
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:55,189
you know waymo is also not doing
autonomous trucking and uh how

4806
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
autonomous trucking and uh how
 

4807
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,350
autonomous trucking and uh how
different like philosophically and

4808
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,360
different like philosophically and
 

4809
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,709
different like philosophically and
technically is that whole space of

4810
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
technically is that whole space of
 

4811
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,149
technically is that whole space of
problems

4812
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:00,159
problems
 

4813
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:03,750
problems
it's one of our two big

4814
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,760
it's one of our two big
 

4815
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,390
it's one of our two big
products and uh you know commercial

4816
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:06,400
products and uh you know commercial
 

4817
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,110
products and uh you know commercial
applications

4818
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,120
applications
 

4819
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,830
applications
of our driver right right handling and

4820
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:09,840
of our driver right right handling and
 

4821
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,790
of our driver right right handling and
deliveries you know

4822
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
deliveries you know
 

4823
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,950
deliveries you know
we have waymo one and waymovia moving

4824
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
we have waymo one and waymovia moving
 

4825
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,310
we have waymo one and waymovia moving
people and moving goods

4826
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:14,320
people and moving goods
 

4827
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,350
people and moving goods
uh you know trucking is an example of

4828
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:17,360
uh you know trucking is an example of
 

4829
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,550
uh you know trucking is an example of
uh moving goods uh we've been uh working

4830
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:20,560
uh moving goods uh we've been uh working
 

4831
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,070
uh moving goods uh we've been uh working
on trucking since 2017. uh it

4832
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080
on trucking since 2017. uh it
 

4833
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:28,070
on trucking since 2017. uh it
is uh

4834
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
is uh
 

4835
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,790
is uh
a very interesting space and your

4836
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
a very interesting space and your
 

4837
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,350
a very interesting space and your
question

4838

question
 

4839
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,110
question
how different is it it has this really

4840
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
how different is it it has this really
 

4841
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,950
how different is it it has this really
nice property that

4842

you know evaluating a retirement system
 

4861
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,630
you know evaluating a retirement system
like those fundamentals

4862
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:52,640
like those fundamentals
 

4863
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:57,189
like those fundamentals
carry over the true challenges of

01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:06,960
uh the simulator ml infrastructure those
 

4875
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,830
uh the simulator ml infrastructure those
carry over

4876
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:07,840
carry over
 

4877
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,510
carry over
i think the data and the application and

4878
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,520
i think the data and the application and
 

4879
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,350
i think the data and the application and
kind of the the

4880
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
kind of the the
 

4881
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,070
kind of the the
domains might be different but the the

4882
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:14,080
domains might be different but the the
 

4883
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,270
domains might be different but the the
most difficult problems

4884
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:15,280
most difficult problems
 

4885
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,669
most difficult problems
uh all of that carries over between the

4886
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:17,679
uh all of that carries over between the
 

4887
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:18,310
uh all of that carries over between the
domains so

4888
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:18,320
domains so
 

4889
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,750
domains so
that that's very nice so that's how we

4890
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
that that's very nice so that's how we
 

4891
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,350
that that's very nice so that's how we
approach it we're kind of

4892
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:21,360
approach it we're kind of
 

4893
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,270
approach it we're kind of
build investing in the core the

4894
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
build investing in the core the
 

4895
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,110
build investing in the core the
technical core

01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:25,120
technical core
 

4897
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,430
technical core
and then there's specialization of and

4898
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
and then there's specialization of and
 

4899
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,390
and then there's specialization of and
uh

4900
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:28,400
uh
 

4901
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,390
uh
of that core technology to different

4902
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:30,400
of that core technology to different
 

4903
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,669
of that core technology to different
product lines to different commercial

applications
 

4907
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,830
applications
so on just to tease it apart a little

4908
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:35,840
so on just to tease it apart a little
 

4909
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,310
so on just to tease it apart a little
bit

4910
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:36,320
bit
 

4911
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,990
bit
uh on trucks so starting with the

4912
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
uh on trucks so starting with the
 

4913
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,990
uh on trucks so starting with the
hardware the configuration of the

4914
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,000
hardware the configuration of the
 

4915
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,629
hardware the configuration of the
sensors

4916
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
sensors
 

4917
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,149
sensors
is different right they're different

4918
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:44,159
is different right they're different
 

4919
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:45,830
is different right they're different
physically geometrically you know

4920
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:45,840
physically geometrically you know
 

4921
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,189
physically geometrically you know
different vehicles

4922
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,199
different vehicles
 

4923
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,350
different vehicles
uh so for example we have two of our

4924
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:49,360
uh so for example we have two of our
 

4925
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,390
uh so for example we have two of our
main laser

4926
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
main laser
 

4927
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,430
main laser
uh on the trucks on both sides so that

4928
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:53,440
uh on the trucks on both sides so that
 

4929
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,629
uh on the trucks on both sides so that
we have you know don't have the blind

4930
01:20:54,629 --> 01:20:54,639
we have you know don't have the blind
 

4931
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:55,350
we have you know don't have the blind
spots

4932
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360

uh whereas on the jlr i-pace we have you

4934
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:58,960
uh whereas on the jlr i-pace we have you
 

4935
01:20:58,960 --> 01:20:59,830
uh whereas on the jlr i-pace we have you
know one of it uh

4936
01:20:59,830 --> 01:20:59,840
know one of it uh
 

4937
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,669
know one of it uh
sitting at the very top but the actual

4938
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:01,679
sitting at the very top but the actual
 

4939
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,310
sitting at the very top but the actual
sensors are uh almost the same

4940
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:04,320
sensors are uh almost the same
 

4941
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,709
sensors are uh almost the same
or largely uh the same so all of the

4942
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:06,719
or largely uh the same so all of the
 

4943
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:07,830
or largely uh the same so all of the
investment

4944
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:07,840
investment
 

4945
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,629

that uh over the years we've put into

4946
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:10,639
that uh over the years we've put into
 

4947
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,310
that uh over the years we've put into
building our custom lighters custom

together
that carries over very nicely uh then

4954
01:21:16,229 --> 01:21:16,239
that carries over very nicely uh then
 

4955
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,669
that carries over very nicely uh then
you know on the perception side

4956
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:17,679
you know on the perception side
 

4957
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,390
you know on the perception side
uh the like the fundamental challenges

4958
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
uh the like the fundamental challenges
 

4959
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:20,870
uh the like the fundamental challenges
of

seeing understanding the world whether
 

4963
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,510
seeing understanding the world whether
it's you know object detection

all that carries over now yes there's

4970
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:28,400
all that carries over now yes there's
 

4971
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,830
all that carries over now yes there's
some specialization when you're driving

4972
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:29,840
some specialization when you're driving
 

4973
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,550
some specialization when you're driving
on freeways

4974
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:30,560
on freeways
 

4975
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,030
on freeways
uh you know range becomes more important

4976
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,040
uh you know range becomes more important
 

4977
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,310
uh you know range becomes more important
the domain is a little bit different

4978
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:34,320
the domain is a little bit different
 

4979
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,629
the domain is a little bit different
but again the fundamentals carry over

4980
01:21:36,629 --> 01:21:36,639
but again the fundamentals carry over
 

4981
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,149
but again the fundamentals carry over
very very nicely

4982
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
very very nicely
 

4983
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:41,030
very very nicely
same and i guess you get into prediction

4984
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,040
same and i guess you get into prediction
 

4985
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:41,990
same and i guess you get into prediction
or decision making

4986
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000

find the long tail to improve your

4996
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
find the long tail to improve your
 

4997
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,390
find the long tail to improve your
system in that long tail

4998
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:52,400
system in that long tail
 

4999
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,790
system in that long tail
of behavior prediction and response that

5000
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:54,800
of behavior prediction and response that
 

5001
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,669
of behavior prediction and response that
carries over right and so on and so on

5002
01:21:57,669 --> 01:21:57,679
carries over right and so on and so on
 

5003
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,189
carries over right and so on and so on
so i mean that's pretty exciting by the

5004
01:21:59,189 --> 01:21:59,199
so i mean that's pretty exciting by the
 

5005
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,910
so i mean that's pretty exciting by the
way does waymovia include

way does waymovia include
using the the smaller vehicles for

5008
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:05,120
using the the smaller vehicles for
 

5009
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,390
using the the smaller vehicles for
transportation goods that's an

5010
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
transportation goods that's an
 

5011
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,510
transportation goods that's an
interesting distinction

5012
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,520
interesting distinction
 

5013
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,189
interesting distinction
so let's say there's three interesting

5014
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:11,199
so let's say there's three interesting
 

5015
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:14,149
so let's say there's three interesting
modes of operation so one is moving

5016
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:14,159
modes of operation so one is moving
 

5017
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,669
modes of operation so one is moving
humans one is moving goods

5018
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:15,679
humans one is moving goods
 

5019
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:18,709
humans one is moving goods
and one is like moving nothing zero

5020
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:18,719
and one is like moving nothing zero

your your empty vehicle i mean it's it's

5028
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:27,199
your your empty vehicle i mean it's it's
 

5029
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,870
your your empty vehicle i mean it's it's
the third is the last wave that's the

5030
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
the third is the last wave that's the
 

5031
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,390
the third is the last wave that's the
entirety of it it's so less you know

5032
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
entirety of it it's so less you know
 

5033
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,990
entirety of it it's so less you know
exciting from the commercial perspective

5034
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
exciting from the commercial perspective
 

5035
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,310
exciting from the commercial perspective
[Laughter]

5036
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:34,320
[Laughter]
 

5037
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,189
[Laughter]
well i mean in terms of like if you

5038
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
well i mean in terms of like if you
 

5039
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,350
well i mean in terms of like if you
think about what's inside a vehicle as

5040
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:39,360
think about what's inside a vehicle as
 

5041
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,070
think about what's inside a vehicle as
it's moving

5042
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
it's moving
 

5043
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,110
it's moving
because it does you know some

5044
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:43,120
because it does you know some
 

5045
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,870
because it does you know some
significant fraction of the vehicle's

5046
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:44,880
significant fraction of the vehicle's
 

5047
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,270
significant fraction of the vehicle's
movement has to be

5048
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:47,280
movement has to be
 

5049
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,990
movement has to be
empty i mean it's kind of fascinating

5050
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,000
empty i mean it's kind of fascinating
 

5051
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,990
empty i mean it's kind of fascinating
maybe just on that small point is

5052
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
maybe just on that small point is
 

5053
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,750
maybe just on that small point is
is there different

5054
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:55,760
is there different
 

5055
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,030
is there different
control and like policies

5056
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,040
control and like policies
 

5057
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,189
control and like policies
that are applied for a zero occupancy

5058
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
that are applied for a zero occupancy
 

5059
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,669
that are applied for a zero occupancy
vehicle so vehicle with nothing in it

5060
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
vehicle so vehicle with nothing in it
 

5061
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,590
vehicle so vehicle with nothing in it
or is it just move as if there is a

5062
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:05,600
or is it just move as if there is a
 

5063
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,669
or is it just move as if there is a
person inside what was

5064
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:07,679
person inside what was
 

5065
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,629
person inside what was
with uh some subtle differences as a

01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,990
first order approximation
there are no differences and if you

5070
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,000
there are no differences and if you
 

5071
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,270
there are no differences and if you
think about

so you know yes there are some second
 

5105
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,229
so you know yes there are some second
order uh things you can do it's gonna

01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:46,239
order uh things you can do it's gonna
 

5107
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:47,510
order uh things you can do it's gonna
change your route

5108

change your route
 

5109
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,910
change your route
and you know optimize maybe kind of your

5110
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:49,920
and you know optimize maybe kind of your
 

5111
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:50,790
and you know optimize maybe kind of your
fleet

fleet
 

5113
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,709
fleet
things at the fleet scale and you would

5114
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:52,719
things at the fleet scale and you would
 

5115
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,390
things at the fleet scale and you would
take into account whether

5116
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:54,400
take into account whether
 

5117
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,910

know other cars
 

5125
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,390
know other cars
are you know driving completely empty

5126
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:04,400
are you know driving completely empty
 

5127
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,149
are you know driving completely empty
you know to that next

5128
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
you know to that next
 

5129
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,510
you know to that next
valuable trip that they're going to

5130
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:07,520
valuable trip that they're going to
 

5131
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,830
valuable trip that they're going to
provide but that those are

provide but that those are
 

5133
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,709
provide but that those are
mostly second order effects okay cool so

5134
01:24:12,709 --> 01:24:12,719

01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:35,920

 

5151
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,149

is that the cartoon pinky in the brain

5152
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
is that the cartoon pinky in the brain
 

5153
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,070
is that the cartoon pinky in the brain
yeah okay

5154
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,080
yeah okay
 

5155
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,790
yeah okay
but you know gradually is a true answer

5156
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:42,800
but you know gradually is a true answer
 

5157
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,990
but you know gradually is a true answer
so i think

5158
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
so i think

01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,149
uh to get this technology to
more places and more people around the

5186
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:14,159
more places and more people around the
 

5187
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:15,910
more places and more people around the
world right

5188
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
world right
 

5189
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,070
world right
so our next

5190
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:20,080
so our next
 

5191
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,110
so our next
big area of focus is

5192
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:23,120
big area of focus is
 

5193
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,669
big area of focus is
exactly that larger scale

5194
01:25:25,669 --> 01:25:25,679
exactly that larger scale
 

5195
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:26,709
exactly that larger scale
commercialization and

5196
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:26,719
commercialization and
 

5197
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:30,070
commercialization and
you know scaling up uh

5198
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,080
you know scaling up uh
 

5199
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,709
you know scaling up uh
if i think about

5200
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:34,719
if i think about
 

5201
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,910
if i think about
you know the main and your phoenix gives

5202
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:37,920
you know the main and your phoenix gives
 

5203
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,550
you know the main and your phoenix gives
us that

5204
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:38,560
us that
 

5205
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,229
us that
platform it gives us that foundation of

5206
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239
platform it gives us that foundation of
 

5207
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:47,030
platform it gives us that foundation of
upon which we can build them and it's

5208
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
upon which we can build them and it's
 

5209
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,070
upon which we can build them and it's
there are few really

5210
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:50,080
there are few really
 

5211
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,750
there are few really
challenging aspects of this whole

5212
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:51,760
challenging aspects of this whole
 

5213
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,149
challenging aspects of this whole
problem that you have to pull together

5214
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:54,159
problem that you have to pull together
 

5215
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:57,270
problem that you have to pull together
in order to build the technology

5216
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,280
in order to build the technology
 

5217
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,709
in order to build the technology
in order to deploy it

5218
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:00,719
in order to deploy it
 

5219
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,910
in order to deploy it
uh into the field to go

5220
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:03,920
uh into the field to go
 

5221
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,189
uh into the field to go
from a driverless car to

5222
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
from a driverless car to
 

5223
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,830
from a driverless car to
a fleet of cars that are providing a

5224
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:09,840
a fleet of cars that are providing a
 

5225

service
 

5227
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,910
service
and then all the way to you know

5228
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:11,920
and then all the way to you know
 

5229
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,669
and then all the way to you know
commercialization so

5230
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
commercialization so
 

5231
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:14,950
commercialization so
uh and then you know this is what we

5232
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:14,960
uh and then you know this is what we
 

5233
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,070
uh and then you know this is what we
have in phoenix we've taken the

5234
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,080
have in phoenix we've taken the
 

5235
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,750
have in phoenix we've taken the
technology from

01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,000
amount from that so now what we're doing
 

5309
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,310
amount from that so now what we're doing
is we are incorporating all those

5310
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,320
is we are incorporating all those
 

5311
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,430
is we are incorporating all those
lessons

5312
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:43,440
lessons
 

5313
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,030
lessons
into some pretty fundamental

on the hardware side and on the software
side

5320
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
side
 

5321
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,629
side
to build a more general more robust

5322
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:52,639
to build a more general more robust

so on the hardware side

5330
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,000
so on the hardware side
 

5331
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,590
so on the hardware side
all of those lessons are now

5332
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:03,600
all of those lessons are now
 

5333

researchers and engineers that you know
 

5449
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,830
researchers and engineers that you know
so you can how do you build all these

5450
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,840
so you can how do you build all these
 

5451
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,229
so you can how do you build all these
you know

so that you know people can focus on
 

5461
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,870
so that you know people can focus on
improving the system and kind of the

5462

01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:03,760
releases
 

5465
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,270
releases
just go out the door and get deployed

5466
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:05,280
just go out the door and get deployed
 

5467
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,350
just go out the door and get deployed
across the fleet so we've gotten really

5468
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:07,360
across the fleet so we've gotten really
 

5469
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,550
across the fleet so we've gotten really
good at that

5470
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:08,560
good at that
 

5471
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,350
good at that
in phoenix that's been a tremendously

5472
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:11,360
in phoenix that's been a tremendously
 

5473
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,870
in phoenix that's been a tremendously
difficult problem

5474
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:12,880
difficult problem
 

5475
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,629
difficult problem
but that's what we have in phoenix right

5476
01:30:14,629 --> 01:30:14,639
but that's what we have in phoenix right
 

5477
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,149
but that's what we have in phoenix right
now that gives us that foundation

5478
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:16,159
now that gives us that foundation
 

5479
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:17,669
now that gives us that foundation
and now we're working on kind of

5480
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:17,679
and now we're working on kind of
 

5481
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,189
and now we're working on kind of
incorporating all the lessons that we've

5482
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:19,199
incorporating all the lessons that we've
 

5483
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:19,750
incorporating all the lessons that we've
learned

5484
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:19,760
learned
 

5485
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,830
learned
to make it more efficient to go to new

5486
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:21,840
to make it more efficient to go to new
 

5487
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,110
to make it more efficient to go to new
places you know scale up and just kind

5488
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:23,120
places you know scale up and just kind
 

5489
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,030
places you know scale up and just kind
of you know stamp things out

5490
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:25,040
of you know stamp things out
 

5491
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,629
of you know stamp things out
so that's that second dimension of

5492
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:26,639
so that's that second dimension of
 

5493
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,709
so that's that second dimension of
evaluation and deployment and the third

5494
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:28,719
evaluation and deployment and the third
 

5495
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:29,430
evaluation and deployment and the third
dimension

01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:54,480
uh and uh we'll continue to iterate on
 

5521
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:54,950
uh and uh we'll continue to iterate on
that and

5522
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:54,960
that and
 

5523
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,350
that and
incorporate all those uh those lessons

5524
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:57,360
incorporate all those uh those lessons
 

5525
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,390
incorporate all those uh those lessons
into

5526
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:58,400
into
 

5527
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,390
into
making our product you know even better

5528
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:00,400
making our product you know even better
 

5529
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,669
making our product you know even better
and more convenient for our users

5530
01:31:01,669 --> 01:31:01,679
and more convenient for our users
 

5531
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,750
and more convenient for our users
so you're converting this whole process

5532
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:03,760
so you're converting this whole process
 

5533
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,709
so you're converting this whole process
of phoenix

5534
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:04,719
of phoenix
 

5535
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:07,350
of phoenix
in phoenix into uh something that could

5536
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:07,360
in phoenix into uh something that could
 

5537
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,350
in phoenix into uh something that could
be copy and pasted elsewhere

5538
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:09,360
be copy and pasted elsewhere
 

5539
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,149
be copy and pasted elsewhere
so like uh perhaps you didn't think of

5540
01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:12,159
so like uh perhaps you didn't think of
 

5541
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,350
so like uh perhaps you didn't think of
it that way when you were doing the

5542
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,360
it that way when you were doing the
 

5543
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,790
it that way when you were doing the
experimentation phoenix but

5544
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:14,800
experimentation phoenix but
 

5545
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,950
experimentation phoenix but
so how long did basically

5546
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:18,960
so how long did basically
 

5547
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,070
so how long did basically
you can correct me but you've i mean

5548
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:22,080
you can correct me but you've i mean
 

5549
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,510
you can correct me but you've i mean
it's still early days but you're taking

5550
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:23,520
it's still early days but you're taking
 

5551
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,550
it's still early days but you're taking
the full journey

5552
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:24,560
the full journey
 

5553
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,750
the full journey
in phoenix right as you were saying

5554
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:27,760
in phoenix right as you were saying
 

5555
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,830
in phoenix right as you were saying
of like what it takes to basically

5556
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:29,840
of like what it takes to basically
 

5557
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,510
of like what it takes to basically
automate i mean it's not the entirety of

5558
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:31,520
automate i mean it's not the entirety of
 

5559
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,310
automate i mean it's not the entirety of
phoenix right

5560
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,320
phoenix right
 

5561
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,669
phoenix right
but i imagine it can encompass

5562
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:35,679
but i imagine it can encompass
 

5563
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:38,870
but i imagine it can encompass
the entirety of phoenix that's some some

5564
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:38,880
the entirety of phoenix that's some some
 

5565
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,350
the entirety of phoenix that's some some
uh near-term date but that's not even

5566
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:41,360
uh near-term date but that's not even
 

5567
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,629
uh near-term date but that's not even
perhaps important like

5568
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:42,639
perhaps important like
 

5569
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:43,750
perhaps important like
as long as it's a large enough

5570
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:43,760
as long as it's a large enough
 

5571
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,750
as long as it's a large enough
geographic area so

5572
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:45,760
geographic area so
 

5573
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:50,629
geographic area so
what how copy-pastable

5574
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
what how copy-pastable
 

5575
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:53,990
what how copy-pastable
is that process currently and

5576
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:54,000
is that process currently and
 

5577
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,189
is that process currently and

problem
 

5843
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,030
problem
is there other stuff that you have to

5844
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
is there other stuff that you have to
 

5845
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,709
is there other stuff that you have to
overcome

5846
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:30,719
overcome
 

5847
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:33,109

when when uh deploying a public service

5848
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:33,119
when when uh deploying a public service
 

5849
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:35,109
when when uh deploying a public service
in a city

5850

in a city
 

5851
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:37,669
in a city
that's interesting it's very important

5852
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:37,679
that's interesting it's very important
 

5853
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:38,790
that's interesting it's very important
so we we

5854
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:38,800
so we we
 

5855
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,109
so we we
put significant effort in uh

5856
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:43,119
put significant effort in uh
 

5857
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:44,709
put significant effort in uh
creating those partnerships and you know

new area you know we always lead with
 

5879
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,669

with a conversation with the local

5880
01:37:09,669 --> 01:37:09,679
with a conversation with the local
 

5881
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:12,070
with a conversation with the local
officials and but the result of that

5882
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:12,080
officials and but the result of that
 

5883
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,669

that investment is that no
 

5885
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,430
that investment is that no
it's not challenges we have to overcome

5886
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:15,440
it's not challenges we have to overcome
 

5887
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,350
it's not challenges we have to overcome
it but it is a very important

5888
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:17,360
it but it is a very important
 

5889
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,830
it but it is a very important
that we continue to have this

5890
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:18,840
that we continue to have this
 

5891
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,870
that we continue to have this
conversation oh yeah

5892
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
conversation oh yeah
 

5893
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,990
conversation oh yeah
i love politicians too okay uh so mr

said that uh lidar is a crutch

5898
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:29,440
said that uh lidar is a crutch
 

5899
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,950
said that uh lidar is a crutch
what are your thoughts

5900
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:32,960

 

5901
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,229

i wouldn't characterize it exactly that

5902
01:37:34,229 --> 01:37:34,239
i wouldn't characterize it exactly that
 

5903
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:36,470
i wouldn't characterize it exactly that
way uh i know i think lighter is

5904
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:36,480
way uh i know i think lighter is
 

5905
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:40,629
way uh i know i think lighter is
very important uh it is a key sensor

5906
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:40,639
very important uh it is a key sensor
 

5907
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,629
very important uh it is a key sensor
uh that you know we use just like other

5908
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
uh that you know we use just like other
 

5909
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,470
uh that you know we use just like other
modalities and as we discussed

5910
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:44,480
modalities and as we discussed
 

5911
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,870
modalities and as we discussed
our cars use cameras uh lidars and

5912
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:46,880
our cars use cameras uh lidars and
 

5913
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,550
our cars use cameras uh lidars and
radars

5914
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:48,560
radars
 

5915
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,709
radars
they are all very important they are

5916
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:52,719
they are all very important they are
 

5917
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,750
they are all very important they are
at the kind of the physical level they

5918
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:55,760
at the kind of the physical level they
 

5919
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,910
at the kind of the physical level they
are very different they have very

5920
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:57,920
are very different they have very
 

5921
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,790
are very different they have very
different you know physical

5922
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:58,800
different you know physical
 

5923
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,310
different you know physical
characteristics

5924
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
characteristics
 

5925
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,310
characteristics
cameras are passive lighters and radars

5926
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,320
cameras are passive lighters and radars
 

5927
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,629
cameras are passive lighters and radars
are active you use different wavelengths

5928
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:04,639
are active you use different wavelengths
 

5929
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,870
are active you use different wavelengths
uh so that means they complement each

5930
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:06,880
uh so that means they complement each
 

5931
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:07,750
uh so that means they complement each
other uh

5932
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:07,760
other uh
 

5933
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,270
other uh
and very nicely and and together

5934
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,280
and very nicely and and together
 

5935
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:16,149
and very nicely and and together
combined they can be used to build a

5936
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:16,159
combined they can be used to build a
 

5937
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:17,990
combined they can be used to build a
much

5938
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:18,000
much
 

5939
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,669
much
safer and much more capable system so

5940
01:38:21,669 --> 01:38:21,679
safer and much more capable system so
 

5941
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:25,030
safer and much more capable system so
you know to me it's more of a question

5942
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,040
you know to me it's more of a question
 

5943
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,030
you know to me it's more of a question
you know why the heck would you handicap

5944
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:27,040
you know why the heck would you handicap
 

5945
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,709
you know why the heck would you handicap
yourself and not use one

5946
01:38:28,709 --> 01:38:28,719
yourself and not use one
 

5947
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:30,709
yourself and not use one
or more of those sensing modalities when

5948
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
or more of those sensing modalities when
 

5949
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,870
or more of those sensing modalities when
they you know undoubtedly just make your

5950
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:32,880
they you know undoubtedly just make your
 

5951
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,830
they you know undoubtedly just make your
system

5952
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:33,840
system
 

5953
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,870
system
uh more capable and safer

5954
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:36,880
uh more capable and safer
 

5955
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,149
uh more capable and safer
now it you know

5956
01:38:40,149 --> 01:38:40,159
now it you know
 

5957
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:44,310
now it you know
what might make sense for one product uh

5958
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:44,320
what might make sense for one product uh
 

5959
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,750
what might make sense for one product uh
or one business might not make sense for

5960
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:47,760
or one business might not make sense for
 

5961
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,470
or one business might not make sense for
another one

5962
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:48,480
another one

so if you're talking about driver assist

5964
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:50,320
so if you're talking about driver assist
 

5965
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,070
so if you're talking about driver assist
technologies you make certain design

5966
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,080
technologies you make certain design
 

5967
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:52,950
technologies you make certain design
decisions and you make certain

5968
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:52,960
decisions and you make certain
 

5969
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:53,590
decisions and you make certain
trade-offs

5970
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:53,600
trade-offs
 

5971
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,030
trade-offs
and you make different ones if you are

5972
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,040
and you make different ones if you are
 

5973
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,910
and you make different ones if you are
you know building a driver uh that deep

uh
 

5985
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,830
uh
that i hear or you know the

5986

that i hear or you know the
 

5987
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,629
that i hear or you know the
counterpoints

5988
01:39:12,629 --> 01:39:12,639
counterpoints
 

5989
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:16,070
counterpoints
that cost and aesthetics

5990
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:16,080
that cost and aesthetics
 

5991
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,109
that cost and aesthetics
and like i i don't find either of those

5992
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:19,119
and like i i don't find either of those
 

5993
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,590
and like i i don't find either of those
honestly very compelling so on the cost

5994
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:21,600
honestly very compelling so on the cost
 

5995
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,310
honestly very compelling so on the cost
side

5996
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:22,320
side
 

5997
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,750
side
there's nothing fundamentally

01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:23,760
there's nothing fundamentally
 

5999
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,070
there's nothing fundamentally
prohibitive about you know the cost of

6000
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:26,080
prohibitive about you know the cost of
 

6001
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,830
prohibitive about you know the cost of
lighters you know radars used to be very

6002
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:27,840
lighters you know radars used to be very
 

6003
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,669
lighters you know radars used to be very
expensive uh before people start you

6004
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:29,679
expensive uh before people start you
 

6005
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:29,990
expensive uh before people start you
know

6006
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,000
know
 

6007
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,070
know
uh before people need certain balances

6008
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:32,080
uh before people need certain balances
 

6009
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,510
uh before people need certain balances
and technology and you started to

6010
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,520
and technology and you started to
 

6011
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,990
and technology and you started to
to manufacture them uh massive scale and

6012
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:36,000
to manufacture them uh massive scale and
 

6013
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,510
to manufacture them uh massive scale and
deploy them in vehicles right

6014
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:37,520
deploy them in vehicles right
 

6015
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,669
deploy them in vehicles right
uh similarly with lighters and this is

6016
01:39:39,669 --> 01:39:39,679
uh similarly with lighters and this is
 

6017
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:41,510
uh similarly with lighters and this is
where the lidars that we have on our

6018
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
where the lidars that we have on our
 

6019
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,270
where the lidars that we have on our
cars especially the fifth generation

6020
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:43,280
cars especially the fifth generation
 

6021
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,390
cars especially the fifth generation
uh you know we've been able to make

6022
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:46,400
uh you know we've been able to make
 

6023
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,149
uh you know we've been able to make
some pretty qualitative discontinuous

6024
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:48,159
some pretty qualitative discontinuous
 

6025
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:49,750
some pretty qualitative discontinuous
jumps in terms of the fundamental

6026
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:49,760
jumps in terms of the fundamental
 

6027
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,590
jumps in terms of the fundamental
technology that allow us to

6028
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:51,600
technology that allow us to
 

6029
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,510
technology that allow us to
manufacture those things at very

6030
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:53,520
manufacture those things at very
 

6031
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:54,790
manufacture those things at very
significant scale

6032
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:54,800
significant scale
 

6033
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,750
significant scale
and add a fraction of the cost of you

6034
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:57,760
and add a fraction of the cost of you
 

6035
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,709
and add a fraction of the cost of you
know both

6036

our previous generation as well as a

6038
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:01,440
our previous generation as well as a
 

6039
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,950
our previous generation as well as a
fraction of the cost of you know what

6040
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:02,960
fraction of the cost of you know what
 

6041
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,990
fraction of the cost of you know what
might be available

6042
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,000
might be available
 

6043
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,830
might be available
on the market you know off the shelf

6044
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:05,840
on the market you know off the shelf
 

6045
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,109
on the market you know off the shelf
right now and you know that improvement

6046
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:07,119
right now and you know that improvement
 

6047
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:09,270
right now and you know that improvement
will continue so i i think you know cost

6048
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:09,280
will continue so i i think you know cost
 

6049
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:09,910
will continue so i i think you know cost
is uh

6050

okay all right so but aesthetics fine

6136
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:37,920
okay all right so but aesthetics fine
 

6137
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,350
okay all right so but aesthetics fine
but there's an underlying like

philosophical question

6140
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:41,520
philosophical question
 

6141
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,910
philosophical question
behind the kind of lighter question is

6142
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:43,920
behind the kind of lighter question is
 

6143
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,270
behind the kind of lighter question is
like how much

6144
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:45,280
like how much
 

6145
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,470
like how much
of the problem can be solved with

6146
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:48,480
of the problem can be solved with
 

6147
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:51,669
of the problem can be solved with
uh computer vision with machine learning

6148
01:41:51,669 --> 01:41:51,679
uh computer vision with machine learning
 

6149
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:55,189
uh computer vision with machine learning
so i think without sort of

6150
01:41:55,189 --> 01:41:55,199
so i think without sort of
 

6151
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:58,470
so i think without sort of
disagreements and so on

6152
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:58,480
disagreements and so on
 

6153
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:01,830
disagreements and so on
it's nice to put uh it on the spectrum

6154
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:01,840
it's nice to put uh it on the spectrum
 

6155
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,350
it's nice to put uh it on the spectrum
because waymo is doing a lot of machine

6156
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:03,360
because waymo is doing a lot of machine
 

6157
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,790
because waymo is doing a lot of machine
learning as well

6158
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:04,800
learning as well
 

6159
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,390
learning as well
it's interesting to think how much of

6160
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:06,400
it's interesting to think how much of
 

6161
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,390
it's interesting to think how much of
driving if we look at five years

6162
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:08,400

i mean that's something that people

6344
01:44:59,350 --> 01:44:59,360
i mean that's something that people
 

6345
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,510
i mean that's something that people
didn't do for a very long time which is

didn't do for a very long time which is
 

6347
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,709
didn't do for a very long time which is
like at the

like at the
 

6349
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:05,189
like at the
sensor fusion level i guess like early

6485
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:57,350
your you know that so i would decouple
the kind of

6486
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:57,360
the kind of
 

6487
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,950
the kind of
sensing and how that information is used

6488
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:58,960
sensing and how that information is used
 

6489
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:01,350
sensing and how that information is used
from the role of ml in the entire stack

6490
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:01,360
from the role of ml in the entire stack
 

6491
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,149
from the role of ml in the entire stack
and you know i guess it's uh i there's

6492
01:47:04,149 --> 01:47:04,159
and you know i guess it's uh i there's
 

6493
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:04,870
and you know i guess it's uh i there's
trade-offs

6494
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:04,880
trade-offs
 

6495
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,950
trade-offs
uh and you know modularity and how do

6496
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:06,960
uh and you know modularity and how do
 

6497
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,030
uh and you know modularity and how do
you inject

6498
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:09,040
you inject
 

6499
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:11,590
you inject
inductive bias into your system right

6500
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:11,600
inductive bias into your system right
 

6501
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,470

this is

6502
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:12,480
this is
 

6503
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,590
this is
uh there's tremendous power in being

6504
01:47:15,590 --> 01:47:15,600
uh there's tremendous power in being
 

6505
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:16,629
uh there's tremendous power in being
able to do that

6506
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:16,639
able to do that
 

6507
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,669

01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,870
right so you want to induce that bias
like how you induce that bias and that

01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:46,550
that's what we do um

and but then the question of like and
 

6667
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,270

that's when you
 

6669
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,750
that's when you

you know or not but if you think about
 

6677
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:55,990
you know or not but if you think about
how other people

6678
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:56,000
how other people
 

6679
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,390
how other people
treat traffic lights we're back to the

6680
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:58,400
treat traffic lights we're back to the
 

6681
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,669
treat traffic lights we're back to the
ml version of that

ml version of that
 

6683
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,030

because you know they're supposed to
 

6685
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,149

6687
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:03,990
stop for a red light but that doesn't
mean they will so then you're back in

for waymo like machine learning is a

6716
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,080
for waymo like machine learning is a
 

6717
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,750
for waymo like machine learning is a
huge part of the stack

6718
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:29,760
huge part of the stack
 

6719
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,189
huge part of the stack
so it's a huge part of like uh not just

6720
01:50:33,189 --> 01:50:33,199
so it's a huge part of like uh not just
 

6721
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:36,229
so it's a huge part of like uh not just
so obviously the the first the level

6722
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:36,239
so obviously the the first the level
 

6723
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:38,790
so obviously the the first the level
zero or whatever you said which is like

6724
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:38,800
zero or whatever you said which is like
 

6725
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,390
zero or whatever you said which is like
just object detection of things that you

6726
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:40,400
just object detection of things that you
 

6727
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,470
just object detection of things that you
know with no that machine learning can

6728
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:42,480
know with no that machine learning can
 

6729
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,070
know with no that machine learning can
do but also starting to

6730
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:44,080
do but also starting to
 

6731
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,310
do but also starting to
to do prediction behavior and so on to

6732
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:46,320
to do prediction behavior and so on to
 

6733
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,270
to do prediction behavior and so on to
model the

6734
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:47,280
model the
 

6735
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,589
model the
what other or the other parties in the

6736
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:49,599
what other or the other parties in the
 

6737
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:51,510
what other or the other parties in the
scene entities in the scene are gonna do

6738
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:51,520
scene entities in the scene are gonna do
 

6739
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,830
scene entities in the scene are gonna do
so machine learning is more and more uh

6740
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:53,840
so machine learning is more and more uh
 

6741
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,189
so machine learning is more and more uh
playing a role in that

6742
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199
playing a role in that
 

6743
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:58,149
playing a role in that
as well of course absolutely i think

6744
01:50:58,149 --> 01:50:58,159
as well of course absolutely i think
 

6745
01:50:58,159 --> 01:50:58,790
as well of course absolutely i think
we've been

6746
01:50:58,790 --> 01:50:58,800
we've been
 

6747
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,270
we've been
and going back to the earliest days like

6748
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:01,280
and going back to the earliest days like
 

6749
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,550
and going back to the earliest days like
you know darpa

6750
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:02,560
you know darpa
 

6751
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,709
you know darpa
even the grand challenge and team was

6752
01:51:04,709 --> 01:51:04,719
even the grand challenge and team was
 

6753
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:06,229
even the grand challenge and team was
leveraging you know machine learning

6754
01:51:06,229 --> 01:51:06,239
leveraging you know machine learning
 

6755
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:08,229
leveraging you know machine learning
i was like pre you know image nut and it

6756
01:51:08,229 --> 01:51:08,239
i was like pre you know image nut and it
 

6757
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:09,669
i was like pre you know image nut and it
was very different type of ml

6758
01:51:09,669 --> 01:51:09,679
was very different type of ml
 

6759
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:11,350
was very different type of ml
but uh and i think actually that was

6760
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:11,360
but uh and i think actually that was
 

6761
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,589
but uh and i think actually that was
before my time but the stanford team

6762
01:51:13,589 --> 01:51:13,599
before my time but the stanford team
 

6763
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:15,270
before my time but the stanford team
on during the grand challenge had a very

6764
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:15,280
on during the grand challenge had a very
 

6765
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,870
on during the grand challenge had a very
interesting machine learned

6766
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:16,880
interesting machine learned
 

6767
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,430
interesting machine learned
system that would you know use lighter

6768
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:19,440
system that would you know use lighter
 

6769
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,550
system that would you know use lighter
and camera

6770
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:20,560
and camera
 

6771
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,270
and camera
when driving in the desert and it we had

6772
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:23,280
when driving in the desert and it we had
 

6773
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,149
when driving in the desert and it we had
built the model

6774
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:24,159
built the model
 

6775
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:27,350
built the model
uh where it would kind of extend the

6776
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:27,360
uh where it would kind of extend the
 

6777
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:27,910
uh where it would kind of extend the
range

6778
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:27,920
range
 

6779
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,830
range
of free space reasoning so we get a

6780
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:29,840
of free space reasoning so we get a
 

6781
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,510
of free space reasoning so we get a
clear signal from lighter

6782
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:31,520
clear signal from lighter
 

6783
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,950
clear signal from lighter
and then it had a model that hey like

6784
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:32,960
and then it had a model that hey like
 

6785
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,229
and then it had a model that hey like
this stuff and camera kind of sort of

6786
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:34,239
this stuff and camera kind of sort of
 

6787
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:35,350
this stuff and camera kind of sort of
looks like this stuff and

6788
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:35,360
looks like this stuff and
 

6789
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,790
looks like this stuff and
lighter and i know this stuff and that

6790
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:36,800
lighter and i know this stuff and that
 

6791
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,149
lighter and i know this stuff and that
i've seen in lighter i'm very confident

6792
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:38,159
i've seen in lighter i'm very confident
 

6793
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,070
i've seen in lighter i'm very confident
there's free space so let me extend that

6794
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,080
there's free space so let me extend that
 

6795
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,870
there's free space so let me extend that
uh free space zone into the camera range

6796
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:42,880
uh free space zone into the camera range
 

6797
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:43,990
uh free space zone into the camera range
that would allow the vehicle to drive

6798
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:44,000
that would allow the vehicle to drive
 

6799
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:44,470
that would allow the vehicle to drive
faster

6800
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:44,480
faster
 

6801
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,589
faster
right and then we've been building on

6802
01:51:45,589 --> 01:51:45,599
right and then we've been building on
 

6803
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:46,950
right and then we've been building on
top of that and kind of staying and

6804
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:46,960
top of that and kind of staying and
 

6805
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,870
top of that and kind of staying and
pushing the state of the art in a ml

6806
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:48,880
pushing the state of the art in a ml
 

6807
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,030
pushing the state of the art in a ml
in all kinds of different ml uh over the

6808
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:51,040
in all kinds of different ml uh over the
 

6809
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,189
in all kinds of different ml uh over the
years and in fact uh from the earlier

6810
01:51:53,189 --> 01:51:53,199
years and in fact uh from the earlier
 

6811
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:55,109
years and in fact uh from the earlier
days i think you know 2010

6812
01:51:55,109 --> 01:51:55,119
days i think you know 2010
 

6813
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:58,310
days i think you know 2010
is probably the year where google

6814
01:51:58,310 --> 01:51:58,320
is probably the year where google
 

6815
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:01,350
is probably the year where google
uh maybe 2011 probably got got pretty

6816
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:01,360
uh maybe 2011 probably got got pretty
 

6817
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,550
uh maybe 2011 probably got got pretty
heavily involved

6818
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:02,560
heavily involved
 

6819
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,189
heavily involved
in uh machine learning uh kind of deep

6820
01:52:05,189 --> 01:52:05,199
in uh machine learning uh kind of deep
 

6821
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:05,910
in uh machine learning uh kind of deep
nuts

6822
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:05,920
nuts
 

6823
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:07,430
nuts
uh and at that time was probably the

6824
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:07,440
uh and at that time was probably the
 

6825
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,109
uh and at that time was probably the
only company that was very heavily

6826
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:09,119
only company that was very heavily
 

6827
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:09,750
only company that was very heavily
investing

6828
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:09,760
investing
 

6829
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,990
investing
in kind of state-of-the-art ml and

6830
01:52:11,990 --> 01:52:12,000
in kind of state-of-the-art ml and
 

6831
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:12,950
in kind of state-of-the-art ml and
self-driving cars

right and they they they go ahead you

6834
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:14,880
right and they they they go ahead you
 

6835

know hand in hand
 

6837
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,149
know hand in hand
and we've been on that journey ever

6838
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:18,159
and we've been on that journey ever
 

6839
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:19,990
and we've been on that journey ever
since we're doing uh pushing

6840
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:20,000
since we're doing uh pushing
 

6841
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,550
since we're doing uh pushing
a lot of these areas uh in terms of

01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:27,920
think about it kind of the the behavior
 

6917
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:29,589
think about it kind of the the behavior
how you know the path the trajectories

they're strongly connected but there's
 

6941
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:49,990
they're strongly connected but there's
also a kind of larger context that

6942
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,000
also a kind of larger context that
 

6943
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,350
also a kind of larger context that
doesn't have that locality and you also

6944

doesn't have that locality and you also
 

6945
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,709
doesn't have that locality and you also
see that in driving right what's

6946
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:52,719
see that in driving right what's
 

6947

another car is driving oh that's that's

6970
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:12,560
another car is driving oh that's that's
 

6971
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,149
another car is driving oh that's that's
all really fascinating like how

6972
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:14,159
all really fascinating like how
 

6973
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:15,589
all really fascinating like how
it's fascinating to think that uh

6974
01:54:15,589 --> 01:54:15,599
it's fascinating to think that uh
 

6975
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:17,270
it's fascinating to think that uh
transformer models and all this

6976
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,280
transformer models and all this
 

6977
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,589
transformer models and all this
all the breakthroughs in language and

6978
01:54:19,589 --> 01:54:19,599
all the breakthroughs in language and
 

6979
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:21,830
all the breakthroughs in language and
nlp that might be applicable to like

6980
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:21,840
nlp that might be applicable to like
 

6981
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,109
nlp that might be applicable to like
driving at the higher level

6982
01:54:23,109 --> 01:54:23,119
driving at the higher level
 

6983
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:24,550
driving at the higher level
at the behavioral level that's kind of

6984
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:24,560
at the behavioral level that's kind of
 

6985
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,189
at the behavioral level that's kind of
fascinating um let me ask about pesky

6986
01:54:27,189 --> 01:54:27,199
fascinating um let me ask about pesky
 

6987
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:28,870
fascinating um let me ask about pesky
little creatures called pedestrians and

6988
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:28,880
little creatures called pedestrians and
 

6989
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,229
little creatures called pedestrians and
cyclists

6990
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:30,239
cyclists
 

6991
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:32,550
cyclists
they seem so humans are a problem if we

6992
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:32,560
they seem so humans are a problem if we
 

6993
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,550
they seem so humans are a problem if we
can get rid of them i would

6994
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:34,560
can get rid of them i would
 

6995
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,870
can get rid of them i would
um but unfortunately they're all sort of

6996
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:36,880
um but unfortunately they're all sort of
 

6997
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,870
um but unfortunately they're all sort of
a source of joy and love and beauty so

6998
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:38,880
a source of joy and love and beauty so
 

6999
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,470
a source of joy and love and beauty so
let's keep them around they're also our

7000
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:40,480
let's keep them around they're also our
 

7001

so they'll drive through school zones
 

7111
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:37,350
so they'll drive through school zones
right

performance across your whole stack
 

7133
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,709
performance across your whole stack
you know starts with hardware and again

7134
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:04,719
you know starts with hardware and again
 

7135
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:05,750
you know starts with hardware and again
you want to use all

7136
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:05,760
you want to use all
 

7137
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,510
you want to use all
sensing modalities available to you

7138
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:07,520
sensing modalities available to you
 

7139
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,589
sensing modalities available to you
imagine driving on a residential road at

7140
01:57:09,589 --> 01:57:09,599
imagine driving on a residential road at
 

7141
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:09,990
imagine driving on a residential road at
night

7142
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,000
night
 

7143
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,070
night
and kind of making a turn and you don't

7144
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:12,080
and kind of making a turn and you don't
 

7145
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,669
and kind of making a turn and you don't
have you know headlights covering some

7146
01:57:13,669 --> 01:57:13,679
have you know headlights covering some
 

7147
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:15,750
have you know headlights covering some
part of the space and like you know

7148
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:15,760
part of the space and like you know
 

7149
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,510
part of the space and like you know
a kid might run out and you know

7150
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,520
a kid might run out and you know
 

7151
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,830
a kid might run out and you know
lighters are amazing at that

7152
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:19,840
lighters are amazing at that
 

7153
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:22,310
lighters are amazing at that
they see just as well in complete

7154
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:22,320
they see just as well in complete
 

7155
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:23,990
they see just as well in complete
darkness as they do during the day right

7156
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,000
darkness as they do during the day right
 

7157
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,629
darkness as they do during the day right
so just again it gives you that extra

7158
01:57:26,629 --> 01:57:26,639
so just again it gives you that extra
 

7159
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:30,390
so just again it gives you that extra
uh uh you know margin

7160
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:30,400
uh uh you know margin
 

7161
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,669
uh uh you know margin
in terms of your capability and

7162
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:31,679
in terms of your capability and
 

7163
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:33,510
in terms of your capability and
performance and safety and quality

7164
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:33,520
performance and safety and quality
 

7165
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:35,430
performance and safety and quality
and in fact we oftentimes uh in these

7166
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:35,440
and in fact we oftentimes uh in these
 

7167
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,270
and in fact we oftentimes uh in these
kinds of situations we have our system

7168
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:37,280
kinds of situations we have our system
 

7169
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:37,750
kinds of situations we have our system
detect

7170
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:37,760
detect
 

7171
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:39,750
detect
something in some cases even earlier

7172
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:39,760
something in some cases even earlier
 

7173
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,270
something in some cases even earlier
than our trained operators

7174
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:41,280
than our trained operators
 

7175
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,430
than our trained operators
in the car might do especially in

7176
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:43,440
in the car might do especially in
 

7177
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,629
in the car might do especially in
conditions like you know

7178
01:57:44,629 --> 01:57:44,639
conditions like you know
 

7179
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:47,510
conditions like you know
very dark nights um so starts with

7180
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520
very dark nights um so starts with
 

7181
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:48,149
very dark nights um so starts with
sensing

7182
01:57:48,149 --> 01:57:48,159
sensing
 

7183
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:51,270
sensing
then you know perception has to be

7184
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:51,280
then you know perception has to be
 

7185
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,589
then you know perception has to be
incredibly good and you have to be very

7186
01:57:53,589 --> 01:57:53,599
incredibly good and you have to be very
 

7187
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:54,709
incredibly good and you have to be very
very good at

01:57:54,709 --> 01:57:54,719
very good at
 

7189
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,990
very good at
kind of detecting uh pedestrians

7190
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:58,000
kind of detecting uh pedestrians
 

7191
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,550
kind of detecting uh pedestrians
uh in all kinds of situations and all

7192
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:00,560
uh in all kinds of situations and all
 

7193
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,149
uh in all kinds of situations and all
kinds of environments including

7194
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:02,159
kinds of environments including
 

7195
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,149
kinds of environments including
people in weird poses uh people kind of

7196
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:04,159
people in weird poses uh people kind of
 

7197
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:05,990
people in weird poses uh people kind of
running around

7198
01:58:05,990 --> 01:58:06,000
running around
 

7199
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,830
running around
and you know being partially occluded um

7200
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:09,840
and you know being partially occluded um
 

7201
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,189
and you know being partially occluded um
so you know that that's stop number one

7202
01:58:13,189 --> 01:58:13,199
so you know that that's stop number one
 

7203
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:16,229
so you know that that's stop number one
then you have to have in

7204
01:58:16,229 --> 01:58:16,239
then you have to have in
 

7205
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:18,950
then you have to have in
very high accuracy and very low latency

7206
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:18,960
very high accuracy and very low latency
 

7207
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:21,189
very high accuracy and very low latency
in terms of your reactions

7208
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:21,199
in terms of your reactions
 

7209
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:24,390
in terms of your reactions
to you know what you know these uh

7210
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:24,400
to you know what you know these uh
 

7211
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:27,430
to you know what you know these uh
actors might do right and we've put a

7212
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:27,440
actors might do right and we've put a
 

7213
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:28,870
actors might do right and we've put a
tremendous amount of engineering and

7214
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:28,880
tremendous amount of engineering and
 

7215
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,709
tremendous amount of engineering and
tremendous amount of validation in to

7216
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:30,719
tremendous amount of validation in to
 

7217
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,550
tremendous amount of validation in to
make sure our system performs

7218
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:32,560
make sure our system performs
 

7219
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:35,189
make sure our system performs
uh and you know oftentimes it does

7220
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:35,199
uh and you know oftentimes it does
 

7221
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:36,709
uh and you know oftentimes it does
require a very strong reaction

7222
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:36,719
require a very strong reaction
 

7223
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,470
require a very strong reaction
to do the same thing and we actually see

7224
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:38,480
to do the same thing and we actually see
 

7225
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,070
to do the same thing and we actually see
a lot of cases like that that's the long

7226
01:58:40,070 --> 01:58:40,080
a lot of cases like that that's the long
 

7227
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:40,870
a lot of cases like that that's the long
tail of really

7228
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:40,880
tail of really
 

7229
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:44,229
tail of really
rare you know really uh kind of crazy

7230
01:58:44,229 --> 01:58:44,239
rare you know really uh kind of crazy
 

7231
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:45,430
rare you know really uh kind of crazy
events

7232
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:45,440
events
 

7233
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:48,550
events
that contribute to the safety

7234
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:48,560
that contribute to the safety
 

7235
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:50,229
that contribute to the safety
around pedestrians like one one example

7236
01:58:50,229 --> 01:58:50,239
around pedestrians like one one example
 

7237
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,229
around pedestrians like one one example
that comes to mind that we actually

7238
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:52,239
that comes to mind that we actually
 

7239
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:55,510
that comes to mind that we actually
happened uh in phoenix where we were uh

7240
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:55,520
happened uh in phoenix where we were uh
 

7241
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:58,790
happened uh in phoenix where we were uh
driving uh along and i think it was a 45

7242
01:58:58,790 --> 01:58:58,800
driving uh along and i think it was a 45
 

7243
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,310
driving uh along and i think it was a 45
mile per hour road so in pretty high

7244
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:00,320
mile per hour road so in pretty high
 

7245
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:01,109
mile per hour road so in pretty high
speed traffic

7246
01:59:01,109 --> 01:59:01,119
speed traffic
 

7247
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:03,430
speed traffic
and there was a sidewalk next to it and

7248
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:03,440
and there was a sidewalk next to it and
 

7249
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,310
and there was a sidewalk next to it and
there was a cyclist

7250
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:04,320
there was a cyclist
 

7251
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:07,510
there was a cyclist
on the sidewalk and as

7252
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:07,520
on the sidewalk and as
 

7253
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,270
on the sidewalk and as
uh we were in the right lane and right

7254
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:09,280
uh we were in the right lane and right
 

7255
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,870
uh we were in the right lane and right
next to the site so it was a multi-lane

7256
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:10,880
next to the site so it was a multi-lane
 

7257
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:11,589
next to the site so it was a multi-lane
road

7258
01:59:11,589 --> 01:59:11,599
road
 

7259
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:14,310
road
so as we got close to the cyclist on the

7260
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:14,320
so as we got close to the cyclist on the
 

7261
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:15,109
so as we got close to the cyclist on the
sidewalk

7262
01:59:15,109 --> 01:59:15,119
sidewalk
 

7263
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:16,629
sidewalk
uh it was a woman and she tripped and

7264
01:59:16,629 --> 01:59:16,639
uh it was a woman and she tripped and
 

7265
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:18,550
uh it was a woman and she tripped and
fell just you know fell right into the

7266
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:18,560
fell just you know fell right into the
 

7267
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:19,750
fell just you know fell right into the
path of our vehicle

7268
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:19,760
path of our vehicle
 

7269
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:23,350
path of our vehicle
right um and our you know cart

7270
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:23,360
right um and our you know cart
 

7271
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,750
right um and our you know cart
uh uh you know this was actually with a

7272
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:25,760
uh uh you know this was actually with a
 

7273
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,510
uh uh you know this was actually with a
test driver our test drivers uh

7274
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:27,520
test driver our test drivers uh
 

7275
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:30,070
test driver our test drivers uh
uh did exactly the right thing uh they

7276
01:59:30,070 --> 01:59:30,080
uh did exactly the right thing uh they
 

7277
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,589
uh did exactly the right thing uh they
kind of reacted and came to stop it

7278
01:59:31,589 --> 01:59:31,599
kind of reacted and came to stop it
 

7279
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,109
kind of reacted and came to stop it
requires both very strong steering

7280
01:59:33,109 --> 01:59:33,119
requires both very strong steering
 

7281
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:34,870
requires both very strong steering
and uh you know strong application of

7282
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:34,880
and uh you know strong application of
 

7283
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,870
and uh you know strong application of
the brake uh and then we simulated what

7284
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:36,880
the brake uh and then we simulated what
 

7285
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:37,990
the brake uh and then we simulated what
our system would have done in that

7286
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:38,000
our system would have done in that
 

7287
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,189
our system would have done in that
situation and it did

7288
01:59:39,189 --> 01:59:39,199
situation and it did
 

7289
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:41,910
situation and it did
exactly the same thing it uh and that

7290
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:41,920
exactly the same thing it uh and that
 

7291
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,870
exactly the same thing it uh and that
that speaks to

7292
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:42,880
that speaks to
 

7293
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:45,030
that speaks to
all of those components of really good

7294
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,040
all of those components of really good
 

7295
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,030
all of those components of really good
uh state estimation and tracking

7296
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:47,040
uh state estimation and tracking
 

7297
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:49,270
uh state estimation and tracking
and like imagine you know a person on a

7298
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:49,280
and like imagine you know a person on a
 

7299
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:50,790
and like imagine you know a person on a
bike and they're falling over

7300
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:50,800
bike and they're falling over
 

7301
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:51,990
bike and they're falling over
and they're doing that right in front of

7302
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:52,000
and they're doing that right in front of
 

7303
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:52,950
and they're doing that right in front of
you right so you have to be real like

7304
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:52,960
you right so you have to be real like
 

7305
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,229
you right so you have to be real like
things are changing the appearance of

7306
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:54,239
things are changing the appearance of
 

7307
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:55,030
things are changing the appearance of
that whole

7308
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,040
that whole
 

7309
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,390
that whole
thing is changing right and the person

7310
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:56,400
thing is changing right and the person
 

7311
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,149
thing is changing right and the person
goes one way they're falling on the road

7312
01:59:58,149 --> 01:59:58,159
goes one way they're falling on the road
 

7313
01:59:58,159 --> 01:59:58,950
goes one way they're falling on the road
they're you know

7314
01:59:58,950 --> 01:59:58,960
they're you know
 

7315
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,629
they're you know
being flat on the ground in front of you

7316
02:00:00,629 --> 02:00:00,639
being flat on the ground in front of you
 

7317
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:02,149
being flat on the ground in front of you
you know the the bike goes flying the

7318
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,159
you know the the bike goes flying the
 

7319
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:02,629
you know the the bike goes flying the
other

7320
02:00:02,629 --> 02:00:02,639
other
 

7321
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:04,390
other
direction like the two objects that used

7322
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:04,400
direction like the two objects that used
 

7323
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,750
direction like the two objects that used
to be one they're now you know

7324
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
to be one they're now you know
 

7325
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:07,430
to be one they're now you know
uh are splitting apart and the car has

7326
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:07,440
uh are splitting apart and the car has
 

7327
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,109
uh are splitting apart and the car has
to like detect all of that uh like

7328
02:00:09,109 --> 02:00:09,119
to like detect all of that uh like
 

7329
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,310
to like detect all of that uh like
milliseconds matter

7330
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:10,320
milliseconds matter
 

7331
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,390
milliseconds matter
and it doesn't it's not good enough to

7332
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:12,400
and it doesn't it's not good enough to
 

7333
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,830
and it doesn't it's not good enough to
just break you have to like steer

7334
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:13,840
just break you have to like steer
 

7335
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,589
just break you have to like steer
and break and there's traffic around you

7336
02:00:15,589 --> 02:00:15,599
and break and there's traffic around you
 

7337
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:17,589
and break and there's traffic around you
so like it all has to come together

7338
02:00:17,589 --> 02:00:17,599
so like it all has to come together
 

7339
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:19,589
so like it all has to come together
and it was really great uh to see in

7340
02:00:19,589 --> 02:00:19,599
and it was really great uh to see in
 

7341
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:21,109
and it was really great uh to see in
this case and other cases like that

7342
02:00:21,109 --> 02:00:21,119
this case and other cases like that
 

7343
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:22,629
this case and other cases like that
that we're actually seeing in the wild

7344
02:00:22,629 --> 02:00:22,639
that we're actually seeing in the wild
 

7345
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:25,109
that we're actually seeing in the wild
that our system is you know performing

7346
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:25,119
that our system is you know performing
 

7347
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:27,510
that our system is you know performing
exactly the way uh that we would have

7348
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:27,520
exactly the way uh that we would have
 

7349
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,669
exactly the way uh that we would have
liked and is able to you know avoid

7350
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:29,679
liked and is able to you know avoid
 

7351
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:31,589
liked and is able to you know avoid
uh collisions like this such an exciting

7352
02:00:31,589 --> 02:00:31,599
uh collisions like this such an exciting
 

7353
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:32,790
uh collisions like this such an exciting
space for robotics

7354
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:32,800
space for robotics
 

7355
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,589
space for robotics
like in that split second to make

7356
02:00:35,589 --> 02:00:35,599
like in that split second to make
 

7357
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:37,510
like in that split second to make
decisions of life and death

7358
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:37,520
decisions of life and death
 

7359
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,589
decisions of life and death
i don't know if the stakes are high in

7360
02:00:39,589 --> 02:00:39,599
i don't know if the stakes are high in
 

7361
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,589
i don't know if the stakes are high in
the sense but it's also beautiful

7362
02:00:41,589 --> 02:00:41,599
the sense but it's also beautiful
 

7363
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:44,550
the sense but it's also beautiful
that um um for somebody who loves

7364
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,560
that um um for somebody who loves
 

7365
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:45,589
that um um for somebody who loves
artificial intelligence

7366
02:00:45,589 --> 02:00:45,599
artificial intelligence
 

7367
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:47,510
artificial intelligence
the possibility that an ai system might

7368
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:47,520
the possibility that an ai system might
 

7369
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:49,990
the possibility that an ai system might
be able to save a human life

7370
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:50,000
be able to save a human life
 

7371
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,470
be able to save a human life
that's kind of exciting as a as a

7372
02:00:52,470 --> 02:00:52,480
that's kind of exciting as a as a
 

7373
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,750
that's kind of exciting as a as a
problem like to wake up

7374
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:53,760
problem like to wake up
 

7375
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,270
problem like to wake up
you get it's terrifying probably from

7376
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:55,280
you get it's terrifying probably from
 

7377
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,430
you get it's terrifying probably from
energy for an engineer to wake up

7378
02:00:57,430 --> 02:00:57,440
energy for an engineer to wake up
 

7379
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,430
energy for an engineer to wake up
and to think about but it's also

7380
02:00:59,430 --> 02:00:59,440
and to think about but it's also
 

7381
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,030
and to think about but it's also
exciting because it's like

7382
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:01,040
exciting because it's like
 

7383
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:03,350
exciting because it's like
it's it's in your hands let me try to

7384
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:03,360
it's it's in your hands let me try to
 

7385
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,109
it's it's in your hands let me try to
ask a question that's often brought up

7386
02:01:05,109 --> 02:01:05,119
ask a question that's often brought up
 

7387
02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:07,430
ask a question that's often brought up
about autonomous vehicles

7388
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:07,440
about autonomous vehicles
 

7389
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,430
about autonomous vehicles
and it might be fun to see if you have

7390
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:09,440
and it might be fun to see if you have
 

7391
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,430
and it might be fun to see if you have
anything anything interesting to say

7392
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:11,440
anything anything interesting to say
 

7393
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:14,629
anything anything interesting to say
which is about the trolley problem

7394
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
which is about the trolley problem
 

7395
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:17,589
which is about the trolley problem
so uh a trolley problem is a interesting

7396
02:01:17,589 --> 02:01:17,599
so uh a trolley problem is a interesting
 

7397
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:19,270
so uh a trolley problem is a interesting
philosophical construct

7398
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:19,280
philosophical construct
 

7399
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:22,390
philosophical construct
of uh that highlights and there's many

7400
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:22,400
of uh that highlights and there's many
 

7401
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,270
of uh that highlights and there's many
others like it

7402
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:23,280
others like it
 

7403
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:26,310
others like it
of the difficult ethical decisions that

7404
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:26,320
of the difficult ethical decisions that
 

7405
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:28,709
of the difficult ethical decisions that
uh we humans

7406
02:01:28,709 --> 02:01:28,719
uh we humans
 

7407
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:31,189
uh we humans
have before us in this complicated world

02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:31,199
have before us in this complicated world
 

7409
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:31,990
have before us in this complicated world
uh so

7410
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:32,000
uh so
 

7411
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,270
uh so
the specifically is the choice between

7412
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:35,280
the specifically is the choice between
 

7413
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:39,030
the specifically is the choice between
if you were forced to choose uh to kill

7414
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:39,040
if you were forced to choose uh to kill
 

7415
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:41,750
if you were forced to choose uh to kill
a group x of people versus a good why of

02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:41,760
a group x of people versus a good why of
 

7417
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:42,709
a group x of people versus a good why of
people like

7418
02:01:42,709 --> 02:01:42,719
people like
 

7419
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:44,870
people like
one person if you didn't if you did

7420
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:44,880
one person if you didn't if you did
 

7421
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,229
one person if you didn't if you did
nothing you would kill one person but if

7422
02:01:48,229 --> 02:01:48,239
nothing you would kill one person but if
 

7423
02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:49,990
nothing you would kill one person but if
you would kill five people and if you

7424
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
you would kill five people and if you
 

7425
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,350
you would kill five people and if you
decide to swerve out of the way you

7426
02:01:51,350 --> 02:01:51,360
decide to swerve out of the way you
 

7427
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,030
decide to swerve out of the way you
would only kill one person

7428
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,040
would only kill one person
 

7429
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,189
would only kill one person
do you do nothing or you choose to do

7430
02:01:55,189 --> 02:01:55,199
do you do nothing or you choose to do
 

7431
02:01:55,199 --> 02:01:56,950
do you do nothing or you choose to do
something you can construct all kinds of

sort of
ethical experiments of this kind that

7436
02:02:01,669 --> 02:02:01,679
ethical experiments of this kind that
 

7437
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:05,430
ethical experiments of this kind that
um i i think at least on a positive note

7438
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:05,440
um i i think at least on a positive note
 

7439
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,669
um i i think at least on a positive note
inspire you to think about like

introspect
 

7443
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:13,270
introspect
what are the the physics

7444
02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:13,280
what are the the physics
 

7445
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:16,149
what are the the physics
of our morality and there's usually not

7446
02:02:16,149 --> 02:02:16,159
of our morality and there's usually not
 

7447
02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:16,709
of our morality and there's usually not
good

7448
02:02:16,709 --> 02:02:16,719
good
 

7449
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:19,510
good
answers there i think it people love it

7450
02:02:19,510 --> 02:02:19,520
answers there i think it people love it
 

7451
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,709
answers there i think it people love it

02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:23,270
because it's just an exciting
thing to think about i think people who

7454
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:23,280
thing to think about i think people who
 

7455
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:25,109
thing to think about i think people who
build autonomous vehicles usually roll

7456
02:02:25,109 --> 02:02:25,119
build autonomous vehicles usually roll
 

7457
02:02:25,119 --> 02:02:27,109
build autonomous vehicles usually roll
their eyes

7458
02:02:27,109 --> 02:02:27,119
their eyes
 

7459
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:30,629
their eyes
because uh this is not this

7460
02:02:30,629 --> 02:02:30,639
because uh this is not this
 

7461
02:02:30,639 --> 02:02:32,870
because uh this is not this
one as constructed this like literally

7462
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:32,880
one as constructed this like literally
 

7463
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,070
one as constructed this like literally
never comes up

7464
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:34,080
never comes up
 

7465
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,910
never comes up
in reality you never have to choose

7466
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:35,920
in reality you never have to choose
 

7467
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,229
in reality you never have to choose
between killing

7468
02:02:38,229 --> 02:02:38,239
between killing
 

7469
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:41,589
between killing
one like one of two groups of people

7470
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
one like one of two groups of people
 

7471
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:45,270
one like one of two groups of people
but i wonder if you can speak to

7472
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:45,280
but i wonder if you can speak to
 

7473
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:48,709
but i wonder if you can speak to
is there some something interesting

7474
02:02:48,709 --> 02:02:48,719
is there some something interesting
 

7475
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:50,790
is there some something interesting
to use an engineer of autonomous

7476
02:02:50,790 --> 02:02:50,800
to use an engineer of autonomous
 

7477
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,550
to use an engineer of autonomous
vehicles that's within the trolley

7478
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:52,560
vehicles that's within the trolley
 

7479
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:53,350
vehicles that's within the trolley
problem

7480
02:02:53,350 --> 02:02:53,360
problem
 

7481
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:55,669
problem
or maybe more generally are there

7482
02:02:55,669 --> 02:02:55,679
or maybe more generally are there
 

7483
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:56,390
or maybe more generally are there
difficult

7484
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:56,400
difficult
 

7485
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,510
difficult
ethical decisions that you find that the

7486
02:02:59,510 --> 02:02:59,520
ethical decisions that you find that the
 

7487
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,550
ethical decisions that you find that the
algorithm must make on the specific

7488
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:02,560
algorithm must make on the specific
 

7489
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,589
algorithm must make on the specific
version of the trial problem which one

7490
02:03:03,589 --> 02:03:03,599
version of the trial problem which one
 

7491
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:05,109
version of the trial problem which one
would you do

7492
02:03:05,109 --> 02:03:05,119
would you do
 

7493
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:07,990
would you do
if you're driving the question itself is

7494
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:08,000
if you're driving the question itself is
 

7495
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:08,950
if you're driving the question itself is
a profound

7496
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:08,960
a profound
 

7497
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:11,270
a profound
question because we humans ourselves

7498
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:11,280
question because we humans ourselves
 

7499
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,189
question because we humans ourselves
cannot answer and that's the very

7500
02:03:13,189 --> 02:03:13,199
cannot answer and that's the very
 

7501
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:16,950
cannot answer and that's the very
point uh i guess i would kill both

7502
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:16,960
point uh i guess i would kill both
 

7503
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:20,070
point uh i guess i would kill both
um yeah humans i think you're exactly

7504
02:03:20,070 --> 02:03:20,080
um yeah humans i think you're exactly
 

7505
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:21,270
um yeah humans i think you're exactly
right and that you know humans are not

7506
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:21,280
right and that you know humans are not
 

7507
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:22,070
right and that you know humans are not
particularly good

7508
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:22,080
particularly good
 

7509
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,430
particularly good
i think they kind of phrased as a like

7510
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:23,440
i think they kind of phrased as a like
 

7511
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,109
i think they kind of phrased as a like
what would a computer do but like

7512
02:03:25,109 --> 02:03:25,119
what would a computer do but like
 

7513
02:03:25,119 --> 02:03:27,430
what would a computer do but like
humans you know are not very good and i

7514
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:27,440
humans you know are not very good and i
 

7515
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,470
humans you know are not very good and i
actually often times

7516
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:28,480
actually often times
 

7517
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:30,950
actually often times
i think that you know freezing and kind

7518
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:30,960
i think that you know freezing and kind
 

7519
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,550
i think that you know freezing and kind
of not doing anything because

7520
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:32,560
of not doing anything because
 

7521
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:33,830
of not doing anything because
like you've taken a few extra

7522
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:33,840
like you've taken a few extra
 

7523
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,510
like you've taken a few extra
milliseconds to just process and then

7524
02:03:35,510 --> 02:03:35,520
milliseconds to just process and then
 

7525
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:36,070
milliseconds to just process and then
you end up

7526
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:36,080
you end up
 

7527
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:37,589
you end up
like doing the worst of the possible

7528
02:03:37,589 --> 02:03:37,599
like doing the worst of the possible
 

7529
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:39,109
like doing the worst of the possible
outcomes right so um i

7530
02:03:39,109 --> 02:03:39,119
outcomes right so um i
 

7531
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:41,430
outcomes right so um i
i do think that as you've pointed out it

7532
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:41,440
i do think that as you've pointed out it
 

7533
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,229
i do think that as you've pointed out it
can be

7534
02:03:42,229 --> 02:03:42,239
can be
 

7535
02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:44,070
can be
a bit of a distraction and it can be a

7536
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:44,080
a bit of a distraction and it can be a
 

7537
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,669
a bit of a distraction and it can be a
bit of a kind of red herring i think

7538
02:03:45,669 --> 02:03:45,679
bit of a kind of red herring i think
 

7539
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:46,870
bit of a kind of red herring i think
it's an interesting philosophy

7540
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:46,880
it's an interesting philosophy
 

7541
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:49,910
it's an interesting philosophy
discussion in the realm of uh philosophy

7542
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:49,920
discussion in the realm of uh philosophy
 

7543
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:52,390
discussion in the realm of uh philosophy
um right but in terms of what you know

7544
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:52,400
um right but in terms of what you know
 

7545
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,229
um right but in terms of what you know
how that affects the

7546
02:03:54,229 --> 02:03:54,239
how that affects the
 

7547
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:56,470
how that affects the
actual engineering and deployment of

7548
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:56,480
actual engineering and deployment of
 

7549
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,669
actual engineering and deployment of
self-driving vehicles

7550
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
self-driving vehicles
 

7551
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:01,669
self-driving vehicles
i um it's not how you go about building

7552
02:04:01,669 --> 02:04:01,679
i um it's not how you go about building
 

7553
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:03,189
i um it's not how you go about building
a system right we have talked about how

7554
02:04:03,189 --> 02:04:03,199
a system right we have talked about how
 

7555
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:04,470
a system right we have talked about how
you engineer a system

7556
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:04,480
you engineer a system
 

7557
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,629
you engineer a system
how you go about evaluating the

7558
02:04:06,629 --> 02:04:06,639
how you go about evaluating the
 

7559
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:07,510
how you go about evaluating the
different components

7560
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:07,520
different components
 

7561
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,270
different components
and you know the safety of the entire

7562
02:04:09,270 --> 02:04:09,280
and you know the safety of the entire
 

7563
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,910
and you know the safety of the entire
thing how do you kind of inject

7564
02:04:11,910 --> 02:04:11,920
thing how do you kind of inject
 

7565
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:15,109
thing how do you kind of inject
the you know various model based safety

7566
02:04:15,109 --> 02:04:15,119
the you know various model based safety
 

7567
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:16,709
the you know various model based safety
based arguments and you're like yes you

7568
02:04:16,709 --> 02:04:16,719
based arguments and you're like yes you
 

7569
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:18,149
based arguments and you're like yes you
reason it parts the system

7570
02:04:18,149 --> 02:04:18,159
reason it parts the system
 

7571
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:20,550
reason it parts the system
you know you reason about the

7572
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:20,560
you know you reason about the
 

7573
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:22,390
you know you reason about the
probability of a collision the severity

7574
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:22,400
probability of a collision the severity
 

7575
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,149
probability of a collision the severity
of that collision right

7576
02:04:24,149 --> 02:04:24,159
of that collision right
 

7577
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:26,229
of that collision right
and that is incorporated and there's you

7578
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:26,239
and that is incorporated and there's you
 

7579
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:27,510
and that is incorporated and there's you
know you have to properly reason about

7580
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:27,520
know you have to properly reason about
 

7581
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,709
know you have to properly reason about
uncertainty that flows through the

7582
02:04:28,709 --> 02:04:28,719
uncertainty that flows through the
 

7583
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:29,510
uncertainty that flows through the
system right so

7584
02:04:29,510 --> 02:04:29,520
system right so
 

7585
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:32,629
system right so
you know those uh um you know

7586
02:04:32,629 --> 02:04:32,639
you know those uh um you know
 

7587
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:34,470
you know those uh um you know
factors definitely play a role in how

7588
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:34,480
factors definitely play a role in how
 

7589
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,229
factors definitely play a role in how
the cars don't behave but they have to

7590
02:04:36,229 --> 02:04:36,239
the cars don't behave but they have to
 

7591
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:36,709
the cars don't behave but they have to
be more

7592
02:04:36,709 --> 02:04:36,719
be more
 

7593
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:38,390
be more
of like the immersion behavior and what

7594
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:38,400
of like the immersion behavior and what
 

7595
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,750
of like the immersion behavior and what
you see like you're absolutely right

7596
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:39,760
you see like you're absolutely right
 

7597
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:40,629
you see like you're absolutely right
that these you know

7598
02:04:40,629 --> 02:04:40,639
that these you know
 

7599
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:43,589
that these you know
clear uh theoretical problems that they

7600
02:04:43,589 --> 02:04:43,599
clear uh theoretical problems that they
 

7601
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:45,270
clear uh theoretical problems that they
you know you you don't require that

7602
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:45,280
you know you you don't require that
 

7603
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,189
you know you you don't require that
in system and really kind of being back

7604
02:04:47,189 --> 02:04:47,199
in system and really kind of being back
 

7605
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:48,790
in system and really kind of being back
to our previous discussion of like what

7606
02:04:48,790 --> 02:04:48,800
to our previous discussion of like what
 

7607
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:49,430
to our previous discussion of like what
what you know what

7608
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:49,440
what you know what
 

7609
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,270
what you know what
what you know which one do you choose

7610
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:51,280
what you know which one do you choose
 

7611
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,629
what you know which one do you choose
well you know oftentimes

7612
02:04:52,629 --> 02:04:52,639
well you know oftentimes
 

7613
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:55,750
well you know oftentimes
like you made a mistake earlier like you

7614
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:55,760
like you made a mistake earlier like you
 

7615
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,030
like you made a mistake earlier like you
shouldn't be in that situation

7616
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:57,040
shouldn't be in that situation
 

7617
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,030
shouldn't be in that situation
uh in the first place right and in

7618
02:04:59,030 --> 02:04:59,040
uh in the first place right and in
 

7619
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,629
uh in the first place right and in
reality the system comes up

7620
02:05:00,629 --> 02:05:00,639
reality the system comes up
 

7621
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:02,550
reality the system comes up
if you build a very good safe and

7622
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:02,560
if you build a very good safe and
 

7623
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:03,750
if you build a very good safe and
capable driver

7624
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:03,760
capable driver
 

7625
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,709
capable driver
you have enough uh you know clues uh in

7626
02:05:06,709 --> 02:05:06,719
you have enough uh you know clues uh in
 

7627
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:07,750
you have enough uh you know clues uh in
the environment that

7628
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:07,760
the environment that
 

7629
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,830
the environment that
you drive defensively so you don't put

7630
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:09,840
you drive defensively so you don't put
 

7631
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,189
you drive defensively so you don't put
yourself in that situation right

7632
02:05:11,189 --> 02:05:11,199
yourself in that situation right
 

7633
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:12,709
yourself in that situation right
and again you know it has you know this

7634
02:05:12,709 --> 02:05:12,719
and again you know it has you know this
 

7635
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:14,149
and again you know it has you know this
if you go back to that analogy of you

7636
02:05:14,149 --> 02:05:14,159
if you go back to that analogy of you
 

7637
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:15,510
if you go back to that analogy of you
know precision and recall like okay you

7638
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:15,520
know precision and recall like okay you
 

7639
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,149
know precision and recall like okay you
can make a

7640
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:16,159
can make a
 

7641
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:17,910
can make a
very hard trade-off of the i1 but like

7642
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:17,920
very hard trade-off of the i1 but like
 

7643
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:19,510
very hard trade-off of the i1 but like
neither answer is really good

7644
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:19,520
neither answer is really good
 

7645
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:21,910
neither answer is really good
but what instead you focus on is kind of

7646
02:05:21,910 --> 02:05:21,920
but what instead you focus on is kind of
 

7647
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,830
but what instead you focus on is kind of
moving the whole curve up

7648
02:05:23,830 --> 02:05:23,840
moving the whole curve up
 

7649
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,350
moving the whole curve up
and then you focus on building the right

7650
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:25,360
and then you focus on building the right
 

7651
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:26,950
and then you focus on building the right
capability and the right defensive

7652
02:05:26,950 --> 02:05:26,960
capability and the right defensive
 

7653
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,229
capability and the right defensive
driving so that you know you don't put

7654
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:28,239
driving so that you know you don't put
 

7655
02:05:28,239 --> 02:05:31,109
driving so that you know you don't put
yourself in a situation like this

7656
02:05:31,109 --> 02:05:31,119

8271
02:15:45,199 --> 02:15:47,430
stuff can go wrong in non-obvious ways
and it's like it's up to us to preserve

8272
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:47,440
and it's like it's up to us to preserve
 

8273

it
 

8275
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:50,149
it
and it's like it's a responsibility it's

responsibility to
 

8289
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:06,629
responsibility to
um to this world and it

8290
02:16:06,629 --> 02:16:06,639
um to this world and it
 

8291
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:09,030
um to this world and it
dawned on me that like me and millions

8292
02:16:09,030 --> 02:16:09,040
dawned on me that like me and millions
 

8293
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:10,229
dawned on me that like me and millions
of others

8294
02:16:10,229 --> 02:16:10,239
of others
 

8295
02:16:10,239 --> 02:16:12,950
of others
are like the little ants that maintain

8296
02:16:12,950 --> 02:16:12,960
are like the little ants that maintain
 

8297
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:14,629
are like the little ants that maintain

this little colony
 

8299
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:17,030
this little colony
right so we have a responsibility not to

8300
02:16:17,030 --> 02:16:17,040
right so we have a responsibility not to
 

8301
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:18,550
right so we have a responsibility not to
be uh i don't know what the right

want to
 

8309
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,750
want to
not do that and there's interesting

8310
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:25,760
not do that and there's interesting
 

8311
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:27,830
not do that and there's interesting
complicated ways of doing that as 1984

8312
02:16:27,830 --> 02:16:27,840
complicated ways of doing that as 1984
 

8313
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:28,390
complicated ways of doing that as 1984
shows

happening and
happening you fast forward like millions

8420
02:18:14,549 --> 02:18:14,559
happening you fast forward like millions
 

8421
02:18:14,559 --> 02:18:16,309
happening you fast forward like millions
of years into the future and you know

8422
02:18:16,309 --> 02:18:16,319
of years into the future and you know
 

8423
02:18:16,319 --> 02:18:17,990
of years into the future and you know
billions of years and like at some point

8424
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:18,000
billions of years and like at some point
 

8425
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,190
billions of years and like at some point
it's just the only entity in the

8426
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:19,200
it's just the only entity in the
 

8427
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:19,830
it's just the only entity in the
universe

8428
02:18:19,830 --> 02:18:19,840
universe
 

8429
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:21,830
universe
it's like absorbed all humanity and all

8430
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:21,840
it's like absorbed all humanity and all
 

8431
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:23,349
it's like absorbed all humanity and all
knowledge in the universe and it like

8432
02:18:23,349 --> 02:18:23,359
knowledge in the universe and it like
 

8433
02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:25,349
knowledge in the universe and it like
keeps posing the same question to itself

8434
02:18:25,349 --> 02:18:25,359
keeps posing the same question to itself
 

8435
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:27,669
keeps posing the same question to itself
and you know

8436
02:18:27,669 --> 02:18:27,679
and you know
 

8437
02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:29,429
and you know
finally it gets to the point where it is

8438
02:18:29,429 --> 02:18:29,439
finally it gets to the point where it is
 

8439
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:30,950
finally it gets to the point where it is
able to answer that question but of

8440
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:30,960
able to answer that question but of
 

8441
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:32,629
able to answer that question but of
course at that point you know there's

8442
02:18:32,629 --> 02:18:32,639
course at that point you know there's
 

8443
02:18:32,639 --> 02:18:34,150
course at that point you know there's
you know the heat death of the universe

8444
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:34,160
you know the heat death of the universe
 

8445
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:35,669
you know the heat death of the universe
has occurred and that's the only entity

8446
02:18:35,669 --> 02:18:35,679
has occurred and that's the only entity
 

8447
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:37,429
has occurred and that's the only entity
and there's nobody else to provide that

8448
02:18:37,429 --> 02:18:37,439
and there's nobody else to provide that
 

8449
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:39,669
and there's nobody else to provide that
answer to so the only thing it can do is

8450
02:18:39,669 --> 02:18:39,679
answer to so the only thing it can do is
 

8451
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:40,070
answer to so the only thing it can do is
to

8452
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,080
to
 

8453
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:41,669
to
you know answer it by demonstration so

8454
02:18:41,669 --> 02:18:41,679
you know answer it by demonstration so
 

8455
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:43,429
you know answer it by demonstration so
it like you know recreates the

8456
02:18:43,429 --> 02:18:43,439
it like you know recreates the
 

8457
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:44,870
it like you know recreates the
big bang right and resets the clock

8458
02:18:44,870 --> 02:18:44,880
big bang right and resets the clock
 

8459
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,950
big bang right and resets the clock
right

8460
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:46,960
right
 

8461
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:50,070
right
but i i can try to give kind of a

8462
02:18:50,070 --> 02:18:50,080
but i i can try to give kind of a
 

8463
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:52,309
but i i can try to give kind of a
a different version of the answer you

8464
02:18:52,309 --> 02:18:52,319
a different version of the answer you
 

8465
02:18:52,319 --> 02:18:53,349
a different version of the answer you
know maybe

8466
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:53,359
know maybe
 

8467
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:55,589
know maybe
uh not on the behalf of all humanity i

8468
02:18:55,589 --> 02:18:55,599
uh not on the behalf of all humanity i
 

8469
02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:56,790
uh not on the behalf of all humanity i
think that that might be a little

8470
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:56,800
think that that might be a little
 

8471
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:58,309
think that that might be a little
presumptuous for me to speak about the

8472
02:18:58,309 --> 02:18:58,319
presumptuous for me to speak about the
 

8473
02:18:58,319 --> 02:18:59,429
presumptuous for me to speak about the
meaning of life on

8474
02:18:59,429 --> 02:18:59,439
meaning of life on
 

8475
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:01,910
meaning of life on
the behalf of all humans uh but at least

8476
02:19:01,910 --> 02:19:01,920
the behalf of all humans uh but at least
 

8477
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:03,429
the behalf of all humans uh but at least
you know personally

8478
02:19:03,429 --> 02:19:03,439
you know personally
 

8479
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:05,509
you know personally
uh it changes right i think if you think

8480
02:19:05,509 --> 02:19:05,519
uh it changes right i think if you think
 

8481
02:19:05,519 --> 02:19:06,950
uh it changes right i think if you think
about kind of what

8482
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:06,960
about kind of what
 

8483
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:10,150

uh learning about things right i guess
 

8529
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:51,030
uh learning about things right i guess
actually before you start intentionally

8530

actually before you start intentionally
 

8531
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:51,990
actually before you start intentionally
learning probably fun

and like fun is good uh then you get you
know start learning and i guess that

8542
02:20:01,030 --> 02:20:01,040
know start learning and i guess that
 

8543
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,349
know start learning and i guess that
this this

8544
02:20:03,349 --> 02:20:03,359
this this
 

8545
02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:06,950
this this
joy of comprehension and discovery

8546
