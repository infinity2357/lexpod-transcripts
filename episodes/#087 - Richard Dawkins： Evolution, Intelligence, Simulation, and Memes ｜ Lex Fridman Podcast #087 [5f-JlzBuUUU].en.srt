00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,330
and then the subsequent evolution to
 

165
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,150
and then the subsequent evolution to
intelligent life which is also fairly a

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,160
intelligent life which is also fairly a
 

167
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,220

problem so the juxtaposition of those

168
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,230
problem so the juxtaposition of those
 

169
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,720
problem so the juxtaposition of those
two you could say is pretty improbable

170
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:16,730
two you could say is pretty improbable
 

171
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,740
two you could say is pretty improbable
but not 10 to the 22 in problem it's an

172
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:20,750
but not 10 to the 22 in problem it's an
 

173
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,120
but not 10 to the 22 in problem it's an
interesting question maybe you're coming

174
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,130
interesting question maybe you're coming
 

175
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,560
interesting question maybe you're coming
on to it how we would recognize

176
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,570
on to it how we would recognize
 

177
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,540
on to it how we would recognize
intelligence from outer space if we if

we encountered it the most likely way we

180
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:28,670
we encountered it the most likely way we
 

181
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,370
we encountered it the most likely way we
would come across them would be by radio

182
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:30,380
would come across them would be by radio
 

183
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,350
would come across them would be by radio
it's highly unlikely they'd ever visit

184
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,360
it's highly unlikely they'd ever visit
 

185
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,280
it's highly unlikely they'd ever visit
us but um it's not it's not that

186
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,290
us but um it's not it's not that
 

187
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,810
us but um it's not it's not that
unlikely that we would pick up radio

188
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:37,820
unlikely that we would pick up radio
 

189
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,900
unlikely that we would pick up radio
signals and then we would have to have

190
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:40,910
signals and then we would have to have
 

191
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,400
signals and then we would have to have
some means of deciding as it was

some means of deciding as it was

intelligent people have people involved

194
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,550
intelligent people have people involved

00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,370
intelligent people have people involved
in the SETI program discuss how they

in the SETI program discuss how they
 

197
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,720

would do it and things like prime

198
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:49,730
would do it and things like prime
 

199
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,750

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:00,770
are here I suspect it probably would be
 

207
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,800
are here I suspect it probably would be
obvious actually that's interesting

208
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:02,810
obvious actually that's interesting
 

209
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,020
obvious actually that's interesting
prime number so the mathematical

210
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,030
prime number so the mathematical
 

211
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,490
prime number so the mathematical
patterns it's an open question whether

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,010

00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:14,989
assume that ultimately if we were

governed by the same laws of physics and
 

221
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,729
governed by the same laws of physics and
we should be governed by the same laws

we should be governed by the same laws
 

223
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,620
we should be governed by the same laws
of mathematics I think so

224
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:20,630
of mathematics I think so
 

225
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,750
of mathematics I think so
I suspect that they will have Pythagoras

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:22,760
I suspect that they will have Pythagoras
 

227
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
I suspect that they will have Pythagoras
theorem etc and I don't think that

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,500
theorem etc and I don't think that
mathematics will be that different do

235
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,010

that we do discover life elsewhere it

will be Darwinian life in the sense that

will be Darwinian life in the sense that

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,870
will be Darwinian life in the sense that
it will but it will work by some kind of

it will but it will work by some kind of

that the genera have to have some kind

DNA genetics probably wouldn't be
 

255
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,389
DNA genetics probably wouldn't be

actually but it would I think it would

actually but it would I think it would
have to be Darwinian yes there's some

have to be Darwinian yes there's some

00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,819
have to be Darwinian yes there's some
kind of selection process yes in the

00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:00,829
kind of selection process yes in the
 

261
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:03,519
kind of selection process yes in the
general sense it will be Darwinian so

262
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:03,529
general sense it will be Darwinian so
 

263
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,219
general sense it will be Darwinian so
let me ask kind of artificial

00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:06,229
let me ask kind of artificial
 

265
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,259
let me ask kind of artificial
intelligence engineering questions so

266
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:08,269
intelligence engineering questions so
 

267
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,209
intelligence engineering questions so
you've been an outspoken critic of I

00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:10,219
you've been an outspoken critic of I

some religious folks that really just

again you can correct me is the only

00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,149
again you can correct me is the only

will be
well of course one of the somebody says

296
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:40,159
well of course one of the somebody says
 

297
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:46,709
well of course one of the somebody says
that a hundred years later I know but um

298
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:46,719
that a hundred years later I know but um
 

299
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,139

that I mean not what he would look sorry
 

301
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,369
that I mean not what he would look sorry
yes they would probably look very

302
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:51,379
yes they would probably look very
 

303
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:52,899
yes they would probably look very
similar but it'd be it's almost like

304
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:52,909
similar but it'd be it's almost like
 

305
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,909
similar but it'd be it's almost like

00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,189

alteration of the theory or something
 

311
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,779
alteration of the theory or something
like that but it won't be fundamentally

312
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:01,789
like that but it won't be fundamentally
 

313
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:07,269
like that but it won't be fundamentally
different but okay it so so now for the

00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:07,279
different but okay it so so now for the
 

315
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,489
different but okay it so so now for the

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,059
quite a number of examples as you'd

00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,949
expect it's not surprising that we find
examples of that sort in a way what's

examples of that sort in a way what's
 

505
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,420
examples of that sort in a way what's
surprising is there aren't more of them

surprising is there aren't more of them
 

507
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,579
surprising is there aren't more of them
in a way what's surprising is that the

00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:57,589
in a way what's surprising is that the
 

509
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,620
in a way what's surprising is that the

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:31,880
that's the inefficiency of it yes that's
 

535
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,939
that's the inefficiency of it yes that's
the horrible wastefulness of it so yeah

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:53,620
of like super intelligence do you see
 

553
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,170
of like super intelligence do you see
super human level intelligence that's

00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,819
super human level intelligence that's
potentially the next step in the

potentially the next step in the
 

557
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,129
potentially the next step in the
evolutionary process yes I think that if

558
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:00,139
evolutionary process yes I think that if

it will be artificial I don't have any
 

563
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,970
it will be artificial I don't have any
hope that we ourselves our brains will

hope that we ourselves our brains will

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,240
hope that we ourselves our brains will
go on in go on getting larger in

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,250
go on in go on getting larger in
 

567
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,600
go on in go on getting larger in
ordinary biological evolution I think

568
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:13,610
ordinary biological evolution I think
 

569
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,360
ordinary biological evolution I think
that's probably coming to an end it is

that's probably coming to an end it is

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,370
that's probably coming to an end it is

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,430
raised eyes yes
 

579
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,670
raised eyes yes
so it's been it's been swelling rather

580
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
so it's been it's been swelling rather
 

581
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,470
so it's been it's been swelling rather
dramatically over the last two or three

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,690
dramatically over the last two or three

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,280
million years that is unlikely to
continue that the only way that that's

586
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,290
continue that the only way that that's
 

587
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,500

that happens is because natural

the biggest brains and that's not
 

593
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,000
the biggest brains and that's not

pressures are not I mean are they active

598
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:48,380

599
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,940

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,579
in any form well in order for them to be

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,180
brain size but let's let's talk about
 

609

intelligence in order for that to evolve
 

611
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,389
intelligence in order for that to evolve
it's necessary that the most intelligent

it's necessary that the most intelligent
 

613
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,490
it's necessary that the most intelligent
beings have the most individuals have

about it that the leap to sort of

00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:17,359
about it that the leap to sort of

religious or mystical explanations is
 

761
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:20,150
religious or mystical explanations is
too easy to make i I think that it's

too easy to make i I think that it's

too easy to make i I think that it's
just an act of cowardice to lead to

just an act of cowardice to lead to
 

765
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,299
just an act of cowardice to lead to
religious explanations and what it

766
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:23,309
religious explanations and what it
 

767
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:27,559
religious explanations and what it
doesn't do that of course but I I accept

768
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:27,569
doesn't do that of course but I I accept
 

769
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,389
doesn't do that of course but I I accept
that there may be something we don't

fascinating that sort of ideas it's like

962
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,390
fascinating that sort of ideas it's like
 

963
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,360
fascinating that sort of ideas it's like
you haven't go up against islands or

964
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,370
you haven't go up against islands or
 

965
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,300
you haven't go up against islands or
something is the 70s and the internet

966
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,310
something is the 70s and the internet
 

967
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,480
something is the 70s and the internet
allowed all these species is just like

968
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:06,490
allowed all these species is just like
 

969
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,700
allowed all these species is just like
global eyes and and in a matter of

970
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:09,710
global eyes and and in a matter of
 

971
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,710
global eyes and and in a matter of
seconds you could spread a message to

972
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:11,720
seconds you could spread a message to
 

973
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,610
seconds you could spread a message to
millions of people and these ideas these

974
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:15,620
millions of people and these ideas these
 

975
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,670
millions of people and these ideas these
memes can breed

976
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:17,680
memes can breed
 

977
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,180
memes can breed
can evolve can mutate and there's a

978
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,190
can evolve can mutate and there's a
 

979
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,430
can evolve can mutate and there's a
selection and there's like different I

980
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
selection and there's like different I
 

981
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,610
selection and there's like different I
guess groups that of all like there's a

982
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:25,620
guess groups that of all like there's a
 

983
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,660
guess groups that of all like there's a
dynamics it's fascinating here do you

984
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:27,670
dynamics it's fascinating here do you
 

985
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,870
dynamics it's fascinating here do you
think yes basically do you think your

986
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
think yes basically do you think your
 

987
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,700
think yes basically do you think your
work in this direction while

988
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:32,710
work in this direction while
 

989
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,980
work in this direction while
fundamentally was focused on life on

990
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:34,990
fundamentally was focused on life on
 

991
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,020
fundamentally was focused on life on
Earth do you think it should continue

992
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,030
Earth do you think it should continue
 

993
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,230
Earth do you think it should continue
like to be well yeah I do think it would

994
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
like to be well yeah I do think it would
 

995
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,670
like to be well yeah I do think it would
probably be a good idea to think in a

996
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:41,680
probably be a good idea to think in a
 

997
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,480
probably be a good idea to think in a
Darwinian way about this sort of thing

998
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,490
Darwinian way about this sort of thing
 

999
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,580
Darwinian way about this sort of thing
we could mention you think of the

1000
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:47,590
we could mention you think of the
 

1001
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,110
we could mention you think of the
transmission of ideas from in

1002
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
transmission of ideas from in
 

1003
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,540
transmission of ideas from in
evolutionary context just being limited

1004
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:51,550
evolutionary context just being limited
 

1005
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,100
evolutionary context just being limited
to I mean in our ancestors people living

1006
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,110
to I mean in our ancestors people living
 

1007
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,890
to I mean in our ancestors people living
in villages living in small bands where

1008
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:58,900
in villages living in small bands where
 

1009
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,930
in villages living in small bands where
everybody knew each other and ideas

1010
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:00,940
everybody knew each other and ideas
 

1011
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,300
everybody knew each other and ideas
could propagate within the village and

1012
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,310
could propagate within the village and
 

1013
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,020
could propagate within the village and
they might hop to a neighboring village

1014
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,030
they might hop to a neighboring village
 

1015
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,130
they might hop to a neighboring village
occasionally and maybe able to a

1016
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,140
occasionally and maybe able to a
 

1017
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,230
occasionally and maybe able to a
neighboring continent eventually and

1018
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,240
neighboring continent eventually and
 

1019
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,630
neighboring continent eventually and
that was a slow process nowadays

1020
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
that was a slow process nowadays
 

1021
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,470
that was a slow process nowadays
villages are international I mean you

1022
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
villages are international I mean you
 

1023
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,860
villages are international I mean you
have people it's been called echo

1024
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:19,870
have people it's been called echo
 

1025
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,740
have people it's been called echo
chambers where people are in a sort of

1026
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:22,750
chambers where people are in a sort of
 

1027
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,770
chambers where people are in a sort of
Internet village where the other members

1028
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:25,780
Internet village where the other members
 

1029
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,050
Internet village where the other members
of the village may be geographically

1030
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,060
of the village may be geographically
 

1031
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,460
of the village may be geographically
distributed all over the world whether

1032
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,470
distributed all over the world whether
 

1033
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,780
distributed all over the world whether
they just happen to be interested in the

1034
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:30,790
they just happen to be interested in the
 

1035
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,150
they just happen to be interested in the
same things use the same terminology

1036
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,160
same things use the same terminology
 

1037
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,240
same things use the same terminology
the same jargon have the same enthusiasm

1038
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,250
the same jargon have the same enthusiasm
 

1039
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,130
the same jargon have the same enthusiasm
so people like the Flat Earth Society

1040
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,140
so people like the Flat Earth Society
 

1041
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,630
so people like the Flat Earth Society
they don't all live in one place they

1042
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
they don't all live in one place they
 

1043
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
they don't all live in one place they
find each other and they talk the same

1044
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,410
find each other and they talk the same
 

1045
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,510
find each other and they talk the same
language to each other they talk the

1046
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
language to each other they talk the
 

1047
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,560
language to each other they talk the
same nonsense to each other

1048
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:46,570
same nonsense to each other
 

1049
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,910
same nonsense to each other
and they but so this is a kind of

1050
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:49,920
and they but so this is a kind of
 

1051
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,470
and they but so this is a kind of
distributed version of the primitive

1052
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
distributed version of the primitive
 

1053
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,070
distributed version of the primitive
idea of of people living in in villages

1054
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
idea of of people living in in villages
 

1055
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
idea of of people living in in villages
and propagating their ideas in in a

1056
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:57,850
and propagating their ideas in in a
 

1057
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,780
and propagating their ideas in in a
local way is there is there a Darwinist

1058
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:00,790
local way is there is there a Darwinist
 

1059
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,500
local way is there is there a Darwinist
parallel parallel here so is their

1060
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:03,510
parallel parallel here so is their
 

1061
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,150
parallel parallel here so is their
evolutionary purpose of villages or is

1062
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,160
evolutionary purpose of villages or is
 

1063
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,800
evolutionary purpose of villages or is
that just the I wouldn't use the word

1064
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:07,810
that just the I wouldn't use the word
 

1065
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,420
that just the I wouldn't use the word
like evolutionary purpose in that play

1066
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:09,430
like evolutionary purpose in that play
 

1067
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,980
like evolutionary purpose in that play
at that case but vient villages or

1068
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:10,990
at that case but vient villages or
 

1069
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,020
at that case but vient villages or
religious will be something that just

1070
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,030
religious will be something that just
 

1071
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,640
religious will be something that just
emerged that's the way people happen to

1072
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:14,650
emerged that's the way people happen to
 

1073
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,190
emerged that's the way people happen to
live and in it just the same kind of way

1074
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
live and in it just the same kind of way
 

1075
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,870
live and in it just the same kind of way
the Flat Earth Society societies of

1076
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:21,880
the Flat Earth Society societies of
 

1077
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,840
the Flat Earth Society societies of
ideas emerge in the same kind of way in

1078
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:24,850
ideas emerge in the same kind of way in
 

1079
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,200
ideas emerge in the same kind of way in
this digital space yes yes is there

1080
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,210
this digital space yes yes is there
 

1081
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,610
this digital space yes yes is there
something interesting to say about the

1082
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:30,620
something interesting to say about the
 

1083
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,170
something interesting to say about the
I guess from a perspective of Darwin

1084
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,180
I guess from a perspective of Darwin
 

1085
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,549
I guess from a perspective of Darwin
could we fully interpret the dynamics of

1086
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
could we fully interpret the dynamics of
 

1087
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,950
could we fully interpret the dynamics of
social interaction and these social

1088
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:41,960
social interaction and these social
 

1089
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,030
social interaction and these social
networks or is there or some much more

1090
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,040
networks or is there or some much more
 

1091
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,620
networks or is there or some much more
complicated thing need to be developed

1092
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:47,630
complicated thing need to be developed
 

1093
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,230
complicated thing need to be developed
like what's your sense well a Darwinian

1094
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
like what's your sense well a Darwinian
 

1095
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,130
like what's your sense well a Darwinian
selection idea would involve

1096
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,140
selection idea would involve
 

1097
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,420
selection idea would involve
investigating which ideas spread in

1098
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,430
investigating which ideas spread in
 

1099
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,400
investigating which ideas spread in
which which don't so in some ideas don't

1100
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,410
which which don't so in some ideas don't
 

1101
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,410
which which don't so in some ideas don't
have the ability to spread in the flat

1102
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:02,420
have the ability to spread in the flat
 

1103
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,620
have the ability to spread in the flat
earth flatter earth ism is is there are

1104
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:05,630
earth flatter earth ism is is there are
 

1105
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,730
earth flatter earth ism is is there are
a few people believe in it but it's not

1106
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:06,740
a few people believe in it but it's not
 

1107
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,960
a few people believe in it but it's not
going to spread because it's obvious

1108
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:07,970
going to spread because it's obvious
 

1109
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,930
going to spread because it's obvious
nonsense but other ideas even if they

1110
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:10,940
nonsense but other ideas even if they
 

1111
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,460
nonsense but other ideas even if they
are wrong can spread because they are

1112
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,470
are wrong can spread because they are
 

1113
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,200
are wrong can spread because they are
attractive in some sense so the the

1114
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,210
attractive in some sense so the the
 

1115
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,780
attractive in some sense so the the
spreading in the selection and in the

1116
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:19,790
spreading in the selection and in the
 

1117
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,500
spreading in the selection and in the
Darwinian context is it just has to be

1118
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:23,510

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,340
evolution on religion do you think there
will ever be a time in our future where

1276
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,350
will ever be a time in our future where
 

1277
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,930
will ever be a time in our future where
almost nobody believes in God or God is

1278
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:46,940
almost nobody believes in God or God is
 

1279
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,670
almost nobody believes in God or God is
not a part of the moral fabric of our

1280
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:48,680
not a part of the moral fabric of our
 

1281
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,600
not a part of the moral fabric of our
society yes I do I think it may happen

1282
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:52,610
society yes I do I think it may happen
 

1283
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,400
society yes I do I think it may happen
I'll for very long time it may take a

1284
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,410
I'll for very long time it may take a
 

1285
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,350
I'll for very long time it may take a
long time for that to happen so do you

1286
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:56,360
long time for that to happen so do you
 

1287
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,970
long time for that to happen so do you
think ultimately for everybody

1288
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:57,980
think ultimately for everybody
 

1289
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,650
think ultimately for everybody
on earth religion the other forms of

1290
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:02,660
on earth religion the other forms of
 

1291
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,980
on earth religion the other forms of
doctrines ideas could do better job than

1292
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:05,990
doctrines ideas could do better job than
 

1293
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,590
doctrines ideas could do better job than
what religion does yes

1294
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:08,600
what religion does yes
 

1295
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,820
what religion does yes
I mean following in truth at least what

1296
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:12,830
I mean following in truth at least what
 

1297
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:17,500
I mean following in truth at least what
truth is a funny funny word and reason

1298
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:17,510
truth is a funny funny word and reason
 

1299
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,330
truth is a funny funny word and reason
to theirs yeah it's a it's a difficult

1300
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:22,340
to theirs yeah it's a it's a difficult
 

1301
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,380
to theirs yeah it's a it's a difficult
idea

1302
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,390
idea
 

1303
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,100
idea
now with truth on the Internet right and

1304
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,110
now with truth on the Internet right and
 

1305
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,320
now with truth on the Internet right and
fake news and so on I suppose when you

1306
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,330
fake news and so on I suppose when you
 

1307
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,720
fake news and so on I suppose when you
say reason you mean the very basic sort

1308
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:31,730
say reason you mean the very basic sort
 

1309
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,720
say reason you mean the very basic sort
of inarguable conclusions of science

1310
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:34,730
of inarguable conclusions of science
 

1311
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,960
of inarguable conclusions of science
versus which political system is better

1312
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:37,970
versus which political system is better
 

1313
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,650
versus which political system is better
yeah yes yes I mean truth about the real

1314
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:41,660
yeah yes yes I mean truth about the real
 

1315
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,940
yeah yes yes I mean truth about the real
world which is ascertainable by not just

1316
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:45,950
world which is ascertainable by not just
 

1317
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,100
world which is ascertainable by not just
by the more rigorous methods of science

1318
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,110
by the more rigorous methods of science
 

1319
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,150
by the more rigorous methods of science
but by just ordinary sensory observation

1320
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,160
but by just ordinary sensory observation
 

1321
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,950
but by just ordinary sensory observation
so do you think there will ever be a

1322
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:53,960
so do you think there will ever be a
 

1323
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,240
so do you think there will ever be a
time when we move past it like I guess

1324
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,250
time when we move past it like I guess
 

1325
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,220
time when we move past it like I guess
another way to ask it are we hopelessly

1326
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,230
another way to ask it are we hopelessly
 

1327
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:06,669
another way to ask it are we hopelessly
fundamentally tied to religion in the

1328
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:06,679
fundamentally tied to religion in the
 

1329
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,789
fundamentally tied to religion in the
way our society functions well clearly

1330
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:09,799
way our society functions well clearly
 

1331
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,909
way our society functions well clearly
all individuals are not hopelessly tied

1332
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:12,919
all individuals are not hopelessly tied
 

1333
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:14,590
all individuals are not hopelessly tied
to it because many individuals don't

1334
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:14,600
to it because many individuals don't
 

1335
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,360
to it because many individuals don't
believe you could mean something like

1336
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:18,370
believe you could mean something like
 

1337
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,740
believe you could mean something like
society needs religion in order to

1338
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:20,750
society needs religion in order to
 

1339
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,210
society needs religion in order to
function properly or something like that

1340
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:22,220
function properly or something like that
 

1341
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,950
function properly or something like that
and some people have suggested that some

1342
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:23,960
and some people have suggested that some
 

1343
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,100
and some people have suggested that some
what's your intuition on there well I've

1344
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,110
what's your intuition on there well I've
 

1345
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,760
what's your intuition on there well I've
read books on it and they're persuasive

1346
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:30,770
read books on it and they're persuasive
 

1347
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,250
read books on it and they're persuasive
I don't think they're that persuasive

1348
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:33,260
I don't think they're that persuasive
 

1349
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,200
I don't think they're that persuasive
though I mean I've some people suggested

1350
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,210
though I mean I've some people suggested
 

1351
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,840
though I mean I've some people suggested
that society needs a sort of figurehead

1352
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:40,850
that society needs a sort of figurehead
 

1353
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,820
that society needs a sort of figurehead
which can be a non-existent figurehead

1354
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:42,830
which can be a non-existent figurehead
 

1355
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,770
which can be a non-existent figurehead
in order to function properly I know

1356
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:44,780
in order to function properly I know
 

1357
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,299
in order to function properly I know
there's something rather patronizing

1358
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:46,309
there's something rather patronizing
 

1359
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,539
there's something rather patronizing
about the idea that well you and I are

1360
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:49,549
about the idea that well you and I are
 

1361
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,640
about the idea that well you and I are
intelligent enough not to believe in God

1362
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:51,650
intelligent enough not to believe in God
 

1363
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,520
intelligent enough not to believe in God
but the plebs needed sort of thing and I

1364
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:54,530
but the plebs needed sort of thing and I
 

1365
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,520
but the plebs needed sort of thing and I
think that's patronizing and I'd like to

1366
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:57,530
think that's patronizing and I'd like to
 

1367
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,350
think that's patronizing and I'd like to
think that that that was not the right

1368
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
think that that that was not the right
 

1369
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,350
think that that that was not the right
way to proceed but at the individual

1370
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,360
way to proceed but at the individual
 

1371
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,539
way to proceed but at the individual
level do you think there's some value of

1372
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:06,549
level do you think there's some value of
 

1373
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,300
level do you think there's some value of
spirituality sort of if I think

1374
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,310
spirituality sort of if I think
 

1375
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,310
spirituality sort of if I think
as a scientist the amount of things we

1376
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,320
as a scientist the amount of things we
 

1377
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,170
as a scientist the amount of things we
actually know about our universe is a

1378
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:15,180
actually know about our universe is a
 

1379
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,680
actually know about our universe is a
tiny tiny tiny percentage of what we

1380
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:18,690
tiny tiny tiny percentage of what we
 

1381
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,630
tiny tiny tiny percentage of what we
could possibly know so just from

1382
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
could possibly know so just from
 

1383
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,400
could possibly know so just from
everything even the certainty we have

1384
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,410
everything even the certainty we have
 

1385
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,380
everything even the certainty we have
about the laws of physics it seems to be

1386
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,390
about the laws of physics it seems to be
 

1387
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,660
about the laws of physics it seems to be
that there's yet a huge amount to

1388
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:26,670
that there's yet a huge amount to
 

1389
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,730
that there's yet a huge amount to
discover and therefore we're sitting

1390
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:28,740
discover and therefore we're sitting
 

1391
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,300
discover and therefore we're sitting
where 99.999% of things is just still

1392
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,310
where 99.999% of things is just still
 

1393
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,910
where 99.999% of things is just still
shrouded in mystery do you think there's

1394
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:34,920
shrouded in mystery do you think there's
 

1395
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,760
shrouded in mystery do you think there's
a role in a kind of spiritual view of

1396
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:37,770
a role in a kind of spiritual view of
 

1397
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,040
a role in a kind of spiritual view of
that sort of a humbled spiritual I think

1398
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,050
that sort of a humbled spiritual I think
 

1399
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,330
that sort of a humbled spiritual I think
it's right to be humble

1400
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:41,340
it's right to be humble
 

1401
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,370
it's right to be humble
I think it's right to admit that there's

1402
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:43,380
I think it's right to admit that there's
 

1403
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,720
I think it's right to admit that there's
a lot we don't know a lot that we don't

1404
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:44,730
a lot we don't know a lot that we don't
 

1405
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,640
a lot we don't know a lot that we don't
understand a lot but we still need to

1406
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:46,650
understand a lot but we still need to
 

1407
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,640
understand a lot but we still need to
work on we're working on it what I don't

1408
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:49,650
work on we're working on it what I don't
 

1409
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,650
work on we're working on it what I don't
think is that it helps to invoke

1410
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:51,660
think is that it helps to invoke
 

1411
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,550
think is that it helps to invoke
supernatural explanations what we found

1412
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:55,560
supernatural explanations what we found
 

1413
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,790
supernatural explanations what we found
if our current scientific explanations

1414
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:58,800
if our current scientific explanations
 

1415
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,620
if our current scientific explanations
aren't adequate to do the job then we

1416
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:00,630
aren't adequate to do the job then we
 

1417
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,360
aren't adequate to do the job then we
need better ones we need to work more

1418
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:02,370
need better ones we need to work more
 

1419
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,160
need better ones we need to work more
and of course the history of science

1420
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,170
and of course the history of science
 

1421
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,060
and of course the history of science
shows just that that as science goes on

1422
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,070
shows just that that as science goes on
 

1423
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,320
shows just that that as science goes on
problems get solved one after another

1424
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:09,330
problems get solved one after another
 

1425
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,330
problems get solved one after another
and the science advances as science gets

1426
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:11,340
and the science advances as science gets
 

1427
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,750
and the science advances as science gets
better but to invoke an non-scientific

1428
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:16,760
better but to invoke an non-scientific
 

1429
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,390
better but to invoke an non-scientific
non-physical explanation is simply to

1430
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:20,400
non-physical explanation is simply to
 

1431
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,920
non-physical explanation is simply to
lie down in a cowardly way and say we

1432
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:21,930
lie down in a cowardly way and say we
 

1433
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,750
lie down in a cowardly way and say we
can't solve it so again to invoke magic

1434
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
can't solve it so again to invoke magic
 

1435
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,820
can't solve it so again to invoke magic
don't let's do that let's say we need

1436
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:25,830
don't let's do that let's say we need
 

1437
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,880
don't let's do that let's say we need
better science we need more science it

1438
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:28,890
better science we need more science it
 

1439
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,530
better science we need more science it
may be that the science will never do it

1440
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:30,540
may be that the science will never do it
 

1441
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,820
may be that the science will never do it
it may be that we will never actually

1442
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:31,830
it may be that we will never actually
 

1443
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,260
it may be that we will never actually
understand everything and that's okay

1444
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,270
understand everything and that's okay
 

1445
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,980
understand everything and that's okay
but let's keep working on it a

1446
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:38,990
but let's keep working on it a
 

1447
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,210
but let's keep working on it a
challenging question there is do you

1448
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:41,220
challenging question there is do you
 

1449
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,070
challenging question there is do you
think science can lead us astray in

1450
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,080
think science can lead us astray in
 

1451
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,500
think science can lead us astray in
terms of the humbleness so there's some

1452
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:45,510
terms of the humbleness so there's some
 

1453
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,500
terms of the humbleness so there's some
aspect of science

1454
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:47,510
aspect of science
 

1455
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,090
aspect of science
maybe it's the aspect of scientists in

1456
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,100
maybe it's the aspect of scientists in
 

1457
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,590
maybe it's the aspect of scientists in
that science but of sort of a mix of ego

1458
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:54,600
that science but of sort of a mix of ego
 

1459
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,220
that science but of sort of a mix of ego
and confidence that can lead us astray

1460
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,230
and confidence that can lead us astray
 

1461
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,610
and confidence that can lead us astray
in terms of discovering them you know

1462
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:01,620
in terms of discovering them you know
 

1463
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,560
in terms of discovering them you know
some of the big open questions about yes

1464
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:03,570
some of the big open questions about yes
 

1465
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,840
some of the big open questions about yes
about the universe I think that's right

1466
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:05,850
about the universe I think that's right
 

1467
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,490
about the universe I think that's right
I mean there are there are arrogant

1468
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:07,500
I mean there are there are arrogant
 

1469
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,350
I mean there are there are arrogant
people in any walk of life and

1470
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
people in any walk of life and
 

1471
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,300
people in any walk of life and
scientists an exception to that and so

1472
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,310
scientists an exception to that and so
 

1473
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,310
scientists an exception to that and so
there are arrogant scientists who think

1474
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,320
there are arrogant scientists who think
 

1475
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,570
there are arrogant scientists who think
we've sold everything of course we

1476
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:14,580
we've sold everything of course we
 

1477
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,210
we've sold everything of course we
haven't so humility is a proper stance

1478
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,220
haven't so humility is a proper stance
 

1479
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,430
haven't so humility is a proper stance
for a scientist and when it's a proper

1480
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,440
for a scientist and when it's a proper
 

1481
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,940
for a scientist and when it's a proper
working stance because it encourages

1482
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:21,950
working stance because it encourages
 

1483
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,889
working stance because it encourages
further work but in a way to resort to a

1484
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:26,899
further work but in a way to resort to a
 

1485
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:29,049
further work but in a way to resort to a
supernatural explanation is a kind of

1486
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:29,059
supernatural explanation is a kind of
 

1487
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,789
supernatural explanation is a kind of
arrogance because it's saying well we

1488
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:30,799
arrogance because it's saying well we
 

1489
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,080
arrogance because it's saying well we
don't understand it scientifically

1490
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,090
don't understand it scientifically
 

1491
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,259
don't understand it scientifically
therefore the non-scientific religious

1492
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:37,269
therefore the non-scientific religious
 

1493
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,310
therefore the non-scientific religious
supernatural explanation must be the

1494
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,320
supernatural explanation must be the
 

1495
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,500
supernatural explanation must be the
right one that's arrogant what is what

1496
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:41,510
right one that's arrogant what is what
 

1497
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,440
right one that's arrogant what is what
is humble is to say we don't know and we

1498
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:44,450
is humble is to say we don't know and we
 

1499
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,700
is humble is to say we don't know and we
need to work further on it

1500
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,710
need to work further on it
 

1501
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,700
need to work further on it
so maybe if I could psychoanalyze you

1502
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:48,710
so maybe if I could psychoanalyze you
 

1503
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,570
so maybe if I could psychoanalyze you
for a second you have at times been just

1504
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:52,580
for a second you have at times been just
 

1505
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,230
for a second you have at times been just
slightly frustrated with people who have

1506
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,240
slightly frustrated with people who have
 

1507
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,830
slightly frustrated with people who have
supernet you know have a supernatural

1508
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:58,840
supernet you know have a supernatural
 

1509
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,690
supernet you know have a supernatural
has that changed over the years have you

1510
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:01,700
has that changed over the years have you
 

1511
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,389
has that changed over the years have you
become like how do people that kind of

1512
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
become like how do people that kind of
 

1513
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,120
become like how do people that kind of
have to seek supernatural explanations

1514
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,130
have to seek supernatural explanations
 

1515
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,810
have to seek supernatural explanations
how do you see those people as human

1516
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:10,820
how do you see those people as human
 

1517
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,909
how do you see those people as human
beings as it's like do you see them as

1518
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:12,919
beings as it's like do you see them as
 

1519
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,639
beings as it's like do you see them as
dishonest do you see them as sort of

1520
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:17,649
dishonest do you see them as sort of
 

1521
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,340
dishonest do you see them as sort of
ignorant do you see them as I don't know

1522
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,350
ignorant do you see them as I don't know
 

1523
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,139
ignorant do you see them as I don't know
is it like well I mean how do you think

1524
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:23,149
is it like well I mean how do you think
 

1525
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,049
is it like well I mean how do you think
of certainly not not not dishonest and I

1526
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:26,059
of certainly not not not dishonest and I
 

1527
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,879
of certainly not not not dishonest and I
mean obviously many of them are very

1528
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:27,889
mean obviously many of them are very
 

1529
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:29,470
mean obviously many of them are very
nice people so I don't I don't sort of

1530
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:29,480
nice people so I don't I don't sort of
 

1531
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,519
nice people so I don't I don't sort of
despise them in that sense I think it's

1532
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:33,529
despise them in that sense I think it's
 

1533
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:37,049
despise them in that sense I think it's
often a misunderstanding that that

1534
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:37,059
often a misunderstanding that that
 

1535
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:41,350
often a misunderstanding that that
people will jump from the admission that

1536
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
people will jump from the admission that
 

1537
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,200
people will jump from the admission that
we don't understand something they will

1538
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,210
we don't understand something they will
 

1539
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,419
we don't understand something they will
jump straight to what they think of as

1540
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:46,429
jump straight to what they think of as
 

1541
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:48,340
jump straight to what they think of as
an alternative explanation which is the

1542
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,350
an alternative explanation which is the
 

1543
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,629
an alternative explanation which is the
supernatural one which is not an

1544
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:49,639
supernatural one which is not an
 

1545
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:52,230
supernatural one which is not an
alternative it's a known explanation

1546
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
alternative it's a known explanation
 

1547
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,129
alternative it's a known explanation
instead of jumping to the conclusion

1548
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:54,139
instead of jumping to the conclusion
 

1549
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:57,730
instead of jumping to the conclusion
that science needs more work that we

1550
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:57,740
that science needs more work that we
 

1551
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,930
that science needs more work that we
need to actually get do some better

1552
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:58,940
need to actually get do some better
 

1553
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:05,549
need to actually get do some better
better science so I I don't have I mean

1554
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:05,559
better science so I I don't have I mean
 

1555
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:08,350
better science so I I don't have I mean
personal antipathy towards such people I

1556
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,360
personal antipathy towards such people I
 

1557
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,899
personal antipathy towards such people I
just think they're they're misguided so

1558
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:10,909
just think they're they're misguided so
 

1559
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:12,460
just think they're they're misguided so
what about this really interesting space

1560
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:12,470
what about this really interesting space
 

1561
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,610
what about this really interesting space
that I have trouble with so religion

1562
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:15,620
that I have trouble with so religion
 

1563
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,820
that I have trouble with so religion
ever but a grasp on but there's a large

1564
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:18,830
ever but a grasp on but there's a large
 

1565
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,529
ever but a grasp on but there's a large
communities like you said flat earth a

1566
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:20,539
communities like you said flat earth a
 

1567
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,919
communities like you said flat earth a
community that I've recently because

1568
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:23,929
community that I've recently because
 

1569
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:26,950
community that I've recently because
I've made a few jokes about it I saw

1570
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:26,960
I've made a few jokes about it I saw
 

1571
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,110
I've made a few jokes about it I saw
that there's I've noticed that there's

1572
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
that there's I've noticed that there's
 

1573
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,529
that there's I've noticed that there's
people that to take it quite seriously

1574
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:31,539
people that to take it quite seriously
 

1575
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:34,299
people that to take it quite seriously
so there's this bigger world of

1576
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:34,309
so there's this bigger world of
 

1577
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:36,100
so there's this bigger world of
conspiracy theorists

1578
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,110
conspiracy theorists
 

1579
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,000
conspiracy theorists
which is the kind of I mean there's

1580
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,010
which is the kind of I mean there's
 

1581
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,130
which is the kind of I mean there's
elements of it there are religious as

1582
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:42,140
elements of it there are religious as
 

1583
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,580
elements of it there are religious as
well but I think they're also scientific

1584
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:45,590
well but I think they're also scientific
 

1585
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,820
well but I think they're also scientific
so the the basic credo of a conspiracy

1586
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:48,830
so the the basic credo of a conspiracy
 

1587
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,919
so the the basic credo of a conspiracy
theorist is to question everything which

1588
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:53,929
theorist is to question everything which
 

1589
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:56,799
theorist is to question everything which
is also the cradle of a good scientist I

1590
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:56,809
is also the cradle of a good scientist I
 

1591
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:59,830
is also the cradle of a good scientist I
would say so what do you make of this I

1592
00:33:59,830 --> 00:33:59,840
would say so what do you make of this I
 

1593
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,880
would say so what do you make of this I
mean I think it's probably too easy to

1594
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:03,890
mean I think it's probably too easy to
 

1595
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,680
mean I think it's probably too easy to
say that by labeling something

1596
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:05,690
say that by labeling something
 

1597
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,109
say that by labeling something
conspiracy you therefore dismiss it I

1598
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:08,119
conspiracy you therefore dismiss it I
 

1599
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,060
conspiracy you therefore dismiss it I
mean occasionally conspiracies are right

1600
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,070
mean occasionally conspiracies are right
 

1601
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,149
mean occasionally conspiracies are right
and so we shouldn't dismiss conspiracy

1602
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:13,159
and so we shouldn't dismiss conspiracy
 

1603
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,129
and so we shouldn't dismiss conspiracy
theories out of hand we should examine

1604
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:15,139
theories out of hand we should examine
 

1605
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,889
theories out of hand we should examine
them on their own merits Flat Earth is

1606
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:17,899
them on their own merits Flat Earth is
 

1607
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:19,810
them on their own merits Flat Earth is
amiss obvious nonsense we don't have to

1608
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:19,820
amiss obvious nonsense we don't have to
 

1609
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,560
amiss obvious nonsense we don't have to
examine that much further but I mean

1610
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:23,570
examine that much further but I mean
 

1611
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,629
examine that much further but I mean
there may be other conspiracy theories

1612
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:25,639
there may be other conspiracy theories
 

1613
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,480
there may be other conspiracy theories
which are actually right so I've go a

1614
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,490
which are actually right so I've go a
 

1615
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,579
which are actually right so I've go a
grew up in the Soviet Union as I you

00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:30,589
grew up in the Soviet Union as I you
 

1617
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:33,040
grew up in the Soviet Union as I you
know the space race was very influential

1618
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,050
know the space race was very influential
 

1619
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,200
know the space race was very influential
for me and both sides of the coin you

1620
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,210
for me and both sides of the coin you
 

1621
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,079
for me and both sides of the coin you
know there's a conspiracy theory that we

1622
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:38,089
know there's a conspiracy theory that we
 

1623
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:43,240
know there's a conspiracy theory that we
never went to the moon right and it's

1624
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,250
never went to the moon right and it's
 

1625
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,730
never went to the moon right and it's
it's like I can understand it and it's

1626
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:45,740
it's like I can understand it and it's
 

1627
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,990
it's like I can understand it and it's
very difficult to rigorously

1628
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:47,000
very difficult to rigorously
 

1629
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,690
very difficult to rigorously
scientifically show one way or the other

1630
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:48,700
scientifically show one way or the other
 

1631
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,820
scientifically show one way or the other
it's just you have to use some of the

1632
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:51,830
it's just you have to use some of the
 

1633
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,649
it's just you have to use some of the
human intuition about who would have to

1634
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:53,659
human intuition about who would have to
 

1635
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,210
human intuition about who would have to
lie who would have to work together and

1636
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:55,220
lie who would have to work together and
 

1637
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,250
lie who would have to work together and
it's clear that very unlikely good

it's clear that very unlikely good

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,870
it's clear that very unlikely good
behind that is my general intuition that

00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:01,880
behind that is my general intuition that

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,359
behind that is my general intuition that

some conspiracy theories there has to be

1646
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,060
some conspiracy theories there has to be
 

1647
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,030
some conspiracy theories there has to be
a large number of people working

1648
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,040
a large number of people working
 

1649
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,120
a large number of people working
together and essentially being dishonest

1650
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,130
together and essentially being dishonest
 

1651
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,550
together and essentially being dishonest
yes which is improbable it the sheer

1652
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:15,560
yes which is improbable it the sheer
 

1653
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,680
yes which is improbable it the sheer
number who would have to be in on this

1654
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:17,690
number who would have to be in on this
 

1655
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,620
number who would have to be in on this
conspiracy and the sheer detail the

1656
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:20,630
conspiracy and the sheer detail the
 

1657
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,150
conspiracy and the sheer detail the
attention to detail they'd have had to

1658
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
attention to detail they'd have had to
 

1659
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,390
attention to detail they'd have had to
have had and so on I'd also can worry

1660
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:25,400
have had and so on I'd also can worry
 

1661
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,740
have had and so on I'd also can worry
about the motive and why would anyone

1662
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:26,750
about the motive and why would anyone
 

1663
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,900
about the motive and why would anyone
want to suggest that it but it didn't

1664
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:28,910
want to suggest that it but it didn't
 

1665
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,020
want to suggest that it but it didn't
happen what's the what's the why is it

1666
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,030
happen what's the what's the why is it
 

1667
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,730
happen what's the what's the why is it
so hard to believe I mean the the

1668
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:33,740
so hard to believe I mean the the
 

1669
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,250
so hard to believe I mean the the
physics of it the mathematics of it the

1670
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:36,260
physics of it the mathematics of it the
 

1671
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,060
physics of it the mathematics of it the
the idea of computing orbits and

1672
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,070
the idea of computing orbits and
 

1673
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,380
the idea of computing orbits and
trajectories and things it all works

1674
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:41,390
trajectories and things it all works
 

1675
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,329
trajectories and things it all works
mathematically well I like wouldn't you

1676
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:43,339
mathematically well I like wouldn't you
 

1677
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:43,990
mathematically well I like wouldn't you
believe it

1678
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
believe it
 

1679
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,579
believe it
it's a psychology question because

1680
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:45,589
it's a psychology question because
 

1681
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,630
it's a psychology question because
there's something really Pleasant about

1682
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:49,640

 

1683
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,190

you know pointing out that the emperor

1684
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,200
you know pointing out that the emperor
 

1685
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,819
you know pointing out that the emperor
has no clothes when everybody like you

1686
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:54,829
has no clothes when everybody like you
 

1687
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:57,279
has no clothes when everybody like you
know thinking outside the box and coming

1688
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:57,289
know thinking outside the box and coming
 

1689
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,930
know thinking outside the box and coming
up with the chewy answer where everybody

1690
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:58,940
up with the chewy answer where everybody
 

1691
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,730
up with the chewy answer where everybody
else is deluded there's something yeah I

1692
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:00,740
else is deluded there's something yeah I
 

1693
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,009
else is deluded there's something yeah I
mean I have that for science right you

1694
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:03,019
mean I have that for science right you
 

1695
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:04,299
mean I have that for science right you
want to prove the entire scientific

1696
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:04,309
want to prove the entire scientific
 

1697
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:06,130
want to prove the entire scientific
community wrong that's the whole now

1698
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:06,140
community wrong that's the whole now
 

1699
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,630
community wrong that's the whole now
that that's that's right and of course

1700
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:07,640
that that's that's right and of course
 

1701
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,259
that that's that's right and of course
historically loan geniuses have come out

1702
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:11,269
historically loan geniuses have come out
 

1703
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,150
historically loan geniuses have come out
right sometimes yes but often people

1704
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,160
right sometimes yes but often people
 

1705
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,370
right sometimes yes but often people
with who think they're alone genius and

1706
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:15,380
with who think they're alone genius and
 

1707
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,769
with who think they're alone genius and
from much more often turn out not to so

1708
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:17,779
from much more often turn out not to so
 

1709
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,390
from much more often turn out not to so
you have to judge each case on its

1710
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:19,400
you have to judge each case on its
 

1711
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,190
you have to judge each case on its
merits then the mere fact that you're a

1712
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200
merits then the mere fact that you're a
 

1713
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,019
merits then the mere fact that you're a
maverick the mere fact that you you

1714
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:23,029
maverick the mere fact that you you
 

1715
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:25,329
maverick the mere fact that you you
you're going against the current tide

1716
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:25,339
you're going against the current tide
 

1717
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,670
you're going against the current tide
doesn't make you right you've got a FRU

1718
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:27,680
doesn't make you right you've got a FRU
 

1719
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,990
doesn't make you right you've got a FRU
show you're right by looking at the

1720
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,000
show you're right by looking at the
 

1721
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,500
show you're right by looking at the
evidence

1722
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:29,510
evidence
 

1723
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,440
evidence
so because you focus so much on religion

1724
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,450
so because you focus so much on religion
 

1725
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,269
so because you focus so much on religion
and disassembled a lot of ideas there

1726
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:34,279
and disassembled a lot of ideas there
 

1727
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:37,210
and disassembled a lot of ideas there
and I just I was wondering if you have

1728
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:37,220
and I just I was wondering if you have
 

1729
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,569
and I just I was wondering if you have
ideas about conspiracy theory groups

1730
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:40,579
ideas about conspiracy theory groups
 

1731
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:42,460
ideas about conspiracy theory groups
because there's such a prevalent even

1732
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:42,470
because there's such a prevalent even
 

1733
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,519
because there's such a prevalent even
reaching into presidential politics and

1734
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:45,529
reaching into presidential politics and
 

1735
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:47,799
reaching into presidential politics and
so on it seems like it's a very large

1736
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:47,809
so on it seems like it's a very large
 

1737
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,480
so on it seems like it's a very large
communities that believe different kinds

understand why people believe things
 

1749
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:05,559
understand why people believe things
that are clearly nonsense like well Flat

1750
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:05,569
that are clearly nonsense like well Flat
 

1751
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:07,720
that are clearly nonsense like well Flat
Earth and also the conspiracy about not

Earth and also the conspiracy about not
 

1753
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:12,370

1757
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:17,740
United States engineer 9/11 that that
kind of thing so it's not clearly

1758
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:17,750
kind of thing so it's not clearly
 

1759
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,980
kind of thing so it's not clearly
nonsense it's extremely unlikely though

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:20,990
nonsense it's extremely unlikely though
 

1761
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,400

is a bit different because it's passed
 

1765
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,670
is a bit different because it's passed
down from generation to generation and

down from generation to generation and
 

1767
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,029
down from generation to generation and
so many of the people who are religious

1768
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,039
so many of the people who are religious
 

1769
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,230
so many of the people who are religious
got it from their parents who got it

1774
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:35,990
parents and childhood indoctrination is
 

1775
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,269
parents and childhood indoctrination is
a very powerful force but these things

1776
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:40,279
a very powerful force but these things
 

1777
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:45,120
a very powerful force but these things
like the 9/11 conspiracy theory the

1778
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,130
like the 9/11 conspiracy theory the
 

1779
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,710
like the 9/11 conspiracy theory the
Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory

the man on the moon conspiracy theory
 

1783
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,150
the man on the moon conspiracy theory
these are not childhood indoctrination

1784
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,160
these are not childhood indoctrination
 

1785
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,079
these are not childhood indoctrination
these are presumably dreamed up by

these are presumably dreamed up by
 

1787
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:58,029
these are presumably dreamed up by
somebody who then tells somebody else

somebody who then tells somebody else
 

1789
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:01,569
somebody who then tells somebody else
who then wants to believe it and I don't

1790
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:01,579
who then wants to believe it and I don't
 

1791
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,220
who then wants to believe it and I don't
know why people

1792
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,230
know why people
 

1793
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,370
know why people
so eager to fall in line with some just

1794
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:06,380
so eager to fall in line with some just
 

1795
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,280
so eager to fall in line with some just
some person that they happen to read or

1796
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,290
some person that they happen to read or
 

1797
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,220
some person that they happen to read or
meet who spin some yarn I can kind of

1798
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,230
meet who spin some yarn I can kind of
 

1799
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,590
meet who spin some yarn I can kind of
understand why they believe what their

1800
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:14,600
understand why they believe what their
 

1801
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,630
understand why they believe what their
parents and teachers told them when they

1802
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,640
parents and teachers told them when they
 

1803
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,210
parents and teachers told them when they
were very tiny and not capable of

1804
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:19,220
were very tiny and not capable of
 

1805
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,640
were very tiny and not capable of
critical thinking for themselves so I

1806
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:21,650
critical thinking for themselves so I
 

1807
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,880
critical thinking for themselves so I
sort of get why the great religions of

1808
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:24,890
sort of get why the great religions of
 

1809
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,670
sort of get why the great religions of
the world like Catholicism and Islam go

00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,680
the world like Catholicism and Islam go
 

1811
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,380
the world like Catholicism and Islam go
on for as persisting is because of

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:29,390
on for as persisting is because of
 

1813
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,810
on for as persisting is because of
childhood indoctrination but that's not

1814
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:31,820
childhood indoctrination but that's not
 

1815
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,359
childhood indoctrination but that's not
true of Flat Earth ISM and sure enough

1816
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:34,369
true of Flat Earth ISM and sure enough
 

1817
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:36,900
true of Flat Earth ISM and sure enough
flat earth ISM is a very minority cult

1818
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:36,910
flat earth ISM is a very minority cult
 

1819
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,330
flat earth ISM is a very minority cult
way larger than I ever realized well yes

1820
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:40,340
way larger than I ever realized well yes
 

1821
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,220
way larger than I ever realized well yes
I know but so that's a really clean idea

1822
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,230
I know but so that's a really clean idea
 

1823
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,109
I know but so that's a really clean idea
you've articulate in your new book and

1824
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:44,119
you've articulate in your new book and
 

1825
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,240
you've articulate in your new book and
and and I'll groan God and then God

1826
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,250
and and I'll groan God and then God
 

1827
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:46,990
and and I'll groan God and then God
Delusion

1828
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,000
Delusion
 

1829
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,300
Delusion
is the early indoctrination that's

1830
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:49,310
is the early indoctrination that's
 

1831
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,160
is the early indoctrination that's
really interesting you can get away with

1832
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,170
really interesting you can get away with
 

1833
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,830
really interesting you can get away with
a lot of out there ideas in terms of

1834
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:53,840
a lot of out there ideas in terms of
 

1835
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,109
a lot of out there ideas in terms of
religious texts if the age which you

1836
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119
religious texts if the age which you
 

1837
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,870
religious texts if the age which you
convey those ideas at first is a young

1838
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:01,880
convey those ideas at first is a young
 

1839
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,750
convey those ideas at first is a young
age so indoctrination is sort of an

1840
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:04,760
age so indoctrination is sort of an
 

1841
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,300
age so indoctrination is sort of an
essential element of propagation of

1842
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,310
essential element of propagation of
 

1843
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:11,410
essential element of propagation of
religion so let me ask on the morality

1844
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:11,420
religion so let me ask on the morality
 

1845
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,900
religion so let me ask on the morality
side in the books that I mentioned God

1846
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:13,910
side in the books that I mentioned God
 

1847
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,060
side in the books that I mentioned God
Delusion I'll go on God you describe the

1848
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,070
Delusion I'll go on God you describe the
 

1849
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,580
Delusion I'll go on God you describe the
human beings don't need religion to be

1850
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:18,590
human beings don't need religion to be
 

1851
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,190
human beings don't need religion to be
moral so from an engineering perspective

1852
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,200
moral so from an engineering perspective
 

1853
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,880
moral so from an engineering perspective
we want to engineer morality into AI

1854
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:24,890
we want to engineer morality into AI
 

1855
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,690
we want to engineer morality into AI
systems so in general where do you think

1856
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:28,700
systems so in general where do you think
 

1857
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,220
systems so in general where do you think
morals come from in humans a very

1858
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,230
morals come from in humans a very
 

1859
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,790
morals come from in humans a very
complicated and interesting question

1860
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:35,800
complicated and interesting question
 

1861
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,970
complicated and interesting question
it's clear to me that the moral

1862
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:39,980
it's clear to me that the moral
 

1863
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,849
it's clear to me that the moral
standards the moral values of our

1864
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:42,859
standards the moral values of our
 

1865
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:49,300
standards the moral values of our
civilization changes as the decades go

1866
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,310
civilization changes as the decades go
 

1867
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,160
civilization changes as the decades go
by certainly as the centuries go by even

1868
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,170
by certainly as the centuries go by even
 

1869
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,560
by certainly as the centuries go by even
as the decades go by and we in the 21st

1870
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:56,570
as the decades go by and we in the 21st
 

1871
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,859
as the decades go by and we in the 21st
century are quite clearly labeled 21st

1872
00:39:59,859 --> 00:39:59,869
century are quite clearly labeled 21st
 

1873
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,920
century are quite clearly labeled 21st
century people in terms of our moral

1874
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:01,930
century people in terms of our moral
 

1875
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,620
century people in terms of our moral
values we there's a spread I mean some

1876
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:05,630
values we there's a spread I mean some
 

1877
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,050
values we there's a spread I mean some
of us are a little bit more ruthless

1878
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,060
of us are a little bit more ruthless
 

1879
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,490
of us are a little bit more ruthless
somewhat more conservative some of us

1880
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:09,500
somewhat more conservative some of us
 

1881
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,510
somewhat more conservative some of us
more more liberal and so on but we all

1882
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,520
more more liberal and so on but we all
 

1883
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,820
more more liberal and so on but we all
subscribe to pretty much the same views

1884
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,830
subscribe to pretty much the same views
 

1885
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,930
subscribe to pretty much the same views
when you compare

1886
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:16,940
when you compare
 

1887
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,320
when you compare
with say 18th century 17th century

1888
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,330
with say 18th century 17th century
 

1889
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,750
with say 18th century 17th century
people even 19th century 20th century

1890
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:22,760
people even 19th century 20th century
 

1891
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,970
people even 19th century 20th century
people so we're much less racist or a

1892
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:27,980
people so we're much less racist or a
 

1893

people so we're much less racist or a
much less sexist and so on than we used

1894
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,050
much less sexist and so on than we used
 

1895
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,140
much less sexist and so on than we used
to be some some people are still racist

1896
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,150
to be some some people are still racist
 

1897
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,630
to be some some people are still racist
in some are still sexist but the the

1903
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:43,360

steadily as the centuries go by and that
 

1905
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:47,980
steadily as the centuries go by and that
is the most powerful influence I can see

1906
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:47,990
is the most powerful influence I can see
 

1907
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,160

have anything to do with religion I mean

your morals on on religious texts which
 

1949
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,730
your morals on on religious texts which
were written millennia ago um it is not

a great way to proceed I think that's

1952
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,010
a great way to proceed I think that's
 

1953
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,110
a great way to proceed I think that's
pretty clear so not only should we not

1954
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,120
pretty clear so not only should we not
 

1955
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,690
pretty clear so not only should we not
get our morals from such text but we

1956
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:58,700
get our morals from such text but we
 

1957
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,540
get our morals from such text but we
don't we quite clearly don't um if we

1958
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:01,550
don't we quite clearly don't um if we
 

1959
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,700
don't we quite clearly don't um if we
did then we would be discriminating

1960
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:03,710
did then we would be discriminating
 

1961
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,910
did then we would be discriminating
against women and we'd be we'd be racist

1962
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:06,920
against women and we'd be we'd be racist
 

1963
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,200
against women and we'd be we'd be racist
we'd be killing homosexuals and so on so

1964
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,210
we'd be killing homosexuals and so on so
 

1965
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,770
we'd be killing homosexuals and so on so
so we don't and we shouldn't now of

1966
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:14,780
so we don't and we shouldn't now of
 

1967
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,980
so we don't and we shouldn't now of

00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,090
the 21st century standards of morality
 

1971
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,790
the 21st century standards of morality
and you can look at the Bible and you

1972
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:21,800
and you can look at the Bible and you
 

1973
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,420
and you can look at the Bible and you
can cherry-pick particular verses which

1974
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:25,430
can cherry-pick particular verses which
 

1975
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,340
can cherry-pick particular verses which
conform to our modern morality and

1976
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:27,350
conform to our modern morality and
 

1977
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,320
conform to our modern morality and
you'll find that Jesus has a pretty nice

1978
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,330
you'll find that Jesus has a pretty nice
 

1979
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:29,930
you'll find that Jesus has a pretty nice
thing

1980
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:29,940
thing
 

1981
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,520
thing
which is great but you're using your

1982
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:34,530
which is great but you're using your
 

1983
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,800
which is great but you're using your
21st century morality to decide which

1984
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:36,810
21st century morality to decide which
 

1985
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,960
21st century morality to decide which
verses to pick which verses to reject

1986
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:38,970
verses to pick which verses to reject
 

1987
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,360
verses to pick which verses to reject
and so why not cut out the middleman of

1988
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,370
and so why not cut out the middleman of
 

1989
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:45,560
and so why not cut out the middleman of
the Bible and go straight to the 21st

1990
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:45,570
the Bible and go straight to the 21st
 

1991
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,010
the Bible and go straight to the 21st
century morality which is where that

1992
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:49,020
century morality which is where that
 

1993
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,480
century morality which is where that
comes from is a much more complicated

1994
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:50,490
comes from is a much more complicated
 

1995
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,960
comes from is a much more complicated
question why is it that morality moral

1996
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:53,970
question why is it that morality moral
 

1997
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,450
question why is it that morality moral
values change as the centuries go by

1998
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:56,460
values change as the centuries go by
 

1999
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,550

they undoubtedly do and is a very
 

2001
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,400
they undoubtedly do and is a very
interesting question to ask why it's

2002
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:01,410
interesting question to ask why it's
 

2003
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,810
interesting question to ask why it's
another example of cultural evolution

2004

another example of cultural evolution
 

2005
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:07,970
another example of cultural evolution
just as technology progresses so moral

2006

just as technology progresses so moral
 

2007
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,680
just as technology progresses so moral

different reasons but it's a it's
 

2011
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,800
different reasons but it's a it's
interesting if the direction in which

interesting if the direction in which

that progress is happening has some

00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:21,120
choice any direction and I'm not sure
 

2021
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,460
choice any direction and I'm not sure
evolutionarily valuable what it is is

evolutionarily valuable what it is is

I think you're using terms and

I think you're using terms and

yeah because Genghis Khan will probably

00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:46,320
yeah because Genghis Khan will probably

00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,500
yeah because Genghis Khan will probably
say that this is not more decent because

yes I was careful to say bye-bye the

all right so you don't think AI will

00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,930
the way um there we go then you still
need to explain the programmer the

need to explain the programmer the

00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,800
simulation at a high level so I was
intrigued by this and I love others of

speculation he actually thinks it's
 

2387
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:36,200
speculation he actually thinks it's
positively likely yeah I mean it's very

00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:36,210
positively likely yeah I mean it's very
 

2389
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,210
positively likely yeah I mean it's very
likely actually well he's he makes like

a probabilistic argument which you can
 

2393
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,720
a probabilistic argument which you can
use to come up with very interesting

a simulation in this table is a

2416
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:07,410
a simulation in this table is a
 

2417
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:11,960
a simulation in this table is a
simulation and so on I don't actually in

2418
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:11,970
simulation and so on I don't actually in
 

2419
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,670
simulation and so on I don't actually in
my heart of hearts believe it but that I

2420
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,680
my heart of hearts believe it but that I
 

2421
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,920
my heart of hearts believe it but that I
like his argument well so the

2422
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:15,930
like his argument well so the
 

2423
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,710
like his argument well so the
interesting thing is that I agree with

2424
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:18,720
interesting thing is that I agree with
 

2425
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,380
interesting thing is that I agree with
you but the interesting thing to me if I

2426
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:21,390
you but the interesting thing to me if I
 

2427
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,340
you but the interesting thing to me if I
would say if we're living in a

2428
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:22,350
would say if we're living in a
 

2429
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,820
would say if we're living in a
simulation that in that simulation to

2430
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:25,830
simulation that in that simulation to
 

2431
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,950
simulation that in that simulation to
make it work you still have to do

2432
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:27,960
make it work you still have to do
 

2433
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,600
make it work you still have to do
everything gradually just like you said

2434
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:29,610
everything gradually just like you said
 

2435
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,030
everything gradually just like you said
that even though it's program I don't

2436
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:32,040
that even though it's program I don't
 

2437
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,830
that even though it's program I don't
think there could be miracles otherwise

2438
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:33,840
think there could be miracles otherwise
 

2439
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,140
think there could be miracles otherwise
we'll know I mean the the programmer the

2440
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:36,150
we'll know I mean the the programmer the
 

2441
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,080
we'll know I mean the the programmer the
higher up the upper ones have to have

2442
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,090
higher up the upper ones have to have
 

2443
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,730
higher up the upper ones have to have
evolved gradually however the simulation

2444
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:40,740
evolved gradually however the simulation
 

2445
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,100
evolved gradually however the simulation
they create could be instantaneous I

2446
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,110
they create could be instantaneous I
 

2447
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,140
they create could be instantaneous I
mean it could be switched on and we come

2448
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:45,150
mean it could be switched on and we come
 

2449
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,420
mean it could be switched on and we come
into the world with fabricated memories

2450
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:47,430
into the world with fabricated memories
 

2451
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,820
into the world with fabricated memories
true but what I'm what I'm trying to

2452
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:49,830
true but what I'm what I'm trying to
 

2453
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,070
true but what I'm what I'm trying to
convey so you're saying the the broader

2454
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:52,080
convey so you're saying the the broader
 

2455
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,110
convey so you're saying the the broader
statement but I'm saying from an

2456
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:54,120
statement but I'm saying from an
 

2457
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,790
statement but I'm saying from an
engineering perspective both the

2458
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:55,800
engineering perspective both the
 

2459
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,580
engineering perspective both the
programmer has to be slowly evolved and

2460
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:58,590
programmer has to be slowly evolved and
 

2461
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:01,820
programmer has to be slowly evolved and
the simulation because it's like yeah

2462
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:01,830
the simulation because it's like yeah
 

2463
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,710
the simulation because it's like yeah
I'm an engineering perspective yeah it

2464
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:03,720
I'm an engineering perspective yeah it
 

2465
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,780
I'm an engineering perspective yeah it
takes a long time to write a program no

2466
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:05,790
takes a long time to write a program no
 

2467
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,880
takes a long time to write a program no
like just I don't think you can create

2468
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,890
like just I don't think you can create
 

2469
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,850
like just I don't think you can create
the universe in a snap I think you have

2470
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:10,860
the universe in a snap I think you have
 

2471
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,050
the universe in a snap I think you have
to grow it ok well that's and that's a

2472
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,060
to grow it ok well that's and that's a
 

2473
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:15,680
to grow it ok well that's and that's a
good point

2474
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:15,690
good point
 

2475
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,110
good point
that's an arguable point by the way um I

2476
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:18,120
that's an arguable point by the way um I
 

2477
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,100
that's an arguable point by the way um I
I have thought about using the Nick

2478
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,110
I have thought about using the Nick
 

2479
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:22,580
I have thought about using the Nick
Bostrom

2480
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:22,590

Bostrom
eye idea to solve the riddle of how we

2482
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:26,040
eye idea to solve the riddle of how we
 

2483
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,140
eye idea to solve the riddle of how we
were talking we were talking earlier

2484
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,150
were talking we were talking earlier
 

2485
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,960
were talking we were talking earlier
about why the human brain can achieve so

2486
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:29,970
about why the human brain can achieve so
 

2487
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:34,370
about why the human brain can achieve so
much I thought of this when my then

2488
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:34,380
much I thought of this when my then
 

2489
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,160
much I thought of this when my then
hundred year old mother was marveling at

2490
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,170
hundred year old mother was marveling at
 

2491
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,420
hundred year old mother was marveling at
what I could do with it with us

2492
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:38,430
what I could do with it with us
 

2493
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,250
what I could do with it with us
Bart phone and and I could you know

2494
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:40,260
Bart phone and and I could you know
 

2495
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,020
Bart phone and and I could you know
Koren look up anything in the

2496
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:42,030
Koren look up anything in the
 

2497
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,030
Koren look up anything in the
encyclopedia I could play her music that

2498
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,040
encyclopedia I could play her music that
 

2499
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,230
encyclopedia I could play her music that
she liked and so on Jen please it's all

2500
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:45,240
she liked and so on Jen please it's all
 

2501
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,359
she liked and so on Jen please it's all
left in that tiny little firm no it's

2502
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:47,369
left in that tiny little firm no it's
 

2503
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:48,890
left in that tiny little firm no it's
it's out there it's in it's in the cloud

2504
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:48,900
it's out there it's in it's in the cloud
 

2505
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,349
it's out there it's in it's in the cloud
it's and maybe what most of what we do

2506
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:51,359
it's and maybe what most of what we do
 

2507
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,559
it's and maybe what most of what we do
is in a cloud so maybe if if we're if we

2508
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:54,569
is in a cloud so maybe if if we're if we
 

2509
00:53:54,569 --> 00:53:58,160
is in a cloud so maybe if if we're if we
are a simulation yeah then all the power

2510
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,170
are a simulation yeah then all the power
 

2511
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,410
are a simulation yeah then all the power
that we think is in our skull it

2512
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:00,420
that we think is in our skull it
 

2513
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,059
that we think is in our skull it
actually may be like the power that we

2514
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:02,069
actually may be like the power that we
 

2515
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:04,670
actually may be like the power that we
think is in the iPhone but is that

2516
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:04,680
think is in the iPhone but is that
 

2517
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,160
think is in the iPhone but is that
actually out there it's an interface to

2518
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,170
actually out there it's an interface to
 

2519
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,359
actually out there it's an interface to
something else yeah I mean that's what

2520
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:08,369
something else yeah I mean that's what
 

2521
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:11,870
something else yeah I mean that's what

00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:59,059
able to survive and so on but that
doesn't mean that our perception

2558
00:54:59,059 --> 00:54:59,069
doesn't mean that our perception
 

2559
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:01,190
doesn't mean that our perception
actually reflects the fundamental

believe there is a fundamental reality I
do think that what the perception is

2570
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:16,250
do think that what the perception is
 

2571
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,120
do think that what the perception is
constructive in the sense that we

2572
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,130
constructive in the sense that we
 

2573
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:23,630
constructive in the sense that we
construct in our minds a model of what

construct in our minds a model of what
 

2575
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,210
construct in our minds a model of what
we're seeing and so and this is really

out other things like an echo cube which

00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,240
flipped from a two-dimensional picture
of a cube on on on sheet of paper but we

00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,250
of a cube on on on sheet of paper but we
 

2587
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,010
of a cube on on on sheet of paper but we
see it as a three-dimensional cube and

00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:43,020
see it as a three-dimensional cube and
 

2589
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,490

it flips from one orientation to another

it flips from one orientation to another
at regular intervals what's going on is

2592
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:49,380
at regular intervals what's going on is
 

2593
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,770
at regular intervals what's going on is
that the brain is is constructing a cube

2594
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:51,780
that the brain is is constructing a cube
 

2595
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,849
that the brain is is constructing a cube
but

2596
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:52,859
but
 

2597
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:55,370
but
the sense-data are compatible with two

00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,680
the sense-data are compatible with two

00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:57,690
alternative cubes and so rather than
 

2601
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,269
alternative cubes and so rather than
stick with one of them it alternates

stick with one of them it alternates

somebody who actually is say a friend of
 

2619
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:26,779
somebody who actually is say a friend of

00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:26,789
mine but I until I kind of realized that

in to invoke it yeah we do some kind of

2636
00:56:49,479 --> 00:56:49,489
in to invoke it yeah we do some kind of
 

2637
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,680
in to invoke it yeah we do some kind of
miraculous compression on this whole

2646
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:02,039
do so you've written several many
 

2647
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:06,880
do so you've written several many
amazing books but let me ask what books

2648
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:06,890
amazing books but let me ask what books
 

2649
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,259
amazing books but let me ask what books
technical or fiction of philosophical

technical or fiction of philosophical
 

2651
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:12,890
technical or fiction of philosophical
had a big impact on your own life what

had a big impact on your own life what
 

2653
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,769
had a big impact on your own life what
what books would you recommend people

2654
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:15,779
what books would you recommend people
 

2655
00:57:15,779 --> 00:57:17,420
what books would you recommend people
consider reading in their own

2656
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:17,430
consider reading in their own
 

2657
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,339
consider reading in their own
intellectual journey darling of course

2658
00:57:21,339 --> 00:57:21,349
intellectual journey darling of course
 

2659
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:25,609
intellectual journey darling of course
and the original I've actually ashamed

2660
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:25,619
and the original I've actually ashamed
 

2661
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:29,059
and the original I've actually ashamed
to say I've never read Darwin he's

to say I've never read Darwin he's
 

2663
00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:31,609
to say I've never read Darwin he's
nearly prescient because considering he
