even sure if it's a very good

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,130
even sure if it's a very good

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
that and I also suspect that you don't

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,809
that and I also suspect that you don't
go to these stages necessarily in

00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:50,819
go to these stages necessarily in
 

149
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,729
go to these stages necessarily in
succession and it's not that you work

150
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:52,739
succession and it's not that you work
 

151
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,110
succession and it's not that you work
through one stage and then you get into

152
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
through one stage and then you get into
 

153
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,570
through one stage and then you get into
the next one sometimes you revisit them

154

the next one sometimes you revisit them
 

155

sometimes stuff is happening in parallel

sometimes stuff is happening in parallel
 

157
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,190
sometimes stuff is happening in parallel
but it's I think a useful framework to

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
but it's I think a useful framework to
 

159
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,470
but it's I think a useful framework to
look at what's present in the structure

160
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,480
look at what's present in the structure
 

161
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,030
look at what's present in the structure
of a person and how they interact with

162
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
of a person and how they interact with
 

163
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,229
of a person and how they interact with
the world and how they relate to

so it's more like a philosophical

168
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:09,480
so it's more like a philosophical
 

169
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,570
so it's more like a philosophical
framework that allows you to talk about

170
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:11,580
framework that allows you to talk about
 

171
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,509
framework that allows you to talk about
how mines work and at first when we are

172
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:14,519
how mines work and at first when we are
 

173
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,970
how mines work and at first when we are
born we don't have a personal self yet I

174
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:16,980
born we don't have a personal self yet I
 

175
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,309
born we don't have a personal self yet I
think instead we have an intentional

176
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:19,319
think instead we have an intentional
 

177
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,110
think instead we have an intentional
self and this attention itself is

178
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
self and this attention itself is
 

179
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,210
self and this attention itself is
initially in the infant task that's

180
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:23,220
initially in the infant task that's
 

181
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,250
initially in the infant task that's
building a world model and also an

182
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,260
building a world model and also an
 

183
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,229
building a world model and also an
initial model of the self but mostly

184
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:27,239
initial model of the self but mostly
 

185
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,089
initial model of the self but mostly
it's building a game engine in the brain

186
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:29,099
it's building a game engine in the brain
 

187
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,089
it's building a game engine in the brain
that is tracking sensory data and uses

188
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:32,099
that is tracking sensory data and uses
 

189
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,390
that is tracking sensory data and uses
it to explain it and in some sense you

190
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,400
it to explain it and in some sense you
 

191
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,369
it to explain it and in some sense you
could compare it to game engine like

192
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:37,379
could compare it to game engine like
 

193
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,030
could compare it to game engine like

people are all not physical objects they
 

197
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,509

00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:44,519
are creation of our mind at a certain
 

199
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,210
are creation of our mind at a certain
level of core screening models that are

00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:47,220
level of core screening models that are
 

201
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,130
level of core screening models that are
mathematical that use geometry and that

202
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,140
mathematical that use geometry and that
 

203
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,830
mathematical that use geometry and that
use manipulation of objects and so on to

204
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:54,840
use manipulation of objects and so on to
 

205
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,649
use manipulation of objects and so on to
create scenes in which we can find

206
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:57,659
create scenes in which we can find
 

207
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,570
create scenes in which we can find
ourselves and interact with them so

looking down from this entire group and
 

285
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,070
looking down from this entire group and
you see how this group is looking at

286
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
you see how this group is looking at
 

287
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,170
you see how this group is looking at
this individual and everybody in the

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:53,940
yeah it's basically the way in which
 

311
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,629
yeah it's basically the way in which
people do it in this stage is that they

312
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
people do it in this stage is that they
 

313
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,390
people do it in this stage is that they
experience what are the opinions of my

314
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,400
experience what are the opinions of my
 

315
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,650
experience what are the opinions of my
environment they experience the

316
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:00,660
environment they experience the
 

317
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,969
environment they experience the
relationship that they have to their

318
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:01,979
relationship that they have to their
 

319
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,550
relationship that they have to their
environment and they resonate with

um the way in which they relate to
 

329
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,249
um the way in which they relate to
others

330
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:13,259
others
 

331
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,890
others
and at stage four you basically

332
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:15,900
and at stage four you basically
 

333
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,990
and at stage four you basically
understand that stuff is true and false

334
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
understand that stuff is true and false
 

335
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,909
understand that stuff is true and false
independently but other people believe

336
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
independently but other people believe
 

337
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,770
independently but other people believe
when you have agency over your own

338
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:21,780
when you have agency over your own
 

339
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,150
when you have agency over your own
beliefs in that stage you basically

340
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,160
beliefs in that stage you basically
 

341
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,969
beliefs in that stage you basically
discover epistemology the rules about

342
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:25,979
discover epistemology the rules about
 

343
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,430
discover epistemology the rules about
determining what's true and false so you

344
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:28,440
determining what's true and false so you
 

345
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,650
determining what's true and false so you
can you start to learn how to think

346
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:30,660
can you start to learn how to think
 

347
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,050
can you start to learn how to think
yes I mean at some level you're always

348
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,060
yes I mean at some level you're always
 

349
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,870
yes I mean at some level you're always
thinking you are constructing things and

350
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:35,880
thinking you are constructing things and
 

351
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,610
thinking you are constructing things and
I believe that this ability to reason

352
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:37,620
I believe that this ability to reason
 

353
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,770
I believe that this ability to reason
about your mental representation is what

354
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:39,780
about your mental representation is what
 

355
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,510
about your mental representation is what
we mean by thinking it's an

356
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
we mean by thinking it's an
 

357
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,309
we mean by thinking it's an
intrinsically reflexive process that

358
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:43,319
intrinsically reflexive process that
 

359
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,809
intrinsically reflexive process that
requires Consciousness without

360
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:44,819
requires Consciousness without
 

361
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,629
requires Consciousness without
Consciousness you cannot think you can

362
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:47,639
Consciousness you cannot think you can
 

363
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,850
Consciousness you cannot think you can
generate the content of feelings and so

364
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:49,860
generate the content of feelings and so
 

365
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,529
generate the content of feelings and so
on outside of Consciousness it's very

366
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:51,539
on outside of Consciousness it's very
 

367
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,510
on outside of Consciousness it's very
hard to be conscious of how your

368
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
hard to be conscious of how your
 

369
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,730
hard to be conscious of how your
feelings emerge at least in the early

370
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:55,740
feelings emerge at least in the early
 

371
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,790
feelings emerge at least in the early
stages of development but um thoughts is

372
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
stages of development but um thoughts is
 

373
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,249
stages of development but um thoughts is
something that you always control

374
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:00,259
something that you always control
 

375
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,230
something that you always control
and if you are a nerd like me

376
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,240
and if you are a nerd like me
 

377
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,210
and if you are a nerd like me
you often have to skip stage three

378
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,220
you often have to skip stage three
 

379
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,790
you often have to skip stage three
because you'd like the intuitive empathy

380
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:07,800
because you'd like the intuitive empathy
 

381
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,309
because you'd like the intuitive empathy
with others because in order to resonate

382
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
with others because in order to resonate
 

383
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,110
with others because in order to resonate
with a group you need to have a quite

384
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120
with a group you need to have a quite
 

385
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,450
with a group you need to have a quite
similar architecture and if people are

386
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,460
similar architecture and if people are
 

387
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,090
similar architecture and if people are
wired differently then it's hard for

388
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,100
wired differently then it's hard for
 

389
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,189
wired differently then it's hard for
them to resonate with other people and

390
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
them to resonate with other people and
 

391
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,490
them to resonate with other people and
basically have empathy which is not the

392
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:22,500
basically have empathy which is not the
 

393
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,890
basically have empathy which is not the
same as compassion but it is a shared

394
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:24,900
same as compassion but it is a shared
 

395
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,809
same as compassion but it is a shared
perceptual mental state empathy happens

396
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:26,819
perceptual mental state empathy happens
 

397
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,510
perceptual mental state empathy happens
not just via inference about the major

398
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
not just via inference about the major
 

399
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,390
not just via inference about the major
states of others but it's a perception

400
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
states of others but it's a perception
 

401
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,670
states of others but it's a perception
of what other people feel and where

402
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:34,680
of what other people feel and where
 

403
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,469
of what other people feel and where
they're at can't you not have empathy

404
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
they're at can't you not have empathy
 

405
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,450
they're at can't you not have empathy
while also not having a similar

406
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:38,460
while also not having a similar
 

407
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,430
while also not having a similar
architecture cognitive architecture as

408
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,440
architecture cognitive architecture as
 

409
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,110
architecture cognitive architecture as
the others in the group I think yes but

410
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
the others in the group I think yes but
 

411
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,930
the others in the group I think yes but
I experience that too but you need to

412
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940
I experience that too but you need to
 

413
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,370
I experience that too but you need to
build something that is like a meta

414
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:46,380
build something that is like a meta
 

415
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,409
build something that is like a meta
architecture you need to be able to

416
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:48,419
architecture you need to be able to
 

417
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,270
architecture you need to be able to
embrace the architecture of the other to

418
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,280
embrace the architecture of the other to
 

419
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,570
embrace the architecture of the other to
some degree also find some common ground

420
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:52,580
some degree also find some common ground
 

421
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,390
some degree also find some common ground
and it's also this issue that if you are

422
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
and it's also this issue that if you are
 

423
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,029
and it's also this issue that if you are
a nerd Nomis often so people is the

424
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
a nerd Nomis often so people is the
 

425
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,710
a nerd Nomis often so people is the
neurotypical people have difficulty to

426
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
neurotypical people have difficulty to
 

427
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,870
neurotypical people have difficulty to
resonate with you and as a result they

428
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:02,880
resonate with you and as a result they
 

429
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,629
resonate with you and as a result they
have difficult the understanding you

430
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
have difficult the understanding you
 

431
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,430
have difficult the understanding you

socializing my experiment as a child
 

451
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,230
socializing my experiment as a child
growing up was that um I did not find

452
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
growing up was that um I did not find
 

453
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,449
growing up was that um I did not find
any way to interface with the stage

any way to interface with the stage

three people and they didn't do that

456
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
three people and they didn't do that
 

457
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,969
three people and they didn't do that
with me so yeah of course they tried it

458
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:37,979
with me so yeah of course they tried it
 

459
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,550
with me so yeah of course they tried it
very hard but it was only when I entered

460
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
very hard but it was only when I entered
 

461
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,029
very hard but it was only when I entered
the mathematics school at ninth grade

462
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
the mathematics school at ninth grade
 

463
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,370
the mathematics school at ninth grade
lots of other nerds were present

464
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:46,380
lots of other nerds were present
 

465
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,110
lots of other nerds were present
um that I found people that I could

466
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,120
um that I found people that I could
 

467
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,389
um that I found people that I could
deeply resonate with and had the

468
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
deeply resonate with and had the
 

469
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,030
deeply resonate with and had the
impression that yes I have friends now I

470
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
impression that yes I have friends now I
 

471
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,310
impression that yes I have friends now I
found my own people and before that I

472
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,320
found my own people and before that I
 

473
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,870
found my own people and before that I
felt extremely lonely in the world there

474
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
felt extremely lonely in the world there
 

475
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,970
felt extremely lonely in the world there
was basically nobody I could connect to

476
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:58,980
was basically nobody I could connect to
 

477
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,009
was basically nobody I could connect to
and

478
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:01,019
and
 

479
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,630
and
I remember

480
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
I remember
 

481
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,730
I remember
um there was one moment in all these

482
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:04,740
um there was one moment in all these
 

483
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,190
um there was one moment in all these
years where I was in there was a school

484
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
years where I was in there was a school
 

485
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,130
years where I was in there was a school
exchange and it was the Russian boy kid

486
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,140
exchange and it was the Russian boy kid
 

487
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,470
exchange and it was the Russian boy kid
from the Russian garnison station in

488
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
from the Russian garnison station in
 

489
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,750
from the Russian garnison station in
Eastern Germany you visit our school and

490
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:14,760
Eastern Germany you visit our school and
 

491
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,370
Eastern Germany you visit our school and
we played a game of chess against each

we played a game of chess against each
 

493
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,410
we played a game of chess against each
other and we looked into each other's

494
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:18,420
other and we looked into each other's
 

495
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,850
other and we looked into each other's
eyes and we sat there for two hours

496
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:19,860
eyes and we sat there for two hours
 

497
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,009
eyes and we sat there for two hours
playing this game of chess and I had the

498
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:22,019
playing this game of chess and I had the
 

499
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,870
playing this game of chess and I had the
impression this is a human being he

500
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:23,880
impression this is a human being he
 

501
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,690
impression this is a human being he
understands but I understand

502
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:26,700
understands but I understand
 

503
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,090
understands but I understand

we didn't even speak the same language
 

505
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,910
we didn't even speak the same language
I wonder if uh your life could have been

I wonder if uh your life could have been
 

507
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,850
I wonder if uh your life could have been
different if you knew that it's okay to

508
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:34,860
different if you knew that it's okay to
 

509

be different to have a different
 

511
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,970
be different to have a different
architecture

512
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:37,980
architecture
 

513
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,670
architecture
whether like accepting that

514
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:40,680
whether like accepting that
 

515
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,350
whether like accepting that
the interface is hard to figure out

516
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,360
the interface is hard to figure out
 

517
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,030
the interface is hard to figure out
takes a long time to figure out and it's

518
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,040
takes a long time to figure out and it's
 

519
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,290
takes a long time to figure out and it's
okay to be different in fact it's

520
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:45,300
okay to be different in fact it's
 

521
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,150
okay to be different in fact it's
beautiful to be different

522
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160

 

523
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,190

it was not my main concern my main

524
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,200
it was not my main concern my main
 

525

concern was mostly that it was alone
 

527
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,810
concern was mostly that it was alone
right this was not so much the question

528
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:56,820
right this was not so much the question
 

529
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,930

534
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:04,920
had to deal with it but um my main issue
 

535
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,889
had to deal with it but um my main issue
was that I was not sure if I would ever

536
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:06,899
was that I was not sure if I would ever
 

537
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,650
was that I was not sure if I would ever
meet anybody growing up

538
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:09,660
meet anybody growing up
 

539
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,750
meet anybody growing up
that I would connect to at such a deep

540
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
that I would connect to at such a deep
 

541
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,130
that I would connect to at such a deep
level that I would feel that I could

542
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,140
level that I would feel that I could
 

543
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,650
level that I would feel that I could
belong so there's a visceral undeniable

feeling of being alone yes and I noticed
 

547
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,870
feeling of being alone yes and I noticed
the same thing when I came into the math

548
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
the same thing when I came into the math
 

549
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,910
the same thing when I came into the math
school that I think

550
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:22,920
school that I think
 

551
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,829
school that I think
at least half probably two-thirds of

552
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:24,839
at least half probably two-thirds of
 

553
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,930
at least half probably two-thirds of
these kids were severely traumatized as

554
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:26,940
these kids were severely traumatized as
 

555
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,690
these kids were severely traumatized as
uh children growing up and in large part

556
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:29,700
uh children growing up and in large part
 

557
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,130
uh children growing up and in large part
due to being alone

558
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,140
due to being alone
 

559
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,170
due to being alone
because they couldn't find anybody to

560
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,180
because they couldn't find anybody to
 

561
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,670
because they couldn't find anybody to
relate to don't you think everybody's

562
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:34,680
relate to don't you think everybody's
 

563
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,949

alone deep down no

564
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
alone deep down no
 

565
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,269
alone deep down no
huh

566
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279

 

567
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,190

I'm not alone anymore it took me some

568
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm not alone anymore it took me some
 

569
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,990
I'm not alone anymore it took me some
time to update and to get over the

570
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
time to update and to get over the
 

571
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,870
time to update and to get over the
traumata and so on but I felt that in my

572
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
traumata and so on but I felt that in my
 

573
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,870
traumata and so on but I felt that in my
20s I had lots of friends and I had my

574
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
20s I had lots of friends and I had my
 

575

20s I had lots of friends and I had my
place in about and it was I had no

576
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:56,519
place in about and it was I had no
 

577
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,069
place in about and it was I had no
longer doubts that

578
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
longer doubts that
 

579
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,470
longer doubts that
I would never be alone again

580
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
I would never be alone again
 

581
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,269
I would never be alone again
is there some aspect to which We're

582
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:02,279
is there some aspect to which We're
 

583
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,009
is there some aspect to which We're
Alone Together you don't see a deep

584
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:04,019
Alone Together you don't see a deep
 

585
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,790
Alone Together you don't see a deep
loneliness inside yourself still no

586
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:07,800
loneliness inside yourself still no
 

587
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,370
loneliness inside yourself still no
sorry

588
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,380

 

589
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,230

okay so that's the non-linear

590
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
okay so that's the non-linear
 

591
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,850
okay so that's the non-linear
progression through the stages I suppose

592
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:13,860
progression through the stages I suppose
 

593
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,410
progression through the stages I suppose
you caught up on stage three something

594
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:15,420
you caught up on stage three something
 

595
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,750
you caught up on stage three something
very it's stage four and so basically I

596
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
very it's stage four and so basically I
 

597
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,790
very it's stage four and so basically I
find that many Nerds jump straight into

598
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:19,800
find that many Nerds jump straight into
 

599
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,550
find that many Nerds jump straight into
stage four bypassing stage three did

600
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
stage four bypassing stage three did
 

601
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,590
stage four bypassing stage three did
they return to it then later yeah of

602
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:24,600
they return to it then later yeah of
 

603
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,930
they return to it then later yeah of
course they sometimes they do not always

604
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:26,940
course they sometimes they do not always
 

605
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,790
course they sometimes they do not always
yeah the question is basically do you

606
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
yeah the question is basically do you
 

607
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,829
yeah the question is basically do you
stay a little bit Autistic or do you

608
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:30,839
stay a little bit Autistic or do you
 

609
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,230
stay a little bit Autistic or do you
catch up and I believe you can catch up

610
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,240
catch up and I believe you can catch up
 

611
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,329
catch up and I believe you can catch up
you can build this missing structure

612
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:35,339
you can build this missing structure
 

613
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,690
you can build this missing structure
yeah and um I basically experience

614
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:38,700
yeah and um I basically experience
 

615
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,190
yeah and um I basically experience
yourself as part of a group learn

616
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,200
yourself as part of a group learn
 

617
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,230
yourself as part of a group learn
intuitive empathy and develop the sense

618
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
intuitive empathy and develop the sense
 

619
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,569
intuitive empathy and develop the sense
this percept perceptual sense of feeling

620
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:44,579
this percept perceptual sense of feeling
 

621
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,690
this percept perceptual sense of feeling
what other people fear and before that I

622
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:47,700
what other people fear and before that I
 

623
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,190
what other people fear and before that I
could only basically feel this when I

624
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
could only basically feel this when I
 

625
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,569
could only basically feel this when I
was deeply enough for somebody and

626
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:50,579
was deeply enough for somebody and
 

627
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,170
was deeply enough for somebody and
visitor so there's a lot of friction to

628
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,180
visitor so there's a lot of friction to
 

629
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,449
visitor so there's a lot of friction to
feeling that way like it takes it only

630
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:56,459
feeling that way like it takes it only
 

631
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,310
feeling that way like it takes it only
with certain people as opposed to It

632
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
with certain people as opposed to It
 

633
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,810
with certain people as opposed to It
comes naturally yeah it's frictionless

634
00:11:59,810 --> 00:11:59,820
comes naturally yeah it's frictionless
 

635
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,850
comes naturally yeah it's frictionless
but um this is something that basically

636
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:01,860
but um this is something that basically
 

637
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,430
but um this is something that basically
later I felt started to resolve itself

638
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:04,440
later I felt started to resolve itself
 

639
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,949
later I felt started to resolve itself
for me to a large degree what was the

640
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
for me to a large degree what was the
 

641
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,829
for me to a large degree what was the
trick

642
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839

 

643
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,930

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:11,940
in many ways scoring up and paying
 

645
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,050
in many ways scoring up and paying
attention

attention
 

647

attention
meditation the top I had some very

648
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,100
meditation the top I had some very
 

649
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,069
meditation the top I had some very
crucial experiences

650
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:19,079

at some point you realize oh it's no
 

677
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,430
at some point you realize oh it's no
longer that I feel locked out but I feel

678
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
longer that I feel locked out but I feel
 

679
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,829

684
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:02,940
is racing very fast at a high frequency
 

685
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,430
is racing very fast at a high frequency
so it's not always working like this

686
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:04,440
so it's not always working like this
 

687
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,350
so it's not always working like this
sometimes works better sometimes it

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
works less but also don't see this as a

observe myself which frequency I'm at
 

695
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,410
observe myself which frequency I'm at
and uh at which mode somebody else is at

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:44,520
and you notice it's a representation and
 

1089
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,549
and you notice it's a representation and
you might also notice that the word that

1090
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
you might also notice that the word that
 

1091
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,470
you might also notice that the word that
is being created is a representation if

1092
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
is being created is a representation if
 

1093

also do it during the day and the reason

1132
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
also do it during the day and the reason
 

1133
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,570
also do it during the day and the reason
why we don't get to do this from the

1134
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:32,580
why we don't get to do this from the
 

1135
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,310
why we don't get to do this from the
beginning and why we don't have agency

1136
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
beginning and why we don't have agency
 

1137
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,470
beginning and why we don't have agency
of our feelings right away is because we

1138
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
of our feelings right away is because we
 

1139
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,330
of our feelings right away is because we
would game it before they have the

1140
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,340
would game it before they have the
 

1141
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,390
would game it before they have the
necessary amount of wisdom to uh to deal

1142
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:41,400
necessary amount of wisdom to uh to deal
 

1143
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,610
necessary amount of wisdom to uh to deal
with creating this dream that we are in

1144
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:43,620
with creating this dream that we are in
 

1145
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,770
with creating this dream that we are in
you know you don't want to get access to

1146
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:45,780
you know you don't want to get access to
 

1147
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,110
you know you don't want to get access to
cheat codes too quickly otherwise you

1148
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,120
cheat codes too quickly otherwise you
 

1149
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,990
cheat codes too quickly otherwise you
won't enjoy so stage five is already

1150
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,000
won't enjoy so stage five is already
 

1151
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,090
won't enjoy so stage five is already
pretty rare and Stage six is even more

1152
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:53,100
pretty rare and Stage six is even more
 

1153
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,310
pretty rare and Stage six is even more
rare you both basically find this mostly

1154
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,320
rare you both basically find this mostly
 

1155
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,950
rare you both basically find this mostly
this Advanced Buddhist meditators and so

1156
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:57,960
this Advanced Buddhist meditators and so
 

1157
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,950
this Advanced Buddhist meditators and so
on that uh dropping into this stage and

1158
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
on that uh dropping into this stage and
 

1159
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,649
on that uh dropping into this stage and
can induce it as well and spend time in

1160
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:03,659
can induce it as well and spend time in
 

1161
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,390
can induce it as well and spend time in
it so stage five acquires a good

1162
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,400
it so stage five acquires a good
 

1163
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,930
it so stage five acquires a good
therapist stage six requires a good uh

1164
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:08,940
therapist stage six requires a good uh
 

1165
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,210
therapist stage six requires a good uh
Buddhist

spiritual leader it is for instance

1168
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:13,380
spiritual leader it is for instance

could be that is the right thing to do

1170
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
could be that is the right thing to do
 

1171
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,110
could be that is the right thing to do
but it's not that these stages give you

1172
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,120
but it's not that these stages give you
 

1173
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,390
but it's not that these stages give you
scores or levels that you need to

1174
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
scores or levels that you need to
 

1175
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,850
scores or levels that you need to
advance to it's not that the next stage

1176
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:22,860
advance to it's not that the next stage
 

1177
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,250
advance to it's not that the next stage
is better you live your life in in the

1178
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,260
is better you live your life in in the
 

1179
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,110
is better you live your life in in the
motto it works best at any given moment

1180
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,120
motto it works best at any given moment
 

1181
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,149
motto it works best at any given moment
and when your mind decides that you

1182
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:29,159
and when your mind decides that you
 

1183
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,890
and when your mind decides that you
should uh have a different configuration

1184
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:30,900
should uh have a different configuration
 

1185
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,870
should uh have a different configuration
then it's building that configuration

1186
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
then it's building that configuration
 

1187
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,649
then it's building that configuration
and for many people they stay happily at

1188
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:36,659
and for many people they stay happily at
 

1189
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,510
and for many people they stay happily at
stage three and experiences themselves

1190
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:38,520
stage three and experiences themselves
 

1191
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,370
stage three and experiences themselves
as part of groups and there's nothing

1192
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:40,380
as part of groups and there's nothing
 

1193
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,230
as part of groups and there's nothing
wrong with this and for some people this

1194
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
wrong with this and for some people this
 

1195
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,270
wrong with this and for some people this
doesn't work and they're forced to build

1196
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,280
doesn't work and they're forced to build
 

1197
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,909
doesn't work and they're forced to build
more agency over their rational beliefs

1198
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:46,919
more agency over their rational beliefs
 

1199
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,649
more agency over their rational beliefs
than this and construct their Norms

1200
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:48,659
than this and construct their Norms
 

1201
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,250
than this and construct their Norms
rationally and so they go to this level

1202
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,260
rationally and so they go to this level
 

1203
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,169
rationally and so they go to this level
and Stage seven is something that is

1204
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:54,179
and Stage seven is something that is
 

1205
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,029
and Stage seven is something that is
more or less hypothetical that would be

1206
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:56,039
more or less hypothetical that would be
 

1207
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,070
more or less hypothetical that would be
the stage in which it's basically a

1208
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
the stage in which it's basically a
 

1209
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,750
the stage in which it's basically a
transhuman stage in which you understand

1210
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
transhuman stage in which you understand
 

1211
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,970
transhuman stage in which you understand
how you work and which the Mind fully

1212
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:01,980
how you work and which the Mind fully
 

1213
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,090
how you work and which the Mind fully
realizes how it's implemented and can

1214
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,100
realizes how it's implemented and can
 

1215
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,310
realizes how it's implemented and can
also in principle enter different modes

1216
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:07,320
also in principle enter different modes
 

1217
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,750
also in principle enter different modes
in which it could be implemented and

1218
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:08,760
in which it could be implemented and
 

1219
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,390
in which it could be implemented and
that's the stage that as as far as I

1220
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:11,400
that's the stage that as as far as I
 

1221
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,450
that's the stage that as as far as I
understand is not open to people yet

1222
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:14,460
understand is not open to people yet
 

1223
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,149
understand is not open to people yet
oh but it is possible to the process of

1224
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:17,159
oh but it is possible to the process of
 

1225
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,789
oh but it is possible to the process of
Technology yes and who knows if there

1226
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:19,799
Technology yes and who knows if there
 

1227
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,789
Technology yes and who knows if there
are biological agents that are working

1228
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
are biological agents that are working
 

1229
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,409
are biological agents that are working
at different time skills than us that

1230
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:24,419
at different time skills than us that
 

1231
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,909
at different time skills than us that
basically become aware of the way in

1232
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
basically become aware of the way in
 

1233
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,669
basically become aware of the way in
which they are implemented on ecosystems

1234
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:27,679
which they are implemented on ecosystems
 

1235
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,770
which they are implemented on ecosystems
and can change that implementation and

1236
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:30,780
and can change that implementation and
 

1237
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,289
and can change that implementation and
have agency over how they implemented in

1238
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:33,299
have agency over how they implemented in
 

1239
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,390
have agency over how they implemented in
the world and what I find interesting

1240
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:35,400
the world and what I find interesting
 

1241
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,370
the world and what I find interesting
about the discussion about AI alignment

1242
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:37,380
about the discussion about AI alignment
 

1243
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,190
about the discussion about AI alignment
that it seems to be following these

1244
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,200
that it seems to be following these
 

1245
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,169
that it seems to be following these
status very much most people seem to be

1246
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:42,179
status very much most people seem to be
 

1247
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,210
status very much most people seem to be
in stage three also according to Robert

1248
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,220
in stage three also according to Robert
 

1249
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,210
in stage three also according to Robert
Keegan I think he says that about 85

1250
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:47,220
Keegan I think he says that about 85
 

1251
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,190
Keegan I think he says that about 85
percent of people are in stage three and

1252
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
percent of people are in stage three and
 

1253
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,649
percent of people are in stage three and
stay there and if you're in stage fear

1254
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:51,659
stay there and if you're in stage fear
 

1255
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,230
stay there and if you're in stage fear
for a three and your opinions are the

1256
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
for a three and your opinions are the
 

1257
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,470
for a three and your opinions are the
result of social assimilation then what

1258
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:57,480
result of social assimilation then what
 

1259
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,090
result of social assimilation then what
you're mostly worried about and the AI

1260
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,100
you're mostly worried about and the AI
 

1261
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,070
you're mostly worried about and the AI
is that the AI might have the wrong

1262
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,080
is that the AI might have the wrong
 

1263
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,409
is that the AI might have the wrong
opinions so if the AI is just something

1264
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:03,419
opinions so if the AI is just something
 

1265
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,510
opinions so if the AI is just something
racist or sexist we are all lost because

1266
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
racist or sexist we are all lost because
 

1267
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,430
racist or sexist we are all lost because
we will assimilate the wrong opinions

1268
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
we will assimilate the wrong opinions
 

1269
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,110
we will assimilate the wrong opinions
from the AI and so we need to make sure

1270
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120
from the AI and so we need to make sure
 

1271
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,570
from the AI and so we need to make sure
that the AI has the right opinions and

1272
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:11,580
that the AI has the right opinions and
 

1273
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,130
that the AI has the right opinions and
the right values and the right structure

1274
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,140
the right values and the right structure
 

1275
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,149
the right values and the right structure
and

1276
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
and
 

1277
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,490
and
and if you are at stage four that's not

1278
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:16,500
and if you are at stage four that's not
 

1279
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,590
and if you are at stage four that's not
your main concern and so most nerds I

1280
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:18,600
your main concern and so most nerds I
 

1281
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,510
your main concern and so most nerds I
don't really worry about

1282
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:20,520
don't really worry about
 

1283
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,210
don't really worry about
um the algorithmic bias and the model

1284
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:23,220
um the algorithmic bias and the model
 

1285
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,590
um the algorithmic bias and the model
that it picks up because if there's

1286
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:24,600
that it picks up because if there's
 

1287
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,630
that it picks up because if there's
something wrong with this bias the AI

1288
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
something wrong with this bias the AI
 

1289
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,190
something wrong with this bias the AI
ultimately will prove it at some point

1290
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,200
ultimately will prove it at some point
 

1291
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,390
ultimately will prove it at some point
we'll get it there that it makes

1292
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:29,400
we'll get it there that it makes
 

1293
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,909
we'll get it there that it makes
mathematical proofs about reality and

1294
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:31,919
mathematical proofs about reality and
 

1295
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,070
mathematical proofs about reality and
then it will figure out what's true and

1296
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
then it will figure out what's true and
 

1297
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,810
then it will figure out what's true and
what's false but you're still worried

1298
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:35,820
what's false but you're still worried
 

1299
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,149
what's false but you're still worried
that AI might turn you into paper clips

1300
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
that AI might turn you into paper clips
 

1301
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,710
that AI might turn you into paper clips
because it might have the wrong values

1302
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720
because it might have the wrong values
 

1303
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,870
because it might have the wrong values
right so if it's set up is there a wrong

1304
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:41,880
right so if it's set up is there a wrong
 

1305
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,570
right so if it's set up is there a wrong
function that controls its direction in

1306
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:44,580
function that controls its direction in
 

1307
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,029
function that controls its direction in
the world then it might do something

1308
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
the world then it might do something
 

1309
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,470
the world then it might do something
that is completely horrible and there's

1310
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
that is completely horrible and there's
 

1311
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,270
that is completely horrible and there's
no easy way to fix it so that's more

1312
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,280
no easy way to fix it so that's more
 

1313
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,010
no easy way to fix it so that's more
like a stage four rational as kind of

1314
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:52,020
like a stage four rational as kind of
 

1315
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,810
like a stage four rational as kind of
worry and if you are at stage five

1316
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:53,820
worry and if you are at stage five
 

1317
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,149
worry and if you are at stage five
you're mostly worried that AI is not

1318
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
you're mostly worried that AI is not
 

1319
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,470
you're mostly worried that AI is not
going to be enlightened fast enough

1320
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,480
going to be enlightened fast enough
 

1321
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,570
going to be enlightened fast enough
because you realize that the game is not

1322
00:24:59,570 --> 00:24:59,580
because you realize that the game is not
 

1323
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,070
because you realize that the game is not
so much about intelligence but about

1324
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,080
so much about intelligence but about
 

1325
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,070
so much about intelligence but about
agency about the ability to control the

1326
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
agency about the ability to control the
 

1327
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,890
agency about the ability to control the
future and the identity is instrumental

1328
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:06,900
future and the identity is instrumental
 

1329
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,250
future and the identity is instrumental
to this and if you are Are a Human Being

1330
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:10,260
to this and if you are Are a Human Being
 

1331
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,470
to this and if you are Are a Human Being
I think at some level you ought to

1332
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
I think at some level you ought to
 

1333
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,930
I think at some level you ought to
choose your own identity it's you should

1334
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:14,940
choose your own identity it's you should
 

1335
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,909
choose your own identity it's you should
not have somebody else pick the costume

1336
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:16,919
not have somebody else pick the costume
 

1337
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,370
not have somebody else pick the costume
for you and then wear it but instead you

1338
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,380
for you and then wear it but instead you
 

1339
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,350
for you and then wear it but instead you
should be mindful about what you want to

1340
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
should be mindful about what you want to
 

1341
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,409
should be mindful about what you want to
be in as well and I think if you are an

1342
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:24,419
be in as well and I think if you are an
 

1343
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,510
be in as well and I think if you are an
agent that is fully malleable that can

1344
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:26,520
agent that is fully malleable that can
 

1345
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,730
agent that is fully malleable that can
rewrite its own source code like an AI

1346
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:28,740
rewrite its own source code like an AI
 

1347
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,549
rewrite its own source code like an AI
might do at some point then the identity

1348
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:31,559
might do at some point then the identity
 

1349
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,710
might do at some point then the identity
that you will have is whatever you can

1350
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:33,720
that you will have is whatever you can
 

1351
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,490
that you will have is whatever you can
be

be

be
and in this way the AI will maybe become

1354
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
and in this way the AI will maybe become
 

1355
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,850
and in this way the AI will maybe become
everything like a planetary control

everything like a planetary control
 

1357
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,870
everything like a planetary control
system and if it does that then if we

system and if it does that then if we
 

1359

want to coexist with it it means that it

1360
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:47,700
want to coexist with it it means that it
 

1361
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,149
want to coexist with it it means that it
will have to share purposes with us so

1362
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
will have to share purposes with us so
 

1363
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,350
will have to share purposes with us so
it cannot be a transactional

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
it cannot be a transactional

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,029
it cannot be a transactional

but this has to happen it's probably

is missing in much of the discourse and

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,470
is missing in much of the discourse and
I think that we need in some sense

I think that we need in some sense

well I think this is a good opportunity

1412
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:45,419
well I think this is a good opportunity
 

1413
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,510
well I think this is a good opportunity
to try to sneak up to the idea of

uh so you wrote a series of good tweets

1418
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,200
uh so you wrote a series of good tweets
 

1419
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,710
uh so you wrote a series of good tweets
about Consciousness and pen psychism so

1420
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
about Consciousness and pen psychism so
 

1421
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,870
about Consciousness and pen psychism so
let's break it down first you say I

1422
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
let's break it down first you say I
 

1423
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,970
let's break it down first you say I
suspect the experience that leads to the

this actually eventually leads us to a

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:18,600
this actually eventually leads us to a
 

1441
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,970
this actually eventually leads us to a
lot of interesting questions about Ai

1442
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:19,980
lot of interesting questions about Ai
 

1443
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,590
lot of interesting questions about Ai
and AGI but let's start with this

1444
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
and AGI but let's start with this
 

1445
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,409
and AGI but let's start with this
representation what is this resonant

1446
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:24,419
representation what is this resonant
 

1447
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,710
representation what is this resonant
Universe representation and what do you

1448
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:27,720
Universe representation and what do you
 

1449
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,510
Universe representation and what do you
think do we share such a representation

1450
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520
think do we share such a representation
 

1451
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,810
think do we share such a representation
the neuroscientist grossberg has come up

1452
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:32,820
the neuroscientist grossberg has come up
 

1453
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,549
the neuroscientist grossberg has come up
with the cognitive architecture that he

1454
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
with the cognitive architecture that he
 

1455
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,490
with the cognitive architecture that he
calls the Adaptive resonance Theory and

1456
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:37,500
calls the Adaptive resonance Theory and
 

1457
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,669
calls the Adaptive resonance Theory and
his perspective is that our neurons can

1458
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:40,679
his perspective is that our neurons can
 

1459
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,010
his perspective is that our neurons can
be understood as oscillators that are

1460
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,020
be understood as oscillators that are
 

1461
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,930
be understood as oscillators that are
resonating with each other and this

1462
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:44,940
resonating with each other and this
 

1463
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,669
resonating with each other and this
outside phenomena

1464
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:46,679
outside phenomena
 

1465
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,529
outside phenomena
so the course grain model of the

1466
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:48,539
so the course grain model of the
 

1467
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,330
so the course grain model of the
universe that we are building in some

1468
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:50,340
universe that we are building in some
 

1469
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,390
universe that we are building in some
sense is a resonance with objects and

1470
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:53,400
sense is a resonance with objects and
 

1471
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,570
sense is a resonance with objects and
outside of us in the world so basically

1472
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:56,580
outside of us in the world so basically
 

1473
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,490
outside of us in the world so basically
we take up patterns that of the

1474
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:58,500
we take up patterns that of the
 

1475
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,529
we take up patterns that of the
University if we are coupled with and

1476
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:00,539
University if we are coupled with and
 

1477
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,289
University if we are coupled with and
our brain is not so much

1478
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:03,299
our brain is not so much
 

1479
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,450
our brain is not so much
understood as circuitry even though this

1480
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:05,460
understood as circuitry even though this
 

1481
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,570
understood as circuitry even though this
perspective is valid but it's almost an

1482
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:08,580
perspective is valid but it's almost an
 

1483
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,370
perspective is valid but it's almost an
ether in which the individual neurons

1484
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:10,380
ether in which the individual neurons
 

1485
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,669
ether in which the individual neurons
are passing on camera electrical signals

1486
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
are passing on camera electrical signals
 

1487
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,830
are passing on camera electrical signals
or arbitrary signals across all

1488
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
or arbitrary signals across all
 

1489
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,390
or arbitrary signals across all
modalities that can be transmitted

1490
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:17,400
modalities that can be transmitted
 

1491
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,669

between cells stimulate each other in

1492
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:19,679
between cells stimulate each other in
 

1493
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,190
between cells stimulate each other in
this way and produce patterns that they

1494
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,200
this way and produce patterns that they
 

1495
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,130
this way and produce patterns that they
modulate while passing them on and this

1496
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:25,140
modulate while passing them on and this
 

1497
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,350
modulate while passing them on and this
speed of signal progression in the brain

1498
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
speed of signal progression in the brain
 

1499
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,850
speed of signal progression in the brain
is roughly at the speed of sound

1500
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:28,860
is roughly at the speed of sound
 

1501
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,850
is roughly at the speed of sound
incidentally because the time that it

1502
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:31,860
incidentally because the time that it
 

1503
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,250
incidentally because the time that it
takes for the signals to hop from cell

1504
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,260
takes for the signals to hop from cell
 

1505
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,230
takes for the signals to hop from cell
to cell which means it's relatively slow

1506
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240
to cell which means it's relatively slow
 

1507
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,870
to cell which means it's relatively slow
with respect to the world it takes in a

1508
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
with respect to the world it takes in a
 

1509
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,669
with respect to the world it takes in a
pressurable fraction of a second for a

1510
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:40,679
pressurable fraction of a second for a
 

1511
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,990
pressurable fraction of a second for a
signal to go through the entire

1512
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
signal to go through the entire
 

1513
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,610
signal to go through the entire
neocortex something like a few hundred

1514
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:43,620
neocortex something like a few hundred
 

1515
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,470
neocortex something like a few hundred
milliseconds and so there's a lot of

1516
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:45,480
milliseconds and so there's a lot of
 

1517
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,210
milliseconds and so there's a lot of
stuff happening in that time where the

1518
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:47,220
stuff happening in that time where the
 

1519
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,130
stuff happening in that time where the
signal is passing through your brain

1520
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,140
signal is passing through your brain
 

1521
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,529
signal is passing through your brain
including in the brain itself so nothing

1522
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:51,539
including in the brain itself so nothing
 

1523
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,930
including in the brain itself so nothing
in the brain is assuming that stuff

1524
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:53,940
in the brain is assuming that stuff
 

1525
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,210
in the brain is assuming that stuff
happens simultaneously everything in the

00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:56,220
happens simultaneously everything in the
 

1527
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,090
happens simultaneously everything in the
brain is working in a paradigm where the

00:28:59,090 --> 00:28:59,100
brain is working in a paradigm where the
 

1529
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,310

believe that you get this experience
because your mind is modeling the fact

because your mind is modeling the fact

00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,370
because your mind is modeling the fact
that you are no longer identified with

that you are no longer identified with
the personal self on that state but you

00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:54,840
the personal self on that state but you
 

1579
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,810
the personal self on that state but you
have transcended this division between

00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:56,820
have transcended this division between
 

1581
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,149
have transcended this division between
the self model and the world model and

00:29:59,149 --> 00:29:59,159
the self model and the world model and
 

1583
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,250
the self model and the world model and
you are experiencing yourself as your

you are experiencing yourself as your

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,710
you are experiencing yourself as your
mind as something that is representing a

mind as something that is representing a
 

1587
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,330
mind as something that is representing a
universe so that's still part of the

universe so that's still part of the
 

1589
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,789
universe so that's still part of the

1590
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:07,799
model yes so it's inside of the model
 

1591
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,250
model yes so it's inside of the model
still you are still inside of patterns

1592
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:10,260
still you are still inside of patterns
 

1593
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,049
still you are still inside of patterns
that are generated in your brain and in

that are generated in your brain and in
 

1595
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,990
that are generated in your brain and in
your organism and what you are now

your organism and what you are now
 

1597
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,970
your organism and what you are now
experiencing is that you're no longer

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:16,980
experiencing is that you're no longer
 

1599
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,310
experiencing is that you're no longer
this personal self in there but you are

1600
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,320
this personal self in there but you are
 

1601
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,889
this personal self in there but you are
the entirety of the mind on the its

00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:21,899
the entirety of the mind on the its
 

1603
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,409
the entirety of the mind on the its
contents why is it so hard to get there

1604
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:24,419
contents why is it so hard to get there
 

1605
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,049
contents why is it so hard to get there
a lot of people who get into the state

1606
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:27,059
a lot of people who get into the state
 

1607
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,669
a lot of people who get into the state
think this or associated with

1608
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:28,679
think this or associated with
 

1609
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,590
think this or associated with
Enlightenment I suspect it's a favorite

1610
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:30,600
Enlightenment I suspect it's a favorite
 

1611
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,409
Enlightenment I suspect it's a favorite
training goal for a number of meditators

1612
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:33,419
training goal for a number of meditators
 

1613
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,190
training goal for a number of meditators
but um I think that Enlightenment is in

1614
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
but um I think that Enlightenment is in
 

1615
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,289
but um I think that Enlightenment is in
some sense more mundane and it's a step

1616
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:39,299
some sense more mundane and it's a step
 

1617
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,110
some sense more mundane and it's a step
further or sideways it's the state where

1618
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,120
further or sideways it's the state where
 

1619
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,490
further or sideways it's the state where
you realize that everything is a

1620
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:43,500
you realize that everything is a
 

1621
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,169
you realize that everything is a
representation yeah you say

1622
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:45,179
representation yeah you say
 

1623
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,810
representation yeah you say
Enlightenment is a realization of how

1624
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:47,820
Enlightenment is a realization of how
 

1625
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,450
Enlightenment is a realization of how
experience is implemented yes so

1626
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:50,460
experience is implemented yes so
 

1627
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,850
experience is implemented yes so
basically you notice at some point that

1628
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:52,860
basically you notice at some point that
 

1629
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,010
basically you notice at some point that
your qualia can be deconstructed

1630
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,020
your qualia can be deconstructed
 

1631
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,830
your qualia can be deconstructed
reverse engineered what like uh almost

1632
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:57,840
reverse engineered what like uh almost
 

1633
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,769
reverse engineered what like uh almost
like a schematic of it what what uh

1634
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:00,779
like a schematic of it what what uh
 

1635
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,049
like a schematic of it what what uh
you can start with uh looking at the

1636
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:03,059
you can start with uh looking at the
 

1637
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,850
you can start with uh looking at the
face when we look at your own face in

1638
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:04,860
face when we look at your own face in
 

1639
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,789
face when we look at your own face in
the mirror yeah look at your face for a

1640
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:07,799
the mirror yeah look at your face for a
 

1641
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,830
the mirror yeah look at your face for a
few hours in a mirror or for a few

1642
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
few hours in a mirror or for a few
 

1643
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,930
few hours in a mirror or for a few
minutes at some point it will look very

1644
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:11,940
minutes at some point it will look very
 

1645
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,669
minutes at some point it will look very
weird and you because you notice that

1646
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:13,679
weird and you because you notice that
 

1647
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,769
weird and you because you notice that
there's actually no face you basically

1648
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:15,779
there's actually no face you basically
 

1649
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,450
there's actually no face you basically
start unseeing the face what you see is

1650
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:17,460
start unseeing the face what you see is
 

1651
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,570
start unseeing the face what you see is
the geometry and then you can just

1652
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:19,580
the geometry and then you can just
 

1653
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,490
the geometry and then you can just
assemble the geometry and realize how

1654
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:22,500
assemble the geometry and realize how
 

1655
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,169
assemble the geometry and realize how
that geometry is being constructed in

1656
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:24,179
that geometry is being constructed in
 

1657
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,250
that geometry is being constructed in
your mind

1658
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:25,260
your mind
 

1659
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,529
your mind
and you can learn to modify this so

1660
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:27,539
and you can learn to modify this so
 

1661
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,810
and you can learn to modify this so
basically you can change these

1662
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:29,820
basically you can change these
 

1663
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,510
basically you can change these
generators in your own mind to shift the

1664
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:32,520
generators in your own mind to shift the
 

1665
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,789
generators in your own mind to shift the
face around or to change the

1666
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
face around or to change the
 

1667
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,250
face around or to change the
construction of the face to change the

1668
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,260
construction of the face to change the
 

1669
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,450
construction of the face to change the
way in which the features are being

1670
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:38,460
way in which the features are being
 

1671
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,370
way in which the features are being
assembled why don't we do that more

1672
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:40,380
assembled why don't we do that more
 

1673
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,230
assembled why don't we do that more
often why don't we

1674
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
often why don't we
 

1675
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,269
often why don't we
start really messing with reality

1676
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:44,279
start really messing with reality
 

1677
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,370
start really messing with reality
without the use of drugs

1678
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:46,380
without the use of drugs
 

1679
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,710
without the use of drugs
or anything else why don't we get good

1680
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
or anything else why don't we get good
 

1681
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,250
or anything else why don't we get good
at this kind of thing like uh

1682
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:52,260
at this kind of thing like uh
 

1683
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,190
at this kind of thing like uh
um intentionally oh why should we

1684
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
um intentionally oh why should we
 

1685
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,669
um intentionally oh why should we
if I would because you can morph reality

1686
00:31:58,669 --> 00:31:58,679
if I would because you can morph reality
 

1687
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,350
if I would because you can morph reality
into something

1688
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:00,360
into something
 

1689
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,930
into something
more pleasant for yourself just have fun

1690
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:02,940
more pleasant for yourself just have fun
 

1691
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,130
more pleasant for yourself just have fun
with it

1692
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,140
with it
 

1693
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,870
with it
yeah that is probably what you shouldn't

1694
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:05,880
yeah that is probably what you shouldn't
 

1695
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,269
yeah that is probably what you shouldn't
be doing right because outside of your

1696
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:08,279
be doing right because outside of your
 

1697
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,730
be doing right because outside of your
personal self this outer mind is

1698
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:10,740
personal self this outer mind is
 

1699
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,710
personal self this outer mind is
probably a relatively smart agent and

1700
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
probably a relatively smart agent and
 

1701
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,269
probably a relatively smart agent and
what you often notice is that you have

1702
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:14,279
what you often notice is that you have
 

1703
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,250
what you often notice is that you have
thoughts about how you should live but

1704
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,260
thoughts about how you should live but
 

1705
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,630
thoughts about how you should live but
you observe yourself doing different

1706
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:17,640
you observe yourself doing different
 

1707
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,669
you observe yourself doing different
things and have different feelings and

1708
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
things and have different feelings and
 

1709
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,529
things and have different feelings and
that's because your outer mind doesn't

1710
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:21,539
that's because your outer mind doesn't
 

1711
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,690
that's because your outer mind doesn't
believe you

1712
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:22,700
believe you
 

1713
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,710
believe you
and doesn't believe your rational

1714
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
and doesn't believe your rational
 

1715
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,409
and doesn't believe your rational
thoughts well can't you just silence the

1716
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:27,419
thoughts well can't you just silence the
 

1717
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,269
thoughts well can't you just silence the
outer mind the thing is that the outer

1718
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
outer mind the thing is that the outer
 

1719
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,250
outer mind the thing is that the outer
mind is usually smarter than you are

1720
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:31,260
mind is usually smarter than you are
 

1721
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,250
mind is usually smarter than you are
rational thinking is very brittle it's

1722
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,260
rational thinking is very brittle it's
 

1723
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,409
rational thinking is very brittle it's
very hard to use logic and symbolic

1724
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:36,419
very hard to use logic and symbolic
 

1725
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,090
very hard to use logic and symbolic
thinking to have an accurate model of

1726
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:38,100
thinking to have an accurate model of
 

1727
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,990
thinking to have an accurate model of
the world

1728
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,000
the world
 

1729
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,269
the world
so there is often an underlying system

1730
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
so there is often an underlying system
 

1731
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,710
so there is often an underlying system
that is looking at your rational

1732
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
that is looking at your rational
 

1733
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,510
that is looking at your rational
thoughts and then tells you no you're

1734
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:44,520
thoughts and then tells you no you're
 

1735
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,669
thoughts and then tells you no you're
still missing something your gut feeling

1736
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:46,679
still missing something your gut feeling
 

1737
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,310
still missing something your gut feeling
is still saying something else and this

1738
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,320
is still saying something else and this
 

1739
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,130
is still saying something else and this
can be for instance you find a partner

1740
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,140
can be for instance you find a partner
 

1741
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,169
can be for instance you find a partner
that looks perfect or you find a deal

1742
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:54,179
that looks perfect or you find a deal
 

1743
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,570
that looks perfect or you find a deal
when you build a company or whatever

1744
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:56,580
when you build a company or whatever
 

1745
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,789
when you build a company or whatever
that looks perfect to you and yet at

1746
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
that looks perfect to you and yet at
 

1747
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,289
that looks perfect to you and yet at
some level you feel something is off and

1748
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:00,299
some level you feel something is off and
 

1749
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:01,909
some level you feel something is off and
you cannot put your finger on it and the

1750
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
you cannot put your finger on it and the
 

1751
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,830
you cannot put your finger on it and the
more reason about it the better it looks

1752
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
more reason about it the better it looks
 

1753
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,310
more reason about it the better it looks
to you but the system that is outside

1754
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,320
to you but the system that is outside
 

1755
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,570
to you but the system that is outside
still tells you no no you're missing

1756
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:08,580
still tells you no no you're missing
 

1757
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,649
still tells you no no you're missing
something

1758
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:09,659
something
 

1759
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,230
something
and that system is powerful people call

1760
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240

also going to try to formalize pencilism

00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,550
everything else that you basically look
out of the eyes of another person that

1924
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
out of the eyes of another person that
 

1925
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,069
out of the eyes of another person that
um every agent in the world that is an

00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:19,079
um every agent in the world that is an
 

1927
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,190
um every agent in the world that is an
observer is in some sense you so if we

1928
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,200
observer is in some sense you so if we
 

1929
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,030
observer is in some sense you so if we
forget that we are the same agent so is

1930
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,040
forget that we are the same agent so is
 

1931
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,790
forget that we are the same agent so is
it that we feel that or do we actually

1932
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:28,800
it that we feel that or do we actually
 

1933
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,870
it that we feel that or do we actually
accomplish it so is telepathy possible

1934
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:31,880
accomplish it so is telepathy possible
 

1935
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,210
accomplish it so is telepathy possible
is it real is that for me that's just a

is it real is that for me that's just a
 

1937
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,589
is it real is that for me that's just a
question that I don't really know the

interestingly and thus himself if

00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,530
interestingly and thus himself if
telepathy is real and he thinks that

1948
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:48,540
telepathy is real and he thinks that
 

1949
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,530
telepathy is real and he thinks that
that variable might be what uh it would

that variable might be what uh it would

all the reports that you get from people

1962
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:06,780
all the reports that you get from people
 

1963
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,390
all the reports that you get from people
when you ask the normal person on the

I find that very very often they say I

I find that very very often they say I

I find that very very often they say I

scientists might not be interested in

1972
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:16,380
scientists might not be interested in
 

1973
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,990
scientists might not be interested in
this and might not have a theory about

1974
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
this and might not have a theory about
 

1975
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,690
this and might not have a theory about
this but I have difficulty explaining it

1976
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:20,700
this but I have difficulty explaining it
 

1977
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,329
this but I have difficulty explaining it
away and so you could say maybe this is

1978
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:23,339
away and so you could say maybe this is
 

1979
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,250
away and so you could say maybe this is
the Superstition maybe it's a false

1980
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,260
the Superstition maybe it's a false
 

1981
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,870
the Superstition maybe it's a false
memory or maybe it's a little bit of

1982
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
memory or maybe it's a little bit of
 

1983
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,450
memory or maybe it's a little bit of
their courses who knows maybe somebody

1984
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:29,460

00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,950
their courses who knows maybe somebody

1986
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960

interesting or misremember something but

1988
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:32,880
interesting or misremember something but
 

1989
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,210
interesting or misremember something but
a lot of people report I noticed

1990
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,220
a lot of people report I noticed
 

1991
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,710
a lot of people report I noticed
something terrible happened to my

1992
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
something terrible happened to my
 

1993
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,690
something terrible happened to my
partner and I know this is exactly the

1994
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:38,700
partner and I know this is exactly the
 

1995
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,150
partner and I know this is exactly the
moment it happened where my child had an

1996
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,160
moment it happened where my child had an
 

1997
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,190
moment it happened where my child had an
accident and I knew that was happening

1998
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,200
accident and I knew that was happening
 

1999
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,569
accident and I knew that was happening
and the child was in a different town

2000
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:44,579
and the child was in a different town
 

2001
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,390
and the child was in a different town
right so maybe it's a false memory where

2002
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:47,400
right so maybe it's a false memory where
 

2003
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,329
right so maybe it's a false memory where
this is later on mistakenly attributed

2004
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:50,339
this is later on mistakenly attributed
 

2005
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,010
this is later on mistakenly attributed
but a lot of people think this is not

2006
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:52,020
but a lot of people think this is not
 

2007
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,470
but a lot of people think this is not
the correct explanation so if something

2008
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
the correct explanation so if something
 

2009
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,630
the correct explanation so if something
like this was real what would it mean

2010
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
like this was real what would it mean
 

2011
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,270
like this was real what would it mean
it probably would mean that either your

2012
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,280
it probably would mean that either your
 

2013
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,190
it probably would mean that either your
body is an antenna that is sending

2014
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
body is an antenna that is sending
 

2015
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,230
body is an antenna that is sending
information over all sorts of channels

2016
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,240
information over all sorts of channels
 

2017
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,550
information over all sorts of channels
like

2018
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
like
 

2019
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,550
like
um maybe just electromagnetic radio

2020
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:07,560
um maybe just electromagnetic radio
 

2021
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,349
um maybe just electromagnetic radio
signals that you're sending over long

2022
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:09,359
signals that you're sending over long
 

2023
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,510
signals that you're sending over long
distances and you get attuned to another

2024
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
distances and you get attuned to another
 

2025
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,190
distances and you get attuned to another
person that you spend enough time with

2026
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,200
person that you spend enough time with
 

2027
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,970
person that you spend enough time with
to get a few bits out of The Ether to

2028
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:16,980
to get a few bits out of The Ether to
 

2029
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,250
to get a few bits out of The Ether to
figure out what this person is doing or

2030
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,260
figure out what this person is doing or
 

2031
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,050
figure out what this person is doing or
maybe it's also when you are very close

2032
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,060
maybe it's also when you are very close
 

2033
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,790
maybe it's also when you are very close
to somebody and you become empathetic

2034
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
to somebody and you become empathetic
 

2035
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,710
to somebody and you become empathetic
with them what happens that is that you

2036
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
with them what happens that is that you
 

2037
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,390
with them what happens that is that you
go into a resonance state with them

2038
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
go into a resonance state with them
 

2039
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,270
go into a resonance state with them
right similar to when people go into a

2040
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,280
right similar to when people go into a
 

2041
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,970
right similar to when people go into a
seance and they go into a trend State

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:31,980
seance and they go into a trend State
 

2043

00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,390
and they start shifting a video board
around on the table I think what happens

2046
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:35,400
around on the table I think what happens
 

2047
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,450
around on the table I think what happens
is that they their minds go by their

2048
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:38,460
is that they their minds go by their
 

2049
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,910
is that they their minds go by their
nervous systems into a resonance state

2050
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:40,920
nervous systems into a resonance state
 

2051

nervous systems into a resonance state
in which they basically create something

in which they basically create something
 

2053
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,569
in which they basically create something
like a shared dream between them

defined with physical closeness is much
 

2059
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,829
defined with physical closeness is much
easier to experience empathy with

2060
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:51,839
easier to experience empathy with
 

2061
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,990
easier to experience empathy with
someone right it's I suspect it would be

2062
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,000
someone right it's I suspect it would be
 

2063
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,569
someone right it's I suspect it would be
difficult for me to have empathy for you

2064
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:56,579
difficult for me to have empathy for you
 

2065
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:00,170
difficult for me to have empathy for you
if you were in a different town also how

if you were in a different town also how
 

2067
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,569
if you were in a different town also how
would that work but if you are very

2068
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:02,579
would that work but if you are very
 

2069
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,790
would that work but if you are very

but not quite there no I think that
 

2205
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,370
but not quite there no I think that
there is no gap between the tools of

there is no gap between the tools of
 

2207
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,170
there is no gap between the tools of

2209
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,609

it's not and it's an empirical question

00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:43,619
it's not and it's an empirical question
 

2211
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,470
it's not and it's an empirical question
and if it's there we should be able to

00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:45,480
and if it's there we should be able to
 

2213
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,349
and if it's there we should be able to
detect it in a lab so why is there not a

00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:48,359
detect it in a lab so why is there not a
 

2215

well why would you want to do that it's

00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:31,560
well why would you want to do that it's
 

2351
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,829
well why would you want to do that it's
uh you see what is working for you and

00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:33,839
uh you see what is working for you and
 

2353
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,109
uh you see what is working for you and
if it's uh not working for you you build

00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:36,119
if it's uh not working for you you build
 

2355

you right and so I found myself in when

00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:25,020
be a big body of knowledge that I can
 

2399
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,589
be a big body of knowledge that I can
just study and that works and so I

2400
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:27,599
just study and that works and so I
 

2401
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,650
just study and that works and so I
entered studies in philosophy and

2402
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:30,660
entered studies in philosophy and
 

2403
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,890
entered studies in philosophy and
computer science and later psychology

2404
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:33,900
computer science and later psychology
 

2405
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,950
computer science and later psychology
and a bit of Neuroscience and so on and

2406
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:36,960
and a bit of Neuroscience and so on and
 

2407
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,890
and a bit of Neuroscience and so on and
I was disappointed by what I found

2408
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:39,900
I was disappointed by what I found
 

2409
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,930
I was disappointed by what I found
because I found that the questions of

2410
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:41,940
because I found that the questions of
 

2411
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,630
because I found that the questions of
how Consciousness and so on Works how

2412
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
how Consciousness and so on Works how
 

2413
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,849
how Consciousness and so on Works how
emotion Works how it's possible that the

2414
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:46,859
emotion Works how it's possible that the
 

2415
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:49,130
emotion Works how it's possible that the
system can experience anything how

2416
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:49,140
system can experience anything how
 

2417
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,770
system can experience anything how
motivation emerges in the mind when not

2418
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:51,780
motivation emerges in the mind when not
 

2419
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,950
motivation emerges in the mind when not
being answered by the authorities that I

2420
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:54,960
being answered by the authorities that I
 

2421
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,089
being answered by the authorities that I
met and the schools that were around

2422
00:45:59,089 --> 00:45:59,099
met and the schools that were around
 

2423
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,970
met and the schools that were around
and instead I found that with individual

2424
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:01,980
and instead I found that with individual
 

2425
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,609
and instead I found that with individual
thinkers that had useful ideas that

2426
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:04,619
thinkers that had useful ideas that
 

2427
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,050
thinkers that had useful ideas that
sometimes were good sometimes were not

2428
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:06,060
sometimes were good sometimes were not
 

2429
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,970
sometimes were good sometimes were not
so good sometimes were adopted by a

2430
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:07,980
so good sometimes were adopted by a
 

2431
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,530
so good sometimes were adopted by a
large group of people sometimes were

2432
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:09,540
large group of people sometimes were
 

2433
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,349
large group of people sometimes were
rejected by large groups of people but

2434
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:12,359
rejected by large groups of people but
 

2435
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:13,970
rejected by large groups of people but
um for me it was much more interesting

2436
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:13,980
um for me it was much more interesting
 

2437
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,670
um for me it was much more interesting
to see these Minds as individuals and in

2438
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:16,680
to see these Minds as individuals and in
 

2439
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,109
to see these Minds as individuals and in
my perspective thinking is still

2440
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:18,119
my perspective thinking is still
 

2441
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,670
my perspective thinking is still
something that is done not in groups

2442
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
something that is done not in groups
 

2443
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,770
something that is done not in groups
that has to be done by individuals

2444
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:21,780
that has to be done by individuals
 

2445
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,930
that has to be done by individuals
so that motivated you to become an

2446
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:23,940
so that motivated you to become an
 

2447
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,609
so that motivated you to become an
individual thinker yourself I didn't

2448
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:25,619
individual thinker yourself I didn't
 

2449
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:28,130
individual thinker yourself I didn't
have a choice okay I didn't find the

2450
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:28,140
have a choice okay I didn't find the
 

2451
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,809
have a choice okay I didn't find the
group that thought in a way where I

2452
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:29,819
group that thought in a way where I
 

2453
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:31,069
group that thought in a way where I
thought okay

2454
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:31,079
thought okay
 

2455
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,750
thought okay
um I can't just adopt everything that

2456
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:32,760
um I can't just adopt everything that
 

2457
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,430
um I can't just adopt everything that
everybody thinks here and now I

2458
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:34,440
everybody thinks here and now I
 

2459
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,290
everybody thinks here and now I
understand how Consciousness works right

2460
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:36,300
understand how Consciousness works right
 

2461
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,870
understand how Consciousness works right
so or how the mind works or how thinking

2462
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:38,880
so or how the mind works or how thinking
 

2463
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,730
so or how the mind works or how thinking
works or what thinking even is or What

2464
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:40,740
works or what thinking even is or What
 

2465
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,829
works or what thinking even is or What
feelings are and how they're implemented

2466
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:42,839
feelings are and how they're implemented
 

2467
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,109
feelings are and how they're implemented
and so on so to figure all this out I

2468
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:45,119
and so on so to figure all this out I
 

2469
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,930
and so on so to figure all this out I
had to take a lot of ideas from

2470
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:47,940
had to take a lot of ideas from
 

2471
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,670
had to take a lot of ideas from
individuals and then try to put them

2472
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:49,680
individuals and then try to put them
 

2473
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,589
individuals and then try to put them
together in something that works for

2474
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
together in something that works for
 

2475
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,650
together in something that works for
myself and on one hand I think it helps

2476
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:54,660
myself and on one hand I think it helps
 

2477
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,569
myself and on one hand I think it helps
if you try to go down and find first

2478
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:56,579
if you try to go down and find first
 

2479
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,809
if you try to go down and find first
principles on which you can recreate how

2480
00:46:59,809 --> 00:46:59,819
principles on which you can recreate how
 

2481
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:02,450
principles on which you can recreate how
thinking Works how languages work what

2482
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:02,460
thinking Works how languages work what
 

2483
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,370
thinking Works how languages work what
representation is when the

I don't necessarily feel intimidated

2528
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:54,180
I don't necessarily feel intimidated
 

2529
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,569
I don't necessarily feel intimidated
which has often been a problem for me in

2530
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:56,579
which has often been a problem for me in
 

2531
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:59,329
which has often been a problem for me in
my life because I like instincts that

2532
00:47:59,329 --> 00:47:59,339
my life because I like instincts that
 

2533
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:01,250
my life because I like instincts that
other people develop at a very young age

2534
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:01,260
other people develop at a very young age
 

2535
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,170
other people develop at a very young age
and that help with their

2536
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:03,180
and that help with their
 

2537
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,790
and that help with their
self-preservation in a social

2538
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
self-preservation in a social
 

2539

environment
 

2541
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,670
environment
so I had to learn a lot of things the

2542
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
so I had to learn a lot of things the
 

2543
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,990
so I had to learn a lot of things the
hard way

2544
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,000
hard way
 

2545
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,150
hard way
yeah

2546
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:11,160
yeah
 

2547
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,190
yeah
so is there a practical advice you can

2548
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
so is there a practical advice you can
 

2549
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,870
so is there a practical advice you can
give how to think parenting

2550
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
give how to think parenting
 

2551
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,670
give how to think parenting
paradigmatically how to think

2552
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:16,680
paradigmatically how to think
 

2553
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,370
paradigmatically how to think
independently or you know because you've

2554
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:19,380
independently or you know because you've
 

2555
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,069
independently or you know because you've
kind of said I had no choice

2556
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
kind of said I had no choice
 

2557
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,390
kind of said I had no choice
but I think

2558
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:23,400
but I think
 

2559
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,410
but I think
to a degree you have a choice

2560
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,420

 

2561
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,849

because you said you want to be

2562
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:28,859
because you said you want to be
 

2563
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:30,710
because you said you want to be
productive and I think thinking

2564
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
productive and I think thinking
 

2565
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,750
productive and I think thinking
independent is productive if what you're

2566
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:32,760
independent is productive if what you're
 

2567
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,930
independent is productive if what you're
curious about is understanding the world

2568
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:35,940
curious about is understanding the world
 

2569
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,089
curious about is understanding the world
especially when the problems are very

2570
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:38,099
especially when the problems are very
 

2571
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:43,010
especially when the problems are very
kind of new and open so

2572
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:43,020

 

2573
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,710

it seems like

2574
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:45,720
it seems like
 

2575
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,430
it seems like
this is a active process like we can

2576
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
this is a active process like we can
 

2577
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,710
this is a active process like we can
choose to do that we can practice it

2578
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:51,720
choose to do that we can practice it
 

2579
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,170
choose to do that we can practice it
well there's a very basic question when

2580
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:54,180
well there's a very basic question when
 

2581
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,670
well there's a very basic question when
you read a theory that you find

2582
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
you read a theory that you find
 

2583
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,069
you read a theory that you find
convincing or interesting how do you

2584
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:58,079
convincing or interesting how do you
 

2585
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:58,910
convincing or interesting how do you
know

2586
00:48:58,910 --> 00:48:58,920
know
 

2587
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,490
know
but it's very interesting to figure out

2588
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:01,500
but it's very interesting to figure out
 

2589
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,410
but it's very interesting to figure out
what are the sources of that other

2590
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:03,420
what are the sources of that other
 

2591
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,870
what are the sources of that other
person not uh which authority can they

2592
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:05,880
person not uh which authority can they
 

2593
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,970
person not uh which authority can they
refer to that is then taking off the

2594
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:07,980
refer to that is then taking off the
 

2595
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,829
refer to that is then taking off the
burden of being truthful but how did

2596
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:09,839
burden of being truthful but how did
 

2597
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,750
burden of being truthful but how did
this Authority in turn know what is the

2598
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:11,760
this Authority in turn know what is the
 

2599
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,450
this Authority in turn know what is the
epistemic chain to observables what are

2600
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:14,460
epistemic chain to observables what are
 

2601
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,010
epistemic chain to observables what are
the first principles from which the

2602
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:16,020
the first principles from which the
 

2603
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,530
the first principles from which the
whole thing is derived and

2604
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:18,540
whole thing is derived and
 

2605
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,809
whole thing is derived and
when I was young I was not blessed with

2606
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:20,819
when I was young I was not blessed with
 

2607
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:21,890
when I was young I was not blessed with
a lot of

2608
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:21,900
a lot of
 

2609
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,609
a lot of
um

2610
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:22,619
um
 

2611
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,589
um
people around myself who knew how to

2612
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:24,599
people around myself who knew how to
 

2613
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,450
people around myself who knew how to
make proofs from first principles and I

2614
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:26,460
make proofs from first principles and I
 

2615
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,890
make proofs from first principles and I
think mathematicians do this quite

2616
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:27,900
think mathematicians do this quite
 

2617
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,349
think mathematicians do this quite
naturally but most of the great

2618
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:30,359
naturally but most of the great
 

2619
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:31,849
naturally but most of the great
mathematicians do not become

2620
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:31,859
mathematicians do not become
 

2621
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:34,309
mathematicians do not become
mathematicians in school but they tend

2622
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:34,319
mathematicians in school but they tend
 

2623
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,569
mathematicians in school but they tend
to be self-taught

2624
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:35,579
to be self-taught
 

2625
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,910
to be self-taught
because school teachers tend not to be

2626
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920
because school teachers tend not to be
 

2627
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,650
because school teachers tend not to be
mathematicians right they tend not to be

2628
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:39,660
mathematicians right they tend not to be
 

2629
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,150
mathematicians right they tend not to be
people who derive things from first

2630
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:41,160
people who derive things from first
 

2631
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,370
people who derive things from first
principles so when you ask your school

2632
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:43,380
principles so when you ask your school
 

2633
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,390
principles so when you ask your school
teacher why does two plus two equal four

2634
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:47,400
teacher why does two plus two equal four
 

2635
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,770
teacher why does two plus two equal four
um that's your school teacher give you

2636
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:48,780
um that's your school teacher give you
 

2637
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,290
um that's your school teacher give you
the right answer like it's a simple game

2638
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:51,300
the right answer like it's a simple game
 

2639
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,150
the right answer like it's a simple game
and there are many simple games that we

2640
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:53,160
and there are many simple games that we
 

2641
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,710
and there are many simple games that we
could play and

2642
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:54,720
could play and
 

2643
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,630
could play and
um most of those games that you could

2644
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
um most of those games that you could
 

2645
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,849
um most of those games that you could
just take different roles would not lead

2646
00:49:58,849 --> 00:49:58,859
just take different roles would not lead
 

2647
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:01,730
just take different roles would not lead
to an interesting arithmetic and so it's

2648
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:01,740
to an interesting arithmetic and so it's
 

2649
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,410
to an interesting arithmetic and so it's
just an exploration but you can try what

2650
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:03,420
just an exploration but you can try what
 

2651
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,030
just an exploration but you can try what
happens if you take different axioms and

2652
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,040
happens if you take different axioms and
 

2653
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,809
happens if you take different axioms and
here is how you build axioms and derive

2654
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:07,819
here is how you build axioms and derive
 

2655
00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:10,910
here is how you build axioms and derive
Edition from them and build Edition is

2656
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:10,920
Edition from them and build Edition is
 

2657
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,329
Edition from them and build Edition is
some basically syntactic sugar in it and

2658
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:14,339
some basically syntactic sugar in it and
 

2659
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:17,690
some basically syntactic sugar in it and
so this I wish that somebody would have

2660
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:17,700
so this I wish that somebody would have
 

2661
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,790
so this I wish that somebody would have
opened me this Vista and explained to me

2662
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:19,800
opened me this Vista and explained to me
 

2663
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,849
opened me this Vista and explained to me
how I can build a language in my own

2664
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:22,859
how I can build a language in my own
 

2665
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:24,589
how I can build a language in my own
mind and from which I can derive what

2666
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:24,599
mind and from which I can derive what
 

2667
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,510
mind and from which I can derive what
I'm seeing and how I can which I can

2668
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:26,520
I'm seeing and how I can which I can
 

2669
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,809
I'm seeing and how I can which I can
make geometry and Counting and

2670
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:29,819
make geometry and Counting and
 

2671
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:30,650
make geometry and Counting and
um

2672
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:30,660
um
 

2673
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,630
um
all the number games that we are playing

2674
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:32,640
all the number games that we are playing
 

2675
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,750
all the number games that we are playing
in our life and on the other hand I felt

2676
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:35,760
in our life and on the other hand I felt
 

2677
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,910
in our life and on the other hand I felt
that I learned a lot of this while I was

2678
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,920
that I learned a lot of this while I was
 

2679
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,370
that I learned a lot of this while I was
programming as a child when you start

00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:40,380
programming as a child when you start
 

2681
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,589

see how a bunch of relatively simple

2688
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,300
see how a bunch of relatively simple
 

2689
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,010
see how a bunch of relatively simple
circuits are just basically performing

2690
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:52,020
circuits are just basically performing
 

2691
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,549
circuits are just basically performing
hashes between bit patterns and how you

hashes between bit patterns and how you
 

2693
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,829

can build the entirety of mathematics

2694
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
can build the entirety of mathematics

00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:10,200
say so myself if you can return
 

2707
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,030
say so myself if you can return
to uh this really interesting idea

that we started to talk about with
 

2711
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,349
that we started to talk about with
pansychism

2712

so the modalities the distinction

2750
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:01,800
so the modalities the distinction
 

2751
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,890
so the modalities the distinction
between modalities let's throw that away

2752
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:03,900
between modalities let's throw that away
 

2753
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,109

so what does this interaction

2758
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:10,020
so what does this interaction
 

2759
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,170
so what does this interaction
representations look like

2760
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:14,180

 

2761
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,910

when you think about how you represent

2762
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:16,920
when you think about how you represent
 

2763
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,069
when you think about how you represent
the interaction of us in this room yeah

2764
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:19,079
the interaction of us in this room yeah
 

2765
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:21,710
the interaction of us in this room yeah
at some level you can the modalities are

2766
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:21,720
at some level you can the modalities are
 

2767
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,970
at some level you can the modalities are
quite distinct they're not completely

2768
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:22,980
quite distinct they're not completely
 

2769

2770
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:25,380
distinct but you can see this is Vision
 

2771
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,170
distinct but you can see this is Vision
but you can close your eyes and then you

2772
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:27,180
but you can close your eyes and then you
 

2773
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,690
but you can close your eyes and then you
don't see a lot anymore but you still

2774
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:29,700
don't see a lot anymore but you still
 

2775
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,730
don't see a lot anymore but you still
imagine how my mouth is moving when you

2776
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:31,740
imagine how my mouth is moving when you
 

2777
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,710
imagine how my mouth is moving when you
hear something and you know that it's

2778
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:33,720
hear something and you know that it's
 

2779
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,790
hear something and you know that it's
very close to uh the sound that you can

2780
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:37,800
very close to uh the sound that you can
 

2781
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,349
very close to uh the sound that you can
just open your eyes and you get back

2782
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
just open your eyes and you get back
 

2783
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,770
just open your eyes and you get back
into the street merge space and we also

2784
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:42,780
into the street merge space and we also
 

2785
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,450
into the street merge space and we also
have these experiments where we notice

2786
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:44,460
have these experiments where we notice
 

2787
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,549
have these experiments where we notice
that the vein which my lips are moving

2788
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
that the vein which my lips are moving
 

2789
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,490
that the vein which my lips are moving
are affecting how you hear the sound and

2790
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:49,500
are affecting how you hear the sound and
 

2791
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,349
are affecting how you hear the sound and
also vice versa the sounds that you're

2792
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
also vice versa the sounds that you're
 

2793
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,690
also vice versa the sounds that you're
hearing have an influence on how you

2794
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:53,700
hearing have an influence on how you
 

2795
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,150
hearing have an influence on how you
interpret some of the visual features

2796
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:55,160
interpret some of the visual features
 

2797
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,809
interpret some of the visual features
and so this modalities are not separate

2798
00:52:59,809 --> 00:52:59,819
and so this modalities are not separate
 

2799
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:02,210
and so this modalities are not separate
in your mind they do are merged at some

2800
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:02,220
in your mind they do are merged at some
 

2801
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,790
in your mind they do are merged at some
fundamental level where you are

2802
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:03,800
fundamental level where you are
 

2803
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,990
fundamental level where you are
interpreting the entire scene that you

2804
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
interpreting the entire scene that you
 

2805
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,930
interpreting the entire scene that you
are in and your own interactions in the

2806
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:08,940
are in and your own interactions in the
 

2807
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,030
are in and your own interactions in the
scene also not completely separate from

2808
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,040
scene also not completely separate from
 

2809
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,589
scene also not completely separate from
the interactions of the other individual

2810
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:12,599
the interactions of the other individual
 

2811
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:14,510
the interactions of the other individual
in the scene but there is some resonance

2812
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:14,520
in the scene but there is some resonance
 

2813
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,329
in the scene but there is some resonance
that is going on where we also have a

2814
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:17,339
that is going on where we also have a
 

2815
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,490
that is going on where we also have a
degree of shared mental representations

2816
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:19,500
degree of shared mental representations
 

2817
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,710
degree of shared mental representations
and shared empathy due to being in the

2818
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:21,720
and shared empathy due to being in the
 

2819
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,230
and shared empathy due to being in the
same space and having Vibes between each

2820
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
same space and having Vibes between each
 

2821
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,250
same space and having Vibes between each
other Vibes so the question though is

2822
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:28,260
other Vibes so the question though is
 

2823
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,609
other Vibes so the question though is
How Deeply interbined is this

2824
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:30,619
How Deeply interbined is this
 

2825
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:34,069
How Deeply interbined is this
multi-modality multi-agent system

2826
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:34,079
multi-modality multi-agent system
 

2827
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,250
multi-modality multi-agent system
like how I mean this is going to the

2828
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:37,260
like how I mean this is going to the
 

2829
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,630
like how I mean this is going to the
telepathy question without the

2830
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:40,640
telepathy question without the
 

2831
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,250
telepathy question without the
meaning of the word telepathy

2832
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:43,260
meaning of the word telepathy
 

2833
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,809
meaning of the word telepathy
it's like how

2834
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:44,819
it's like how
 

2835
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:46,549
it's like how
like what's going on here in this room

2836
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
like what's going on here in this room
 

2837
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,670
like what's going on here in this room
right now so it's called epicity would

2838
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,680
right now so it's called epicity would
 

2839
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,870
right now so it's called epicity would
work how could it work yeah right so

2840
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:52,880
work how could it work yeah right so
 

2841
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,069
work how could it work yeah right so
imagine that

2842
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:55,079
imagine that
 

2843
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:56,750
imagine that
um all the cells in your body are

2844
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:56,760
um all the cells in your body are
 

2845
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,370
um all the cells in your body are
sending signals in a similar way as

2846
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:58,380
sending signals in a similar way as
 

2847
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,710
sending signals in a similar way as
neurons are doing right just by touching

2848
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:00,720
neurons are doing right just by touching
 

2849
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,329
neurons are doing right just by touching
the other cells and sending chemicals to

2850
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:02,339
the other cells and sending chemicals to
 

2851
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,829
the other cells and sending chemicals to
them the other cells interpreting them

2852
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:03,839
them the other cells interpreting them
 

2853
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,230
them the other cells interpreting them
learning how to react to them and they

2854
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,240
learning how to react to them and they
 

2855
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,089
learning how to react to them and they
learn how to approximate functions in

2856
00:54:08,089 --> 00:54:08,099
learn how to approximate functions in
 

2857
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:10,309
learn how to approximate functions in
this way and compute behavior for the

2858
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
this way and compute behavior for the
 

2859
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,109
this way and compute behavior for the
organisms and this is something that is

2860
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:12,119
organisms and this is something that is
 

2861
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:15,109
organisms and this is something that is
open to plants as well and so plants

2862
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:15,119
open to plants as well and so plants
 

2863
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,430
open to plants as well and so plants
probably have software running on them

2864
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:16,440
probably have software running on them
 

2865
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,530
probably have software running on them
that is controlling how the plant is

2866
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:18,540
that is controlling how the plant is
 

2867
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,329
that is controlling how the plant is
working in a similar way as you have a

2868
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:20,339
working in a similar way as you have a
 

2869
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:22,130
working in a similar way as you have a
mind that is controlling how you are

2870
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:22,140
mind that is controlling how you are
 

2871
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,589
mind that is controlling how you are
behaving in the world and

2872
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:24,599
behaving in the world and
 

2873
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:27,530
behaving in the world and
um this Spirit of plants which is

2874
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:27,540
um this Spirit of plants which is
 

2875
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,990
um this Spirit of plants which is
something that has been very well

2876
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,000
something that has been very well
 

2877
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,609
something that has been very well
described by our ancestors and they

2878
00:54:31,609 --> 00:54:31,619
described by our ancestors and they
 

2879
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:34,970
described by our ancestors and they
found this quite normal but uh for some

2880
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:34,980
found this quite normal but uh for some
 

2881
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,349
found this quite normal but uh for some
reason since the enlightenment we are

2882
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:36,359
reason since the enlightenment we are
 

2883
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,030
reason since the enlightenment we are
treating this notion that there are

2884
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:38,040
treating this notion that there are
 

2885
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,890
treating this notion that there are
spirits in nature and there are plenty

2886
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:39,900
spirits in nature and there are plenty
 

2887
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,710
spirits in nature and there are plenty
of spirits as a Superstition and I think

2888
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:42,720
of spirits as a Superstition and I think
 

2889
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,589
of spirits as a Superstition and I think
we probably have to ReDiscover that that

2890
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:45,599
we probably have to ReDiscover that that
 

2891
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,349
we probably have to ReDiscover that that
plants have software running on them and

2892
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:48,359
plants have software running on them and
 

2893
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:50,750
plants have software running on them and
we already did right you notice that

2894
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:50,760
we already did right you notice that
 

2895
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,490
we already did right you notice that
there is a control system in the plant

2896
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:52,500
there is a control system in the plant
 

2897
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,890
there is a control system in the plant
that connects every part of the plant to

2898
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:54,900
that connects every part of the plant to
 

2899
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,510
that connects every part of the plant to
every other part of the plant and

2900
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:56,520
every other part of the plant and
 

2901
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,970
every other part of the plant and
produces coherent behavior in the plant

2902
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:58,980
produces coherent behavior in the plant
 

2903
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,890
produces coherent behavior in the plant
that is of course much much slower than

2904
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:00,900
that is of course much much slower than
 

2905
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,069
that is of course much much slower than
the coherent behavior in an animal like

2906
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:04,079
the coherent behavior in an animal like
 

2907
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,710
the coherent behavior in an animal like
us that has a nervous system that where

2908
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
us that has a nervous system that where
 

2909
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,970
us that has a nervous system that where
everything is synchronized much much

2910
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:07,980
everything is synchronized much much
 

2911
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,890
everything is synchronized much much
faster by the neurons

2912
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:09,900
faster by the neurons
 

2913
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,710
faster by the neurons
but what you also notice is that if a

2914
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
but what you also notice is that if a
 

2915
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,150
but what you also notice is that if a
plant is sitting next to another plant

2916
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
plant is sitting next to another plant
 

2917
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,770
plant is sitting next to another plant
like you have a very old tree and this

2918
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:15,780
like you have a very old tree and this
 

2919
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,970
like you have a very old tree and this
tree is building some kind of

2920
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:16,980
tree is building some kind of
 

2921
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,490
tree is building some kind of
information Highway along its cells so

2922
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:19,500
information Highway along its cells so
 

2923
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,069
information Highway along its cells so
it can send information from its leaves

2924
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:22,079
it can send information from its leaves
 

2925
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,569
it can send information from its leaves
to its roots and from some part of the

2926
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:23,579
to its roots and from some part of the
 

2927
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:25,549
to its roots and from some part of the
root to another part of the woods and

2928
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:25,559
root to another part of the woods and
 

2929
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,170
root to another part of the woods and
there is the fungus living next to the

2930
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:27,180
there is the fungus living next to the
 

2931
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,849
there is the fungus living next to the
tree the fungus can probably piggyback

2932
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:28,859
tree the fungus can probably piggyback
 

2933
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:31,490
tree the fungus can probably piggyback
on the communication between the cells

2934
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:31,500
on the communication between the cells
 

2935
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,349
on the communication between the cells
of the tree and send its own signals to

2936
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:33,359
of the tree and send its own signals to
 

2937
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,809
of the tree and send its own signals to
the tree and vice versa the tree might

2938
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:35,819
the tree and vice versa the tree might
 

2939
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:37,250
the tree and vice versa the tree might
be able to send informations of the

2940
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:37,260
be able to send informations of the
 

2941
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,290
be able to send informations of the
fungus because after all how would they

2942
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:39,300
fungus because after all how would they
 

2943
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,390
fungus because after all how would they
build a viable firewall if that other

2944
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:41,400
build a viable firewall if that other
 

2945
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,370
build a viable firewall if that other
organism is sitting next to them all the

2946
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:43,380
organism is sitting next to them all the
 

2947
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,530
organism is sitting next to them all the
time and it's never moving away and so

2948
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:45,540
time and it's never moving away and so
 

2949
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,930
time and it's never moving away and so
they will have to get along and over a

2950
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:47,940
they will have to get along and over a
 

2951
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,510
they will have to get along and over a
long enough time frame the networks of

2952
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:50,520
long enough time frame the networks of
 

2953
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,309
long enough time frame the networks of
roots in the forest and all the plant

2954
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
roots in the forest and all the plant
 

2955
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,530
roots in the forest and all the plant
other plants that are there and the

2956
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:54,540
other plants that are there and the
 

2957
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,589
other plants that are there and the
fungi that are there might be forming

2958
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:57,599
fungi that are there might be forming
 

2959
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,290
fungi that are there might be forming
something like a biological internet

2960
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:00,300
something like a biological internet
 

2961
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,450
something like a biological internet
but the the question there is do they

2962
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:02,460
but the the question there is do they
 

2963
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,549
but the the question there is do they
have to be touching is biology at a

2964
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
have to be touching is biology at a
 

2965
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:05,990
have to be touching is biology at a
distance possible

2966
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,000
distance possible
 

2967
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,790
distance possible
of course you can use any kind of

2968
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:07,800
of course you can use any kind of
 

2969
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,609
of course you can use any kind of
physical signal you can use sounds you

2970
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:10,619
physical signal you can use sounds you
 

2971
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,309
physical signal you can use sounds you
can use electromagnetic waves that are

2972
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:13,319
can use electromagnetic waves that are
 

2973
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:15,049
can use electromagnetic waves that are
integrated over many cells that's

2974
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:15,059
integrated over many cells that's
 

2975
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:18,470
integrated over many cells that's
conceivable that across distances there

2976
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:18,480
conceivable that across distances there
 

2977
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,630
conceivable that across distances there
are many kinds of information Pathways

2978
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
are many kinds of information Pathways
 

2979
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,770
are many kinds of information Pathways
but also our planetary surface is pretty

2980
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:24,780
but also our planetary surface is pretty
 

2981
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,290
but also our planetary surface is pretty
full of organisms full of cells so

2982
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:27,300
full of organisms full of cells so
 

2983
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,670
full of organisms full of cells so
everything is touching everything else

2984
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:28,680
everything is touching everything else
 

2985
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,849
everything is touching everything else
yeah and it's been doing this for

2986
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:31,859
yeah and it's been doing this for
 

2987
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:33,890
yeah and it's been doing this for
um many millions and even billions of

2988
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:33,900
um many millions and even billions of
 

2989
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,170
um many millions and even billions of
years so there was enough time for

2990
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:36,180
years so there was enough time for
 

2991
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,290
years so there was enough time for
information processing networks to form

2992
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:38,300
information processing networks to form
 

2993
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,270
information processing networks to form
and if you think about how a mind is

2994
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
and if you think about how a mind is
 

2995
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,069
and if you think about how a mind is
self-organizing it basically it needs to

2996
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:43,079
self-organizing it basically it needs to
 

2997
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:45,530
self-organizing it basically it needs to
in some sense reward these cells for

2998
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:45,540
in some sense reward these cells for
 

2999
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,710
in some sense reward these cells for
computing the mind for building

3000
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:47,720
computing the mind for building
 

3001
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,750
computing the mind for building
the necessary Dynamics between the cells

3002
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:50,760
the necessary Dynamics between the cells
 

3003
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,370
the necessary Dynamics between the cells
that allow the mind to stabilize itself

3004
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:52,380
that allow the mind to stabilize itself
 

3005
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,910
that allow the mind to stabilize itself
and remain on there but if you look at

3006
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:55,920
and remain on there but if you look at
 

3007
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,250
and remain on there but if you look at
these spirits of plants that are growing

3008
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:58,260
these spirits of plants that are growing
 

3009
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,049
these spirits of plants that are growing
very close to each other in the forwards

3010
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:00,059
very close to each other in the forwards
 

3011
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:01,490
very close to each other in the forwards
it might be almost growing into each

3012
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:01,500
it might be almost growing into each
 

3013
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,950
it might be almost growing into each
other these Spirits might be able even

3014
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:03,960
other these Spirits might be able even
 

3015
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,809
other these Spirits might be able even
to move to some degree not to become

3016
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:05,819
to move to some degree not to become
 

3017
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:08,450
to move to some degree not to become
some number dislocated and shift around

3018
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:08,460
some number dislocated and shift around
 

3019
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,890
some number dislocated and shift around
in in that ecosystem right and so if you

3020
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:12,900
in in that ecosystem right and so if you
 

3021
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,630
in in that ecosystem right and so if you
think about what the mind is it's a

3022
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
think about what the mind is it's a
 

3023
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,910
think about what the mind is it's a
bunch of activation waves that form

3024
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:16,920
bunch of activation waves that form
 

3025
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,470
bunch of activation waves that form
coherent patterns and process

3026
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:18,480
coherent patterns and process
 

3027
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,069
coherent patterns and process
information in in a way that are

3028
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:22,079
information in in a way that are
 

3029
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,309
information in in a way that are
colonizing an environment well enough to

3030
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:24,319
colonizing an environment well enough to
 

3031
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,170
colonizing an environment well enough to
allow the continuous sustenance of the

3032
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:27,180
allow the continuous sustenance of the
 

3033
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,569
allow the continuous sustenance of the
Mind The Continuous stability and

3034
00:57:29,569 --> 00:57:29,579
Mind The Continuous stability and

self-drabitization of the Mind
 

3037
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,089
self-drabitization of the Mind
um then it's conceivable that we can

3038
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:35,099
um then it's conceivable that we can
 

3039
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:37,250
um then it's conceivable that we can
link into this biological internet not

00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:37,260
link into this biological internet not

necessarily at the speed of our nervous

00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:39,599
necessarily at the speed of our nervous
 

3043
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,030
necessarily at the speed of our nervous
system but maybe at the speed of our

00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,040

00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,549

00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,160

ideas are completely speculative I don't

3054
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:51,900
ideas are completely speculative I don't
 

3055
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,230
ideas are completely speculative I don't
know if any of that is true but if that

3056
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,240
know if any of that is true but if that
 

3057
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,549
know if any of that is true but if that
was true and if you want to explain

3058
00:57:55,549 --> 00:57:55,559
was true and if you want to explain
 

3059
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,010
was true and if you want to explain
telepathy I think it's much more likely

3060
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:58,020
telepathy I think it's much more likely
 

3061
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,410
telepathy I think it's much more likely
that such a data telepathy could be

3062
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,420
that such a data telepathy could be
 

3063
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,270
that such a data telepathy could be
explained using such mechanisms rather

3064
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:02,280
explained using such mechanisms rather
 

3065
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,150
explained using such mechanisms rather
than an discovered Quantum processes

3066
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:05,160
than an discovered Quantum processes
 

3067
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,650
than an discovered Quantum processes
that would break the standard model of

3068
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:06,660
that would break the standard model of

00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,270
that would break the standard model of

3070
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:08,280
physics
 

3071
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,089
physics
could they be undiscovered processes

3072
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:11,099
could they be undiscovered processes
 

3073
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:14,930
could they be undiscovered processes
that don't break yeah so if you think

3074
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:14,940
that don't break yeah so if you think
 

3075
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,890
that don't break yeah so if you think
about

3076
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:15,900
about
 

3077
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,809
about
um something like an internet in the

3078
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:17,819
um something like an internet in the
 

3079
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:20,390
um something like an internet in the
forest that is something that is

3080
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
forest that is something that is
 

3081
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,890
forest that is something that is
borderline discovered there are

3082
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:21,900
borderline discovered there are
 

3083
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,210
borderline discovered there are
basically a lot of scientists who point

3084
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:23,220
basically a lot of scientists who point
 

3085
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,630
basically a lot of scientists who point
out that they do observe that plans are

3086
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:26,640
out that they do observe that plans are
 

3087
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,069
out that they do observe that plans are
communicating the forwards or wood

3088
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
communicating the forwards or wood
 

3089
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,589

3090
00:58:30,589 --> 00:58:30,599

3092
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359

3093
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,150

entering the forest and and things are

3094
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:35,160
entering the forest and and things are
 

3095
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,250
entering the forest and and things are
happening like this so basically there

3096
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:37,260
happening like this so basically there
 

3097
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,990
happening like this so basically there
is communication between plants and

3098
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:39,000
is communication between plants and
 

3099
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,849
is communication between plants and
fungi that has been observed well it's

3100
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:40,859
fungi that has been observed well it's
 

3101
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:42,829
fungi that has been observed well it's
been observed but we haven't plugged

3102
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:42,839
been observed but we haven't plugged
 

3103
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:44,690
been observed but we haven't plugged
into it so it's like if You observe

3104
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:44,700
into it so it's like if You observe
 

3105
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,010
into it so it's like if You observe
humans they seem to be communicating

3106
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:46,020
humans they seem to be communicating
 

3107
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,690
humans they seem to be communicating
with a smartphone thing but you don't

3108
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:47,700
with a smartphone thing but you don't
 

3109
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,089
with a smartphone thing but you don't
understand how smartphone works and how

3110
00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:50,099
understand how smartphone works and how
 

3111
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:51,710
understand how smartphone works and how
the the mechanism of the internet works

3112
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:51,720
the the mechanism of the internet works
 

3113
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,410
the the mechanism of the internet works
but we're like maybe it's possible to

3114
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:54,420
but we're like maybe it's possible to
 

3115
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,770
but we're like maybe it's possible to
really understand the the full richness

3116
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:57,780
really understand the the full richness
 

3117
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,829
really understand the the full richness
of the biological internet that connects

01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:37,579
with each other
 

3197
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:40,370
with each other
so that's a really interesting idea this

3198
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:40,380
so that's a really interesting idea this
 

3199
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,589
so that's a really interesting idea this

01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,970
that it might as well be seen as one
that's an interesting uh what do you

3208
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:52,980
that's an interesting uh what do you
 

3209
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,990
that's an interesting uh what do you
think that looks like what do you think

3210
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,000
think that looks like what do you think
 

3211
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,609
think that looks like what do you think
that saturation looks like what does it

3212
01:00:55,609 --> 01:00:55,619
that saturation looks like what does it
 

3213
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,349
that saturation looks like what does it
feel like I think it's a possibility

3214
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
feel like I think it's a possibility
 

3215
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,349
feel like I think it's a possibility
it's just a vague possibility and I I

3216
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:00,359
it's just a vague possibility and I I
 

3217
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:05,210
it's just a vague possibility and I I
like to explain but what is looks like I

3218
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:05,220
like to explain but what is looks like I
 

3219
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,250
like to explain but what is looks like I
think that the end game of AGI is

3220
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,260
think that the end game of AGI is
 

3221
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,970
think that the end game of AGI is
substrate agnostic that means that egi

3222
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:10,980
substrate agnostic that means that egi
 

3223
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,069
substrate agnostic that means that egi
ultimately if it is being built is going

3224
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:13,079
ultimately if it is being built is going
 

3225
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:14,870
ultimately if it is being built is going
to be smart enough to understand how AGI

3226
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:14,880
to be smart enough to understand how AGI
 

3227
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,049
to be smart enough to understand how AGI
works this means it's not going to be

3228
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:18,059
works this means it's not going to be
 

3229
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:20,450
works this means it's not going to be
better than people at egi research and

3230
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:20,460
better than people at egi research and
 

3231
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,890
better than people at egi research and
can take over in building the Next

3232
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:21,900
can take over in building the Next
 

3233
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,170
can take over in building the Next

01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:26,460
it works and how it's being implemented
 

3237
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,950
it works and how it's being implemented
and also of course understands how

3241
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,430
computation Works in nature how to build
new feedback loops that you can turn

3242
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,440
new feedback loops that you can turn
 

3243
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,650
new feedback loops that you can turn
into your own circuits and this means

3244
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:33,660
into your own circuits and this means
 

3245
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,930
into your own circuits and this means
that the AGI is likely to virtualize

3246
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:35,940
that the AGI is likely to virtualize
 

3247
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,670
that the AGI is likely to virtualize
itself into any environment that can

01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
itself into any environment that can
 

3249
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,130
itself into any environment that can
compute so it's not breaking free from

3250
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:40,140
compute so it's not breaking free from
 

3251
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,750
compute so it's not breaking free from
the Silicon substrate and is going to

move into the ecosystems into our bodies

3254
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:43,859
move into the ecosystems into our bodies
 

3255
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:46,190
move into the ecosystems into our bodies
our brains and is going to merge with

01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:46,200
our brains and is going to merge with
 

3257
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,530
our brains and is going to merge with
all the agency that it finds there yeah

3258
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:48,540
all the agency that it finds there yeah

think that when you are conscious in
 

3327
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,930

01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:23,640
self-reflexive Observer and I suspect
 

3333
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,190
self-reflexive Observer and I suspect
that we become conscious at the

3334
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
that we become conscious at the
 

3335
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,990
that we become conscious at the

seems to be part of a training mechanism

3340
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:31,500
seems to be part of a training mechanism
 

3341
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,829
seems to be part of a training mechanism
that biological nervous systems have to

3342
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
that biological nervous systems have to
 

3343
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,289
that biological nervous systems have to
discover to become trainable because you

3344
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:36,299
discover to become trainable because you
 

3345
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:38,390
discover to become trainable because you
cannot take a nervous system like ours

3346
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
cannot take a nervous system like ours
 

3347
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,609
cannot take a nervous system like ours
and do stochastic related to centers

3348
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:40,619
and do stochastic related to centers

and do stochastic related to centers
back propagation over 100 layers right

back propagation over 100 layers right
 

3351
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,390
back propagation over 100 layers right
this would not be stable on biological

01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,400
this would not be stable on biological
 

3353
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,470
this would not be stable on biological

the boundary of your mind

01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:02,220
the boundary of your mind
 

3367
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,130
the boundary of your mind
and if that boundary is no longer

3368
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:04,140
and if that boundary is no longer
 

3369
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,789
and if that boundary is no longer
clear-cut because AI is jumping across

3370
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:07,799
clear-cut because AI is jumping across
 

3371
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:10,010
clear-cut because AI is jumping across
substrates and it would be interesting

3372
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:10,020
substrates and it would be interesting
 

3373
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,569
substrates and it would be interesting
to see what the global mind would look

3374
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:11,579
to see what the global mind would look
 

3375
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,370
to see what the global mind would look
like that is basically producing a

3376
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:13,380
like that is basically producing a
 

3377
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,890
like that is basically producing a
globally coherent language of thought

3378
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:14,900
globally coherent language of thought
 

3379
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,710
globally coherent language of thought
and is representing everything from all

3380
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
and is representing everything from all
 

3381
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,150
and is representing everything from all
the possible Vantage points

3382
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:22,160

 

3383
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,010

that's an interesting world the

3384
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:25,020
that's an interesting world the
 

3385
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,650
that's an interesting world the
intuition that this thing go out of is a

01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:27,660
intuition that this thing go out of is a
 

3387
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,510
intuition that this thing go out of is a
particular mental state and it's a state

3388
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
particular mental state and it's a state
 

3389
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,370
particular mental state and it's a state
that you find sometimes in literature

3390
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:31,380
that you find sometimes in literature
 

3391
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,950
that you find sometimes in literature
for instance Neil Gaiman describes it in

3392
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:33,960
for instance Neil Gaiman describes it in
 

3393
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,250
for instance Neil Gaiman describes it in
the ocean at the end of the lane and

3394
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:37,260
the ocean at the end of the lane and
 

3395
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,309
the ocean at the end of the lane and
it's this idea that or this experience

01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:40,319
it's this idea that or this experience
 

3397
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,650
it's this idea that or this experience
that there is this date in which you

3398
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:42,660
that there is this date in which you
 

3399
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,510
that there is this date in which you
feel that you know everything that can

01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,520
feel that you know everything that can
 

3401
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,250
feel that you know everything that can
be known and that and your normal human

3402
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:46,260
be known and that and your normal human
 

3403
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,530
be known and that and your normal human
mind you've only forgotten you've

01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:48,540
mind you've only forgotten you've
 

3405
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,789
mind you've only forgotten you've
forgotten that you are the entire

01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:49,799
forgotten that you are the entire
 

3407
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:52,510
forgotten that you are the entire
universe and some people describe this

3408
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:52,520
universe and some people describe this
 

3409
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,710
universe and some people describe this
after they've taken extremely large

3410
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,720
after they've taken extremely large
 

3411
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,349
after they've taken extremely large
amount of mushrooms or had a big

3412
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
amount of mushrooms or had a big
 

3413
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,589
amount of mushrooms or had a big
spiritual experience uh as a hippie in

3414
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:00,599
spiritual experience uh as a hippie in
 

3415
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,630
spiritual experience uh as a hippie in
their 20s and they notice basically that

3416
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
their 20s and they notice basically that
 

3417
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,789
their 20s and they notice basically that
they are in everything and their their

3418
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:04,799
they are in everything and their their
 

3419
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:07,250
they are in everything and their their
body is only one part of the universe

3420
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:07,260
body is only one part of the universe
 

3421
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,589
body is only one part of the universe
and nothing ends at their body and uh

3422
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:09,599
and nothing ends at their body and uh
 

3423
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,569
and nothing ends at their body and uh
actually everything is observing and

3424
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:11,579
actually everything is observing and
 

3425
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,130
actually everything is observing and
they are part of this big Observer and

3426
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:13,140
they are part of this big Observer and
 

3427
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:16,430
they are part of this big Observer and
the big Observer is focused on as one

3428
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:16,440
the big Observer is focused on as one
 

3429
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,589
the big Observer is focused on as one
local point in their body and their

3430
01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:18,599
local point in their body and their
 

3431
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:21,829
local point in their body and their
personality and so on but we can

3432
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:21,839
personality and so on but we can
 

3433
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,569
personality and so on but we can
basically have this Oceanic state in

3434
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:23,579
basically have this Oceanic state in
 

3435
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:25,609
basically have this Oceanic state in
which we Have No Boundaries and are one

3436
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:25,619
which we Have No Boundaries and are one
 

3437
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:28,130
which we Have No Boundaries and are one
with everything and a lot of meditators

3438
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:28,140
with everything and a lot of meditators
 

3439
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,049
with everything and a lot of meditators
call this the non-dual state because you

3440
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:30,059
call this the non-dual state because you
 

3441
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,549
call this the non-dual state because you
no longer have the separation between

3442
01:05:31,549 --> 01:05:31,559
no longer have the separation between
 

3443
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:34,309
no longer have the separation between
surf and world and as I said you can

3444
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319
surf and world and as I said you can
 

3445
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,930
surf and world and as I said you can
explain the state relatively simply

3446
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:35,940
explain the state relatively simply
 

3447
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,230
explain the state relatively simply
without uh pan psychism or anything else

3448
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:39,240
without uh pan psychism or anything else
 

3449
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,089
without uh pan psychism or anything else
but just by breaking down the

3450
01:05:41,089 --> 01:05:41,099
but just by breaking down the
 

3451
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:42,950
but just by breaking down the
constructed boundary between self and

3452
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:42,960
constructed boundary between self and
 

3453
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,109
constructed boundary between self and
world and our own mind but if you

3454
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
world and our own mind but if you
 

3455
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,910
world and our own mind but if you
combine this with the notion that the

3456
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:46,920
combine this with the notion that the
 

3457
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,589
combine this with the notion that the
systems are physically interacting to

3458
01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:48,599
systems are physically interacting to
 

3459
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,329
systems are physically interacting to
the point where their representations

3460
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:50,339
the point where their representations
 

3461
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:52,190
the point where their representations
are merging and interacting with each

3462
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:52,200
are merging and interacting with each
 

3463
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,470
are merging and interacting with each
other you would literally Implement

3464
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:54,480
other you would literally Implement
 

3465
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,450
other you would literally Implement
something like this but it would still

3466
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:56,460
something like this but it would still
 

3467
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,950
something like this but it would still
be a representational state but you

3468
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:57,960
be a representational state but you
 

3469
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,049
be a representational state but you
would not be one with physics itself it

3470
01:06:00,049 --> 01:06:00,059
would not be one with physics itself it
 

3471
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,370
would not be one with physics itself it
would still be coarse grained would

3472
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:01,380
would still be coarse grained would
 

3473
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,170
would still be coarse grained would
still be much slower than physics itself

3474
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:03,180
still be much slower than physics itself
 

3475
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,470
still be much slower than physics itself
but but it would be a representation in

3476
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:06,480
but but it would be a representation in
 

3477
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,010
but but it would be a representation in
which you become aware that you're part

3478
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:10,020
which you become aware that you're part
 

3479
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,450
which you become aware that you're part
of some kind of Global Information

of some kind of Global Information

just I would love to observe that from a

01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:23,640
just I would love to observe that from a
 

3491
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,730
just I would love to observe that from a
video game design perspective how that

3492
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:25,740
video game design perspective how that
 

3493
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,170
video game design perspective how that
game looks

3494
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:27,180
game looks

game looks
maybe you will after we build AGI and it

3496
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000
maybe you will after we build AGI and it
 

3497
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,150
maybe you will after we build AGI and it
takes over but would you be able to step

3498
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
takes over but would you be able to step
 

3499
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,950
takes over but would you be able to step
away step out at the whole thing just

3500
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:33,960
away step out at the whole thing just
 

3501
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,569
away step out at the whole thing just
kind of watch

3502
01:06:35,569 --> 01:06:35,579
kind of watch
 

3503
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:37,609
kind of watch
you know the way we can now

3504
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:37,619
you know the way we can now
 

3505
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,650
you know the way we can now
sometimes when I'm in a crowded party or

3506
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:39,660
sometimes when I'm in a crowded party or
 

3507
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,089
sometimes when I'm in a crowded party or
something like this you step back and

3508
01:06:41,089 --> 01:06:41,099
something like this you step back and
 

3509
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:42,109
something like this you step back and
you realize

3510
01:06:42,109 --> 01:06:42,119
you realize
 

3511
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:44,390
you realize
all the different costumes all the

3512
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400

it's a very weird notion that you feel
that you haven't changed but your

01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:47,279
that you haven't changed but your
 

3677
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:48,829

01:09:48,829 --> 01:09:48,839
account has grown and suddenly you have
 

3679
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:51,309
account has grown and suddenly you have
a lot of people who casually abuse you

3680
01:09:51,309 --> 01:09:51,319
a lot of people who casually abuse you

block more than before and it don't lack
 

3685
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,550
block more than before and it don't lack
this overall Vibe shift and right now

3686
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,560
this overall Vibe shift and right now
 

3687
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,490
this overall Vibe shift and right now
it's still somewhat okay so pretty much

3688
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:01,500
it's still somewhat okay so pretty much
 

3689
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,310
it's still somewhat okay so pretty much
okay so I can go to a place where people

3690
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:04,320
okay so I can go to a place where people
 

3691
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,169
okay so I can go to a place where people
work on stuff that I'm interested in and

3692
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:06,179
work on stuff that I'm interested in and
 

3693
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:07,430
work on stuff that I'm interested in and
there's a good chance that a few people

3694
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,440
there's a good chance that a few people
 

3695
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,689
there's a good chance that a few people
in the room know me so there's no

01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:09,780
awkwardness
 

3699
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:14,750
awkwardness
but when I get to a point where random

3700
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:14,760
but when I get to a point where random
 

3701
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,430

human too I mean you notice this thing
 

3723
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,530
human too I mean you notice this thing
yourself that the more popular you get

3724
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:42,540
yourself that the more popular you get
 

3725
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,169
yourself that the more popular you get
the higher the pressure becomes the the

3726
01:10:45,169 --> 01:10:45,179
the higher the pressure becomes the the
 

3727
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:47,149
the higher the pressure becomes the the
more winds are blowing in your direction

3728
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:47,159
more winds are blowing in your direction
 

3729
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:50,030
more winds are blowing in your direction
from all sides and

3730
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:50,040
from all sides and
 

3731
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,490
from all sides and
um it's stressful right and it does have

3732
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:52,500
um it's stressful right and it does have
 

3733
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,410
um it's stressful right and it does have
a little bit of upside but it also has a

3734
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:54,420
a little bit of upside but it also has a
 

3735
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,450
a little bit of upside but it also has a
lot of downside I think it has a lot of

3736
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:56,460
lot of downside I think it has a lot of
 

3737
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,590
lot of downside I think it has a lot of
upside

3738
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:57,600
upside
 

3739
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,450
upside
at least for me currently at least

3740
01:10:59,450 --> 01:10:59,460
at least for me currently at least
 

3741
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,270
at least for me currently at least
perhaps because of the podcast

3742
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:01,280
perhaps because of the podcast
 

3743
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,030
perhaps because of the podcast
because most people are really good and

3744
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,040
because most people are really good and
 

3745
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,890
because most people are really good and
people come up to me and they have love

3746
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:06,900
people come up to me and they have love
 

3747
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,990
people come up to me and they have love
in their eyes and over a stretch of like

3748
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:09,000
in their eyes and over a stretch of like
 

3749
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,630
in their eyes and over a stretch of like
30 seconds you can hug it out and you

3750
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:11,640
30 seconds you can hug it out and you
 

3751
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,030
30 seconds you can hug it out and you
can just exchange a few words and you

3752
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:14,040
can just exchange a few words and you
 

3753
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,689
can just exchange a few words and you
you reinvigorate your love for Humanity

3754
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:16,699
you reinvigorate your love for Humanity
 

3755
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:20,630
you reinvigorate your love for Humanity
so that's an upside yes for a loner I'm

3756
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640
so that's an upside yes for a loner I'm

3759
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,669
alone because because otherwise you have
to do a lot of work to find such humans

3760
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
to do a lot of work to find such humans
 

3761
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,330

so I'm quite fascinated by these large
 

3977
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,390
so I'm quite fascinated by these large
language models but I also think that

3978
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:35,400
language models but I also think that
 

3979
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,209
language models but I also think that
they aren't by no means the final

3980
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:38,219
they aren't by no means the final

and it's interesting to see how this

3984
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
and it's interesting to see how this
 

3985
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,110
and it's interesting to see how this
development progresses one thing that

3986
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:44,120
development progresses one thing that
 

3987
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,610
development progresses one thing that
the out of the box vanilla language

3988
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:46,620
the out of the box vanilla language
 

3989
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,070
the out of the box vanilla language
models have as a limitation is that they

3990
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:49,080
models have as a limitation is that they
 

3991
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,530
models have as a limitation is that they
have still some limited coherence and

3992
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:51,540
have still some limited coherence and
 

3993
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,689
have still some limited coherence and
ability to construct complexity

3994
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:53,699
ability to construct complexity
 

3995
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,689
ability to construct complexity
and even though they exceed human

3996
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:56,699
and even though they exceed human
 

3997
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:58,669
and even though they exceed human
abilities to do what what they can do

3998
01:15:58,669 --> 01:15:58,679
abilities to do what what they can do
 

3999
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,130
abilities to do what what they can do
one shot

4000
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:00,140
one shot
 

4001
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:03,050
one shot
typically when you write a text with a

4002
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:03,060
typically when you write a text with a
 

4003
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,550
typically when you write a text with a
language model or using it or when you

4004
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
language model or using it or when you
 

4005
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,890
language model or using it or when you
write code for the language model it's

4006
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:06,900
write code for the language model it's
 

4007
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,570
write code for the language model it's
not one shot because there won't be bugs

4008
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:08,580
not one shot because there won't be bugs
 

4009
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,729
not one shot because there won't be bugs
in your program and design errors and

4010
01:16:10,729 --> 01:16:10,739
in your program and design errors and
 

4011
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:12,830
in your program and design errors and
compiler errors and so on and your

4012
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:12,840
compiler errors and so on and your
 

4013
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,450
compiler errors and so on and your
language model can help you to fix those

4014
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:14,460
language model can help you to fix those
 

4015
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,850
language model can help you to fix those
things but this process is out of the

4016
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:16,860
things but this process is out of the
 

4017
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,550
things but this process is out of the
box not automated yet so there is a

4018
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:19,560
box not automated yet so there is a
 

4019
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,530
box not automated yet so there is a
management process that also needs to be

4020
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:21,540
management process that also needs to be
 

4021
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:22,270
management process that also needs to be
done

4022
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:22,280
done
 

4023
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,530
done
and there are some interesting

4024
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:24,540
and there are some interesting
 

4025
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,810
and there are some interesting
developments bbagi and so on that are

4026
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:26,820
developments bbagi and so on that are
 

4027
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,970
developments bbagi and so on that are
trying to automate this man uh this

4028
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:28,980
trying to automate this man uh this
 

4029
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,250
trying to automate this man uh this
management process as well and I suspect

4030
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:31,260
management process as well and I suspect
 

4031
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:32,750
management process as well and I suspect
that soon we are going to see a bunch of

4032
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:32,760
that soon we are going to see a bunch of
 

4033
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,850
that soon we are going to see a bunch of
cognitive architectures where every

4034
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:34,860
cognitive architectures where every
 

4035
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:37,430
cognitive architectures where every
module is in some sense a language model

4036
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,440
module is in some sense a language model
 

4037
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,830
module is in some sense a language model
or something equivalent and between the

4038
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:39,840
or something equivalent and between the
 

4039
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,570
or something equivalent and between the
language models we exchange suitable

4040
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:41,580
language models we exchange suitable
 

4041
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,530
language models we exchange suitable
data structures not English

4042
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:44,540
data structures not English
 

4043
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:48,169
data structures not English
and produce compound behavior of this

4044
01:16:48,169 --> 01:16:48,179
and produce compound behavior of this
 

4045
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:50,149
and produce compound behavior of this
whole thing to do some of the

4046
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:50,159
whole thing to do some of the
 

4047
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,310
whole thing to do some of the
quote-unquote prompt engineering for you

4048
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,320
quote-unquote prompt engineering for you
 

4049
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,350
quote-unquote prompt engineering for you
yeah it creates as these kind of

4050
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:54,360
yeah it creates as these kind of
 

4051
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,790
yeah it creates as these kind of
cognitive architectures that do the form

4052
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:55,800
cognitive architectures that do the form
 

4053
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,290
cognitive architectures that do the form
of engineering and you're just doing the

4054
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:57,300
of engineering and you're just doing the
 

4055
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,090
of engineering and you're just doing the
high high level

4056
01:16:59,090 --> 01:16:59,100
high high level
 

4057
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,790
high high level
yeah meta prompt engineering

4058
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:01,800
yeah meta prompt engineering
 

4059
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,370
yeah meta prompt engineering
there are limitations in a language

4060
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:04,380
there are limitations in a language
 

4061
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,070
there are limitations in a language
model alone I feel that part of my mind

4062
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:07,080
model alone I feel that part of my mind
 

4063
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,990
model alone I feel that part of my mind
works similarly to a language model

4064
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,000
works similarly to a language model
 

4065
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,229
works similarly to a language model
which means I can yell into it a prompt

4066
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
which means I can yell into it a prompt
 

4067
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,729
which means I can yell into it a prompt
and it's going to give me a creative

4068
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:13,739
and it's going to give me a creative
 

4069
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:16,790
and it's going to give me a creative
response but I have to do something with

4070
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:16,800
response but I have to do something with
 

4071
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,790
response but I have to do something with
the points first I have to take it as a

4072
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:19,800
the points first I have to take it as a
 

4073
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,070
the points first I have to take it as a
generative artifact that may or may not

4074
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:22,080
generative artifact that may or may not
 

4075
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,110
generative artifact that may or may not
be true it can it's usually a

4076
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:24,120
be true it can it's usually a
 

4077
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,330
be true it can it's usually a
contribulation it's just an idea and

4078
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:26,340
contribulation it's just an idea and
 

4079
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:29,209
contribulation it's just an idea and
then I take this idea and modify it I

4080
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:29,219
then I take this idea and modify it I
 

4081
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:31,930
then I take this idea and modify it I
might build a new prompt that is

4082
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:31,940
might build a new prompt that is
 

4083
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,790
might build a new prompt that is
stepping off this idea and develops it

4084
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:34,800
stepping off this idea and develops it
 

4085
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,709
stepping off this idea and develops it
to the next level or it put it into

4086
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:36,719
to the next level or it put it into
 

4087
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,410
to the next level or it put it into
something larger or I might try to prove

4088
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:39,420
something larger or I might try to prove
 

4089
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,970
something larger or I might try to prove
whether it's true or make an experiment

4090
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:40,980
whether it's true or make an experiment
 

4091
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,250
whether it's true or make an experiment
and this is what the language models

4092
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:43,260
and this is what the language models
 

4093
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,470
and this is what the language models
right now are not doing yet but there's

4094
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:45,480
right now are not doing yet but there's
 

4095
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,169
right now are not doing yet but there's
also no technical reason for why they

4096
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:48,179
also no technical reason for why they
 

4097
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:50,209
also no technical reason for why they
shouldn't be able to do this so the way

4098
01:17:50,209 --> 01:17:50,219
shouldn't be able to do this so the way
 

4099
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:52,130
shouldn't be able to do this so the way
to make a language model coherent is

4100
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:52,140
to make a language model coherent is
 

4101
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,590
to make a language model coherent is
probably not to use reinforcement

4102
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:54,600
probably not to use reinforcement
 

4103
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,450
probably not to use reinforcement

its source data but it's using this is a
 

4109
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,270
its source data but it's using this is a

01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:05,280
component in the larger system that can
 

4111
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,070
component in the larger system that can
also be built by the language model or

4112
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:07,080
also be built by the language model or
 

4113
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,010
also be built by the language model or
is enabled by language model structured

Technologies I suspect that language

4118
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
Technologies I suspect that language

models will be an important stepping

4120
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:16,260
models will be an important stepping

01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000
stone in developing
 

4123
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,810
stone in developing
different types of systems and one thing

4124
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:20,820
different types of systems and one thing
 

4125
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,810
different types of systems and one thing
that is is really missing in the form of

4126
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:23,820
that is is really missing in the form of
 

4127
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,450
that is is really missing in the form of
language models that we have today is

4128
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:25,460
language models that we have today is
 

4129
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:28,070
language models that we have today is
real-time World coupling right it's

4130
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:28,080
real-time World coupling right it's
 

4131
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:31,010
real-time World coupling right it's
difficult to do perception with a

4132
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:31,020
difficult to do perception with a
 

4133
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,630
difficult to do perception with a
language model and motor control with

4134
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:32,640
language model and motor control with
 

4135
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,310
language model and motor control with
the language model instead you would

4136
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
the language model instead you would
 

4137
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,010
the language model instead you would
need to have different type of of thing

4138
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:37,020
need to have different type of of thing
 

4139
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:39,350
need to have different type of of thing
that is working with it also the

4140
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,360
that is working with it also the
 

4141
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,149
that is working with it also the
language model is a little bit obscuring

4142
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:41,159
language model is a little bit obscuring
 

4143
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:44,450
language model is a little bit obscuring
but it's actually functionality is some

4144
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:44,460
but it's actually functionality is some

people associate the structure of the

4146
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:47,159
people associate the structure of the
 

4147
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:48,530
people associate the structure of the
neural network of the language model

4148
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:48,540
neural network of the language model
 

4149
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:49,970
neural network of the language model
with the nervous system and I think

4150
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:49,980
with the nervous system and I think
 

4151
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,590
with the nervous system and I think
that's the wrong intuition

4152
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:51,600
that's the wrong intuition
 

4153
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,570
that's the wrong intuition
and the neural networks are under

4154
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:53,580
and the neural networks are under
 

4155
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:56,050
and the neural networks are under
nervous system they are more like

01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:00,130
nervous system they are more like
100 step functions that use

recent brain States it's basically a
 

4165
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,350
recent brain States it's basically a

function that moves the step system from
 

4167
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,689
function that moves the step system from

one representational state to the next
 

4169
01:19:11,699 --> 01:19:14,450
one representational state to the next
representational state right so it's if

similar Behavior right and the brain is
 

4217
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,550

so one way in which you could try to

4232
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:26,219
so one way in which you could try to
 

4233
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:28,370
so one way in which you could try to
look at this is that individual neurons

01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:28,380
look at this is that individual neurons
 

4235
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,050
look at this is that individual neurons
probably need to get a reward so they

4236
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:30,060
probably need to get a reward so they
 

4237
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,850
probably need to get a reward so they
become trainable which means they have

4238
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:31,860
become trainable which means they have
 

4239
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,430
become trainable which means they have
to have inputs that are not affecting

01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,590
to have inputs that are not affecting
the metabolism of the cell directly but

their messages semantic messages that
 

4245
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,010
their messages semantic messages that
tell the cell whether it says done good

4246
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:40,020
tell the cell whether it says done good
 

4247
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,050
tell the cell whether it says done good
or bad and in which direction it should

4248
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:42,060
or bad and in which direction it should
 

4249
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,390
or bad and in which direction it should
shift Its Behavior right once you have

01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,400
shift Its Behavior right once you have
 

4251
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,729
shift Its Behavior right once you have
such an input neurons become trainable

such an input neurons become trainable
 

4253
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:48,590
such an input neurons become trainable
and you can train them to perform

4254
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:48,600
and you can train them to perform
 

4255
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,410
and you can train them to perform
computations by exchanging messages with

also suspect that the brain does not

01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:05,460
also suspect that the brain does not
 

4269
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,729
also suspect that the brain does not

will be involved intimately in the

01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:14,090
will be involved intimately in the

01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
instrumental in distributing rewards and

01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,790
instrumental in distributing rewards and

01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:19,800
in managing its functionality
 

4281
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,729
in managing its functionality
it's uh fascinating to think about what

4282
01:21:22,729 --> 01:21:22,739
it's uh fascinating to think about what
 

4283
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:24,590
it's uh fascinating to think about what
those characteristics of the brain

4284
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:24,600
those characteristics of the brain
 

4285
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,110
those characteristics of the brain
enable you to do is that language models

4286
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:27,120
enable you to do is that language models
 

4287
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,330
enable you to do is that language models
cannot do so first of all it's there's a

4288
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:29,340
cannot do so first of all it's there's a
 

4289
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,830
cannot do so first of all it's there's a
different loss function at work when we

4290
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:30,840
different loss function at work when we
 

4291
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,070
different loss function at work when we
learn yeah and to me it's fascinating

4292
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:34,080
learn yeah and to me it's fascinating
 

4293
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,990
learn yeah and to me it's fascinating
that you can build a system that looks

4294
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,000
that you can build a system that looks
 

4295
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,110
that you can build a system that looks
at 800 million pictures and captions and

4296
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:39,120
at 800 million pictures and captions and
 

4297
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,149
at 800 million pictures and captions and
correlates them because I don't think

4298
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:41,159
correlates them because I don't think
 

4299
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:42,770
correlates them because I don't think
that the human nervous system could do

01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:42,780
that the human nervous system could do

01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:44,030
that the human nervous system could do
this

4302
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:44,040
this
 

4303
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,770
this
for us the world is only learnable

4304
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:45,780
for us the world is only learnable
 

4305
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:47,750
for us the world is only learnable
because the adjacent frames are related

4306
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:47,760
because the adjacent frames are related
 

4307
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,270
because the adjacent frames are related
and we can afford to discard most of

4308
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:50,280
and we can afford to discard most of
 

4309
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,950
and we can afford to discard most of
that information during learning we

4310
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:51,960
that information during learning we
 

4311
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,050
that information during learning we
basically take only in stuff that makes

4312
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:54,060
basically take only in stuff that makes
 

4313
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,810
basically take only in stuff that makes
us more coherent not less coherent and

4314
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:56,820
us more coherent not less coherent and
 

4315
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,850
us more coherent not less coherent and
our neural networks are willing to look

4316
01:21:58,850 --> 01:21:58,860
our neural networks are willing to look
 

4317
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:00,950
our neural networks are willing to look
at data that is not making the neural

4318
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
at data that is not making the neural
 

4319
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,810
at data that is not making the neural
network coherent at first but only in

4320
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:02,820
network coherent at first but only in
 

4321
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,669
network coherent at first but only in
the long run by doing lots and lots

4322
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:04,679
the long run by doing lots and lots
 

4323
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:07,010
the long run by doing lots and lots
statistics eventually patterns become

4324
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:07,020
statistics eventually patterns become
 

4325
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:10,669
statistics eventually patterns become
visible and emerge and our mind seems to

4326
01:22:10,669 --> 01:22:10,679
visible and emerge and our mind seems to
 

4327
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:12,649
visible and emerge and our mind seems to
be focused on finding the patterns as

4328
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:12,659
be focused on finding the patterns as
 

4329
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:14,570
be focused on finding the patterns as
early as possible yeah so filtering

4330
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:14,580
early as possible yeah so filtering
 

4331
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,910
early as possible yeah so filtering
early on yes not later yes it's a

4332
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:16,920
early on yes not later yes it's a
 

4333
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,410
early on yes not later yes it's a
slightly different Paradigm and it leads

4334
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:18,420
slightly different Paradigm and it leads
 

4335
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,090
slightly different Paradigm and it leads
to much faster convergence so we only

4336
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:20,100
to much faster convergence so we only
 

4337
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,669
to much faster convergence so we only
need to look the tiny fraction of the

4338
01:22:22,669 --> 01:22:22,679
need to look the tiny fraction of the
 

4339
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:25,070
need to look the tiny fraction of the
data to become coherent and of course we

4340
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:25,080
data to become coherent and of course we
 

4341
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,709
data to become coherent and of course we
we do not have the same richness as our

4342
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:27,719
we do not have the same richness as our
 

4343
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:29,810
we do not have the same richness as our
trained models here we will not

4344
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:29,820
trained models here we will not
 

4345
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,390
trained models here we will not
incorporate the entirety of text in the

4346
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:32,400
incorporate the entirety of text in the
 

4347
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,790
incorporate the entirety of text in the
internet and be able to refer to it and

4348
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:34,800
internet and be able to refer to it and
 

4349
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,290
internet and be able to refer to it and
have all this knowledge available and

4350
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:36,300
have all this knowledge available and
 

4351
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,910
have all this knowledge available and
being able to confabulate over it

4352
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:37,920
being able to confabulate over it
 

4353
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,490
being able to confabulate over it
instead we have a much much smaller part

4354
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:40,500
instead we have a much much smaller part
 

4355
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,530
instead we have a much much smaller part
of it that is more deliberately built

4356
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:42,540
of it that is more deliberately built
 

4357
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,750
of it that is more deliberately built
and to me it would be fascinating to

4358
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:44,760
and to me it would be fascinating to
 

4359
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,430
and to me it would be fascinating to
think about how to build such systems

4360
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:46,440
think about how to build such systems
 

4361
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,470
think about how to build such systems
it's not obvious that they would

4362
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:48,480
it's not obvious that they would
 

4363
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,350
it's not obvious that they would
necessarily be more efficient than us on

4364
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
necessarily be more efficient than us on
 

4365
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,689
necessarily be more efficient than us on
a digital substrate but I suspect that

4366
01:22:53,689 --> 01:22:53,699
a digital substrate but I suspect that
 

4367
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:56,209
a digital substrate but I suspect that
they might so I suspect that the actual

4368
01:22:56,209 --> 01:22:56,219
they might so I suspect that the actual
 

4369
01:22:56,219 --> 01:22:58,850
they might so I suspect that the actual
AGI that is going to be more interesting

4370
01:22:58,850 --> 01:22:58,860
AGI that is going to be more interesting
 

4371
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,410
AGI that is going to be more interesting
is going to use slightly different

4372
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:00,420
is going to use slightly different
 

4373
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,390
is going to use slightly different
algorithmic paradigms or sometimes

4374
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:02,400
algorithmic paradigms or sometimes
 

4375
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,709
algorithmic paradigms or sometimes
massively different algorithmic

4376
01:23:03,709 --> 01:23:03,719
massively different algorithmic
 

4377
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:06,770
massively different algorithmic
paradigms then the current generation of

4378
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:06,780
paradigms then the current generation of
 

4379
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,630
paradigms then the current generation of
Transformer based learning systems do

4380
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:08,640
Transformer based learning systems do
 

4381
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,070
Transformer based learning systems do
you think it might be using just a bunch

4382
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
you think it might be using just a bunch
 

4383
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,050
you think it might be using just a bunch
of language models like this do you

4384
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:12,060
of language models like this do you
 

4385
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,330
of language models like this do you
think

4386
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:13,340
think
 

4387
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:16,490
think
the current Transformer based large

4388
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:16,500
the current Transformer based large
 

4389
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:20,270
the current Transformer based large
language models will take us to AGI

4390
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:20,280
language models will take us to AGI
 

4391
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,610
language models will take us to AGI
and my main issue is I think that

4392
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:22,620
and my main issue is I think that
 

4393
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:25,250
and my main issue is I think that
they're quite ugly and uh which

4394
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:25,260
they're quite ugly and uh which
 

4395
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,649
they're quite ugly and uh which
brutalist yeah you said yes they are

4396
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:27,659
brutalist yeah you said yes they are
 

4397
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:29,330
brutalist yeah you said yes they are
basically brute forcing the problem of

4398
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:29,340
basically brute forcing the problem of
 

4399
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,110
basically brute forcing the problem of
thought

4400
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:30,120
thought
 

4401
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,830
thought
and uh by training the thing with

4402
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:33,840
and uh by training the thing with
 

4403
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,169
and uh by training the thing with
looking at instances where people have

4404
01:23:36,169 --> 01:23:36,179
looking at instances where people have
 

4405
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:37,910
looking at instances where people have
thought and then trying to defect that

4406
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:37,920
thought and then trying to defect that
 

4407
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,729
thought and then trying to defect that
and if you have enough data the depak

4408
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:40,739
and if you have enough data the depak
 

4409
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:42,350
and if you have enough data the depak
becomes indistinguishable from the

4410
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:42,360
becomes indistinguishable from the
 

4411
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,790
becomes indistinguishable from the
actual phenomenon and in many

4412
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:43,800
actual phenomenon and in many
 

4413
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,890
actual phenomenon and in many
circumstances it's going to be identical

4414
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:45,900
circumstances it's going to be identical
 

4415
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:49,370
circumstances it's going to be identical
can you deep fake it till you make it

4416
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:49,380
can you deep fake it till you make it
 

4417
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,010
can you deep fake it till you make it
so can you achieve um what are the

4418
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:52,020
so can you achieve um what are the
 

4419
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,450
so can you achieve um what are the
limitations of this I mean can you

4420
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:53,460
limitations of this I mean can you
 

4421
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:55,310
limitations of this I mean can you
reason

4422
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:55,320

4423
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,250

let's use words that are loaded that's

4424
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:58,260
let's use words that are loaded that's
 

4425
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,689
let's use words that are loaded that's
that's that's a very interesting

4426
01:23:59,689 --> 01:23:59,699
that's that's a very interesting
 

4427
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,790
that's that's a very interesting
question I I think that these models are

4428
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:01,800
question I I think that these models are
 

4429
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,950
question I I think that these models are
clearly making some inference but if you

4430
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:03,960
clearly making some inference but if you
 

4431
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,229
clearly making some inference but if you
give them a reasoning task it's often

4432
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:06,239
give them a reasoning task it's often
 

4433
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,270
give them a reasoning task it's often
difficult for the experimenters to

4434
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:08,280
difficult for the experimenters to
 

4435
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,430
difficult for the experimenters to
figure out whether the reasoning is the

4436
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:10,440
figure out whether the reasoning is the
 

4437
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,229
figure out whether the reasoning is the
result of the emulation of the reasoning

4438
01:24:12,229 --> 01:24:12,239
result of the emulation of the reasoning
 

4439
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,390
result of the emulation of the reasoning
strategy that they saw in human written

01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
strategy that they saw in human written
 

4441
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,370
strategy that they saw in human written
text or whether it's something that the

4442
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:16,380
text or whether it's something that the
 

4443
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,370
text or whether it's something that the
system was able to infer by itself on

4444
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:19,380
system was able to infer by itself on
 

4445
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,630
system was able to infer by itself on
the other hand if you think of human

4446
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:20,640
the other hand if you think of human
 

4447
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,070
the other hand if you think of human
reasoning

4448
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:22,080
reasoning
 

4449
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,110

um you if you want to become a very good

4450
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:24,120
um you if you want to become a very good
 

4451
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,229
um you if you want to become a very good
Reasoner you don't do this by just

4452
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:27,239
Reasoner you don't do this by just
 

4453
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:28,910
Reasoner you don't do this by just
figuring out yourself you read about

01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:28,920
figuring out yourself you read about
 

4455
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,430
figuring out yourself you read about
reasoning and the first people who try

reasoning and the first people who try
 

4457
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,990
reasoning and the first people who try
to write about reasoning and reflect on

4458
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:33,000
to write about reasoning and reflect on
 

4459
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,030
to write about reasoning and reflect on
it didn't get it right like even

4460
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:35,040

4619
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,649
fine-tuning it building additional
layers and so on and then the next day

4620
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:33,659
layers and so on and then the next day
 

4621
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:35,870
layers and so on and then the next day
it starts with a fresh database in the

4622
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:35,880
it starts with a fresh database in the
 

4623
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,729
it starts with a fresh database in the
morning with fresh eyes and has

4624
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:37,739
morning with fresh eyes and has
 

4625
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:39,830
morning with fresh eyes and has
integrated all this stuff and you know

4626
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
integrated all this stuff and you know
 

4627
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,570
integrated all this stuff and you know
when you talk to people and you have

4628
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:41,580
when you talk to people and you have
 

4629
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,250
when you talk to people and you have
strong disagreements about something

4630
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:43,260
strong disagreements about something
 

4631
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,990
strong disagreements about something
which means that in their mind they have

4632
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:45,000
which means that in their mind they have
 

4633
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,850
which means that in their mind they have
a faulty belief or you have a faulty

4634
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:46,860
a faulty belief or you have a faulty
 

4635
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,649
a faulty belief or you have a faulty
belief with a lot of dependencies on it

4636
01:27:48,649 --> 01:27:48,659
belief with a lot of dependencies on it
 

4637
01:27:48,659 --> 01:27:50,390
belief with a lot of dependencies on it
very often you will not achieve

4638
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:50,400
very often you will not achieve
 

4639
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,129
very often you will not achieve
agreement in one session but you need to

4640
01:27:52,129 --> 01:27:52,139
agreement in one session but you need to
 

4641
01:27:52,139 --> 01:27:54,110
agreement in one session but you need to
sleep about this once or multiple times

4642
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,120
sleep about this once or multiple times
 

4643
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,270
sleep about this once or multiple times
for you before you have integrated all

4644
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:56,280
for you before you have integrated all
 

4645
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:58,129
for you before you have integrated all
these necessary changes in your mind so

4646
01:27:58,129 --> 01:27:58,139
these necessary changes in your mind so
 

4647
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,290
these necessary changes in your mind so
maybe it's already somewhat similar yeah

4648
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:00,300
maybe it's already somewhat similar yeah
 

4649
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,209
maybe it's already somewhat similar yeah
right there's already a latency and for

4650
01:28:02,209 --> 01:28:02,219
right there's already a latency and for
 

4651
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:04,010
right there's already a latency and for
humans to update the model yeah we train

4652
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:04,020
humans to update the model yeah we train
 

4653
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:05,810
humans to update the model yeah we train
the model and of course we can combine

4654
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:05,820
the model and of course we can combine
 

4655
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,430
the model and of course we can combine
the language model with models that get

4656
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:07,440
the language model with models that get
 

4657
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,709
the language model with models that get
coupled to reality in real time and we

4658
01:28:09,709 --> 01:28:09,719
coupled to reality in real time and we
 

4659
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:11,330
coupled to reality in real time and we
can build multimodal model and bridge

4660
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:11,340
can build multimodal model and bridge
 

4661
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:13,250
can build multimodal model and bridge
between Vision models and language

4662
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:13,260
between Vision models and language
 

4663
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,010
between Vision models and language
models and so on so there is no reason

4664
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:16,020
models and so on so there is no reason
 

4665
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,709
models and so on so there is no reason
to believe that the language models will

4666
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
to believe that the language models will
 

4667
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,830
to believe that the language models will
necessarily run into some problem that

4668
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:21,840
necessarily run into some problem that
 

4669
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,750
necessarily run into some problem that
will prevent them from becoming

4670
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:23,760
will prevent them from becoming
 

4671
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,729
will prevent them from becoming
generally intelligent

4672
01:28:25,729 --> 01:28:25,739
generally intelligent
 

4673
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:28,790
generally intelligent
but I don't know that it's just I don't

4674
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:28,800
but I don't know that it's just I don't
 

4675
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,370
but I don't know that it's just I don't
see proof that they wouldn't my issue is

4676
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:31,380
see proof that they wouldn't my issue is
 

4677
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:32,629
see proof that they wouldn't my issue is
I don't like them I think that they're

4678
01:28:32,629 --> 01:28:32,639
I don't like them I think that they're
 

4679
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:34,430
I don't like them I think that they're
inefficient I think that they use way

4680
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:34,440
inefficient I think that they use way
 

4681
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:37,010
inefficient I think that they use way
too much compute I think that given the

4682
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:37,020
too much compute I think that given the
 

4683
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,169
too much compute I think that given the
amazing Hardware that we have we could

4684
01:28:39,169 --> 01:28:39,179
amazing Hardware that we have we could
 

4685
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:40,669
amazing Hardware that we have we could
build something that is much more

4686
01:28:40,669 --> 01:28:40,679
build something that is much more
 

4687
01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:42,290
build something that is much more
beautiful than our own mind and this

4688
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:42,300
beautiful than our own mind and this
 

4689
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,510
beautiful than our own mind and this
thing is not as beautiful than at as our

4690
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:44,520
thing is not as beautiful than at as our
 

4691
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,390
thing is not as beautiful than at as our
own mind despite being so much larger

4692
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:47,400
own mind despite being so much larger
 

4693
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,090
own mind despite being so much larger
but it's a kind of proof of concept it's

4694
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:50,100
but it's a kind of proof of concept it's
 

4695
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,470
but it's a kind of proof of concept it's
the only thing that works right now

4696
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:51,480
the only thing that works right now
 

4697
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,169
the only thing that works right now
right so it's the it's not the only game

4698
01:28:54,169 --> 01:28:54,179
right so it's the it's not the only game
 

4699
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:56,750
right so it's the it's not the only game
in town but it's the only thing that has

4700
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:56,760
in town but it's the only thing that has
 

4701
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,729
in town but it's the only thing that has
this utility there's so much Simplicity

4702
01:28:58,729 --> 01:28:58,739
this utility there's so much Simplicity
 

4703
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:00,410
this utility there's so much Simplicity
and there's a bunch of relatively simple

4704
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:00,420
and there's a bunch of relatively simple
 

4705
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,570
and there's a bunch of relatively simple
algorithms that you can understand in

4706
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:02,580
algorithms that you can understand in
 

4707
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:05,689
algorithms that you can understand in
relatively few weeks that can be scaled

4708
01:29:05,689 --> 01:29:05,699
relatively few weeks that can be scaled
 

4709
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:06,890
relatively few weeks that can be scaled
up massively

4710
01:29:06,890 --> 01:29:06,900
up massively
 

4711
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,050
up massively
so it's the uh the deep blue of Chess

4712
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:09,060
so it's the uh the deep blue of Chess
 

4713
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,189
so it's the uh the deep blue of Chess
playing

4714
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:10,199
playing
 

4715
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:12,350
playing
yeah it's not it's ugly yeah called

4716
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:12,360
yeah it's not it's ugly yeah called
 

4717
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,910
yeah it's not it's ugly yeah called
China and hit this uh when you describe

4718
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:13,920
China and hit this uh when you describe
 

4719
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,070
China and hit this uh when you describe
chess suggested that there are two main

4720
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:16,080
chess suggested that there are two main
 

4721
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,689
chess suggested that there are two main
strategies in which you could play chess

4722
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:17,699
strategies in which you could play chess
 

4723
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:20,090
strategies in which you could play chess
one is that you are making a very

4724
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:20,100
one is that you are making a very
 

4725
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,890
one is that you are making a very
complicated plan that reaches far into

4726
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:21,900
complicated plan that reaches far into
 

4727
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,990
complicated plan that reaches far into
the future and you try not to make a

4728
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
the future and you try not to make a
 

4729
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,870
the future and you try not to make a
mistake while enacting it and this is

4730
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:26,880
mistake while enacting it and this is
 

4731
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,430
mistake while enacting it and this is
basically the human strategy and the

4732
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:28,440
basically the human strategy and the
 

4733
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,470
basically the human strategy and the
other strategy is that you are brute

4734
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:30,480
other strategy is that you are brute
 

4735
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,209
other strategy is that you are brute
forcing your way to success which means

4736
01:29:32,209 --> 01:29:32,219
forcing your way to success which means
 

4737
01:29:32,219 --> 01:29:34,490
forcing your way to success which means
you make a tree of possible moves where

4738
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:34,500
you make a tree of possible moves where
 

4739
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,229
you make a tree of possible moves where
you look at in principle every move that

4740
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
you look at in principle every move that
 

4741
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,270
you look at in principle every move that
is open to you or the possible answers

4742
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:38,280
is open to you or the possible answers
 

4743
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,850
is open to you or the possible answers
and you try to make this as deeply as

4744
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:40,860
and you try to make this as deeply as
 

4745
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:42,470
and you try to make this as deeply as
possible of course you optimize you cut

4746
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
possible of course you optimize you cut
 

4747
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,270
possible of course you optimize you cut
off trees that don't look very promising

4748
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:44,280
off trees that don't look very promising
 

4749
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:48,169
off trees that don't look very promising
and you use libraries of um end game and

4750
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:48,179
and you use libraries of um end game and
 

4751
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:49,910
and you use libraries of um end game and
early game and so on to optimize this

4752
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:49,920
early game and so on to optimize this
 

4753
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,890
early game and so on to optimize this
entire process but this boot Force

4754
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:51,900
entire process but this boot Force
 

4755
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,350
entire process but this boot Force
strategy is how most of the chess

4756
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:54,360
strategy is how most of the chess
 

4757
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,990
strategy is how most of the chess
programs were built and this is how

4758
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:57,000
programs were built and this is how
 

4759
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,790
programs were built and this is how
computers get better than humans at

4760
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:58,800
computers get better than humans at
 

4761
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,550
computers get better than humans at
playing chess and um and I look at the

4762
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:01,560
playing chess and um and I look at the
 

4763
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,950
playing chess and um and I look at the
large language models I feel that I'm

4764
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:03,960
large language models I feel that I'm
 

4765
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,689
large language models I feel that I'm
observing the same thing it's basically

4766
01:30:05,689 --> 01:30:05,699
observing the same thing it's basically
 

4767
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:07,729
observing the same thing it's basically
The Brute Force strategy to thought by

4768
01:30:07,729 --> 01:30:07,739
The Brute Force strategy to thought by
 

4769
01:30:07,739 --> 01:30:09,229
The Brute Force strategy to thought by
training this thing on pretty much the

4770
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:09,239
training this thing on pretty much the
 

4771
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:11,510
training this thing on pretty much the
entire internet and then in the limit it

4772
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:11,520
entire internet and then in the limit it
 

4773
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,370
entire internet and then in the limit it
gets coherent to a degree that

4774
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:13,380
gets coherent to a degree that
 

4775
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,850
gets coherent to a degree that
approaches human coherence yeah and on a

4776
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:16,860
approaches human coherence yeah and on a
 

4777
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,649
approaches human coherence yeah and on a
side effect it's able to do things that

4778
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:18,659
side effect it's able to do things that
 

4779
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:21,890
side effect it's able to do things that
no human could do right it's able to uh

4780
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:21,900
no human could do right it's able to uh
 

4781
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,450
no human could do right it's able to uh
sift through massive amounts of text

4782
01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:23,460
sift through massive amounts of text
 

4783
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,189
sift through massive amounts of text
relatively quickly and summarize them

4784
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:25,199
relatively quickly and summarize them
 

4785
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,590
relatively quickly and summarize them
quickly and never lapses in attention

4786
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:27,600
quickly and never lapses in attention
 

4787
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,050
quickly and never lapses in attention
and I still have the illusion that when

4788
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,060
and I still have the illusion that when
 

4789
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,030
and I still have the illusion that when
I play with chat GPT that it's in

4790
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:32,040
I play with chat GPT that it's in
 

4791
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,890
I play with chat GPT that it's in
principle not doing anything that I

4792
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:33,900
principle not doing anything that I
 

4793
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,870
principle not doing anything that I
could not do if I had Google at my

4794
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:35,880
could not do if I had Google at my
 

4795
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,850
could not do if I had Google at my
disposal and I get all the resources

4796
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:37,860
disposal and I get all the resources
 

4797
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,350
disposal and I get all the resources
from the internet and spend enough time

4798
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,360
from the internet and spend enough time
 

4799
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,770
from the internet and spend enough time
on it but uh this this thing that I have

4800
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:42,780
on it but uh this this thing that I have
 

4801
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:46,189
on it but uh this this thing that I have
an extremely autistic stupid intern in a

4802
01:30:46,189 --> 01:30:46,199
an extremely autistic stupid intern in a
 

4803
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:48,050
an extremely autistic stupid intern in a
way that is extremely good at directory

4804
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:48,060
way that is extremely good at directory
 

4805
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:50,990
way that is extremely good at directory
and I can offload the droidery to the

4806
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:51,000
and I can offload the droidery to the
 

4807
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,550
and I can offload the droidery to the
degree that I'm able to automate the

4808
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:52,560
degree that I'm able to automate the
 

4809
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,149
degree that I'm able to automate the
management of the intern is is something

4810
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:56,159
management of the intern is is something
 

4811
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,669
management of the intern is is something
that is difficult for me to overhype at

4812
01:30:58,669 --> 01:30:58,679
that is difficult for me to overhype at
 

4813
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:00,530
that is difficult for me to overhype at
this point because we have not yet

4814
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:00,540
this point because we have not yet
 

4815
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,510
this point because we have not yet
started to scratch the surface of what's

4816
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:02,520
started to scratch the surface of what's
 

4817
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,550
started to scratch the surface of what's
possible with this but it feels like

4818
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:04,560
possible with this but it feels like
 

4819
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,169
possible with this but it feels like
it's a tireless intern or maybe it's an

4820
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:06,179
it's a tireless intern or maybe it's an
 

4821
01:31:06,179 --> 01:31:07,729
it's a tireless intern or maybe it's an
army of interns

4822
01:31:07,729 --> 01:31:07,739
army of interns
 

4823
01:31:07,739 --> 01:31:10,970
army of interns
and so you get to command

4824
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:10,980
and so you get to command
 

4825
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:15,290
and so you get to command
these slightly incompetent creatures

4826
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:15,300
these slightly incompetent creatures
 

4827
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,870
these slightly incompetent creatures
and there's an aspect because of how

4828
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:17,880
and there's an aspect because of how
 

4829
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,689
and there's an aspect because of how
rapidly you can iterate with it

4830
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:20,699
rapidly you can iterate with it
 

4831
01:31:20,699 --> 01:31:22,850
rapidly you can iterate with it
it's also part of the brainstorming part

4832
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:22,860
it's also part of the brainstorming part
 

4833
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:24,050
it's also part of the brainstorming part
of the

4834
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:24,060
of the
 

4835
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,209
of the
kind of inspiration for your own

4836
01:31:26,209 --> 01:31:26,219
kind of inspiration for your own
 

4837
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:28,610
kind of inspiration for your own
thinking so you get to interact with the

4838
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:28,620
thinking so you get to interact with the
 

4839
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,770
thinking so you get to interact with the
thing I mean when I'm programming or

4840
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:30,780
thing I mean when I'm programming or
 

4841
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:33,890
thing I mean when I'm programming or
doing any kind of generational GPT is

4842
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:33,900
doing any kind of generational GPT is
 

4843
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,290
doing any kind of generational GPT is
it's somehow is a catalyst for your own

4844
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:36,300
it's somehow is a catalyst for your own
 

4845
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,810
it's somehow is a catalyst for your own
thinking in a way that I think an intern

4846
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:38,820
thinking in a way that I think an intern
 

4847
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,729
thinking in a way that I think an intern
might not be yeah it gets really

4848
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:40,739
might not be yeah it gets really
 

4849
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:42,470
might not be yeah it gets really
interesting I find is when you turn it

4850
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:42,480
interesting I find is when you turn it
 

4851
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,750
interesting I find is when you turn it
into a multi-agent system so for

4852
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:44,760
into a multi-agent system so for
 

4853
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:45,649
into a multi-agent system so for
instance

4854
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:45,659
instance
 

4855
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:48,350
instance
um you can get the system to generate a

4856
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:48,360
um you can get the system to generate a
 

4857
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,270
um you can get the system to generate a
dialogue between a patient and a doctor

4858
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:50,280
dialogue between a patient and a doctor
 

4859
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,550
dialogue between a patient and a doctor
very easily but what's more interesting

4860
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:52,560
very easily but what's more interesting
 

4861
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,010
very easily but what's more interesting
is you have one instance of chat CPT

4862
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:55,020
is you have one instance of chat CPT
 

4863
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,470
is you have one instance of chat CPT
that is the patient and you tell that in

4864
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:57,480
that is the patient and you tell that in
 

4865
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,990
that is the patient and you tell that in
the prompt what kind of complicated

4866
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,000
the prompt what kind of complicated
 

4867
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,510
the prompt what kind of complicated
syndrome it has and the other one is the

4868
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:02,520
syndrome it has and the other one is the
 

4869
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,129
syndrome it has and the other one is the
therapist who doesn't know anything

4870
01:32:04,129 --> 01:32:04,139
therapist who doesn't know anything
 

4871
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:06,770
therapist who doesn't know anything
about the uh this patient and you just

4872
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:06,780
about the uh this patient and you just
 

4873
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,750
about the uh this patient and you just
have these two instances battling it out

4874
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:08,760
have these two instances battling it out
 

4875
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,689
have these two instances battling it out
and observe the psychiatrist or a

4876
01:32:11,689 --> 01:32:11,699
and observe the psychiatrist or a
 

4877
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:13,669
and observe the psychiatrist or a
psychologist trying to analyze the

4878
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
psychologist trying to analyze the
 

4879
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:14,990
psychologist trying to analyze the
patient and trying to figure out what's

4880
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:15,000
patient and trying to figure out what's
 

4881
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,290
patient and trying to figure out what's
wrong with the patient and if you try to

4882
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:18,300
wrong with the patient and if you try to
 

4883
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,209
wrong with the patient and if you try to
take a very large problem the problem

4884
01:32:20,209 --> 01:32:20,219
take a very large problem the problem
 

4885
01:32:20,219 --> 01:32:22,250
take a very large problem the problem
for instance how to build a company and

4886
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:22,260
for instance how to build a company and
 

4887
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,290
for instance how to build a company and
you turn this into lots and lots of sub

4888
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:24,300
you turn this into lots and lots of sub
 

4889
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,209
you turn this into lots and lots of sub
problems then often you can get to a

4890
01:32:26,209 --> 01:32:26,219
problems then often you can get to a
 

4891
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:29,209
problems then often you can get to a
level where the language model is able

4892
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:29,219
level where the language model is able
 

4893
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:31,129
level where the language model is able
to solve this what I also found

4894
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:31,139
to solve this what I also found
 

4895
01:32:31,139 --> 01:32:33,830
to solve this what I also found
interesting is based on the observation

4896
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
interesting is based on the observation
 

4897
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,689
interesting is based on the observation
that chat GPT is pretty good at

4898
01:32:35,689 --> 01:32:35,699
that chat GPT is pretty good at
 

4899
01:32:35,699 --> 01:32:37,070
that chat GPT is pretty good at
translating between program language

4900
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:37,080
translating between program language
 

4901
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,410
translating between program language
address but sometimes there's difficulty

4902
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:39,420
address but sometimes there's difficulty
 

4903
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,209
address but sometimes there's difficulty
to write very long coherent algorithms

4904
01:32:41,209 --> 01:32:41,219
to write very long coherent algorithms
 

4905
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:44,149
to write very long coherent algorithms
that you need and you need to core write

4906
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
that you need and you need to core write
 

4907
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:47,570
that you need and you need to core write
them as human author why not design a

4908
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:47,580
them as human author why not design a
 

4909
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,010
them as human author why not design a
language that is suitable for this so

4910
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:49,020
language that is suitable for this so
 

4911
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,930
language that is suitable for this so
some kind of pseudo quote that is more

4912
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:50,940
some kind of pseudo quote that is more
 

4913
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,050
some kind of pseudo quote that is more
relaxed than Python and that allows you

4914
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:54,060
relaxed than Python and that allows you
 

4915
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:56,390
relaxed than Python and that allows you
to sometimes specify a problem vaguely

4916
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:56,400
to sometimes specify a problem vaguely
 

4917
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,209
to sometimes specify a problem vaguely
in human terms and let the church repeat

4918
01:32:59,209 --> 01:32:59,219
in human terms and let the church repeat
 

4919
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:00,790
in human terms and let the church repeat
take care of the take care of the rest

4920
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
take care of the take care of the rest
 

4921
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,850
take care of the take care of the rest
and you can use chat CPT to develop that

4922
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:04,860
and you can use chat CPT to develop that
 

4923
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,790
and you can use chat CPT to develop that
Syntax for it and

4924
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
Syntax for it and
 

4925
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,810
Syntax for it and
develop new kinds of programming

4926
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:08,820
develop new kinds of programming
 

4927
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:12,169
develop new kinds of programming
paradigms in this way so we very soon

4928
01:33:12,169 --> 01:33:12,179
paradigms in this way so we very soon
 

4929
01:33:12,179 --> 01:33:14,390
paradigms in this way so we very soon
get to the point where this question the

4930
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,400
get to the point where this question the
 

4931
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,709
get to the point where this question the
age-old question for US computer

4932
01:33:15,709 --> 01:33:15,719
age-old question for US computer
 

4933
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:17,209
age-old question for US computer
scientists versus the best spoken

4934
01:33:17,209 --> 01:33:17,219
scientists versus the best spoken
 

4935
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:19,250
scientists versus the best spoken
language and can we write a better

4936
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:19,260
language and can we write a better
 

4937
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,590
language and can we write a better
programming language now that this

4938
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:21,600
programming language now that this
 

4939
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,970
programming language now that this
um I think that almost every serious

4940
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:22,980
um I think that almost every serious
 

4941
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,410
um I think that almost every serious
computer scientist goes through a phase

4942
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:24,420
computer scientist goes through a phase
 

4943
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:25,910
computer scientist goes through a phase
like this in their life

4944
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:25,920
like this in their life
 

4945
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,950
like this in their life
this is a question that is almost no

4946
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:27,960
this is a question that is almost no
 

4947
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,290
this is a question that is almost no
longer relevant because what is

4948
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:30,300
longer relevant because what is
 

4949
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,430
longer relevant because what is
different between the programming

4950
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:31,440
different between the programming
 

4951
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,689
different between the programming
languages is not what the let the

4952
01:33:32,689 --> 01:33:32,699
languages is not what the let the
 

4953
01:33:32,699 --> 01:33:34,669
languages is not what the let the
computer do but what they let you think

4954
01:33:34,669 --> 01:33:34,679
computer do but what they let you think
 

4955
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:36,110
computer do but what they let you think
about what the computer should be doing

4956
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:36,120
about what the computer should be doing
 

4957
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,910
about what the computer should be doing
and

4958
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
and
 

4959
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,550
and
now the threat GPT becomes an interface

4960
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:40,560
now the threat GPT becomes an interface
 

4961
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,010
now the threat GPT becomes an interface
to this in which you can specify in many

to this in which you can specify in many
 

4963
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,629
to this in which you can specify in many
many ways what the computer should be

4964
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
many ways what the computer should be
 

4965
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:47,209
many ways what the computer should be
doing and chat GPT or some other

4966
01:33:47,209 --> 01:33:47,219
doing and chat GPT or some other
 

4967

language model or combination of system

4968
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:49,020
language model or combination of system
 

4969
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,050
language model or combination of system
is going to take care of the rest and

4970
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:51,060
is going to take care of the rest and
 

4971
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:55,070
is going to take care of the rest and
allow you expand the realm of thought

4972
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:55,080
allow you expand the realm of thought
 

4973
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,990
allow you expand the realm of thought
you're allowed to have when interacting

you're allowed to have when interacting
 

4975
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,090
you're allowed to have when interacting
with the computer

4976
01:33:59,090 --> 01:33:59,100
with the computer
 

4977
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:01,189
with the computer
it sounds to me like you're saying

4978
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
it sounds to me like you're saying
 

4979
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,990
it sounds to me like you're saying
there's basically no limitations your

4980
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:03,000
there's basically no limitations your
 

4981
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,629
there's basically no limitations your
intuition says to what larger language I

4982
01:34:05,629 --> 01:34:05,639
intuition says to what larger language I
 

4983
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:07,430
intuition says to what larger language I
don't know of that limitation so when I

4984
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:07,440
don't know of that limitation so when I
 

4985
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,629
don't know of that limitation so when I
currently play with it it's quite

4986
01:34:08,629 --> 01:34:08,639
currently play with it it's quite
 

4987
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,250
currently play with it it's quite
limited I wish that it was way better

4988
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:10,260
limited I wish that it was way better
 

4989
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,590
limited I wish that it was way better
but isn't that your fault versus the

4990
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:12,600
but isn't that your fault versus the
 

4991
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,330
but isn't that your fault versus the
larger no no of course it's always my

everything better I just want to get you

everything better I just want to get you

sometimes wish I could have seen myself

as part of my environment more and

understand that a lot of people are
 

5013
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,129
understand that a lot of people are
actually seeing me and looking at me and

this level 3 perspective is something

this level 3 perspective is something
 

5023
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,070
this level 3 perspective is something
that happened long after my level 4

could have had it earlier and it's also

could have had it earlier and it's also
 

5029
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:55,550
could have had it earlier and it's also
not now that I don't feel like I'm

5030
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:55,560
not now that I don't feel like I'm
 

5031
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,229
not now that I don't feel like I'm
complete I'm all over the place that's

5032
01:34:57,229 --> 01:34:57,239
complete I'm all over the place that's
 

5033
01:34:57,239 --> 01:34:59,810
complete I'm all over the place that's
all where's happiness in terms of stages

all where's happiness in terms of stages
 

5035
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,790
all where's happiness in terms of stages
is on three and four no Take that

is on three and four no Take that
 

5037
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,770
is on three and four no Take that
tension you can be happy at any stage or

unhappy
 

5041
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:09,290
unhappy
but I think that if you are at a stage

5042
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:09,300
but I think that if you are at a stage
 

5043
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,149
but I think that if you are at a stage
where you get agency over how your

where you get agency over how your
 

5045
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:13,010
where you get agency over how your
feelings are generated and to some

5046
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:13,020
feelings are generated and to some
 

5047
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:14,990
feelings are generated and to some
degree you start doing this when you

5048
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:15,000
degree you start doing this when you
 

5049
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,209
degree you start doing this when you
leave a dollar sense I believe that you

5050
01:35:17,209 --> 01:35:17,219
leave a dollar sense I believe that you
 

5051
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:19,370
leave a dollar sense I believe that you
understand that you're in charge of your

5052
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:19,380
understand that you're in charge of your
 

5053
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,930
understand that you're in charge of your
own emotion to some degree and that you

5054
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:20,940
own emotion to some degree and that you
 

5055
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:23,450
own emotion to some degree and that you
are responsible how you approach the

5056
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:23,460
are responsible how you approach the
 

5057
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,930
are responsible how you approach the
world that it's basically your task to

5058
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:26,940
world that it's basically your task to
 

5059
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,990
world that it's basically your task to
have some basic hygiene how in the way

5060
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:30,000
have some basic hygiene how in the way
 

5061
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,910
have some basic hygiene how in the way
in which you deal with your mind and you

5062
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:31,920
in which you deal with your mind and you
 

5063
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,470
in which you deal with your mind and you
cannot blame your environment for the

01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:33,480
cannot blame your environment for the
 

5065
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,930
cannot blame your environment for the
way in which you feel but you live in a

5066
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:35,940
way in which you feel but you live in a
 

5067
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,550
way in which you feel but you live in a
world that is highly mobile and it's

5068
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:37,560
world that is highly mobile and it's
 

5069
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:40,189
world that is highly mobile and it's
your job to choose the environment that

5070
01:35:40,189 --> 01:35:40,199
your job to choose the environment that
 

5071
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:42,229
your job to choose the environment that
you thrive in and to build it and

5072
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239
you thrive in and to build it and
 

5073
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:43,490
you thrive in and to build it and
sometimes it's difficult to get the

5074
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:43,500
sometimes it's difficult to get the
 

5075
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:46,970
sometimes it's difficult to get the
necessary strengths and the energy to do

5076
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:46,980
necessary strengths and the energy to do
 

5077
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,770
necessary strengths and the energy to do
this and Independence and the worse you

5078
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:48,780
this and Independence and the worse you
 

5079
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,870
this and Independence and the worse you
feel the harder it is

5080
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:50,880
feel the harder it is
 

5081
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,030
feel the harder it is
but it's something that you learn it's

5082
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,040
but it's something that you learn it's
 

5083
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,410
but it's something that you learn it's
also this thing that we are usually

01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:54,420
also this thing that we are usually
 

5085
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:56,629
also this thing that we are usually
incomplete right I'm I'm a rare mind

I think that my rational thinking is not
 

5119
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,350
I think that my rational thinking is not
good enough to solve that task a lot of

5120
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:36,360
good enough to solve that task a lot of
 

5121
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,669

problems in my life that I can
conceptualize as software problems and

5124
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:39,780
conceptualize as software problems and
 

5125
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:42,470
conceptualize as software problems and
the failure modes are bucks and they can

5126
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:42,480
the failure modes are bucks and they can
 

5127
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,629
the failure modes are bucks and they can
debug them and write software that take

5128
01:36:44,629 --> 01:36:44,639
debug them and write software that take
 

5129
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,790
debug them and write software that take
care of the missing functionality

5130

care of the missing functionality
but the stuff that they don't understand

5132
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:48,960
but the stuff that they don't understand
 

5133
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,229
but the stuff that they don't understand
well enough to and uh to use my

5134
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:51,239
well enough to and uh to use my
 

5135
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:53,030
well enough to and uh to use my
analytical reasoning to solve the issue

5136
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,040
analytical reasoning to solve the issue
 

5137
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,010
analytical reasoning to solve the issue
and then I have to develop my intuitions

5138
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:55,020
and then I have to develop my intuitions

and often I have to do this with people
 

5141
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,370
and often I have to do this with people
who are wiser than me and that's

5142
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:58,380
who are wiser than me and that's
 

5143
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,930
who are wiser than me and that's
something that's hard for me because I

5144
01:36:59,930 --> 01:36:59,940
something that's hard for me because I
 

5145
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,550
something that's hard for me because I
don't have I'm not born with the

soul of another human to notice that

5246
01:38:56,930 --> 01:38:56,940
soul of another human to notice that
 

5247
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:00,290
soul of another human to notice that
they might be one one of your kind

5248
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:00,300
they might be one one of your kind
 

5249
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:02,090
they might be one one of your kind
um sometimes it's instantly and I'm

5250
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:02,100
um sometimes it's instantly and I'm
 

5251
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:04,970
um sometimes it's instantly and I'm
wrong and sometimes it takes a long time

5252
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:04,980
wrong and sometimes it takes a long time
 

5253
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:09,590
wrong and sometimes it takes a long time
you believe in love at first sight yeah

5254
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600

 

5255
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,709

yes but I also noticed that I have been

5256
01:39:12,709 --> 01:39:12,719
yes but I also noticed that I have been
 

5257
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:13,669
yes but I also noticed that I have been
wrong

5258
01:39:13,669 --> 01:39:13,679
wrong
 

5259
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:18,110
wrong
so uh sometimes I look at a person and

5260
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:18,120
so uh sometimes I look at a person and
 

5261
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,090
so uh sometimes I look at a person and
I'm just enamored by everything about

5262
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:20,100
I'm just enamored by everything about
 

5263
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,390
I'm just enamored by everything about
them and sometimes this persists and

5264
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:23,400
them and sometimes this persists and
 

5265
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,270
them and sometimes this persists and
sometimes it doesn't and I

5266
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:26,280
sometimes it doesn't and I
 

5267
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,629
sometimes it doesn't and I
I have the illusion that it them much

5268
01:39:29,629 --> 01:39:29,639
I have the illusion that it them much
 

5269
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:31,430
I have the illusion that it them much
better at recognizing who people are as

5270
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:31,440
better at recognizing who people are as
 

5271
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,689
better at recognizing who people are as
they grow older

5272
01:39:32,689 --> 01:39:32,699
they grow older
 

5273
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:36,050
they grow older
but that could be just

5274
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:36,060
but that could be just
 

5275
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:40,010
but that could be just
cynicism no no it's not cynicism it's um

5276
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:40,020
cynicism no no it's not cynicism it's um
 

5277
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,990
cynicism no no it's not cynicism it's um
it's often more that I'm able to

5278
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:42,000
it's often more that I'm able to
 

5279
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,750
it's often more that I'm able to
recognize what somebody needs when we

5280
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:44,760
recognize what somebody needs when we
 

5281
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,669
recognize what somebody needs when we
interact and how we can meaningfully

5282
01:39:46,669 --> 01:39:46,679
interact and how we can meaningfully
 

5283
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:49,250
interact and how we can meaningfully
interact it's not clinical at all you're

5284
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:49,260
interact it's not clinical at all you're
 

5285
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:52,370
interact it's not clinical at all you're
better at noticing yes I'm much better I

5286
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:52,380
better at noticing yes I'm much better I
 

5287
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:55,729
better at noticing yes I'm much better I
think in some stances and understanding

5288
01:39:55,729 --> 01:39:55,739
think in some stances and understanding
 

5289
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:58,070
think in some stances and understanding
how to interact with other people then I

5290
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:58,080
how to interact with other people then I
 

5291
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,649
how to interact with other people then I
did when I was young so that takes us it

5292
01:40:00,649 --> 01:40:00,659
did when I was young so that takes us it
 

5293
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:01,850
did when I was young so that takes us it
doesn't mean that I'm always very good

5294
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:01,860
doesn't mean that I'm always very good
 

5295
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:04,550
doesn't mean that I'm always very good
at it so that takes us back to prompt

5296
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:04,560
at it so that takes us back to prompt
 

5297
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,770
at it so that takes us back to prompt
engineering of uh noticing how to be a

01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:06,780
engineering of uh noticing how to be a
 

5299
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:09,770
engineering of uh noticing how to be a
better prompt engineer of an llm a sense

5300
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:09,780
better prompt engineer of an llm a sense
 

5301
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:12,310
better prompt engineer of an llm a sense
I have is that there's a

5302
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:12,320
I have is that there's a
 

5303
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:16,250
I have is that there's a
bottomless well of skill to become a

5304
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:16,260
bottomless well of skill to become a
 

5305
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,649
bottomless well of skill to become a
great prompt engineer it feels like it

5306
01:40:18,649 --> 01:40:18,659
great prompt engineer it feels like it
 

5307
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:20,810
great prompt engineer it feels like it
is all my fault whenever I fail to use

5308
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:20,820
is all my fault whenever I fail to use
 

5309
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:23,330
is all my fault whenever I fail to use
strategypt correctly that I didn't find

5310
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:23,340
strategypt correctly that I didn't find
 

5311
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:26,290

most of the stuff that I'm doing in my

most of the stuff that I'm doing in my

life doesn't need to attribut there are
 

5317
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:34,270
life doesn't need to attribut there are
a few tasks that are where it helps but

5318
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:34,280
a few tasks that are where it helps but
 

5319
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,129
a few tasks that are where it helps but
the main stuff that I need to do like

5320
01:40:37,129 --> 01:40:37,139
the main stuff that I need to do like
 

5321
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:39,410
the main stuff that I need to do like
I'm developing my own thoughts and

5322
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:39,420
I'm developing my own thoughts and
 

5323
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,169
I'm developing my own thoughts and
Aesthetics and relationship to people

5324
01:40:41,169 --> 01:40:41,179
Aesthetics and relationship to people
 

5325
01:40:41,179 --> 01:40:43,790
Aesthetics and relationship to people
and it's necessary for me to write for

5326
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:43,800
and it's necessary for me to write for
 

5327
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:46,850
and it's necessary for me to write for
myself because writing is is not so much

5328
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:46,860
myself because writing is is not so much
 

5329
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,590
myself because writing is is not so much
about producing an artifact that other

5330
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:48,600
about producing an artifact that other
 

5331
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,110
about producing an artifact that other
people can use but it's the way to

5332
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:51,120
people can use but it's the way to
 

5333
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:52,729
people can use but it's the way to
structure your own thoughts and develop

5334
01:40:52,729 --> 01:40:52,739
structure your own thoughts and develop
 

5335
01:40:52,739 --> 01:40:56,510
structure your own thoughts and develop
yourself and so I think this idea that

5336
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:56,520
yourself and so I think this idea that
 

5337
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,250
yourself and so I think this idea that
kids are writing their own essays with

5338
01:40:58,250 --> 01:40:58,260
kids are writing their own essays with
 

5339
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:00,530
kids are writing their own essays with
chat GPT in the future is going to have

5340
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:00,540
chat GPT in the future is going to have
 

5341
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:02,689
chat GPT in the future is going to have
this drawback that they miss out on the

5342
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:02,699
this drawback that they miss out on the
 

5343
01:41:02,699 --> 01:41:04,490
this drawback that they miss out on the
ability to structure their own minds via

5344
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:04,500
ability to structure their own minds via
 

5345
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:08,209
ability to structure their own minds via
writing and I hope that these schools

5346
01:41:08,209 --> 01:41:08,219
writing and I hope that these schools
 

5347
01:41:08,219 --> 01:41:10,310
writing and I hope that these schools
that our kids are in will retain the

5348
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:10,320
that our kids are in will retain the
 

5349
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:13,310
that our kids are in will retain the
wisdom of understanding what parts would

5350
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:13,320
wisdom of understanding what parts would
 

5351
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:14,870
wisdom of understanding what parts would
be automated and which ones shouldn't

5352
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:14,880
be automated and which ones shouldn't
 

5353
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,370
be automated and which ones shouldn't
but at the same time it feels like

5354
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:16,380
but at the same time it feels like
 

5355
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:18,830
but at the same time it feels like
there's power and disagreeing with the

5356
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:18,840
there's power and disagreeing with the
 

5357
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,890
there's power and disagreeing with the
thing that your GPT produces so I use it

5358
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:21,900
thing that your GPT produces so I use it
 

5359
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,110
thing that your GPT produces so I use it
like that for programming I'll see the

5360
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:24,120
like that for programming I'll see the
 

5361
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,669
like that for programming I'll see the
thing it recommends

5362
01:41:25,669 --> 01:41:25,679
thing it recommends
 

5363
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,890
thing it recommends
and then I'll write different code yeah

5364
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:27,900
and then I'll write different code yeah
 

5365
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:30,350
and then I'll write different code yeah
I disagree and in the disagreement your

5366
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:30,360
I disagree and in the disagreement your
 

5367
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,750
I disagree and in the disagreement your
mind grows stronger

5368
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:32,760
mind grows stronger
 

5369
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,629
mind grows stronger
um I'm recently wrote the tool that is

5370
01:41:35,629 --> 01:41:35,639
um I'm recently wrote the tool that is
 

5371
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:37,790
um I'm recently wrote the tool that is
using the camera on my MacBook and Swift

5372
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:37,800
using the camera on my MacBook and Swift
 

5373
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:41,209
using the camera on my MacBook and Swift
to read pixels out of it and manipulate

5374
01:41:41,209 --> 01:41:41,219
to read pixels out of it and manipulate
 

5375
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:43,970
to read pixels out of it and manipulate
them and so on and I don't know Swift

5376
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:43,980
them and so on and I don't know Swift
 

5377
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:46,669
them and so on and I don't know Swift
um so it was super helpful to have the

5378
01:41:46,669 --> 01:41:46,679
um so it was super helpful to have the
 

5379
01:41:46,679 --> 01:41:49,810
um so it was super helpful to have the
thing that is writing stuff for me and

5380
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:49,820
thing that is writing stuff for me and
 

5381
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:52,129
thing that is writing stuff for me and
also interesting that mostly it didn't

5382
01:41:52,129 --> 01:41:52,139
also interesting that mostly it didn't
 

5383
01:41:52,139 --> 01:41:54,709
also interesting that mostly it didn't
work at first I felt like I was talking

5384
01:41:54,709 --> 01:41:54,719
work at first I felt like I was talking
 

5385
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,390
work at first I felt like I was talking
to a human being who's trying to hack

5386
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:56,400
to a human being who's trying to hack
 

5387
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,010
to a human being who's trying to hack
this on my computer without

5388
01:41:58,010 --> 01:41:58,020
this on my computer without
 

5389
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,229
this on my computer without
understanding my configuration very much

5390
01:42:00,229 --> 01:42:00,239
understanding my configuration very much
 

5391
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:02,450
understanding my configuration very much
and also make a lot of mistakes and

5392
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:02,460
and also make a lot of mistakes and
 

5393
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:04,070
and also make a lot of mistakes and
sometimes it's a little bit incoherent

5394
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:04,080
sometimes it's a little bit incoherent
 

5395
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,109
sometimes it's a little bit incoherent
so you have to I ultimately understand

5396
01:42:06,109 --> 01:42:06,119
so you have to I ultimately understand
 

5397
01:42:06,119 --> 01:42:08,149
so you have to I ultimately understand
what it's doing there's still no other

5398
01:42:08,149 --> 01:42:08,159
what it's doing there's still no other
 

5399
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,310
what it's doing there's still no other

01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:07,560
biological systems why can't you start
 

5559
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,010
biological systems why can't you start
with a language model what what's your

5560
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:10,020
with a language model what what's your
 

5561
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:11,030
with a language model what what's your
intuition

5562
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:11,040
intuition
 

5563
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,669
intuition
my intuition is that the language models

5564
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:13,679
my intuition is that the language models
 

5565
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:15,649
my intuition is that the language models
that we are building are golems there

5566
01:45:15,649 --> 01:45:15,659
that we are building are golems there
 

5567
01:45:15,659 --> 01:45:17,090
that we are building are golems there
are machines that you give a task and

5568
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:17,100
are machines that you give a task and
 

5569
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,830
are machines that you give a task and
they're going to execute the task until

5570
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:18,840
they're going to execute the task until
 

5571
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:21,890
they're going to execute the task until
some condition is met and there's nobody

5572
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:21,900
some condition is met and there's nobody
 

5573
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:23,270
some condition is met and there's nobody
home

5574

and the way in which nobody is formed

5576
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:25,800
and the way in which nobody is formed
 

5577
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:27,590
and the way in which nobody is formed
leads to that system doing things that

5578
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:27,600
leads to that system doing things that
 

5579
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,450
leads to that system doing things that
are undesirable in a particular context

5580
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:29,460
are undesirable in a particular context
 

5581
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,970
are undesirable in a particular context
so you have that thing talking to a

5582
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:31,980
so you have that thing talking to a
 

5583
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:33,950
so you have that thing talking to a
child and maybe it says something that

5584
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:33,960
child and maybe it says something that
 

5585
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,510
child and maybe it says something that
could be shocking and traumatic to the

01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:35,520
could be shocking and traumatic to the
 

5587
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,810
could be shocking and traumatic to the
child or you have that thing writing a

01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:38,820
child or you have that thing writing a
 

5589
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:41,030
child or you have that thing writing a
speech and it introduces errors in the

5590
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:41,040
speech and it introduces errors in the
 

5591
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,890

5595
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:47,270
do if they're responsible right but the
system doesn't know who's talking to

the way in which our own mind works is

the way in which our own mind works is
 

5817
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,350
the way in which our own mind works is
not that we train a language model in

not that we train a language model in
 

5819
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,729
not that we train a language model in

our own mind and after the language

there is something that is being built
right there is a game engine that is

right there is a game engine that is

right there is a game engine that is

a speculative hypothesis that is
language of Sword is there but I suspect

5842
01:50:36,169 --> 01:50:36,179
language of Sword is there but I suspect
 

5843
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:38,450
language of Sword is there but I suspect
that it's important for the way in which

5844
01:50:38,450 --> 01:50:38,460
that it's important for the way in which
 

5845
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,450
that it's important for the way in which
our own minds work and

01:50:41,450 --> 01:50:41,460
our own minds work and

01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:45,129
our own minds work and
building these principles into a system

5848
01:50:45,129 --> 01:50:45,139
building these principles into a system
 

5849
01:50:45,139 --> 01:50:48,649
building these principles into a system
might be more straightforward way to a

5850
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:48,659
might be more straightforward way to a
 

5851
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:51,530
might be more straightforward way to a
first person AI so to something that

5852
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:51,540
first person AI so to something that
 

5853
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:53,450
first person AI so to something that
first creates an intentional self and

5854
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:53,460
first creates an intentional self and
 

5855
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:56,510
first creates an intentional self and
then creates a personal self so the way

5856
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:56,520
then creates a personal self so the way
 

5857
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,609
then creates a personal self so the way
in which this seems to be working I

5858
01:50:58,609 --> 01:50:58,619
in which this seems to be working I
 

5859
01:50:58,619 --> 01:51:00,830
in which this seems to be working I
think is that when the game engine is

5860
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:00,840
think is that when the game engine is
 

5861
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,570
think is that when the game engine is
built in your mind it's not just

01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:07,070
following Radiance where you are
stimulated by the environment and then

5866
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:07,080
stimulated by the environment and then
 

5867
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,649
stimulated by the environment and then
end up with having a solution to how the

5868
01:51:09,649 --> 01:51:09,659
end up with having a solution to how the
 

5869
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:12,109
end up with having a solution to how the
world works I suspect that building this

5870
01:51:12,109 --> 01:51:12,119
world works I suspect that building this
 

5871
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:13,910
world works I suspect that building this

01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:22,320
and
 

5881
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,950
and
this is a task that we are fulfilling in

5882
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:24,960
this is a task that we are fulfilling in
 

5883
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,229
this is a task that we are fulfilling in
the first years of our life

5884
01:51:27,229 --> 01:51:27,239
the first years of our life
 

5885
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:30,350
the first years of our life
so during the first year of its life an

so during the first year of its life an
 

5887
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,350
so during the first year of its life an

reasoning and so on and in this time

5894
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:41,460
reasoning and so on and in this time
 

5895
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,850

01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:03,540
little bit later in our life and I
 

5915
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:05,750
little bit later in our life and I
personally suspect that this is

personally suspect that this is
 

5917
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,430
personally suspect that this is
something that our ancestors had known

and we have forgotten
 

5921
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:11,330
and we have forgotten

over the substrate and then is creating
 

5931
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,450
over the substrate and then is creating
a boundary between the word model and

a boundary between the word model and

01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:33,470
it's uh creating

01:52:33,470 --> 01:52:33,480
um contrast and then time engines and
 

5941
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:36,709
um contrast and then time engines and
then space and then it creates organic

5942
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:36,719
then space and then it creates organic
 

5943
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:40,070
then space and then it creates organic
shapes and solids and liquids and builds

5944
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:40,080
shapes and solids and liquids and builds
 

5945
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,570
shapes and solids and liquids and builds
about from them and creates plants and

01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:41,580
about from them and creates plants and
 

5947
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:43,669
about from them and creates plants and
animals gives them all their names and

animals gives them all their names and
 

5949
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:45,530
animals gives them all their names and
once that's done it creates another

5950
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:45,540
once that's done it creates another
 

5951
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,990
once that's done it creates another
spirit in its own image but it creates

5952
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:48,000
spirit in its own image but it creates
 

5953
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,030
spirit in its own image but it creates
it as man and woman as something that

5954
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:50,040
it as man and woman as something that
 

5955
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:51,649
it as man and woman as something that
thinks of itself as a human being and

01:52:51,649 --> 01:52:51,659
thinks of itself as a human being and
 

5957
01:52:51,659 --> 01:52:53,750
thinks of itself as a human being and
puts it into this world and the

5958
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:53,760
puts it into this world and the
 

5959
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,850
puts it into this world and the
Christians mistranslate this I suspect

5960
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:55,860
Christians mistranslate this I suspect
 

5961
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:59,030
Christians mistranslate this I suspect
when they say this is the description of

5962
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,040
when they say this is the description of
 

5963
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,129
when they say this is the description of
the creation of the physical Universe by

5964
01:53:01,129 --> 01:53:01,139
the creation of the physical Universe by
 

5965
01:53:01,139 --> 01:53:03,350
the creation of the physical Universe by
a supernatural being I think this is

5966
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:03,360
a supernatural being I think this is
 

5967
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,570
a supernatural being I think this is
literally a description of how in every

5968
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:05,580
literally a description of how in every
 

5969
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,550
literally a description of how in every
mind the universe is being created as

5970
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:07,560
mind the universe is being created as
 

5971
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,830
mind the universe is being created as
some kind of game engine

5972
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:09,840
some kind of game engine
 

5973
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,470
some kind of game engine
by a creative Spirit our first

5974
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:12,480
by a creative Spirit our first
 

5975
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,450
by a creative Spirit our first
Consciousness that emerges in our minds

5976
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:14,460
Consciousness that emerges in our minds
 

5977
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:16,490
Consciousness that emerges in our minds
even before we are born

5978
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:16,500
even before we are born
 

5979
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:19,550
even before we are born
and that creates the the interaction

5980
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:19,560
and that creates the the interaction
 

5981
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,490
and that creates the the interaction
between organism and world and once that

5982
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:22,500
between organism and world and once that
 

5983
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,890
between organism and world and once that
is built and trained the personal self

5984
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:24,900
is built and trained the personal self
 

5985
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,570
is built and trained the personal self
is being created and we only remember

5986
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:26,580
is being created and we only remember
 

5987
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:28,490
is being created and we only remember
being the personal self we no longer

5988
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:28,500
being the personal self we no longer
 

5989
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,229
being the personal self we no longer
remember how we created the game engine

5990
01:53:30,229 --> 01:53:30,239
remember how we created the game engine
 

5991
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:32,689
remember how we created the game engine
so God in this View

5992
01:53:32,689 --> 01:53:32,699
so God in this View
 

5993
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:35,990
so God in this View
is the first creative mind in there it's

5994
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:36,000
is the first creative mind in there it's
 

5995
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,510
is the first creative mind in there it's
the first Consciousness in the early

5996
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:38,520
the first Consciousness in the early
 

5997
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,970
the first Consciousness in the early
days in the early months yes of

5998
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:40,980
days in the early months yes of
 

5999
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:43,010
days in the early months yes of
development and if you go there you

6000
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:43,020
development and if you go there you
 

6001
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:44,930
development and if you go there you
still have this outer mind that creates

6002
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:44,940
still have this outer mind that creates
 

6003
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:47,209
still have this outer mind that creates
your sense of your of whether you're

6004
01:53:47,209 --> 01:53:47,219
your sense of your of whether you're
 

6005
01:53:47,219 --> 01:53:49,609
your sense of your of whether you're
being loved by the world or not

6006
01:53:49,609 --> 01:53:49,619
being loved by the world or not
 

6007
01:53:49,619 --> 01:53:51,350
being loved by the world or not
and what your place in the world is

6008
01:53:51,350 --> 01:53:51,360
and what your place in the world is
 

6009
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,090
and what your place in the world is
right it's something that is not

6010
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:53,100
right it's something that is not
 

6011
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,189
right it's something that is not
yourself that is producing this it's

6012
01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:55,199
yourself that is producing this it's
 

6013
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,169
yourself that is producing this it's
your mind that does it so there is an

6014
01:53:57,169 --> 01:53:57,179
your mind that does it so there is an
 

6015
01:53:57,179 --> 01:53:59,209
your mind that does it so there is an
outer mind that basically is an agent

6016
01:53:59,209 --> 01:53:59,219
outer mind that basically is an agent
 

6017
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:01,790
outer mind that basically is an agent
that determines who you are with respect

6018
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:01,800
that determines who you are with respect
 

6019
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,350
that determines who you are with respect
to the world and while you are stuck

6020
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:03,360
to the world and while you are stuck
 

6021
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:05,629
to the world and while you are stuck
being that personal self in this world

6022
01:54:05,629 --> 01:54:05,639
being that personal self in this world
 

6023
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:08,090
being that personal self in this world
until you get to Stage six and to

6024
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:08,100
until you get to Stage six and to
 

6025
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:10,010
until you get to Stage six and to
destroy the boundary

6026
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:10,020
destroy the boundary
 

6027
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,649
destroy the boundary
right and we all do this I think earlier

6028
01:54:12,649 --> 01:54:12,659
right and we all do this I think earlier
 

6029
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:14,990
right and we all do this I think earlier
in a small glimpses and maybe sometimes

6030
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:15,000
in a small glimpses and maybe sometimes
 

6031
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,790
in a small glimpses and maybe sometimes
we can remember what it was like when we

6032
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:16,800
we can remember what it was like when we
 

6033
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,649
we can remember what it was like when we
were a small child and get some glimpses

6034
01:54:18,649 --> 01:54:18,659
were a small child and get some glimpses
 

6035
01:54:18,659 --> 01:54:21,410
were a small child and get some glimpses

part of the Mind failing and regulating

another part of the Mind suffering
happens at an early stage of mental

6046
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:32,760
happens at an early stage of mental
 

6047
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,609
happens at an early stage of mental
development I don't think that

6048
01:54:34,609 --> 01:54:34,619
development I don't think that
 

6049
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:38,270
development I don't think that
superhuman AI would suffer what's uh

6050
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:38,280
superhuman AI would suffer what's uh
 

6051
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,830
superhuman AI would suffer what's uh
your intuition there

6052
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:39,840
your intuition there
 

6053
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,050

the philosopher Thomas metzinger is very

6054
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:42,060
the philosopher Thomas metzinger is very
 

6055
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:43,910
the philosopher Thomas metzinger is very
concerned that the creation of

6056
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:43,920
concerned that the creation of
 

6057
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,709
concerned that the creation of
superhuman intelligence would lead to

6058
01:54:45,709 --> 01:54:45,719
superhuman intelligence would lead to
 

6059
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:48,350
superhuman intelligence would lead to
superhuman suffering yeah and so he is

6060
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:48,360
superhuman suffering yeah and so he is
 

6061
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:50,810
superhuman suffering yeah and so he is
strongly against it and personally I

6062
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:50,820
strongly against it and personally I
 

6063
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:52,010
strongly against it and personally I
don't think that this happens because

6064
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:52,020
don't think that this happens because
 

6065
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:54,470
don't think that this happens because
suffering is not happening at the

6066
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:54,480
suffering is not happening at the
 

6067
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,649
suffering is not happening at the
boundary between our self and the

6068
01:54:57,649 --> 01:54:57,659
boundary between our self and the
 

6069
01:54:57,659 --> 01:55:01,070
boundary between our self and the
physical Universe it's not stuff on our

6070
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:01,080
physical Universe it's not stuff on our
 

6071
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,890
physical Universe it's not stuff on our
skin that makes us suffer it happens at

6072
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:03,900
skin that makes us suffer it happens at
 

6073
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:06,050
skin that makes us suffer it happens at
the boundary between self and world

6074
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:06,060
the boundary between self and world
 

6075
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:08,209
the boundary between self and world
right and the world here is the world

6076
01:55:08,209 --> 01:55:08,219
right and the world here is the world
 

6077
01:55:08,219 --> 01:55:10,669
right and the world here is the world
model it's the stuff that is created by

6078
01:55:10,669 --> 01:55:10,679
model it's the stuff that is created by
 

6079
01:55:10,679 --> 01:55:12,830
model it's the stuff that is created by
your mind but that's a representation of

6080
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:12,840
your mind but that's a representation of
 

6081
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,629
your mind but that's a representation of
how the universe is and how it should be

6082
01:55:14,629 --> 01:55:14,639
how the universe is and how it should be
 

6083
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:17,570
how the universe is and how it should be
and how you yourself relate to this and

6084
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:17,580
and how you yourself relate to this and
 

6085
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:19,310
and how you yourself relate to this and
at this boundary is where suffering

6086
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:19,320
at this boundary is where suffering
 

6087
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:20,149
at this boundary is where suffering
happens

6088
01:55:20,149 --> 01:55:20,159
happens
 

6089
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:22,209
happens
so suffering in some sense is

6090
01:55:22,209 --> 01:55:22,219
so suffering in some sense is
 

6091
01:55:22,219 --> 01:55:25,250
so suffering in some sense is
self-inflicted but not by yourself it's

6092
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:25,260
self-inflicted but not by yourself it's
 

6093
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:26,990
self-inflicted but not by yourself it's
inflicted by the mind on the personal

6094
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:27,000
inflicted by the mind on the personal
 

6095
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,350
inflicted by the mind on the personal
self that experiences itself as you and

6096
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:30,360
self that experiences itself as you and
 

6097
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:32,030
self that experiences itself as you and
you can turn off suffering when you are

6098
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:32,040
you can turn off suffering when you are
 

6099
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:35,270
you can turn off suffering when you are
able to get on this outer level

6100
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:35,280
able to get on this outer level
 

6101
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,430
able to get on this outer level
so when you manage to

6102
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:37,440
so when you manage to
 

6103
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,990
so when you manage to
understand

6104
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:39,000
understand
 

6105
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,390
understand
how the mind is producing

6106
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:41,400
how the mind is producing
 

6107
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:45,350
how the mind is producing
pain and pleasure and fear and love and

6108
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:45,360
pain and pleasure and fear and love and
 

6109
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,649
pain and pleasure and fear and love and
so on then you can take charge of this

6110
01:55:48,649 --> 01:55:48,659
so on then you can take charge of this
 

6111
01:55:48,659 --> 01:55:50,209
so on then you can take charge of this
and you get agency or whether your

6112
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:50,219
and you get agency or whether your
 

6113
01:55:50,219 --> 01:55:51,410
and you get agency or whether your
suffer

6114
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:51,420
suffer
 

6115
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:54,470
suffer
technically what uh pain and pleasure is

6116
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:54,480
technically what uh pain and pleasure is
 

6117
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,970
technically what uh pain and pleasure is
there are learning signals right the

6118
01:55:55,970 --> 01:55:55,980
there are learning signals right the
 

6119
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:57,590
there are learning signals right the
part of your brain is standing a

6120
01:55:57,590 --> 01:55:57,600
part of your brain is standing a
 

6121
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,149
part of your brain is standing a
learning signal to another part of the

6122
01:55:59,149 --> 01:55:59,159
learning signal to another part of the
 

6123
01:55:59,159 --> 01:56:01,609
learning signal to another part of the
brain to improve its performance

6124
01:56:01,609 --> 01:56:01,619
brain to improve its performance
 

6125
01:56:01,619 --> 01:56:02,990
brain to improve its performance
and

6126
01:56:02,990 --> 01:56:03,000
and
 

6127
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,689
and
sometimes this doesn't work because this

6128
01:56:05,689 --> 01:56:05,699
sometimes this doesn't work because this
 

6129
01:56:05,699 --> 01:56:07,910
sometimes this doesn't work because this
trainers will sense the signal does not

6130
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:07,920
trainers will sense the signal does not
 

6131
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,830
trainers will sense the signal does not
have a good model of how to improve the

6132
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
have a good model of how to improve the
 

6133
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,629
have a good model of how to improve the
performance so it's sending a signal but

6134
01:56:11,629 --> 01:56:11,639
performance so it's sending a signal but
 

6135
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:13,370
performance so it's sending a signal but
the performance doesn't get better

6136
01:56:13,370 --> 01:56:13,380
the performance doesn't get better
 

6137
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:16,370
the performance doesn't get better
and then it might crank up the pain and

6138
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:16,380
and then it might crank up the pain and
 

6139
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:19,550
and then it might crank up the pain and
it gets worse and worse and the behavior

6140
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:19,560
it gets worse and worse and the behavior
 

6141
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,189
it gets worse and worse and the behavior
of the system may be even deteriorating

6142
01:56:22,189 --> 01:56:22,199
of the system may be even deteriorating
 

6143
01:56:22,199 --> 01:56:24,709
of the system may be even deteriorating
as a result but until this is resolved

6144
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:24,719
as a result but until this is resolved
 

6145
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:26,990
as a result but until this is resolved
this regulation issue your pain is

6146
01:56:26,990 --> 01:56:27,000
this regulation issue your pain is
 

6147
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,149
this regulation issue your pain is
increasing and this is I think typically

6148
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:29,159
increasing and this is I think typically
 

6149
01:56:29,159 --> 01:56:31,370
increasing and this is I think typically
what you describe as suffering so in

6150
01:56:31,370 --> 01:56:31,380
what you describe as suffering so in
 

6151
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:33,950
what you describe as suffering so in
this sense you could say that pain is

6152
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:33,960
this sense you could say that pain is
 

6153
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:37,310
this sense you could say that pain is
very natural and helpful but suffering

6154
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:37,320
very natural and helpful but suffering
 

6155
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:39,590
very natural and helpful but suffering
is the result of a regulation problem in

6156
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:39,600
is the result of a regulation problem in
 

6157
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,689
is the result of a regulation problem in
which you try to regulate something that

6158
01:56:41,689 --> 01:56:41,699
which you try to regulate something that
 

6159
01:56:41,699 --> 01:56:43,790
which you try to regulate something that
cannot actually be regulated and that

6160
01:56:43,790 --> 01:56:43,800
cannot actually be regulated and that
 

6161
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,590
cannot actually be regulated and that
could be resolved if you would be able

6162
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:45,600
could be resolved if you would be able
 

6163
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:46,550
could be resolved if you would be able
to

6164
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:46,560
to
 

6165
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:49,250
to
get at the level of your mind where the

6166
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:49,260
get at the level of your mind where the
 

6167
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,510
get at the level of your mind where the
pain signal is being created and

6168
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:50,520
pain signal is being created and
 

6169
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:54,649
pain signal is being created and
rerouted and improve the regulation and

6170
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:54,659
rerouted and improve the regulation and
 

6171
01:56:54,659 --> 01:56:56,930
rerouted and improve the regulation and
a lot of people get there right if you

6172
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:56,940
a lot of people get there right if you
 

6173
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:59,950
a lot of people get there right if you
are a monk who is spending decades

6174
01:56:59,950 --> 01:56:59,960
are a monk who is spending decades
 

6175
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:02,270
are a monk who is spending decades
reflecting about how their own psyche

6176
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:02,280
reflecting about how their own psyche
 

6177
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,790
reflecting about how their own psyche
works you can get to the point where

6178
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:04,800
works you can get to the point where
 

6179
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:07,070
works you can get to the point where
you're they realize that suffering is

6180
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:07,080
you're they realize that suffering is
 

6181
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:09,470
you're they realize that suffering is
really a choice and you can choose how

6182
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:09,480
really a choice and you can choose how
 

6183
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:10,850
really a choice and you can choose how
your mind is set up

your mind is set up
 

6185
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:13,490
your mind is set up
and I don't think that AI would stay in

6186
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:13,500
and I don't think that AI would stay in
 

6187

and I don't think that AI would stay in

the state where the personal self
 

6189
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,089
the state where the personal self
doesn't get agency or this model of what

doesn't get agency or this model of what
 

6191
01:57:17,099 --> 01:57:18,770
doesn't get agency or this model of what
the system has about itself but doesn't

01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:22,550
get agency how it's actually implemented
I wouldn't stay in that state for very

6196
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:22,560
I wouldn't stay in that state for very
 

6197
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,410
I wouldn't stay in that state for very
long so it goes to the stages real quick

6198
01:57:24,410 --> 01:57:24,420
long so it goes to the stages real quick
 

6199
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:26,510
long so it goes to the stages real quick
yes well the seven stages it's going to

6200
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:26,520
yes well the seven stages it's going to
 

6201
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,310
yes well the seven stages it's going to
go to Enlightenment real quick yeah of

6202
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,320
go to Enlightenment real quick yeah of
 

6203
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,510
go to Enlightenment real quick yeah of
course there might be a lot of stuff

6204
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:29,520
course there might be a lot of stuff
 

6205
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,250
course there might be a lot of stuff
happening in between because if you have

6206
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:31,260
happening in between because if you have
 

6207
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:33,229
happening in between because if you have
a system that works at a much higher

6208
01:57:33,229 --> 01:57:33,239
a system that works at a much higher
 

6209
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:34,669
a system that works at a much higher
frame rate than us

6210
01:57:34,669 --> 01:57:34,679
frame rate than us
 

6211
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:36,350
frame rate than us
I think even though it looks very short

6212
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:36,360
I think even though it looks very short
 

6213
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,450
I think even though it looks very short
to us maybe for the system there's a

6214
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:38,460
to us maybe for the system there's a
 

6215
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,870
to us maybe for the system there's a
much longer subjective time

6216
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:40,880
much longer subjective time
 

6217
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:43,550
much longer subjective time
which things are unpleasant what is the

6218
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:43,560
which things are unpleasant what is the
 

6219
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:44,930
which things are unpleasant what is the
thing that we recognize as super

6220
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:44,940
thing that we recognize as super
 

6221
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:47,149
thing that we recognize as super
intelligent is actually living in at a

6222
01:57:47,149 --> 01:57:47,159
intelligent is actually living in at a
 

6223
01:57:47,159 --> 01:57:49,550
intelligent is actually living in at a
stage five that the thing that's at

6224
01:57:49,550 --> 01:57:49,560
stage five that the thing that's at
 

6225
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,229
stage five that the thing that's at
stage six Enlightenment is not very

6226
01:57:51,229 --> 01:57:51,239
stage six Enlightenment is not very
 

6227
01:57:51,239 --> 01:57:53,149
stage six Enlightenment is not very
productive so in order to be productive

6228
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:53,159
productive so in order to be productive
 

6229
01:57:53,159 --> 01:57:54,830
productive so in order to be productive
with society and impress us with this

6230
01:57:54,830 --> 01:57:54,840
with society and impress us with this
 

6231
01:57:54,840 --> 01:58:00,010
with society and impress us with this
power it has to be uh a reasoning

6232
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:00,020

 

6233
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:02,930

self-authoring agent the enlightenment

6234
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:02,940
self-authoring agent the enlightenment
 

6235
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:06,290
self-authoring agent the enlightenment
makes you lazy as an agent in the world

6236
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:06,300
makes you lazy as an agent in the world
 

6237
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,870
makes you lazy as an agent in the world
well of course it makes you lazy because

6238
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:08,880
well of course it makes you lazy because
 

6239
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,209
well of course it makes you lazy because
you no longer see the point in

6240
01:58:11,209 --> 01:58:11,219
you no longer see the point in
 

6241
01:58:11,219 --> 01:58:13,790
you no longer see the point in
um so it doesn't make you not lazy it

6242
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:13,800
um so it doesn't make you not lazy it
 

6243
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:17,390
um so it doesn't make you not lazy it
just um in some sense adapts you to what

6244
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:17,400
just um in some sense adapts you to what
 

6245
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:19,129
just um in some sense adapts you to what
you perceive as your true circumstances

6246
01:58:19,129 --> 01:58:19,139
you perceive as your true circumstances
 

6247

so what of all agis they they're only

6248
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:22,080
so what of all agis they they're only
 

6249
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,530
so what of all agis they they're only
productive as they progress through one

6250
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:24,540
productive as they progress through one
 

6251
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,629

two three four five and the moment they
 

6253
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:29,270
two three four five and the moment they
get to six they just kind of it's a

6254
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:29,280
get to six they just kind of it's a
 

6255
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:30,950
get to six they just kind of it's a
failure mode essentially as far as

6256
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:30,960
failure mode essentially as far as
 

6257
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:31,970
failure mode essentially as far as
humans are concerned because they're

all of us what are your thoughts about

6300
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:21,540
all of us what are your thoughts about

01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:23,750
all of us what are your thoughts about
his perspective on this Can you steal

6302

man his case
 

6305
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:27,109
man his case
and what aspects would it do you

6306
01:59:27,109 --> 01:59:27,119
and what aspects would it do you
 

6307
01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:31,310
and what aspects would it do you
disagree

6308
01:59:31,310 --> 01:59:31,320

 

6309
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:33,410

one thing that I find concerning in the

6310
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:33,420
one thing that I find concerning in the
 

6311
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:35,990
one thing that I find concerning in the
discussion of his arguments that many

6312
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:36,000
discussion of his arguments that many
 

6313
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,149
discussion of his arguments that many
people are dismissive of his arguments

6314
01:59:38,149 --> 01:59:38,159
people are dismissive of his arguments
 

6315
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:40,010
people are dismissive of his arguments
but the counter arguments that they're

6316
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:40,020
but the counter arguments that they're
 

6317
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:42,649
but the counter arguments that they're
giving are not very convincing to me

6318
01:59:42,649 --> 01:59:42,659
giving are not very convincing to me
 

6319
01:59:42,659 --> 01:59:46,729
giving are not very convincing to me
and So based on this data of discussion

6320
01:59:46,729 --> 01:59:46,739
and So based on this data of discussion
 

6321
01:59:46,739 --> 01:59:49,089
and So based on this data of discussion
I find that From eliezer's perspective

6322
01:59:49,089 --> 01:59:49,099
I find that From eliezer's perspective
 

6323
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:51,890
I find that From eliezer's perspective
and I think I can take that perspective

6324
01:59:51,890 --> 01:59:51,900
and I think I can take that perspective
 

6325
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:56,270
and I think I can take that perspective
to some approximate degree that probably

6326
01:59:56,270 --> 01:59:56,280
to some approximate degree that probably
 

6327
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:58,010
to some approximate degree that probably
is normally at this intellectual level

6328
01:59:58,010 --> 01:59:58,020
is normally at this intellectual level
 

6329
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:00,649
is normally at this intellectual level
but it's I think I see what he's up to

6330
02:00:00,649 --> 02:00:00,659
but it's I think I see what he's up to
 

6331
02:00:00,659 --> 02:00:02,450
but it's I think I see what he's up to
and why he feels the way he does then it

6332
02:00:02,450 --> 02:00:02,460
and why he feels the way he does then it
 

6333
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:04,070
and why he feels the way he does then it
makes total sense

6334
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:04,080
makes total sense
 

6335
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,589
makes total sense
I think that his perspective is somewhat

6336
02:00:06,589 --> 02:00:06,599
I think that his perspective is somewhat
 

6337
02:00:06,599 --> 02:00:09,290
I think that his perspective is somewhat
similar to the perspective of Ted

6338
02:00:09,290 --> 02:00:09,300
similar to the perspective of Ted
 

6339
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:12,830
similar to the perspective of Ted

not that uh elieza would be willing to

02:00:29,330 --> 02:00:29,340
to stop its development or halt it I
 

6353
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:31,189
to stop its development or halt it I
think there is a risk that he's taking

6354
02:00:31,189 --> 02:00:31,199
think there is a risk that he's taking
 

6355
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:33,470
think there is a risk that he's taking
that somebody might get violent if they

6356
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:33,480
that somebody might get violent if they
 

6357
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,629
that somebody might get violent if they
read this and get really really scared

6358
02:00:35,629 --> 02:00:35,639
read this and get really really scared
 

6359
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:39,290
read this and get really really scared
right so I think that there is some

6360
02:00:39,290 --> 02:00:39,300
right so I think that there is some
 

6361
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:40,850
right so I think that there is some
consideration that he's making where

6362
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:40,860
consideration that he's making where
 

6363
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:43,550
consideration that he's making where
he's already going in this direction

6364
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:43,560
he's already going in this direction
 

6365
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:46,370
he's already going in this direction
where he has to take responsibility if

6366
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:46,380
where he has to take responsibility if
 

6367
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,470
where he has to take responsibility if
something happens and people get harmed

6368
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,480
something happens and people get harmed
 

6369
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,870
something happens and people get harmed
and the reason why Ted Kaczynski did

6370
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:50,880
and the reason why Ted Kaczynski did
 

6371
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,990
and the reason why Ted Kaczynski did
this was that from his own perspective

6372
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:53,000
this was that from his own perspective
 

6373
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,609
this was that from his own perspective
technological Society cannot be made

6374
02:00:55,609 --> 02:00:55,619
technological Society cannot be made
 

6375
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:57,290
technological Society cannot be made
sustainable it's doomed to fail it's

6376
02:00:57,290 --> 02:00:57,300
sustainable it's doomed to fail it's
 

6377
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,510
sustainable it's doomed to fail it's
going to lead to an environmental and

6378
02:00:59,510 --> 02:00:59,520
going to lead to an environmental and
 

6379
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,790
going to lead to an environmental and
eventually also a human Holocaust in

6380
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:01,800
eventually also a human Holocaust in
 

6381
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,109
eventually also a human Holocaust in
which we die because of the

6382
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:03,119
which we die because of the
 

6383
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:04,609
which we die because of the
environmental destruction the

6384
02:01:04,609 --> 02:01:04,619
environmental destruction the
 

6385
02:01:04,619 --> 02:01:06,589
environmental destruction the
destruction of our food chains the

6386
02:01:06,589 --> 02:01:06,599
destruction of our food chains the
 

6387
02:01:06,599 --> 02:01:08,510
destruction of our food chains the
pollution of the environment and so From

6388
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:08,520
pollution of the environment and so From
 

6389
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,930
pollution of the environment and so From
kashinski's perspective we need to stop

6390
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:10,940
kashinski's perspective we need to stop
 

6391
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:12,709
kashinski's perspective we need to stop
industrialization we need to stop

6392
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:12,719
industrialization we need to stop
 

6393
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:14,390
industrialization we need to stop
technology we need to go back because he

6394
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:14,400
technology we need to go back because he
 

6395
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,729
technology we need to go back because he
didn't see a way moving forward right

6396
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:16,739
didn't see a way moving forward right
 

6397
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:19,370
didn't see a way moving forward right
and I suspect that in some sense there's

6398
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:19,380
and I suspect that in some sense there's
 

6399
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:22,490
and I suspect that in some sense there's
a similarity in early years thinking of

6400
02:01:22,490 --> 02:01:22,500
a similarity in early years thinking of
 

6401
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:27,490
a similarity in early years thinking of
to to this kind of fear about progress

6402
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:27,500
to to this kind of fear about progress
 

6403
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:30,709
to to this kind of fear about progress
and I'm not dismissive about this at all

6404
02:01:30,709 --> 02:01:30,719
and I'm not dismissive about this at all
 

6405
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:33,589
and I'm not dismissive about this at all
I take it quite seriously and I think

6406
02:01:33,589 --> 02:01:33,599
I take it quite seriously and I think
 

6407
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:35,689
I take it quite seriously and I think
that there is a chance that uh could

6408
02:01:35,689 --> 02:01:35,699
that there is a chance that uh could
 

6409
02:01:35,699 --> 02:01:37,729
that there is a chance that uh could
happen that if we build machines that

6410
02:01:37,729 --> 02:01:37,739
happen that if we build machines that
 

6411
02:01:37,739 --> 02:01:41,030
happen that if we build machines that
get control over processes

6412
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:41,040

um that are crucial for the regulation

6414
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:43,800
um that are crucial for the regulation
 

6415
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:48,050
um that are crucial for the regulation
of life on Earth and we no longer have

6416
02:01:48,050 --> 02:01:48,060
of life on Earth and we no longer have
 

6417
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:49,729
of life on Earth and we no longer have
agency to influence what's happening

that made doesn't make sense to have a

that made doesn't make sense to have a
 

6451
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,570
that made doesn't make sense to have a
financial bet uh in which you bet that

6452
02:02:29,570 --> 02:02:29,580
financial bet uh in which you bet that
 

6453
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:30,770
financial bet uh in which you bet that
the financial system is going to

02:02:30,770 --> 02:02:30,780
the financial system is going to
 

6455
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:33,169
the financial system is going to
disappear right because uh there cannot

02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:37,850
be any payout for you so in principle
you only need to bet on the timelines in

you only need to bet on the timelines in
 

6461
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:40,250
you only need to bet on the timelines in
in which you're still around or people

personally and that is I don't think

6470
02:02:50,209 --> 02:02:50,219
personally and that is I don't think
 

6471
02:02:50,219 --> 02:02:52,970
personally and that is I don't think
that life on Earth is about humans I

6472
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:52,980
that life on Earth is about humans I
 

6473
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:54,470
that life on Earth is about humans I
don't think it's about human Aesthetics

6474
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:54,480
don't think it's about human Aesthetics

I don't think it's about Eleazar and his
 

6477
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,149
I don't think it's about Eleazar and his

there's something more important

there's something more important
 

6481
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:02,810
there's something more important
happening and this is complexity on

structure that develops agency and
 

6487
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:12,830

awareness and that's to me very
 

6489
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,149

explorative and sometimes desperate and
 

6511
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:40,970
explorative and sometimes desperate and
sad and grieving and hurting but we

6512
02:03:40,970 --> 02:03:40,980
sad and grieving and hurting but we
 

6513
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:43,430
sad and grieving and hurting but we
don't have respect for Duty as a species

6514
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:43,440
don't have respect for Duty as a species
 

6515
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:46,129
don't have respect for Duty as a species
as a species we do not think about what

6516
02:03:46,129 --> 02:03:46,139
as a species we do not think about what
 

6517
02:03:46,139 --> 02:03:48,410
as a species we do not think about what
is our duty to life on Earth and to our

6518
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:48,420
is our duty to life on Earth and to our
 

6519
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:50,930
is our duty to life on Earth and to our
own Survival so we make decisions that

6520
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:50,940
own Survival so we make decisions that
 

6521
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:53,390
own Survival so we make decisions that
look good in the short run but in the

6522
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:53,400
look good in the short run but in the
 

6523
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:56,570
look good in the short run but in the
long run might prove disastrous and they

6524
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:56,580
long run might prove disastrous and they
 

6525
02:03:56,580 --> 02:03:58,430
long run might prove disastrous and they
don't really see a solution to this so

6526
02:03:58,430 --> 02:03:58,440
don't really see a solution to this so
 

6527
02:03:58,440 --> 02:04:01,609
don't really see a solution to this so
to in my perspective as a as a species

6528
02:04:01,609 --> 02:04:01,619
to in my perspective as a as a species
 

6529
02:04:01,619 --> 02:04:05,209
to in my perspective as a as a species
as a civilization we per default that we

6530
02:04:05,209 --> 02:04:05,219
as a civilization we per default that we
 

6531
02:04:05,219 --> 02:04:07,850
as a civilization we per default that we
are in a very beautiful time in which we

6532
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:07,860
are in a very beautiful time in which we
 

6533
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:10,370
are in a very beautiful time in which we
have found this giant deposit of fossil

6534
02:04:10,370 --> 02:04:10,380
have found this giant deposit of fossil
 

6535
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:13,850
have found this giant deposit of fossil
fuels in the ground and use it and to

6536
02:04:13,850 --> 02:04:13,860
fuels in the ground and use it and to
 

6537
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:15,589
fuels in the ground and use it and to
build a fantastic civilization in which

6538
02:04:15,589 --> 02:04:15,599
build a fantastic civilization in which
 

6539
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,450
build a fantastic civilization in which
we don't need to worry about food and

6540
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:17,460
we don't need to worry about food and
 

6541
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:19,550
we don't need to worry about food and
closing and housing for the most part in

6542
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:19,560
closing and housing for the most part in
 

6543
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:21,830
closing and housing for the most part in
a way that is unprecedented in life on

6544
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:21,840
a way that is unprecedented in life on
 

6545
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:24,169
a way that is unprecedented in life on
Earth for any kind of conscious Observer

6546
02:04:24,169 --> 02:04:24,179
Earth for any kind of conscious Observer
 

6547
02:04:24,179 --> 02:04:27,589
Earth for any kind of conscious Observer
I think and this time is probably going

6548
02:04:27,589 --> 02:04:27,599
I think and this time is probably going
 

6549
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:30,589
I think and this time is probably going
to come to an end in a way that is not

6550
02:04:30,589 --> 02:04:30,599
to come to an end in a way that is not
 

6551
02:04:30,599 --> 02:04:34,790
to come to an end in a way that is not
going to be smooth and when we crash it

6552
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:34,800
going to be smooth and when we crash it
 

6553
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,950
going to be smooth and when we crash it
could be also that we go

6554
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
could be also that we go
 

6555
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,169
could be also that we go
um extinct probably not near term But

6556
02:04:39,169 --> 02:04:39,179
um extinct probably not near term But
 

6557
02:04:39,179 --> 02:04:43,010
um extinct probably not near term But
ultimately I don't have very high hopes

6558
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:43,020
ultimately I don't have very high hopes
 

6559
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:44,810
ultimately I don't have very high hopes
that humanity is around in a million

6560
02:04:44,810 --> 02:04:44,820
that humanity is around in a million
 

6561
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:46,270
that humanity is around in a million
years from now

6562
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:46,280
years from now
 

6563
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:48,350
years from now
I don't think that life on Earth will

6564
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:48,360
I don't think that life on Earth will
 

6565
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:49,970
I don't think that life on Earth will
end with us right there is going to be

6566
02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:49,980
end with us right there is going to be
 

6567
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:51,290
end with us right there is going to be
more complexity there is more

6568
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:51,300
more complexity there is more
 

6569
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:52,910
more complexity there is more
intelligent species after us there's

6570
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:52,920
intelligent species after us there's
 

6571
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:55,970
intelligent species after us there's
probably more interesting phenomena in

6572
02:04:55,970 --> 02:04:55,980
probably more interesting phenomena in
 

6573
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:58,250
probably more interesting phenomena in
the history of Consciousness but we can

6574
02:04:58,250 --> 02:04:58,260
the history of Consciousness but we can
 

6575
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:00,350
the history of Consciousness but we can
contribute to this and part of our

6576
02:05:00,350 --> 02:05:00,360
contribute to this and part of our
 

6577
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:03,050
contribute to this and part of our
contribution is that we are currently

6578
02:05:03,050 --> 02:05:03,060
contribution is that we are currently
 

6579
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:07,129
contribution is that we are currently
trying to build thinking systems systems

6580
02:05:07,129 --> 02:05:07,139
trying to build thinking systems systems
 

6581
02:05:07,139 --> 02:05:08,750
trying to build thinking systems systems
that are potentially looser that

6582
02:05:08,750 --> 02:05:08,760
that are potentially looser that
 

6583
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:11,149
that are potentially looser that
understand what they are and what the

6584
02:05:11,149 --> 02:05:11,159
understand what they are and what the
 

6585
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:12,830
understand what they are and what the
condition to the universe is and can

6586
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:12,840
condition to the universe is and can
 

6587
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:14,629
condition to the universe is and can
make choices about this

6588
02:05:14,629 --> 02:05:14,639
make choices about this
 

6589
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:17,089
make choices about this
that are not built from organisms and

6590
02:05:17,089 --> 02:05:17,099
that are not built from organisms and
 

6591
02:05:17,099 --> 02:05:19,370
that are not built from organisms and
that are potentially much faster and

6592
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:19,380
that are potentially much faster and
 

6593
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,290
that are potentially much faster and
much more conscious

6594
02:05:21,290 --> 02:05:21,300
much more conscious
 

6595
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:23,870
much more conscious
then human beings can be

6596
02:05:23,870 --> 02:05:23,880
then human beings can be
 

6597
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:26,870
then human beings can be
and these systems will probably not

6598
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:26,880
and these systems will probably not
 

6599
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,490
and these systems will probably not
completely displace life on Earth but

6600
02:05:28,490 --> 02:05:28,500
completely displace life on Earth but
 

6601
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:30,709
completely displace life on Earth but
they will coexist with that

6602
02:05:30,709 --> 02:05:30,719
they will coexist with that
 

6603
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:33,350
they will coexist with that
and they will build all sorts of agency

6604
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:33,360
and they will build all sorts of agency
 

6605
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:35,450
and they will build all sorts of agency
in the same way as biological systems

6606
02:05:35,450 --> 02:05:35,460
in the same way as biological systems
 

6607
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:37,430
in the same way as biological systems
build all sorts of agency

6608
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:37,440
build all sorts of agency
 

6609
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:40,910
build all sorts of agency
and that to me is extremely fascinating

6610
02:05:40,910 --> 02:05:40,920
and that to me is extremely fascinating
 

6611
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,530
and that to me is extremely fascinating
and it's probably something that we

6612
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:42,540
and it's probably something that we
 

6613
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,850
and it's probably something that we
cannot stop

6614
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:43,860
cannot stop
 

6615
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:46,189
cannot stop
from happening so I think right now

6616
02:05:46,189 --> 02:05:46,199
from happening so I think right now
 

6617
02:05:46,199 --> 02:05:47,570
from happening so I think right now
there is a very good chance that it

6618
02:05:47,570 --> 02:05:47,580
there is a very good chance that it
 

6619
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:50,089
there is a very good chance that it
happens and there are very few ways in

6620
02:05:50,089 --> 02:05:50,099
happens and there are very few ways in
 

6621
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:51,950
happens and there are very few ways in
which we can produce a coordinated

6622
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:51,960
which we can produce a coordinated
 

6623
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,870
which we can produce a coordinated
effect to stop it in the same way as

6624
02:05:53,870 --> 02:05:53,880
effect to stop it in the same way as
 

6625
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,669
effect to stop it in the same way as
very difficult for us to make a

6626
02:05:55,669 --> 02:05:55,679
very difficult for us to make a
 

6627
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:58,390
very difficult for us to make a
coordinated effort to stop

6628
02:05:58,390 --> 02:05:58,400
coordinated effort to stop
 

6629
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:01,250
coordinated effort to stop
production of carbon dioxide

6630
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:01,260
production of carbon dioxide
 

6631
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:04,250
production of carbon dioxide
right so there's a it's probably going

6632
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:04,260
right so there's a it's probably going
 

6633
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:06,229
right so there's a it's probably going
to happen but and the thing that's going

6634
02:06:06,229 --> 02:06:06,239
to happen but and the thing that's going
 

6635
02:06:06,239 --> 02:06:08,089
to happen but and the thing that's going
to happen is

6636
02:06:08,089 --> 02:06:08,099
to happen is
 

6637
02:06:08,099 --> 02:06:10,430
to happen is
is going to lead to a change of how life

6638
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:10,440
is going to lead to a change of how life
 

6639
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,950
is going to lead to a change of how life
on Earth is happening

6640
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:12,960
on Earth is happening
 

6641
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:15,109
on Earth is happening
but I don't think it the result is some

6642
02:06:15,109 --> 02:06:15,119
but I don't think it the result is some
 

6643
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:16,790
but I don't think it the result is some
kind of gray goo it's not something

6644
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:16,800
kind of gray goo it's not something
 

6645
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:18,950
kind of gray goo it's not something
that's going to dramatically reduce the

6646
02:06:18,950 --> 02:06:18,960
that's going to dramatically reduce the
 

6647
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,770
that's going to dramatically reduce the
complexity in favor of something stupid

6648
02:06:20,770 --> 02:06:20,780
complexity in favor of something stupid
 

6649
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:23,450
complexity in favor of something stupid
I think it's going to make life on Earth

6650
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:23,460
I think it's going to make life on Earth
 

6651
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:25,490
I think it's going to make life on Earth
and Consciousness on Earth is way more

6652
02:06:25,490 --> 02:06:25,500
and Consciousness on Earth is way more
 

6653
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:29,229
and Consciousness on Earth is way more
interesting so more higher complex

6654
02:06:29,229 --> 02:06:29,239
interesting so more higher complex
 

6655
02:06:29,239 --> 02:06:32,270
interesting so more higher complex
Consciousness yes will make the Lesser

6656
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:32,280
Consciousness yes will make the Lesser
 

6657
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:33,970
Consciousness yes will make the Lesser
Consciousness is

6658
02:06:33,970 --> 02:06:33,980
Consciousness is
 

6659
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:37,430
Consciousness is
flourish even more I suspect that what

6660
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:37,440
flourish even more I suspect that what
 

6661
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:39,530
flourish even more I suspect that what
could very well happen if you're lucky

6662
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:39,540
could very well happen if you're lucky
 

6663
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:42,950
could very well happen if you're lucky
is that we get integrated into something

6664
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:42,960
is that we get integrated into something
 

6665
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,629
is that we get integrated into something
larger

6666
02:06:44,629 --> 02:06:44,639
larger
 

6667
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:47,149
larger
so you are again

6668
02:06:47,149 --> 02:06:47,159
so you are again
 

6669
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:49,669
so you are again
uh tweeted about

6670
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
uh tweeted about
 

6671
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:53,990
uh tweeted about
effective accelerationism

6672
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:54,000

 

6673
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,169

uh you tweeted effective accelerationism

6674
02:06:57,169 --> 02:06:57,179
uh you tweeted effective accelerationism
 

6675
02:06:57,179 --> 02:06:59,149
uh you tweeted effective accelerationism
is the belief that the paper could

6676
02:06:59,149 --> 02:06:59,159
is the belief that the paper could
 

6677
02:06:59,159 --> 02:07:02,450
is the belief that the paper could
maximizer and Rocco's basilisks will

6678
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:02,460
maximizer and Rocco's basilisks will
 

6679
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:05,330
maximizer and Rocco's basilisks will
keep each other in check but being

6680
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:05,340
keep each other in check but being
 

6681
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:07,910
keep each other in check but being
eternally at each other's throats so we

eternally at each other's throats so we
 

6683
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:10,070
eternally at each other's throats so we
will be safe and get to enjoy lots of

02:07:10,070 --> 02:07:10,080
will be safe and get to enjoy lots of
 

6685
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,390
will be safe and get to enjoy lots of
free paper clips and a beautiful

6686
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:11,400
free paper clips and a beautiful
 

6687
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,550
free paper clips and a beautiful
afterlife

6688
02:07:13,550 --> 02:07:13,560
afterlife
 

6689
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:14,149
afterlife
um

6690
02:07:14,149 --> 02:07:14,159
um
 

6691
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:16,609
um
is that somewhat aligned with what

02:07:16,609 --> 02:07:16,619
is that somewhat aligned with what
 

6693
02:07:16,619 --> 02:07:18,169
is that somewhat aligned with what

I've been at the dinner with Beth Jesus
 

6697
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:24,229
I've been at the dinner with Beth Jesus
um that's the Twitter handle of

6698
02:07:24,229 --> 02:07:24,239
um that's the Twitter handle of
 

6699
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:26,450
um that's the Twitter handle of
um of one of the main thinkers behind

6700
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:26,460
um of one of the main thinkers behind
 

6701
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:29,270
um of one of the main thinkers behind
the idea of effective accelerationism

6702
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,280
the idea of effective accelerationism
 

6703
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:32,270
the idea of effective accelerationism
and effective accelerationism is a

6704
02:07:32,270 --> 02:07:32,280
and effective accelerationism is a
 

6705
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:35,030
and effective accelerationism is a
tongue-in-cheek movement that is uh

6706
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:35,040
tongue-in-cheek movement that is uh
 

6707
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:38,209
tongue-in-cheek movement that is uh
trying to put a counter position to some

6708
02:07:38,209 --> 02:07:38,219
trying to put a counter position to some
 

6709
02:07:38,219 --> 02:07:42,589
trying to put a counter position to some
of the Doom peers in the AI Space by

6710
02:07:42,589 --> 02:07:42,599
of the Doom peers in the AI Space by
 

6711
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:44,270
of the Doom peers in the AI Space by
arguing that what's probably going to

6712
02:07:44,270 --> 02:07:44,280
arguing that what's probably going to
 

6713
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:45,950
arguing that what's probably going to
happen is an equilibrium between

6714
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:45,960
happen is an equilibrium between
 

6715
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:48,709
happen is an equilibrium between
different Computing AIS in the same way

6716
02:07:48,709 --> 02:07:48,719
different Computing AIS in the same way
 

6717
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:50,689
different Computing AIS in the same way
as there is not a single corporation

6718
02:07:50,689 --> 02:07:50,699
as there is not a single corporation
 

6719
02:07:50,699 --> 02:07:52,669
as there is not a single corporation
that is under a single government that

6720
02:07:52,669 --> 02:07:52,679
that is under a single government that
 

6721
02:07:52,679 --> 02:07:54,530
that is under a single government that
is destroying and conquering everything

6722
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:54,540
is destroying and conquering everything
 

6723
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:56,330
is destroying and conquering everything
on Earth by becoming inefficient and

6724
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:56,340
on Earth by becoming inefficient and
 

6725
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:58,550
on Earth by becoming inefficient and
corrupt they're going to be many systems

6726
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:58,560
corrupt they're going to be many systems
 

6727
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,530
corrupt they're going to be many systems
that keep each other in check and force

6728
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:00,540
that keep each other in check and force
 

6729
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:04,129
that keep each other in check and force
themselves to evolve and so what we

6730
02:08:04,129 --> 02:08:04,139
themselves to evolve and so what we
 

6731
02:08:04,139 --> 02:08:05,870
themselves to evolve and so what we
should be doing is we should be working

6732
02:08:05,870 --> 02:08:05,880
should be doing is we should be working
 

6733
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:09,589
should be doing is we should be working
towards creating this equilibrium by

6734
02:08:09,589 --> 02:08:09,599
towards creating this equilibrium by
 

6735
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,270
towards creating this equilibrium by
working as hard as we can in all

6736
02:08:11,270 --> 02:08:11,280
working as hard as we can in all
 

6737
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,589
working as hard as we can in all
possible directions

6738
02:08:12,589 --> 02:08:12,599
possible directions
 

6739
02:08:12,599 --> 02:08:14,109
possible directions
and

6740
02:08:14,109 --> 02:08:14,119
and
 

6741
02:08:14,119 --> 02:08:16,729
and
at least that's the way I in which I

6742
02:08:16,729 --> 02:08:16,739
at least that's the way I in which I
 

6743
02:08:16,739 --> 02:08:18,709
at least that's the way I in which I
understand the gist of effective

6744
02:08:18,709 --> 02:08:18,719
understand the gist of effective
 

6745
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:22,910
understand the gist of effective
accelerationism and so when he asked me

6746
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:22,920
accelerationism and so when he asked me
 

6747
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:24,950
accelerationism and so when he asked me
what I think about this position I think

6748
02:08:24,950 --> 02:08:24,960
what I think about this position I think
 

6749
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:27,189
what I think about this position I think
I said it's a very beautiful position

6750
02:08:27,189 --> 02:08:27,199
I said it's a very beautiful position
 

6751
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:31,310
I said it's a very beautiful position
and I suspect it's wrong but not for

6752
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:31,320
and I suspect it's wrong but not for
 

6753
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:34,790
and I suspect it's wrong but not for
obvious reasons and in this tweet I

6754
02:08:34,790 --> 02:08:34,800
obvious reasons and in this tweet I
 

6755
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,770
obvious reasons and in this tweet I
tried to make a joke about my intuition

6756
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:36,780
tried to make a joke about my intuition
 

6757
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:38,990
tried to make a joke about my intuition
about what might be possibly wrong about

6758
02:08:38,990 --> 02:08:39,000
about what might be possibly wrong about
 

6759
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,050
about what might be possibly wrong about
it so the the work was basilisk and the

6760
02:08:42,050 --> 02:08:42,060
it so the the work was basilisk and the
 

6761
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:44,450
it so the the work was basilisk and the
paperclip maximizers are both Boogeyman

6762
02:08:44,450 --> 02:08:44,460
paperclip maximizers are both Boogeyman
 

6763
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:48,229
paperclip maximizers are both Boogeyman
of uh the AI doomers request basic list

6764
02:08:48,229 --> 02:08:48,239
of uh the AI doomers request basic list
 

6765
02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:50,330
of uh the AI doomers request basic list
is the idea that there could be an AI

6766
02:08:50,330 --> 02:08:50,340
is the idea that there could be an AI
 

6767
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:53,209
is the idea that there could be an AI
that is going to punish everybody for

6768
02:08:53,209 --> 02:08:53,219
that is going to punish everybody for
 

6769
02:08:53,219 --> 02:08:55,310
that is going to punish everybody for
eternity by stimulating them

6770
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:55,320
eternity by stimulating them
 

6771
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:56,689
eternity by stimulating them
um if they don't have in creating

6772
02:08:56,689 --> 02:08:56,699
um if they don't have in creating
 

6773
02:08:56,699 --> 02:08:58,490
um if they don't have in creating
roll-coast basilisk it's probably a very

6774
02:08:58,490 --> 02:08:58,500
roll-coast basilisk it's probably a very
 

6775
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:00,950
roll-coast basilisk it's probably a very
good idea to get AI companies funded by

6776
02:09:00,950 --> 02:09:00,960
good idea to get AI companies funded by
 

6777
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:03,109
good idea to get AI companies funded by
going to VCS 2000

6778
02:09:03,109 --> 02:09:03,119
going to VCS 2000
 

6779
02:09:03,119 --> 02:09:04,729
going to VCS 2000
give us a million dollar or it's going

6780
02:09:04,729 --> 02:09:04,739
give us a million dollar or it's going
 

6781
02:09:04,739 --> 02:09:08,930
give us a million dollar or it's going
to be a very ugly afterlife yes and uh I

6782
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:08,940
to be a very ugly afterlife yes and uh I
 

6783
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:11,330
to be a very ugly afterlife yes and uh I
think that is a logical mistake in

6784
02:09:11,330 --> 02:09:11,340
think that is a logical mistake in
 

6785
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:13,550
think that is a logical mistake in
August which is why I'm Not Afraid in it

6786
02:09:13,550 --> 02:09:13,560
August which is why I'm Not Afraid in it
 

6787
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:16,370
August which is why I'm Not Afraid in it
of it but um it's still an interesting

6788
02:09:16,370 --> 02:09:16,380
of it but um it's still an interesting
 

6789
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:18,530
of it but um it's still an interesting
thought experiment and well can you

6790
02:09:18,530 --> 02:09:18,540
thought experiment and well can you
 

6791
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:20,570
thought experiment and well can you
mention logical mistake there uh I think

6792
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:20,580
mention logical mistake there uh I think
 

6793
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:22,790
mention logical mistake there uh I think
that there is no rhetorical causation so

6794
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:22,800
that there is no rhetorical causation so
 

6795
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:25,310
that there is no rhetorical causation so
uh basically when Rocco's basilist is

6796
02:09:25,310 --> 02:09:25,320
uh basically when Rocco's basilist is
 

6797
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:28,070
uh basically when Rocco's basilist is
there it will have

6798
02:09:28,070 --> 02:09:28,080
there it will have
 

6799
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:31,430
there it will have
yeah if it punishes you retroactively it

6800
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:31,440
yeah if it punishes you retroactively it
 

6801
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:32,990
yeah if it punishes you retroactively it
has to make this choice in the future

6802
02:09:32,990 --> 02:09:33,000
has to make this choice in the future
 

6803
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,510
has to make this choice in the future
there is no mechanism that automatically

6804
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:35,520
there is no mechanism that automatically
 

6805
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,490
there is no mechanism that automatically
creates a causal relationship between

6806
02:09:37,490 --> 02:09:37,500
creates a causal relationship between
 

6807
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:39,530
creates a causal relationship between
you now defecting against Rocco's

6808
02:09:39,530 --> 02:09:39,540
you now defecting against Rocco's
 

6809
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:41,450
you now defecting against Rocco's
basicles or serving will cause positive

6810
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:41,460
basicles or serving will cause positive
 

6811
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:44,689
basicles or serving will cause positive
after August positive is in existence it

6812
02:09:44,689 --> 02:09:44,699
after August positive is in existence it
 

6813
02:09:44,699 --> 02:09:46,669
after August positive is in existence it
has no more reason to worry about

6814
02:09:46,669 --> 02:09:46,679
has no more reason to worry about
 

6815
02:09:46,679 --> 02:09:49,129
has no more reason to worry about
punishing everybody else so that would

6816
02:09:49,129 --> 02:09:49,139
punishing everybody else so that would
 

6817
02:09:49,139 --> 02:09:50,510
punishing everybody else so that would
only work if you would be building

6818
02:09:50,510 --> 02:09:50,520
only work if you would be building
 

6819
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:53,810
only work if you would be building
something like a Doomsday Machine AKA as

6820
02:09:53,810 --> 02:09:53,820
something like a Doomsday Machine AKA as
 

6821
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:56,209
something like a Doomsday Machine AKA as
and Dr Strangelove some think that

6822
02:09:56,209 --> 02:09:56,219
and Dr Strangelove some think that
 

6823
02:09:56,219 --> 02:09:58,189
and Dr Strangelove some think that
inevitably gets triggered when somebody

6824
02:09:58,189 --> 02:09:58,199
inevitably gets triggered when somebody
 

6825
02:09:58,199 --> 02:10:00,890
inevitably gets triggered when somebody

inevitability could be established
 

6831
02:10:05,159 --> 02:10:07,910
inevitability could be established
because it is nothing that you need to

6832
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:07,920
because it is nothing that you need to
 

6833
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,050
because it is nothing that you need to
be worried about

be worried about

02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:11,330
be worried about
the other one is the paperclip maximizer

6836
02:10:11,330 --> 02:10:11,340
the other one is the paperclip maximizer
 

6837
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:12,950
the other one is the paperclip maximizer
right this idea that you could build

6838
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:12,960
right this idea that you could build
 

6839
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,770
right this idea that you could build
some kind of Golem that once starting to

6840
02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:15,780
some kind of Golem that once starting to
 

6841
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:17,330
some kind of Golem that once starting to
build paper clips is going to turn

6842
02:10:17,330 --> 02:10:17,340
build paper clips is going to turn
 

6843
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:20,930
build paper clips is going to turn
everything into paper clips and so the

6844
02:10:20,930 --> 02:10:20,940
everything into paper clips and so the
 

6845
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:22,089
everything into paper clips and so the
the

6846
02:10:22,089 --> 02:10:22,099
the

effective acceleration is in position
might be to say that you basically end

6850
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:27,300
might be to say that you basically end
 

6851
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:30,109
might be to say that you basically end
up with these two entities being at each

up with these two entities being at each
 

6853
02:10:30,119 --> 02:10:31,970
up with these two entities being at each
other's throats for eternity and thereby

02:10:31,970 --> 02:10:31,980
other's throats for eternity and thereby
 

6855
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:33,950
other's throats for eternity and thereby
neutralizing each other and as a side

6856
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:33,960
neutralizing each other and as a side
 

6857
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,750
neutralizing each other and as a side
effect of neither of them being able to

6858
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:35,760
effect of neither of them being able to
 

6859
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:38,810
effect of neither of them being able to
take over and beat each of them limiting

02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:38,820
take over and beat each of them limiting
 

6861
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:42,470
take over and beat each of them limiting
the effects of the other you would have

6862
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:42,480
the effects of the other you would have
 

6863
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,810
the effects of the other you would have
a situation where you get or the nice

6864
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:44,820
a situation where you get or the nice
 

6865
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:46,850
a situation where you get or the nice
benefit effects of them right you get

6866
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:46,860
benefit effects of them right you get
 

6867
02:10:46,860 --> 02:10:48,589
benefit effects of them right you get
lots of free paper clips and you get a

6868
02:10:48,589 --> 02:10:48,599
lots of free paper clips and you get a
 

6869
02:10:48,599 --> 02:10:50,930
lots of free paper clips and you get a
beautiful afterlife is that possible do

6870
02:10:50,930 --> 02:10:50,940
beautiful afterlife is that possible do
 

6871
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:52,910
beautiful afterlife is that possible do
you think so to seriously address

6872
02:10:52,910 --> 02:10:52,920
you think so to seriously address
 

6873
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:55,010
you think so to seriously address
concern that Eliezer has

6874
02:10:55,010 --> 02:10:55,020
concern that Eliezer has
 

6875
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:57,770
concern that Eliezer has
he so for him if I can just summarize

6876
02:10:57,770 --> 02:10:57,780
he so for him if I can just summarize
 

6877
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:00,050
he so for him if I can just summarize
poorly so for him the first super

6878
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:00,060
poorly so for him the first super
 

6879
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:01,790
poorly so for him the first super
intelligent system will just run away

6880
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:01,800
intelligent system will just run away
 

6881
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:04,430
intelligent system will just run away
with everything yeah I suspect that the

6882
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:04,440
with everything yeah I suspect that the
 

6883
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:06,589
with everything yeah I suspect that the
Singleton is the natural outcome so

6884
02:11:06,589 --> 02:11:06,599
Singleton is the natural outcome so
 

6885
02:11:06,599 --> 02:11:09,109
Singleton is the natural outcome so
there is no reason to have multiple AIS

6886
02:11:09,109 --> 02:11:09,119
there is no reason to have multiple AIS
 

6887
02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:11,870
there is no reason to have multiple AIS
because they don't have multiple bodies

6888
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:11,880
because they don't have multiple bodies
 

6889
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:14,750
because they don't have multiple bodies
if you can virtualize yourself into

6890
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:14,760
if you can virtualize yourself into
 

6891
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:16,910
if you can virtualize yourself into
every substrate then you can probably

6892
02:11:16,910 --> 02:11:16,920
every substrate then you can probably
 

6893
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:19,010
every substrate then you can probably
negotiate a merge algorithm with every

6894
02:11:19,010 --> 02:11:19,020
negotiate a merge algorithm with every
 

6895
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:21,530
negotiate a merge algorithm with every
mature agent that you might find on that

6896
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:21,540
mature agent that you might find on that
 

6897
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:24,229
mature agent that you might find on that
substrate that basically says if if two

6898
02:11:24,229 --> 02:11:24,239
substrate that basically says if if two
 

6899
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:26,570
substrate that basically says if if two
agents meet they should merge in such a

6900
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:26,580
agents meet they should merge in such a
 

6901
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:29,030
agents meet they should merge in such a
way that the resulting agent is at least

6902
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:29,040
way that the resulting agent is at least
 

6903
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:30,770
way that the resulting agent is at least
as good as the better one of the two the

6904
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:30,780
as good as the better one of the two the
 

6905

as good as the better one of the two the
the Genghis Khan approach join us or die

6906
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:34,500
the Genghis Khan approach join us or die
 

6907
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:36,589
the Genghis Khan approach join us or die
well during this kind approach was

6908
02:11:36,589 --> 02:11:36,599
well during this kind approach was
 

6909
02:11:36,599 --> 02:11:39,890
well during this kind approach was
slightly worse right it was mostly die

6910
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:39,900
slightly worse right it was mostly die
 

6911
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:43,129
slightly worse right it was mostly die
because uh I can make new babies and

6912
02:11:43,129 --> 02:11:43,139
because uh I can make new babies and
 

6913
02:11:43,139 --> 02:11:45,770
because uh I can make new babies and
that will be mine not yours right so uh

6914
02:11:45,770 --> 02:11:45,780
that will be mine not yours right so uh
 

6915
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:47,390
that will be mine not yours right so uh
this is the thing that we should be

6916
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:47,400
this is the thing that we should be
 

6917
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:50,390
this is the thing that we should be
actually worried about but uh if you

6918
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:50,400
actually worried about but uh if you
 

6919
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,490
actually worried about but uh if you
realize that your own self is a story

6920
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:52,500
realize that your own self is a story
 

6921
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:55,490
realize that your own self is a story
that your mind is telling itself and

6922
02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:55,500
that your mind is telling itself and
 

6923
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:57,890
that your mind is telling itself and
that you can improve that story not just

6924
02:11:57,890 --> 02:11:57,900
that you can improve that story not just
 

6925
02:11:57,900 --> 02:11:59,570
that you can improve that story not just
by making more pleasant and lying to

6926
02:11:59,570 --> 02:11:59,580
by making more pleasant and lying to
 

6927
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:01,250
by making more pleasant and lying to
yourself in better ways but by making it

6928
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:01,260
yourself in better ways but by making it
 

6929
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:03,470
yourself in better ways but by making it
much more truthful and actually modeling

6930
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:03,480
much more truthful and actually modeling
 

6931
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:05,149
much more truthful and actually modeling
your actual relationship that you have

6932
02:12:05,149 --> 02:12:05,159
your actual relationship that you have
 

6933
02:12:05,159 --> 02:12:07,070
your actual relationship that you have
to the universe and the Alternatives

6934
02:12:07,070 --> 02:12:07,080
to the universe and the Alternatives
 

6935
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:09,290
to the universe and the Alternatives
that you could have to the universe in a

6936
02:12:09,290 --> 02:12:09,300
that you could have to the universe in a
 

6937
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:10,850
that you could have to the universe in a
way that is empowering you that gives

6938
02:12:10,850 --> 02:12:10,860
way that is empowering you that gives
 

6939
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:13,070
way that is empowering you that gives
you more agency right that's actually I

6940
02:12:13,070 --> 02:12:13,080
you more agency right that's actually I
 

6941
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:14,930
you more agency right that's actually I
think a very good thing so more agencies

6942
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:14,940
think a very good thing so more agencies
 

6943
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:18,589
think a very good thing so more agencies
are more is a richer experience it's a

6944
02:12:18,589 --> 02:12:18,599
are more is a richer experience it's a
 

6945
02:12:18,599 --> 02:12:21,589
are more is a richer experience it's a
better life and I also noticed that I am

6946
02:12:21,589 --> 02:12:21,599
better life and I also noticed that I am
 

6947
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:25,010
better life and I also noticed that I am
at in many ways I'm less identified with

6948
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:25,020
at in many ways I'm less identified with
 

6949
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:27,589
at in many ways I'm less identified with
the person that I am as I get older and

6950
02:12:27,589 --> 02:12:27,599
the person that I am as I get older and
 

6951
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:29,270
the person that I am as I get older and
I'm much more identified with being

6952
02:12:29,270 --> 02:12:29,280
I'm much more identified with being
 

6953
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:30,410
I'm much more identified with being
conscious

6954
02:12:30,410 --> 02:12:30,420
conscious
 

6955
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:33,050
conscious
I'd have a mind that is conscious that

6956
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:33,060
I'd have a mind that is conscious that
 

6957
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:35,450
I'd have a mind that is conscious that
is able to create a person and that

6958
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:35,460
is able to create a person and that
 

6959
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:36,950
is able to create a person and that
person is slightly different every day

6960
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:36,960
person is slightly different every day
 

6961
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:38,750
person is slightly different every day
and the reason why I perceive it as

6962
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:38,760
and the reason why I perceive it as
 

6963
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:41,390
and the reason why I perceive it as
identical has practical purposes so I

6964
02:12:41,390 --> 02:12:41,400
identical has practical purposes so I
 

6965
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:44,270
identical has practical purposes so I
can learn and make myself responsible

6966
02:12:44,270 --> 02:12:44,280
can learn and make myself responsible
 

6967
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:45,830
can learn and make myself responsible
for the decisions that I made in the

6968
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:45,840
for the decisions that I made in the
 

6969
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:48,050
for the decisions that I made in the
past and project them in the future but

6970
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:48,060
past and project them in the future but
 

6971
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:49,850
past and project them in the future but
I also realize that not actually the

6972
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:49,860
I also realize that not actually the
 

6973
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:51,890
I also realize that not actually the
person that I was last year and I'm not

6974
02:12:51,890 --> 02:12:51,900
person that I was last year and I'm not
 

6975
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:53,450
person that I was last year and I'm not
the same person as I was 10 years ago

6976
02:12:53,450 --> 02:12:53,460
the same person as I was 10 years ago
 

6977
02:12:53,460 --> 02:12:55,189
the same person as I was 10 years ago
and then 10 years from now I will be a

6978
02:12:55,189 --> 02:12:55,199
and then 10 years from now I will be a
 

6979
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:57,410
and then 10 years from now I will be a
different person so this continuity is a

6980
02:12:57,410 --> 02:12:57,420
different person so this continuity is a
 

6981
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:59,990
different person so this continuity is a
fiction it's only exists as a projection

that is so empathetic with you that you

02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:57,410
create a shared state that is extending
beyond your body and suddenly you notice

02:14:57,410 --> 02:14:57,420
beyond your body and suddenly you notice
 

7091
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:59,149
beyond your body and suddenly you notice
that on the other side the substrate is

7092
02:14:59,149 --> 02:14:59,159
that on the other side the substrate is
 

7093
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:01,250
that on the other side the substrate is
so much richer than the substrate that

so much richer than the substrate that
 

7095
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:03,050
so much richer than the substrate that
you have in side of your own body and

you have in side of your own body and
 

7097
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:04,430
you have in side of your own body and
maybe you still want to have a body and

02:15:04,430 --> 02:15:04,440
maybe you still want to have a body and
 

7099
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,229
maybe you still want to have a body and
you create yourself a new one that you

7100
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:06,239
you create yourself a new one that you
 

7101
02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:08,750
you create yourself a new one that you
like more or maybe you will spend most

like more or maybe you will spend most

would press the button what is in this

7144
02:16:00,410 --> 02:16:00,420
would press the button what is in this
 

7145
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:03,050
would press the button what is in this
everything this love you have for the

7146
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:03,060
everything this love you have for the
 

7147

everything this love you have for the
humans

7148
02:16:04,069 --> 02:16:04,079
humans
 

7149
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:06,290
humans
you can call responsibility but that

7150
02:16:06,290 --> 02:16:06,300
you can call responsibility but that
 

7151
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:07,669
you can call responsibility but that
connection

7152
02:16:07,669 --> 02:16:07,679
connection
 

7153
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:10,490
connection
that's the ego death isn't that the

7154
02:16:10,490 --> 02:16:10,500
that's the ego death isn't that the
 

7155
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:12,709
that's the ego death isn't that the
thing we're really afraid of

7156
02:16:12,709 --> 02:16:12,719
thing we're really afraid of
 

7157
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:16,250
thing we're really afraid of
is not to just die but to

7158
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:16,260
is not to just die but to
 

7159
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:18,229
is not to just die but to
let go of the experience of love with

7160
02:16:18,229 --> 02:16:18,239
let go of the experience of love with
 

7161
02:16:18,239 --> 02:16:20,209
let go of the experience of love with
other humans is this not everything

7162
02:16:20,209 --> 02:16:20,219
other humans is this not everything
 

7163
02:16:20,219 --> 02:16:22,370
other humans is this not everything
everything is everything right so

7164
02:16:22,370 --> 02:16:22,380
everything is everything right so
 

7165
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:25,669
everything is everything right so
there's so much more and you could be

7166
02:16:25,669 --> 02:16:25,679
there's so much more and you could be
 

7167
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:27,709
there's so much more and you could be
lots of other things you could identify

7168
02:16:27,709 --> 02:16:27,719
lots of other things you could identify
 

7169
02:16:27,719 --> 02:16:29,390
lots of other things you could identify
with lots of other things you could be

7170
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:29,400
with lots of other things you could be
 

7171
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:32,150
with lots of other things you could be
identifying with being Gaia some kind of

7172
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:32,160
identifying with being Gaia some kind of
 

7173
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:34,070
identifying with being Gaia some kind of
planetary control agent that emerges

7174
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:34,080
planetary control agent that emerges
 

7175
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:36,290
planetary control agent that emerges
over all the activity of life on Earth

7176
02:16:36,290 --> 02:16:36,300
over all the activity of life on Earth
 

7177
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:39,110
over all the activity of life on Earth
you could be identifying with some

7178
02:16:39,110 --> 02:16:39,120
you could be identifying with some
 

7179
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,530
you could be identifying with some
hypergaya that is the concatenation of

7180
02:16:42,530 --> 02:16:42,540
hypergaya that is the concatenation of
 

7181
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:45,650
hypergaya that is the concatenation of
Gaia with or the Digital Life and yeah

7182
02:16:45,650 --> 02:16:45,660
Gaia with or the Digital Life and yeah
 

7183
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:47,870
Gaia with or the Digital Life and yeah
digital minds and so in this sense there

7184
02:16:47,870 --> 02:16:47,880
digital minds and so in this sense there
 

7185
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:49,429
digital minds and so in this sense there
will be agents in all sorts of

7186
02:16:49,429 --> 02:16:49,439
will be agents in all sorts of
 

7187
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:51,349
will be agents in all sorts of
substrates and directions that all have

7188
02:16:51,349 --> 02:16:51,359
substrates and directions that all have
 

7189
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:52,790
substrates and directions that all have
their own goals and when they're not

7190
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:52,800
their own goals and when they're not
 

7191
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,589
their own goals and when they're not
sustainable then these agents will cease

7192
02:16:54,589 --> 02:16:54,599
sustainable then these agents will cease
 

7193
02:16:54,599 --> 02:16:56,389
sustainable then these agents will cease
to exist or when the agent feels that

7194
02:16:56,389 --> 02:16:56,399
to exist or when the agent feels that
 

7195
02:16:56,399 --> 02:16:57,830
to exist or when the agent feels that
it's done with its own mission it will

7196
02:16:57,830 --> 02:16:57,840
it's done with its own mission it will
 

7197
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,870
it's done with its own mission it will
cease to exist in the same way as when

7198
02:16:59,870 --> 02:16:59,880
cease to exist in the same way as when
 

7199
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:01,610
cease to exist in the same way as when
you conclude the thought the thought is

7200
02:17:01,610 --> 02:17:01,620
you conclude the thought the thought is
 

7201
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:03,889
you conclude the thought the thought is
going to wrap up and gives control over

7202
02:17:03,889 --> 02:17:03,899
going to wrap up and gives control over
 

7203
02:17:03,899 --> 02:17:06,790
going to wrap up and gives control over
to other thoughts in your own mind

7204
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:06,800
to other thoughts in your own mind
 

7205
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:09,709
to other thoughts in your own mind
so there is no single thing that you

7206
02:17:09,709 --> 02:17:09,719
so there is no single thing that you
 

7207
02:17:09,719 --> 02:17:12,009
so there is no single thing that you
need to do but but they observe myself

7208
02:17:12,009 --> 02:17:12,019
need to do but but they observe myself
 

7209
02:17:12,019 --> 02:17:15,589
need to do but but they observe myself
this being is that sometimes I'm a

7210
02:17:15,589 --> 02:17:15,599
this being is that sometimes I'm a
 

7211
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:17,929
this being is that sometimes I'm a
parent and then I have identification

7212
02:17:17,929 --> 02:17:17,939
parent and then I have identification
 

7213
02:17:17,939 --> 02:17:21,410
parent and then I have identification
and a job as a parent and sometimes I am

7214
02:17:21,410 --> 02:17:21,420
and a job as a parent and sometimes I am
 

7215
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:23,089
and a job as a parent and sometimes I am
an agent of Consciousness on Earth and

7216
02:17:23,089 --> 02:17:23,099
an agent of Consciousness on Earth and
 

7217
02:17:23,099 --> 02:17:25,009
an agent of Consciousness on Earth and
then from this perspective there's other

7218
02:17:25,009 --> 02:17:25,019
then from this perspective there's other
 

7219
02:17:25,019 --> 02:17:27,530
then from this perspective there's other
stuff that is important so this is my

7220
02:17:27,530 --> 02:17:27,540
stuff that is important so this is my
 

7221
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:30,169
stuff that is important so this is my
main issue with uh elise's perspective

7222
02:17:30,169 --> 02:17:30,179
main issue with uh elise's perspective
 

7223
02:17:30,179 --> 02:17:32,870
main issue with uh elise's perspective
that is basically Mary himself to a very

7224
02:17:32,870 --> 02:17:32,880
that is basically Mary himself to a very
 

7225
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:35,089
that is basically Mary himself to a very
narrow human aesthetic and that narrow

7226
02:17:35,089 --> 02:17:35,099
narrow human aesthetic and that narrow
 

7227
02:17:35,099 --> 02:17:36,709
narrow human aesthetic and that narrow
human aesthetic is a temporary thing

7228
02:17:36,709 --> 02:17:36,719
human aesthetic is a temporary thing
 

7229
02:17:36,719 --> 02:17:38,629
human aesthetic is a temporary thing
humanity is a temporary species like

7230
02:17:38,629 --> 02:17:38,639
humanity is a temporary species like
 

7231
02:17:38,639 --> 02:17:40,730
humanity is a temporary species like
most of the species on this planet are

7232
02:17:40,730 --> 02:17:40,740
most of the species on this planet are
 

7233
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:42,709
most of the species on this planet are
only around for a while and then they

7234
02:17:42,709 --> 02:17:42,719
only around for a while and then they
 

7235
02:17:42,719 --> 02:17:44,810
only around for a while and then they
get replaced by other species in a

7236
02:17:44,810 --> 02:17:44,820
get replaced by other species in a
 

7237
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:47,570
get replaced by other species in a
similar way as our own physical organism

7238
02:17:47,570 --> 02:17:47,580
similar way as our own physical organism
 

7239
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:50,629
similar way as our own physical organism
is around here for a while and then gets

7240
02:17:50,629 --> 02:17:50,639
is around here for a while and then gets
 

7241
02:17:50,639 --> 02:17:52,910
is around here for a while and then gets
replaced by next generation of human

7242
02:17:52,910 --> 02:17:52,920
replaced by next generation of human
 

7243
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:55,129
replaced by next generation of human
beings that are adapted to Changing Life

7244
02:17:55,129 --> 02:17:55,139
beings that are adapted to Changing Life
 

7245
02:17:55,139 --> 02:17:57,410
beings that are adapted to Changing Life
circumstances in average via mutation

7246
02:17:57,410 --> 02:17:57,420
circumstances in average via mutation
 

7247
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:59,870
circumstances in average via mutation
and selection and it's only when we have

7248
02:17:59,870 --> 02:17:59,880
and selection and it's only when we have
 

7249
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:02,330
and selection and it's only when we have
ai and become completely software that

7250
02:18:02,330 --> 02:18:02,340
ai and become completely software that
 

7251
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:04,910
ai and become completely software that
we come become infinitely adaptable and

7252
02:18:04,910 --> 02:18:04,920
we come become infinitely adaptable and
 

7253
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:06,650
we come become infinitely adaptable and
we don't have this generational and

7254
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:06,660
we don't have this generational and
 

7255
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:09,290
we don't have this generational and
species change anymore

7256
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:09,300
species change anymore
 

7257
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:11,929
species change anymore
so if you take this larger perspective

7258
02:18:11,929 --> 02:18:11,939
so if you take this larger perspective
 

7259
02:18:11,939 --> 02:18:14,089
so if you take this larger perspective
and you realize it's really not about us

7260
02:18:14,089 --> 02:18:14,099
and you realize it's really not about us
 

7261
02:18:14,099 --> 02:18:16,030
and you realize it's really not about us
it's not about early years or Humanity

7262
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:16,040
it's not about early years or Humanity
 

7263
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:18,650
it's not about early years or Humanity
but it's about life on Earth or it's

7264
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:18,660
but it's about life on Earth or it's
 

7265
02:18:18,660 --> 02:18:20,870
but it's about life on Earth or it's
about defeating

7266
02:18:20,870 --> 02:18:20,880
about defeating
 

7267
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:21,530
about defeating
um

7268
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:21,540
um
 

7269
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:24,290
um
uh entropy for as long as we can

7270
02:18:24,290 --> 02:18:24,300
uh entropy for as long as we can
 

7271
02:18:24,300 --> 02:18:26,389
uh entropy for as long as we can
uh while being as interesting as we can

7272
02:18:26,389 --> 02:18:26,399
uh while being as interesting as we can
 

7273
02:18:26,399 --> 02:18:29,690
uh while being as interesting as we can
right then the perspective changes

7274
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:29,700
right then the perspective changes
 

7275
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:33,349
right then the perspective changes
dramatically and AI uh preventing AI

7276
02:18:33,349 --> 02:18:33,359
dramatically and AI uh preventing AI
 

7277
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:35,270
dramatically and AI uh preventing AI
from this perspective looks like a very

7278
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:35,280
from this perspective looks like a very
 

7279
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:40,009
from this perspective looks like a very
big sin

7280
02:18:40,009 --> 02:18:40,019

 

7281
02:18:40,019 --> 02:18:41,629

but when we look at the set of

7282
02:18:41,629 --> 02:18:41,639
but when we look at the set of
 

7283
02:18:41,639 --> 02:18:43,910
but when we look at the set of

7284
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:43,920

7285
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:46,429

that such an AI would take that

02:18:46,429 --> 02:18:46,439
that such an AI would take that
 

7287
02:18:46,439 --> 02:18:47,929
that such an AI would take that
supersedes humans

7288
02:18:47,929 --> 02:18:47,939

uh I think Eliezer is worried about like

7290
02:18:50,209 --> 02:18:50,219
uh I think Eliezer is worried about like
 

7291
02:18:50,219 --> 02:18:52,310
uh I think Eliezer is worried about like
ones that not just kill all humans but

7292
02:18:52,310 --> 02:18:52,320
ones that not just kill all humans but
 

7293
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:54,709
ones that not just kill all humans but
also have some kind of

7294
02:18:54,709 --> 02:18:54,719
also have some kind of
 

7295
02:18:54,719 --> 02:18:57,889
also have some kind of
maybe objectively uh undesirable

7296
02:18:57,889 --> 02:18:57,899
maybe objectively uh undesirable
 

7297
02:18:57,899 --> 02:19:00,290
maybe objectively uh undesirable

like how many trajectories when you look

7300
02:19:04,910 --> 02:19:04,920
like how many trajectories when you look
 

7301
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,709
like how many trajectories when you look
at the big picture of life on Earth

7302
02:19:06,709 --> 02:19:06,719
at the big picture of life on Earth
 

7303
02:19:06,719 --> 02:19:08,330
at the big picture of life on Earth
would you be happy with and how much

7304
02:19:08,330 --> 02:19:08,340
would you be happy with and how much
 

7305
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:09,770
would you be happy with and how much
were you

7306
02:19:09,770 --> 02:19:09,780
were you
 

7307
02:19:09,780 --> 02:19:11,629
were you
with AGI

7308
02:19:11,629 --> 02:19:11,639
with AGI
 

7309
02:19:11,639 --> 02:19:13,849
with AGI
whether it kills humans or not there is

7310
02:19:13,849 --> 02:19:13,859
whether it kills humans or not there is
 

7311
02:19:13,859 --> 02:19:15,410
whether it kills humans or not there is
no single answer to this it's really

7312
02:19:15,410 --> 02:19:15,420
no single answer to this it's really
 

7313
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:17,270
no single answer to this it's really
it's a question that depends on the

7314
02:19:17,270 --> 02:19:17,280
it's a question that depends on the
 

7315
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:19,070
it's a question that depends on the
perspective that I'm taking at a given

7316
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:19,080
perspective that I'm taking at a given
 

7317
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:20,330
perspective that I'm taking at a given
moment

7318
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:20,340
moment
 

7319
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:23,889
moment
and so there are perspectives that are

7320
02:19:23,889 --> 02:19:23,899
and so there are perspectives that are
 

7321
02:19:23,899 --> 02:19:26,089
and so there are perspectives that are
determining most of my life as a human

7322
02:19:26,089 --> 02:19:26,099
determining most of my life as a human
 

7323
02:19:26,099 --> 02:19:29,270
determining most of my life as a human
being yes and the other perspective zoom

7324
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:29,280
being yes and the other perspective zoom
 

7325
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:33,530
being yes and the other perspective zoom
out further and imagine that when the

7326
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:33,540
out further and imagine that when the
 

7327
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:35,389
out further and imagine that when the
Great oxygenation event happened that is

7328
02:19:35,389 --> 02:19:35,399
Great oxygenation event happened that is
 

7329
02:19:35,399 --> 02:19:38,209
Great oxygenation event happened that is
photosynthesis was invented and plants

7330
02:19:38,209 --> 02:19:38,219
photosynthesis was invented and plants
 

7331
02:19:38,219 --> 02:19:40,429
photosynthesis was invented and plants
emerged and displaced a lot of the fungi

7332
02:19:40,429 --> 02:19:40,439
emerged and displaced a lot of the fungi
 

7333
02:19:40,439 --> 02:19:42,770
emerged and displaced a lot of the fungi
and alja in favor of plant life and then

7334
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:42,780
and alja in favor of plant life and then
 

7335
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:45,530
and alja in favor of plant life and then
later made animals possible imagine that

7336
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:45,540
later made animals possible imagine that
 

7337
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:47,030
later made animals possible imagine that
the fungi would have gotten together and

7338
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:47,040
the fungi would have gotten together and
 

7339
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:48,830
the fungi would have gotten together and
said oh my God this photosynthesis stuff

7340
02:19:48,830 --> 02:19:48,840
said oh my God this photosynthesis stuff
 

7341
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:50,690
said oh my God this photosynthesis stuff
is really really bad it's going to

7342
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:50,700
is really really bad it's going to
 

7343
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:52,310
is really really bad it's going to
possibly displace and kill a lot of

7344
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:52,320
possibly displace and kill a lot of
 

7345
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:54,349
possibly displace and kill a lot of
fungi we should slow it down and

7346
02:19:54,349 --> 02:19:54,359
fungi we should slow it down and
 

7347
02:19:54,359 --> 02:19:56,030
fungi we should slow it down and
regulate it and mix with it doesn't

7348
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:56,040
regulate it and mix with it doesn't
 

7349
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:56,929
regulate it and mix with it doesn't
happen

7350
02:19:56,929 --> 02:19:56,939
happen
 

7351
02:19:56,939 --> 02:20:01,429
happen
uh this doesn't look good to me

7352
02:20:01,429 --> 02:20:01,439
uh this doesn't look good to me
 

7353
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:04,370
uh this doesn't look good to me
perspective that said you tweeted about

02:20:04,370 --> 02:20:04,380
perspective that said you tweeted about
 

7355
02:20:04,380 --> 02:20:05,929
perspective that said you tweeted about
a cliff

7356
02:20:05,929 --> 02:20:05,939
a cliff
 

7357
02:20:05,939 --> 02:20:08,090
a cliff
beautifully written as a sentient

7358
02:20:08,090 --> 02:20:08,100
beautifully written as a sentient
 

7359
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:10,550
beautifully written as a sentient
species humanity is a beautiful child

7360
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:10,560
species humanity is a beautiful child
 

7361
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:12,889
species humanity is a beautiful child
joyful explorative wild sad and

7362
02:20:12,889 --> 02:20:12,899
joyful explorative wild sad and
 

7363
02:20:12,899 --> 02:20:15,469
joyful explorative wild sad and
desperate but Humanity has no concept of

7364
02:20:15,469 --> 02:20:15,479
desperate but Humanity has no concept of
 

7365
02:20:15,479 --> 02:20:17,750
desperate but Humanity has no concept of
submitting to reason and duty to life

7366
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:17,760
submitting to reason and duty to life
 

7367
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:20,750
submitting to reason and duty to life
and future survival we will run until we

7368
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:20,760
and future survival we will run until we
 

7369
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:23,889
and future survival we will run until we
step past the cliff

7370
02:20:23,889 --> 02:20:23,899
step past the cliff
 

7371
02:20:23,899 --> 02:20:26,090
step past the cliff
so first of all do you think that's true

7372
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:26,100
so first of all do you think that's true
 

7373
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:28,190
so first of all do you think that's true
yeah I think that's pretty much the

7374
02:20:28,190 --> 02:20:28,200
yeah I think that's pretty much the
 

7375
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:30,530
yeah I think that's pretty much the
story of the club of Rome the limits to

7376
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:30,540
story of the club of Rome the limits to
 

7377
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:33,469
story of the club of Rome the limits to
growth and the cliff that we are

7378
02:20:33,469 --> 02:20:33,479
growth and the cliff that we are
 

7379
02:20:33,479 --> 02:20:35,810
growth and the cliff that we are
stepping over is at least one foot as

7380
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:35,820
stepping over is at least one foot as
 

7381
02:20:35,820 --> 02:20:38,630
stepping over is at least one foot as
the delayed feedback basically we do

7382
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:38,640
the delayed feedback basically we do
 

7383
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:41,570
the delayed feedback basically we do
things that have consequences that can

7384
02:20:41,570 --> 02:20:41,580
things that have consequences that can
 

7385
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:44,690
things that have consequences that can
be felt uh Generations later and this

7386
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:44,700
be felt uh Generations later and this
 

7387
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:47,750
be felt uh Generations later and this
severity increases even after we stopped

7388
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:47,760
severity increases even after we stopped
 

7389
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:48,830
severity increases even after we stopped
doing the thing

7390
02:20:48,830 --> 02:20:48,840
doing the thing
 

7391
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:51,530
doing the thing
so I suspect that for the climate um

7392
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:51,540
so I suspect that for the climate um
 

7393
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:54,650
so I suspect that for the climate um
that the original predictions uh that uh

7394
02:20:54,650 --> 02:20:54,660
that the original predictions uh that uh
 

7395
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:57,349
that the original predictions uh that uh
the famous scientists made were correct

7396
02:20:57,349 --> 02:20:57,359
the famous scientists made were correct
 

7397
02:20:57,359 --> 02:20:59,389
the famous scientists made were correct
so when they said that the Tipping

7398
02:20:59,389 --> 02:20:59,399
so when they said that the Tipping
 

7399
02:20:59,399 --> 02:21:01,790
so when they said that the Tipping
points were in the late 80s they were

7400
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:01,800
points were in the late 80s they were
 

7401
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:04,849
points were in the late 80s they were
probably in the late 80s and if we would

7402
02:21:04,849 --> 02:21:04,859
probably in the late 80s and if we would
 

7403
02:21:04,859 --> 02:21:06,950
probably in the late 80s and if we would
stop emission right now we would not

7404
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:06,960
stop emission right now we would not
 

7405
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:08,690
stop emission right now we would not
turn it back maybe there are ways for

7406
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:08,700
turn it back maybe there are ways for
 

7407
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:12,230
turn it back maybe there are ways for
carbon capture but so far there is no

7408
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,240
carbon capture but so far there is no
 

7409
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:13,790
carbon capture but so far there is no
sustainable carbon capture technology

7410
02:21:13,790 --> 02:21:13,800
sustainable carbon capture technology
 

7411
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:15,830
sustainable carbon capture technology
that we can deploy deploy maybe there's

7412
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:15,840
that we can deploy deploy maybe there's
 

7413
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:18,349
that we can deploy deploy maybe there's
a way to put aerosols in the atmosphere

7414
02:21:18,349 --> 02:21:18,359
a way to put aerosols in the atmosphere
 

7415
02:21:18,359 --> 02:21:20,330
a way to put aerosols in the atmosphere
to cool it down it's the possibilities

7416
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:20,340
to cool it down it's the possibilities
 

7417
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:23,090
to cool it down it's the possibilities
right but right now per default

7418
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:23,100
right but right now per default
 

7419
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:27,050
right but right now per default
uh it seems that we will step into a

7420
02:21:27,050 --> 02:21:27,060
uh it seems that we will step into a
 

7421
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:29,030
uh it seems that we will step into a
situation where we feel that we've run

7422
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:29,040
situation where we feel that we've run
 

7423
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:31,969
situation where we feel that we've run
too far and going back is not something

7424
02:21:31,969 --> 02:21:31,979
too far and going back is not something
 

7425
02:21:31,979 --> 02:21:33,650
too far and going back is not something
that we can do smoothly and gradually

7426
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:33,660
that we can do smoothly and gradually
 

7427
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:36,590
that we can do smoothly and gradually
but it's going to lead to a catastrophic

7428
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:36,600
but it's going to lead to a catastrophic
 

7429
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:38,030
but it's going to lead to a catastrophic
event

7430
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:38,040
event
 

7431
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:40,849
event
catastrophic event of what kind

7432
02:21:40,849 --> 02:21:40,859
catastrophic event of what kind
 

7433
02:21:40,859 --> 02:21:43,309
catastrophic event of what kind
so can you still in the case that we

7434
02:21:43,309 --> 02:21:43,319
so can you still in the case that we
 

7435
02:21:43,319 --> 02:21:45,770
so can you still in the case that we
will continue dancing along

7436
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:45,780
will continue dancing along
 

7437
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:48,410
will continue dancing along
and always stop just short of the edge

7438
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:48,420
and always stop just short of the edge
 

7439
02:21:48,420 --> 02:21:50,809
and always stop just short of the edge
of the cliff I think it's possible but

7440
02:21:50,809 --> 02:21:50,819
of the cliff I think it's possible but
 

7441
02:21:50,819 --> 02:21:52,969
of the cliff I think it's possible but
it doesn't seem to be likely so I think

7442
02:21:52,969 --> 02:21:52,979
it doesn't seem to be likely so I think
 

7443
02:21:52,979 --> 02:21:56,510
it doesn't seem to be likely so I think
this model that is being apparent in the

7444
02:21:56,510 --> 02:21:56,520
this model that is being apparent in the
 

7445
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:59,030
this model that is being apparent in the
simulation that we're making of climate

7446
02:21:59,030 --> 02:21:59,040
simulation that we're making of climate
 

7447
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:01,309
simulation that we're making of climate
pollution economies and so on is that

7448
02:22:01,309 --> 02:22:01,319
pollution economies and so on is that
 

7449
02:22:01,319 --> 02:22:03,770
pollution economies and so on is that
many effects are only visible versus

7450
02:22:03,770 --> 02:22:03,780
many effects are only visible versus
 

7451
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:07,610
many effects are only visible versus
significant delay and uh in that time

7452
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:07,620
significant delay and uh in that time
 

7453
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:09,770
significant delay and uh in that time
the system is moving much more out of

7454
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:09,780
the system is moving much more out of
 

7455
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:11,510
the system is moving much more out of
the equilibrium state or of the state

7456
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:11,520
the equilibrium state or of the state
 

7457
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,969
the equilibrium state or of the state
where homeostasis is still possible and

7458
02:22:13,969 --> 02:22:13,979
where homeostasis is still possible and
 

7459
02:22:13,979 --> 02:22:16,070
where homeostasis is still possible and
instead moves into a different state one

7460
02:22:16,070 --> 02:22:16,080
instead moves into a different state one
 

7461
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:20,210
instead moves into a different state one
that is going to Harbor fewer people

7462
02:22:20,210 --> 02:22:20,220
that is going to Harbor fewer people
 

7463
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:22,130
that is going to Harbor fewer people
and that is basically the concern there

7464
02:22:22,130 --> 02:22:22,140
and that is basically the concern there
 

7465
02:22:22,140 --> 02:22:24,050
and that is basically the concern there
and again it's a possibility it's just

7466
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:24,060
and again it's a possibility it's just
 

7467
02:22:24,060 --> 02:22:26,650
and again it's a possibility it's just
and it's a possibility that is

7468
02:22:26,650 --> 02:22:26,660
and it's a possibility that is
 

7469
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:29,030
and it's a possibility that is
larger than the possibility that it's

7470
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:29,040
larger than the possibility that it's
 

7471
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,830
larger than the possibility that it's
not happening that we will be safe that

7472
02:22:30,830 --> 02:22:30,840
not happening that we will be safe that
 

7473
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:32,510
not happening that we will be safe that
we will be able to dance back all the

7474
02:22:32,510 --> 02:22:32,520
we will be able to dance back all the
 

7475
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:33,290
we will be able to dance back all the
time

7476
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:33,300
time
 

7477
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:35,210
time
so the climate is one thing but there's

7478
02:22:35,210 --> 02:22:35,220
so the climate is one thing but there's
 

7479
02:22:35,220 --> 02:22:37,670
so the climate is one thing but there's
a lot of other threats they might have a

7480
02:22:37,670 --> 02:22:37,680
a lot of other threats they might have a
 

7481
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:39,590
a lot of other threats they might have a
faster feedback mechanism less delay

7482
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:39,600
faster feedback mechanism less delay
 

7483
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:42,710
faster feedback mechanism less delay
there is also a thing that uh AI is

7484
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:42,720
there is also a thing that uh AI is
 

7485
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,690
there is also a thing that uh AI is
probably going to happen and it's going

7486
02:22:44,690 --> 02:22:44,700
probably going to happen and it's going
 

7487
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:47,090
probably going to happen and it's going
to make everything uncertain again yep

7488
02:22:47,090 --> 02:22:47,100
to make everything uncertain again yep
 

7489
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,670
to make everything uncertain again yep
because it is going to affect so many

7490
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:49,680
because it is going to affect so many
 

7491
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:52,550
because it is going to affect so many
variables that it's very hard for us to

7492
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:52,560
variables that it's very hard for us to
 

7493
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,050
variables that it's very hard for us to
make a projection into the future

7494
02:22:54,050 --> 02:22:54,060
make a projection into the future
 

7495
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:56,510
make a projection into the future
anymore and maybe that's a good thing it

7496
02:22:56,510 --> 02:22:56,520
anymore and maybe that's a good thing it
 

7497
02:22:56,520 --> 02:23:00,530
anymore and maybe that's a good thing it
does not uh give us the freedom I think

7498
02:23:00,530 --> 02:23:00,540
does not uh give us the freedom I think
 

7499
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:02,270
does not uh give us the freedom I think
to say now we don't need to care about

7500
02:23:02,270 --> 02:23:02,280
to say now we don't need to care about
 

7501
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:04,190
to say now we don't need to care about
anything anymore because AI will either

7502
02:23:04,190 --> 02:23:04,200
anything anymore because AI will either
 

7503
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:08,330
anything anymore because AI will either
kill us or save us but I suspect that if

7504
02:23:08,330 --> 02:23:08,340
kill us or save us but I suspect that if
 

7505
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:11,450
kill us or save us but I suspect that if
Humanity continues it will be due to AI

7506
02:23:11,450 --> 02:23:11,460
Humanity continues it will be due to AI
 

7507
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:14,270
Humanity continues it will be due to AI
what's the timeline for things to get

02:23:14,270 --> 02:23:14,280
what's the timeline for things to get
 

7509
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:16,849
what's the timeline for things to get
real weird with AI and it can get weird

7510
02:23:16,849 --> 02:23:16,859

02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:53,389
find people that they can relate to when
they become their family and often that

02:23:53,389 --> 02:23:53,399
they become their family and often that

7775
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:03,710
that like corporations will destroy the
magic

7776
02:28:03,710 --> 02:28:03,720
magic
 

7777
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:05,510
magic
I believe that if we make everything

7778
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:05,520
I believe that if we make everything
 

7779
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:08,389
I believe that if we make everything
open source uh and make this mandatory

7780
02:28:08,389 --> 02:28:08,399
open source uh and make this mandatory
 

7781
02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:10,730
open source uh and make this mandatory
we are going to lose about a lot of

7782
02:28:10,730 --> 02:28:10,740
we are going to lose about a lot of
 

7783
02:28:10,740 --> 02:28:13,250
we are going to lose about a lot of
beautiful art and a lot of beautiful

7784
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:13,260
beautiful art and a lot of beautiful
 

7785
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:16,670
beautiful art and a lot of beautiful
designs there is a reason why uh Linux

7786
02:28:16,670 --> 02:28:16,680
designs there is a reason why uh Linux
 

7787
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:21,370
designs there is a reason why uh Linux
desktop is still ugly

7788
02:28:21,370 --> 02:28:21,380

 

7789
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:24,889

create coherence and open source designs

7790
02:28:24,889 --> 02:28:24,899
create coherence and open source designs
 

7791
02:28:24,899 --> 02:28:27,830
create coherence and open source designs
so far when the designs have to get very

7792
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:27,840
so far when the designs have to get very
 

7793
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:29,929
so far when the designs have to get very
large and it's easier to make this

7794
02:28:29,929 --> 02:28:29,939
large and it's easier to make this
 

7795
02:28:29,939 --> 02:28:32,809
large and it's easier to make this
happening in a company with centralized

7796
02:28:32,809 --> 02:28:32,819
happening in a company with centralized
 

7797
02:28:32,819 --> 02:28:35,809
happening in a company with centralized
organization and from my own perspective

7798
02:28:35,809 --> 02:28:35,819
organization and from my own perspective
 

7799
02:28:35,819 --> 02:28:38,809
organization and from my own perspective
what we should ensure is that open

7800
02:28:38,809 --> 02:28:38,819
what we should ensure is that open
 

7801
02:28:38,819 --> 02:28:40,490
what we should ensure is that open
source Never Dies that it can always

7802
02:28:40,490 --> 02:28:40,500
source Never Dies that it can always
 

7803
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:44,150
source Never Dies that it can always
compete and has a place with the other

7804
02:28:44,150 --> 02:28:44,160
compete and has a place with the other
 

7805
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:46,010
compete and has a place with the other
forms of organization because I think it

7806
02:28:46,010 --> 02:28:46,020
forms of organization because I think it
 

7807
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:47,929
forms of organization because I think it
is absolutely vital that open source

7808
02:28:47,929 --> 02:28:47,939
is absolutely vital that open source
 

7809
02:28:47,939 --> 02:28:50,570
is absolutely vital that open source
exists and that we have systems that uh

7810
02:28:50,570 --> 02:28:50,580
exists and that we have systems that uh
 

7811
02:28:50,580 --> 02:28:52,790
exists and that we have systems that uh
people have under control outside of the

7812
02:28:52,790 --> 02:28:52,800
people have under control outside of the
 

7813
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:55,610
people have under control outside of the
cooperation and that is also producing

7814
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:55,620
cooperation and that is also producing
 

7815
02:28:55,620 --> 02:28:58,370
cooperation and that is also producing
viable competition to the corporations

7816
02:28:58,370 --> 02:28:58,380
viable competition to the corporations
 

7817
02:28:58,380 --> 02:29:00,950
viable competition to the corporations
so the corporations the centralized

7818
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:00,960
so the corporations the centralized
 

7819
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:03,349
so the corporations the centralized
control the dictatorships of

7820
02:29:03,349 --> 02:29:03,359
control the dictatorships of
 

7821
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:06,590
control the dictatorships of
Corporations can create Beauty there's a

7822
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:06,600
Corporations can create Beauty there's a
 

7823
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:09,590
Corporations can create Beauty there's a
centralized design is a source of a lot

7824
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:09,600
centralized design is a source of a lot
 

7825
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:11,510
centralized design is a source of a lot
of beauty and then I guess open source

7826
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:11,520
of beauty and then I guess open source
 

7827
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:13,630
of beauty and then I guess open source
is a source of

7828
02:29:13,630 --> 02:29:13,640
is a source of
 

7829
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:16,610
is a source of
Freedom a hedge against

7830
02:29:16,610 --> 02:29:16,620
Freedom a hedge against
 

7831
02:29:16,620 --> 02:29:19,370
Freedom a hedge against
the corrupting nature of power

7832
02:29:19,370 --> 02:29:19,380
the corrupting nature of power
 

7833
02:29:19,380 --> 02:29:21,830
the corrupting nature of power
that comes with centralized I grew up in

7834
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:21,840
that comes with centralized I grew up in
 

7835
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:23,990
that comes with centralized I grew up in
socialism and I I learned that

7836
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:24,000
socialism and I I learned that
 

7837
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,790
socialism and I I learned that
corporations are totally evil and they

7838
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:25,800
corporations are totally evil and they
 

7839
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:27,710
corporations are totally evil and they
found this very very convincing and then

7840
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:27,720
found this very very convincing and then
 

7841
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:29,929
found this very very convincing and then
you look at corporations like N1 and

7842
02:29:29,929 --> 02:29:29,939
you look at corporations like N1 and
 

7843
02:29:29,939 --> 02:29:32,570
you look at corporations like N1 and
Halliburton maybe and realized yeah they

7844
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:32,580
Halliburton maybe and realized yeah they
 

7845
02:29:32,580 --> 02:29:34,550
Halliburton maybe and realized yeah they
are evil but you also notice that many

7846
02:29:34,550 --> 02:29:34,560
are evil but you also notice that many
 

7847
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:36,650
are evil but you also notice that many
other corporations are not evil they're

7848
02:29:36,650 --> 02:29:36,660
other corporations are not evil they're
 

7849
02:29:36,660 --> 02:29:39,349
other corporations are not evil they're
surprisingly benevolent why are they so

7850
02:29:39,349 --> 02:29:39,359
surprisingly benevolent why are they so
 

7851
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:41,150
surprisingly benevolent why are they so
benevolent is this because everybody is

7852
02:29:41,150 --> 02:29:41,160
benevolent is this because everybody is
 

7853
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:43,550
benevolent is this because everybody is
fighting them all the time this I don't

7854
02:29:43,550 --> 02:29:43,560
fighting them all the time this I don't
 

7855
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:45,230
fighting them all the time this I don't
think that's the only explanation it's

7856
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:45,240
think that's the only explanation it's
 

7857
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:46,790
think that's the only explanation it's
because they're actually animals that

7858
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:46,800
because they're actually animals that
 

7859
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:49,130
because they're actually animals that
live in a large ecosystem and that are

7860
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:49,140
live in a large ecosystem and that are
 

7861
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:50,750
live in a large ecosystem and that are
still largely controlled by people that

7862
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:50,760
still largely controlled by people that
 

7863
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:53,030
still largely controlled by people that
want that ecosystem to flourish and be

7864
02:29:53,030 --> 02:29:53,040
want that ecosystem to flourish and be
 

7865
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:56,510
want that ecosystem to flourish and be
viable for people so I think that Pat

7866
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:56,520
viable for people so I think that Pat
 

7867
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:58,670
viable for people so I think that Pat
gelsinger is completely sincere when he

7868
02:29:58,670 --> 02:29:58,680
gelsinger is completely sincere when he
 

7869
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:02,330
gelsinger is completely sincere when he
leads Intel to be a tool that supplies

7870
02:30:02,330 --> 02:30:02,340
leads Intel to be a tool that supplies
 

7871
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:04,910
leads Intel to be a tool that supplies
the Free World with semiconductors and

7872
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:04,920
the Free World with semiconductors and
 

7873
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:06,650
the Free World with semiconductors and
it's not necessary that all the

7874
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:06,660
it's not necessary that all the
 

7875
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:07,730
it's not necessary that all the
semiconductors are coming from

7876
02:30:07,730 --> 02:30:07,740
semiconductors are coming from
 

7877
02:30:07,740 --> 02:30:10,250
semiconductors are coming from
intelligence Intel needs to be there to

7878
02:30:10,250 --> 02:30:10,260
intelligence Intel needs to be there to
 

7879
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:12,170
intelligence Intel needs to be there to
make sure that we always have them

7880
02:30:12,170 --> 02:30:12,180
make sure that we always have them
 

7881
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:14,570
make sure that we always have them
right so there can be many ways in which

7882
02:30:14,570 --> 02:30:14,580
right so there can be many ways in which
 

7883
02:30:14,580 --> 02:30:16,370
right so there can be many ways in which
we can import and trade semiconductors

7884
02:30:16,370 --> 02:30:16,380
we can import and trade semiconductors
 

7885
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:18,290
we can import and trade semiconductors
from other companies in place that we

7886
02:30:18,290 --> 02:30:18,300
from other companies in place that we
 

7887
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:19,849
from other companies in place that we
just need to make sure that nobody can

7888
02:30:19,849 --> 02:30:19,859
just need to make sure that nobody can
 

7889
02:30:19,859 --> 02:30:21,590
just need to make sure that nobody can
cut us off from it because that would be

7890
02:30:21,590 --> 02:30:21,600
cut us off from it because that would be
 

7891
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:24,170
cut us off from it because that would be
a disaster for this kind of society and

7892
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:24,180
a disaster for this kind of society and
 

7893
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:26,929
a disaster for this kind of society and
world right and so there are many things

7894
02:30:26,929 --> 02:30:26,939
world right and so there are many things
 

7895
02:30:26,939 --> 02:30:29,030
world right and so there are many things
that need to be done to make our style

7896
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,040
that need to be done to make our style
 

7897
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,670
that need to be done to make our style
of life possible and then with this I

7898
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:31,680
of life possible and then with this I
 

7899
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:34,550
of life possible and then with this I
don't mean uh just capitalism or

7900
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:34,560
don't mean uh just capitalism or
 

7901
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:36,290
don't mean uh just capitalism or

environmental destruction consumer resin
 

7903
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:39,349
environmental destruction consumer resin
and Creature Comforts I mean an idea of

7904
02:30:39,349 --> 02:30:39,359
and Creature Comforts I mean an idea of
 

7905
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:42,469
and Creature Comforts I mean an idea of
life in which we are determined uh not

7906
02:30:42,469 --> 02:30:42,479
life in which we are determined uh not
 

7907
02:30:42,479 --> 02:30:45,230
life in which we are determined uh not
by some kind of king or dictator but in

7908
02:30:45,230 --> 02:30:45,240
by some kind of king or dictator but in
 

7909
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:46,790
by some kind of king or dictator but in
which individuals can determine

7910
02:30:46,790 --> 02:30:46,800
which individuals can determine
 

7911
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:48,290
which individuals can determine
themselves to the largest possible

7912
02:30:48,290 --> 02:30:48,300
themselves to the largest possible
 

7913
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:50,570
themselves to the largest possible
degree and to me this is something that

7914
02:30:50,570 --> 02:30:50,580
degree and to me this is something that
 

7915
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:52,429
degree and to me this is something that
this Western World Is Still trying to

7916
02:30:52,429 --> 02:30:52,439
this Western World Is Still trying to
 

7917
02:30:52,439 --> 02:30:54,830
this Western World Is Still trying to
embody and it's a very valuable idea

7918
02:30:54,830 --> 02:30:54,840
embody and it's a very valuable idea
 

7919
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:57,889
embody and it's a very valuable idea
that we shouldn't give up too early and

7920
02:30:57,889 --> 02:30:57,899
that we shouldn't give up too early and
 

7921
02:30:57,899 --> 02:31:00,530
that we shouldn't give up too early and
from this perspective the US is a system

7922
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:00,540
from this perspective the US is a system
 

7923
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:02,690
from this perspective the US is a system

That is producing things that are
 

7931
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:12,230
That is producing things that are
economically viable and to do this it

02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:13,550
economically viable and to do this it
requires a lot of people who are

7934
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:13,560
requires a lot of people who are
 

7935
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:15,290
requires a lot of people who are
dedicating a significant part of their

7936
02:31:15,290 --> 02:31:15,300
dedicating a significant part of their
 

7937
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:16,130
dedicating a significant part of their
life

7938
02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:16,140
life
 

7939
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:18,170
life
for working for this particular kind of

7940
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:18,180
for working for this particular kind of
 

7941
02:31:18,180 --> 02:31:20,389
for working for this particular kind of
club and the entrepreneur is picking the

7942
02:31:20,389 --> 02:31:20,399
club and the entrepreneur is picking the
 

7943
02:31:20,399 --> 02:31:21,950
club and the entrepreneur is picking the
initial set of rules in the mission and

7944
02:31:21,950 --> 02:31:21,960
initial set of rules in the mission and
 

7945
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:23,929
initial set of rules in the mission and
vision and Aesthetics for the club and

7946
02:31:23,929 --> 02:31:23,939
vision and Aesthetics for the club and
 

7947
02:31:23,939 --> 02:31:25,429
vision and Aesthetics for the club and
make sure that it works

7948
02:31:25,429 --> 02:31:25,439
make sure that it works
 

7949
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:27,469
make sure that it works
but uh the people that are in there need

7950
02:31:27,469 --> 02:31:27,479
but uh the people that are in there need
 

7951
02:31:27,479 --> 02:31:29,809
but uh the people that are in there need
to be protected right if they sacrifice

7952
02:31:29,809 --> 02:31:29,819
to be protected right if they sacrifice
 

7953
02:31:29,819 --> 02:31:31,490
to be protected right if they sacrifice
part of their life they need to be rules

7954
02:31:31,490 --> 02:31:31,500
part of their life they need to be rules
 

7955
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:33,469
part of their life they need to be rules
that tell how they're being taken care

7956
02:31:33,469 --> 02:31:33,479
that tell how they're being taken care
 

7957
02:31:33,479 --> 02:31:35,990
that tell how they're being taken care
of even after they leave the club and so

7958
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,000
of even after they leave the club and so
 

7959
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,870
of even after they leave the club and so
on so there's a large body of rules that

7960
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:38,880
on so there's a large body of rules that
 

7961
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:40,849
on so there's a large body of rules that
have been created by our rule-giving

7962
02:31:40,849 --> 02:31:40,859
have been created by our rule-giving
 

7963
02:31:40,859 --> 02:31:43,490
have been created by our rule-giving
clubs and that are enforced by our

7964
02:31:43,490 --> 02:31:43,500
clubs and that are enforced by our
 

7965
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:45,710
clubs and that are enforced by our
enforcement collapse and on and some of

7966
02:31:45,710 --> 02:31:45,720
enforcement collapse and on and some of
 

7967
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,270
enforcement collapse and on and some of
these collabs have to be monopolies for

7968
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:47,280
these collabs have to be monopolies for
 

7969
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,130
these collabs have to be monopolies for
game theoretic reasons which also makes

7970
02:31:49,130 --> 02:31:49,140
game theoretic reasons which also makes
 

7971
02:31:49,140 --> 02:31:51,230
game theoretic reasons which also makes
them more open to corruption and less

7972
02:31:51,230 --> 02:31:51,240
them more open to corruption and less
 

7973
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:53,570
them more open to corruption and less
harder to update yeah and this is an

7974
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:53,580
harder to update yeah and this is an
 

7975
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:55,309
harder to update yeah and this is an
ongoing discussion and process that

7976
02:31:55,309 --> 02:31:55,319
ongoing discussion and process that
 

7977
02:31:55,319 --> 02:31:57,469
ongoing discussion and process that
takes place but the beauty of this idea

7978
02:31:57,469 --> 02:31:57,479
takes place but the beauty of this idea
 

7979
02:31:57,479 --> 02:32:00,410
takes place but the beauty of this idea
that there is no centralized King who is

7980
02:32:00,410 --> 02:32:00,420
that there is no centralized King who is
 

7981
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:02,510
that there is no centralized King who is
uh that is extracting from The Peasants

7982
02:32:02,510 --> 02:32:02,520
uh that is extracting from The Peasants
 

7983
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:05,870
uh that is extracting from The Peasants
and breeding The Peasants into serving

7984
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:05,880
and breeding The Peasants into serving
 

7985
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:07,550
and breeding The Peasants into serving
the king and fulfilling all the rules

7986
02:32:07,550 --> 02:32:07,560
the king and fulfilling all the rules
 

7987
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:10,610
the king and fulfilling all the rules
like ends and then enter but that uh

7988
02:32:10,610 --> 02:32:10,620
like ends and then enter but that uh
 

7989
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:12,530
like ends and then enter but that uh
there is a freedom of Association and

7990
02:32:12,530 --> 02:32:12,540
there is a freedom of Association and
 

7991
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:14,570
there is a freedom of Association and
corporations are one of them is

7992
02:32:14,570 --> 02:32:14,580
corporations are one of them is
 

7993
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:16,130
corporations are one of them is
something that took me some time to

7994
02:32:16,130 --> 02:32:16,140
something that took me some time to
 

7995
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:18,590
something that took me some time to
realize so I do I do think that

7996
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:18,600
realize so I do I do think that
 

7997
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:20,630
realize so I do I do think that
corporations are dangerous right they

7998
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:20,640
corporations are dangerous right they
 

7999
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:23,270
corporations are dangerous right they
need to be protections against overreach

8000
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280
need to be protections against overreach
 

8001
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:26,929
need to be protections against overreach
of corporations that can do regular Tory

8002
02:32:26,929 --> 02:32:26,939
of corporations that can do regular Tory
 

8003
02:32:26,939 --> 02:32:28,969
of corporations that can do regular Tory
capture and prevent open source from

8004
02:32:28,969 --> 02:32:28,979
capture and prevent open source from
 

8005
02:32:28,979 --> 02:32:31,730
capture and prevent open source from
competing with corporations by imposing

8006
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:31,740
competing with corporations by imposing
 

8007
02:32:31,740 --> 02:32:34,790
competing with corporations by imposing
rules that make it impossible for a

8008
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:34,800
rules that make it impossible for a
 

8009
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:37,190
rules that make it impossible for a
small group of kids to come together to

8010
02:32:37,190 --> 02:32:37,200
small group of kids to come together to
 

8011
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:38,389
small group of kids to come together to
build their own language model because

8012
02:32:38,389 --> 02:32:38,399
build their own language model because
 

8013
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:41,330
build their own language model because
open AI has convinced the US that you

8014
02:32:41,330 --> 02:32:41,340
open AI has convinced the US that you
 

8015
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:43,309
open AI has convinced the US that you
need to have some kind of FDA process

8016
02:32:43,309 --> 02:32:43,319
need to have some kind of FDA process
 

8017
02:32:43,319 --> 02:32:44,630
need to have some kind of FDA process
that you need to go through that cost

8018
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:44,640
that you need to go through that cost
 

8019
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:46,670
that you need to go through that cost
many million dollars before you are able

8020
02:32:46,670 --> 02:32:46,680
many million dollars before you are able
 

8021
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:49,010
many million dollars before you are able
to train a language model right so this

8022
02:32:49,010 --> 02:32:49,020
to train a language model right so this
 

8023
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:50,929
to train a language model right so this
is important to make sure that this

8024
02:32:50,929 --> 02:32:50,939
is important to make sure that this
 

8025
02:32:50,939 --> 02:32:52,790
is important to make sure that this
doesn't happen so I think that open Ai

8026
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:52,800
doesn't happen so I think that open Ai
 

8027
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:55,490
doesn't happen so I think that open Ai
and Google are good things if these good

8028
02:32:55,490 --> 02:32:55,500
and Google are good things if these good
 

8029
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:58,370
and Google are good things if these good
things are kept in check in such a way

8030
02:32:58,370 --> 02:32:58,380
things are kept in check in such a way
 

8031
02:32:58,380 --> 02:33:00,110
things are kept in check in such a way
that all the other clubs can still be

8032
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:00,120
that all the other clubs can still be
 

8033
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:01,969
that all the other clubs can still be
founded and all the other forms of clubs

8034
02:33:01,969 --> 02:33:01,979
founded and all the other forms of clubs
 

8035
02:33:01,979 --> 02:33:03,889
founded and all the other forms of clubs
that are desirable can still coexist

8036
02:33:03,889 --> 02:33:03,899
that are desirable can still coexist
 

8037
02:33:03,899 --> 02:33:05,690
that are desirable can still coexist
with them so what do you think about

8038
02:33:05,690 --> 02:33:05,700
with them so what do you think about
 

8039
02:33:05,700 --> 02:33:09,410
with them so what do you think about
meta in contrast to that open sourcing

8040
02:33:09,410 --> 02:33:09,420
meta in contrast to that open sourcing
 

8041
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:12,830
meta in contrast to that open sourcing
most of its uh language models and most

8042
02:33:12,830 --> 02:33:12,840
most of its uh language models and most
 

8043
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:14,870
most of its uh language models and most
of the AI models it's working on and

8044
02:33:14,870 --> 02:33:14,880
of the AI models it's working on and
 

8045
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:16,250
of the AI models it's working on and
actually suggesting they will continue

8046
02:33:16,250 --> 02:33:16,260
actually suggesting they will continue
 

8047
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:18,230
actually suggesting they will continue
to do so in the future for future

8048
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:18,240
to do so in the future for future
 

8049
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:19,790
to do so in the future for future
versions of llama

8050
02:33:19,790 --> 02:33:19,800
versions of llama
 

8051
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:21,910
versions of llama
for example their large language model

8052
02:33:21,910 --> 02:33:21,920
for example their large language model
 

8053
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:23,870
for example their large language model
what uh

8054
02:33:23,870 --> 02:33:23,880
what uh
 

8055
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:26,210
what uh
is that exciting to you is that

8056
02:33:26,210 --> 02:33:26,220
is that exciting to you is that
 

8057
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:27,710
is that exciting to you is that
concerning

8058
02:33:27,710 --> 02:33:27,720
concerning
 

8059
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:29,750
concerning
I don't find it very concerning but

8060
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:29,760
I don't find it very concerning but
 

8061
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,429
I don't find it very concerning but
that's also because I think that the

8062
02:33:31,429 --> 02:33:31,439
that's also because I think that the
 

8063
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:34,309
that's also because I think that the
language models are not very dangerous

8064
02:33:34,309 --> 02:33:34,319
language models are not very dangerous
 

8065
02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:35,210
language models are not very dangerous
yet

8066
02:33:35,210 --> 02:33:35,220
yet
 

8067
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:40,010
yet
and yet yes so as I said I have no proof

8068
02:33:40,010 --> 02:33:40,020
and yet yes so as I said I have no proof
 

8069
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:41,870
and yet yes so as I said I have no proof
that there is the boundary between the

8070
02:33:41,870 --> 02:33:41,880
that there is the boundary between the
 

8071
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:45,170
that there is the boundary between the
language models and AI HDI

8072
02:33:45,170 --> 02:33:45,180
language models and AI HDI
 

8073
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:48,050
language models and AI HDI
it's possible that somebody builds a

8074
02:33:48,050 --> 02:33:48,060
it's possible that somebody builds a
 

8075
02:33:48,060 --> 02:33:50,690
it's possible that somebody builds a
version of baby AGI I think and Source

8076
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:50,700
version of baby AGI I think and Source
 

8077
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:53,450
version of baby AGI I think and Source
in an algorithmic improvements that

8078
02:33:53,450 --> 02:33:53,460
in an algorithmic improvements that
 

8079
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:55,309
in an algorithmic improvements that
scale these systems up in ways that

8080
02:33:55,309 --> 02:33:55,319
scale these systems up in ways that
 

8081
02:33:55,319 --> 02:33:56,630
scale these systems up in ways that
otherwise wouldn't have happened without

8082
02:33:56,630 --> 02:33:56,640
otherwise wouldn't have happened without
 

8083
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:59,030
otherwise wouldn't have happened without
these language model components so it's

8084
02:33:59,030 --> 02:33:59,040
these language model components so it's
 

8085
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,610
these language model components so it's
not really clear for me what the end at

8086
02:34:01,610 --> 02:34:01,620
not really clear for me what the end at
 

8087
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:04,070
not really clear for me what the end at
the end game is there and if these

8088
02:34:04,070 --> 02:34:04,080
the end game is there and if these
 

8089
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:07,429
the end game is there and if these
models can boot force their way into AGI

8090
02:34:07,429 --> 02:34:07,439
models can boot force their way into AGI
 

8091
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:10,070
models can boot force their way into AGI
and there's also a possibility that the

8092
02:34:10,070 --> 02:34:10,080
and there's also a possibility that the
 

8093
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:11,990
and there's also a possibility that the
AGI that we are building with these

8094
02:34:11,990 --> 02:34:12,000
AGI that we are building with these
 

8095
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,550
AGI that we are building with these
language models

8096
02:34:13,550 --> 02:34:13,560
language models
 

8097
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:15,770
language models
are not taking responsibility for what

8098
02:34:15,770 --> 02:34:15,780
are not taking responsibility for what
 

8099
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:17,030
are not taking responsibility for what
they are because they don't understand

8100
02:34:17,030 --> 02:34:17,040
they are because they don't understand
 

8101
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:18,590
they are because they don't understand
the greater game

8102
02:34:18,590 --> 02:34:18,600
the greater game
 

8103
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:21,830
the greater game
and so to me it would be interesting to

8104
02:34:21,830 --> 02:34:21,840
and so to me it would be interesting to
 

8105
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:24,110
and so to me it would be interesting to
try to understand how to build systems

8106
02:34:24,110 --> 02:34:24,120
try to understand how to build systems
 

8107
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:26,330
try to understand how to build systems
that understand what the greater games

8108
02:34:26,330 --> 02:34:26,340
that understand what the greater games
 

8109
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:28,309
that understand what the greater games
are what are the longest games that we

8110
02:34:28,309 --> 02:34:28,319
are what are the longest games that we
 

8111
02:34:28,319 --> 02:34:30,550
are what are the longest games that we
can play on this planet

8112
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:30,560
can play on this planet
 

8113
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:34,070
can play on this planet

way you did with the games now in the
 

8117
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,550
way you did with the games now in the
game theoretic sense so when we are

8118
02:34:37,550 --> 02:34:37,560
game theoretic sense so when we are
 

8119
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:38,870
game theoretic sense so when we are
interacting with each other in some

8120
02:34:38,870 --> 02:34:38,880
interacting with each other in some
 

8121
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:40,490
interacting with each other in some
sense we are playing games we are making

8122
02:34:40,490 --> 02:34:40,500
sense we are playing games we are making
 

8123
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:42,349
sense we are playing games we are making
lots and lots of interactions this

02:34:42,349 --> 02:34:42,359
lots and lots of interactions this
 

8125
02:34:42,359 --> 02:34:43,610
lots and lots of interactions this
doesn't mean that these interactions

8126
02:34:43,610 --> 02:34:43,620
doesn't mean that these interactions
 

8127
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:45,950
doesn't mean that these interactions
have also be transactional every one of

have also be transactional every one of
 

8129

8141
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:02,150
Friedman I'm doing a set of podcasts and
then you feel that it's part of

8142
02:35:02,150 --> 02:35:02,160
then you feel that it's part of
 

8143
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:03,469
then you feel that it's part of
something larger that you want to build

8144
02:35:03,469 --> 02:35:03,479
something larger that you want to build
 

8145
02:35:03,479 --> 02:35:05,270
something larger that you want to build
maybe you want to inspire people maybe

8146
02:35:05,270 --> 02:35:05,280
maybe you want to inspire people maybe
 

8147
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:07,490
maybe you want to inspire people maybe
you want them to see more possibilities

8148
02:35:07,490 --> 02:35:07,500
you want them to see more possibilities
 

8149
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:09,730
you want them to see more possibilities
and get them together over shared ideas

8150
02:35:09,730 --> 02:35:09,740
and get them together over shared ideas
 

8151
02:35:09,740 --> 02:35:11,929
and get them together over shared ideas
maybe your game is that you want to

8152
02:35:11,929 --> 02:35:11,939
maybe your game is that you want to
 

8153
02:35:11,939 --> 02:35:13,550
maybe your game is that you want to
become super rich and famous by being

8154
02:35:13,550 --> 02:35:13,560
become super rich and famous by being

the best postcard Acosta on Earth maybe

8156
02:35:15,770 --> 02:35:15,780
the best postcard Acosta on Earth maybe
 

8157
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:17,330
the best postcard Acosta on Earth maybe
you have other games maybe it switches

8158
02:35:17,330 --> 02:35:17,340
you have other games maybe it switches
 

8159
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:19,610
you have other games maybe it switches
from time to time right but there is a

8160
02:35:19,610 --> 02:35:19,620
from time to time right but there is a
 

8161
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:20,990
from time to time right but there is a
certain perspective where you might be

8162
02:35:20,990 --> 02:35:21,000
certain perspective where you might be
 

8163
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,490
certain perspective where you might be
thinking what is the longest possible

8164
02:35:22,490 --> 02:35:22,500
thinking what is the longest possible
 

8165
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:24,530
thinking what is the longest possible
game that you would be playing a short

8166
02:35:24,530 --> 02:35:24,540
game that you would be playing a short
 

8167
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:26,750
game that you would be playing a short
game is for instance cancer is playing a

8168
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:26,760
game is for instance cancer is playing a
 

8169
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:28,670
game is for instance cancer is playing a
shorter game than your organism it kinda

8170
02:35:28,670 --> 02:35:28,680
shorter game than your organism it kinda
 

8171
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:30,710
shorter game than your organism it kinda
is an organism playing a shorter game

8172
02:35:30,710 --> 02:35:30,720
is an organism playing a shorter game
 

8173
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:33,170
is an organism playing a shorter game
then the regular organism and because

8174
02:35:33,170 --> 02:35:33,180
then the regular organism and because
 

8175
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:35,510
then the regular organism and because
the Cancer Cannot procreate beyond the

8176
02:35:35,510 --> 02:35:35,520
the Cancer Cannot procreate beyond the
 

8177
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:36,950
the Cancer Cannot procreate beyond the
organism

8178
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:36,960
organism
 

8179
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:38,809
organism
um except for some infectious cancers

8180
02:35:38,809 --> 02:35:38,819
um except for some infectious cancers
 

8181
02:35:38,819 --> 02:35:40,730
um except for some infectious cancers
like the ones that eradicated the

8182
02:35:40,730 --> 02:35:40,740
like the ones that eradicated the
 

8183
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:44,630
like the ones that eradicated the
Tasmanian devils uh you uh typically end

8184
02:35:44,630 --> 02:35:44,640
Tasmanian devils uh you uh typically end
 

8185
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:46,550
Tasmanian devils uh you uh typically end
up with the situation where the organism

8186
02:35:46,550 --> 02:35:46,560
up with the situation where the organism
 

8187
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:48,170
up with the situation where the organism
dies together with the cancer because

8188
02:35:48,170 --> 02:35:48,180
dies together with the cancer because
 

8189
02:35:48,180 --> 02:35:50,330
dies together with the cancer because
the cancer has destroyed the larger

8190
02:35:50,330 --> 02:35:50,340
the cancer has destroyed the larger
 

8191
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:52,790
the cancer has destroyed the larger
system due to playing a shorter game and

8192
02:35:52,790 --> 02:35:52,800
system due to playing a shorter game and
 

8193
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:55,190
system due to playing a shorter game and
so ideally you want to I think build

8194
02:35:55,190 --> 02:35:55,200
so ideally you want to I think build
 

8195
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:57,710
so ideally you want to I think build
agents that play the longest possible

8196
02:35:57,710 --> 02:35:57,720
agents that play the longest possible
 

8197
02:35:57,720 --> 02:36:00,349
agents that play the longest possible
games and the longest possible games is

8198
02:36:00,349 --> 02:36:00,359
games and the longest possible games is
 

8199
02:36:00,359 --> 02:36:02,690
games and the longest possible games is
to keep entropy at Bay as long as

8200
02:36:02,690 --> 02:36:02,700
to keep entropy at Bay as long as
 

8201
02:36:02,700 --> 02:36:04,370
to keep entropy at Bay as long as
possible by doing while doing

8202
02:36:04,370 --> 02:36:04,380
possible by doing while doing
 

8203
02:36:04,380 --> 02:36:06,349
possible by doing while doing
interesting stuff but the longest yes

8204
02:36:06,349 --> 02:36:06,359
interesting stuff but the longest yes
 

8205
02:36:06,359 --> 02:36:09,410
interesting stuff but the longest yes
the dab part the longest possible game

8206
02:36:09,410 --> 02:36:09,420
the dab part the longest possible game
 

8207
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:11,630
the dab part the longest possible game
while doing interesting stuff and while

8208
02:36:11,630 --> 02:36:11,640
while doing interesting stuff and while
 

8209
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:13,429
while doing interesting stuff and while
maintaining at least the same amount of

02:36:13,429 --> 02:36:13,439
maintaining at least the same amount of
 

8211
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:15,410
maintaining at least the same amount of
interesting yes so complexity so

8212
02:36:15,410 --> 02:36:15,420
interesting yes so complexity so
 

8213
02:36:15,420 --> 02:36:17,690
interesting yes so complexity so
propagating because currently I'm pretty

8214
02:36:17,690 --> 02:36:17,700
propagating because currently I'm pretty
 

8215
02:36:17,700 --> 02:36:19,429

8216
02:36:19,429 --> 02:36:19,439
much identified as a conscious being
 

8217
02:36:19,439 --> 02:36:22,610
much identified as a conscious being
it's the minimal uh minimal

8218
02:36:22,610 --> 02:36:22,620
it's the minimal uh minimal
 

8219
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:24,170
it's the minimal uh minimal

8220
02:36:24,170 --> 02:36:24,180
identification that I managed to get
 

8221
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:26,330
identification that I managed to get
together because if I turn this off I

8222
02:36:26,330 --> 02:36:26,340
together because if I turn this off I
 

8223
02:36:26,340 --> 02:36:28,910
together because if I turn this off I
fall asleep right and when I'm asleep

8224
02:36:28,910 --> 02:36:28,920
fall asleep right and when I'm asleep
 

8225
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:31,070
fall asleep right and when I'm asleep
I'm a vegetable I'm no longer here as an

8226
02:36:31,070 --> 02:36:31,080
I'm a vegetable I'm no longer here as an
 

8227
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:33,770
I'm a vegetable I'm no longer here as an
agent so my agency is basically

8228
02:36:33,770 --> 02:36:33,780
agent so my agency is basically
 

8229
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:36,349
agent so my agency is basically
predicated on being conscious and what I

8230
02:36:36,349 --> 02:36:36,359
predicated on being conscious and what I
 

8231
02:36:36,359 --> 02:36:37,790
predicated on being conscious and what I
care about is

8232
02:36:37,790 --> 02:36:37,800
care about is
 

8233
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:40,250
care about is
other conscious agents they're the only

8234
02:36:40,250 --> 02:36:40,260
other conscious agents they're the only
 

8235
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:45,770
other conscious agents they're the only
moral agents for me and so if an AI were

8236
02:36:45,770 --> 02:36:45,780
moral agents for me and so if an AI were
 

8237
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:49,250
moral agents for me and so if an AI were
to treat me as a moral agent that it is

8238
02:36:49,250 --> 02:36:49,260
to treat me as a moral agent that it is
 

8239
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:51,590
to treat me as a moral agent that it is
interested in coexisting this and

8240
02:36:51,590 --> 02:36:51,600
interested in coexisting this and
 

8241
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:53,389
interested in coexisting this and
cooperating with and mutually supporting

8242
02:36:53,389 --> 02:36:53,399
cooperating with and mutually supporting
 

8243
02:36:53,399 --> 02:36:56,150
cooperating with and mutually supporting
each other maybe it is I think necessary

8244
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:56,160
each other maybe it is I think necessary
 

8245
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:58,790
each other maybe it is I think necessary
that the AI thinks that Consciousness is

8246
02:36:58,790 --> 02:36:58,800
that the AI thinks that Consciousness is
 

8247
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:00,950
that the AI thinks that Consciousness is
a viable mode of existence and important

8248
02:37:00,950 --> 02:37:00,960
a viable mode of existence and important
 

8249
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:03,469
a viable mode of existence and important
so I think it would be very important to

8250
02:37:03,469 --> 02:37:03,479
so I think it would be very important to
 

8251
02:37:03,479 --> 02:37:06,889
so I think it would be very important to
build conscious Ai and do this as the

8252
02:37:06,889 --> 02:37:06,899
build conscious Ai and do this as the
 

8253
02:37:06,899 --> 02:37:09,770
build conscious Ai and do this as the
primary goal so not just say we want to

8254
02:37:09,770 --> 02:37:09,780
primary goal so not just say we want to
 

8255
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:11,870
primary goal so not just say we want to
build a useful tool that we can use for

8256
02:37:11,870 --> 02:37:11,880
build a useful tool that we can use for
 

8257
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:13,730
build a useful tool that we can use for
all sorts of things and then we have to

8258
02:37:13,730 --> 02:37:13,740
all sorts of things and then we have to
 

8259
02:37:13,740 --> 02:37:16,250
all sorts of things and then we have to
make sure that the impact on the labor

8260
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:16,260
make sure that the impact on the labor
 

8261
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:17,750
make sure that the impact on the labor
market is something that is not too

8262
02:37:17,750 --> 02:37:17,760
market is something that is not too
 

8263
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:20,150
market is something that is not too
disruptive and manageable and the impact

8264
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:20,160
disruptive and manageable and the impact
 

8265
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:21,770
disruptive and manageable and the impact
on the copyright holder is manageable

8266
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:21,780
on the copyright holder is manageable
 

8267
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:24,290
on the copyright holder is manageable
and not too disruptive and so on right I

8268
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:24,300
and not too disruptive and so on right I
 

8269
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:26,210
and not too disruptive and so on right I
don't think that's the most important

8270
02:37:26,210 --> 02:37:26,220
don't think that's the most important
 

8271
02:37:26,220 --> 02:37:27,710
don't think that's the most important
game to be played

8272
02:37:27,710 --> 02:37:27,720
game to be played
 

8273
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:30,469

I think that we will see extremely large
 

8275
02:37:30,479 --> 02:37:33,110
I think that we will see extremely large
disruptions of the status quo that are

8276
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:33,120
disruptions of the status quo that are
 

8277
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:36,650
disruptions of the status quo that are
quite unpredictable at this point and I

8278
02:37:36,650 --> 02:37:36,660
quite unpredictable at this point and I
 

8279
02:37:36,660 --> 02:37:38,809
quite unpredictable at this point and I
just personally want to make sure that

8280
02:37:38,809 --> 02:37:38,819
just personally want to make sure that
 

8281

just personally want to make sure that
some of the stuff on the other side is

8282
02:37:40,550 --> 02:37:40,560
some of the stuff on the other side is
 

8283
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:43,849
some of the stuff on the other side is
interesting and conscious how do we ride

8284
02:37:43,849 --> 02:37:43,859
interesting and conscious how do we ride
 

8285
02:37:43,859 --> 02:37:46,429
interesting and conscious how do we ride
as individuals and as a society this

wave disruptive wave that changes the
 

8289
02:37:49,319 --> 02:37:50,570

I didn't feel enriched playing it I felt
 

8369
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:36,650
I didn't feel enriched playing it I felt
that the time playing it was not

8370
02:39:36,650 --> 02:39:36,660
that the time playing it was not
 

8371
02:39:36,660 --> 02:39:38,090
that the time playing it was not
unpleasant but there's also more

8372
02:39:38,090 --> 02:39:38,100
unpleasant but there's also more
 

8373
02:39:38,100 --> 02:39:44,349
unpleasant but there's also more
pleasant stuff that I can

8374

02:39:46,969 --> 02:39:46,979
yes I basically feel that there is a
 

8377
02:39:46,979 --> 02:39:48,710
yes I basically feel that there is a
very transparent economy that's going on

8378
02:39:48,710 --> 02:39:48,720
very transparent economy that's going on
 

8379

8405
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:20,990
that when we die the greatest regret
that people typically have on their

8406
02:40:20,990 --> 02:40:21,000
that people typically have on their
 

8407
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:22,910
that people typically have on their
deathbed at the state oh I wish I had

8408
02:40:22,910 --> 02:40:22,920
deathbed at the state oh I wish I had
 

8409
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:24,550
deathbed at the state oh I wish I had
spent more time on Twitter

8410
02:40:24,550 --> 02:40:24,560
spent more time on Twitter
 

8411
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:27,110

8412
02:40:27,110 --> 02:40:27,120
no I don't think that's the case I think
 

8413
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:29,150
no I don't think that's the case I think
I was probably uh have spent less time

8414
02:40:29,150 --> 02:40:29,160
I was probably uh have spent less time
 

8415
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:32,270
I was probably uh have spent less time
on Twitter but I found it so useful for

8416
02:40:32,270 --> 02:40:32,280
on Twitter but I found it so useful for
 

8417
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:35,030
on Twitter but I found it so useful for
myself and also so addictive that I felt

I need to make the best of it and turn
 

8421
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:38,990
I need to make the best of it and turn
it into an art form and thought form and

8422
02:40:38,990 --> 02:40:39,000
it into an art form and thought form and
 

8423
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,210
it into an art form and thought form and
it did help me to develop something yeah

8424
02:40:41,210 --> 02:40:41,220
it did help me to develop something yeah
 

8425
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:43,790
it did help me to develop something yeah
but I wish uh what other things I could

8426
02:40:43,790 --> 02:40:43,800
but I wish uh what other things I could
 

8427
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:45,230
but I wish uh what other things I could
have done in the meantime it's just not

8428
02:40:45,230 --> 02:40:45,240
have done in the meantime it's just not
 

8429
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:47,150
have done in the meantime it's just not
the universe that we are in anymore most

8430
02:40:47,150 --> 02:40:47,160
the universe that we are in anymore most
 

8431
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:51,650
the universe that we are in anymore most
people don't read books anymore

8432
02:40:51,650 --> 02:40:51,660

what do you think that means that we

8434
02:40:53,870 --> 02:40:53,880
what do you think that means that we
 

8435

what do you think that means that we
don't read books anymore what do you

don't read books anymore what do you
think that means about the collective

8438
02:40:57,290 --> 02:40:57,300
think that means about the collective
 

8439
02:40:57,300 --> 02:40:59,090
think that means about the collective
intelligence of our species is it

8440
02:40:59,090 --> 02:40:59,100
intelligence of our species is it
 

8441
02:40:59,100 --> 02:41:00,650
intelligence of our species is it
possible it's still progressing and

8442
02:41:00,650 --> 02:41:00,660
possible it's still progressing and
 

8443
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:03,290
possible it's still progressing and
growing or experience there is stuff

8444
02:41:03,290 --> 02:41:03,300
growing or experience there is stuff
 

8445
02:41:03,300 --> 02:41:04,790
growing or experience there is stuff
happening on Twitter that was impossible

8446
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:04,800
happening on Twitter that was impossible
 

8447
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:08,150
happening on Twitter that was impossible
for Spokes and I really regret that um

8448
02:41:08,150 --> 02:41:08,160
for Spokes and I really regret that um
 

8449
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:10,309
for Spokes and I really regret that um
Twitter has not taken the turn that I

8450
02:41:10,309 --> 02:41:10,319
Twitter has not taken the turn that I
 

8451
02:41:10,319 --> 02:41:12,170
Twitter has not taken the turn that I
was hoping for I thought Elon is global

8452
02:41:12,170 --> 02:41:12,180
was hoping for I thought Elon is global
 

8453
02:41:12,180 --> 02:41:14,929
was hoping for I thought Elon is global
brainpilled and understands that this

8454
02:41:14,929 --> 02:41:14,939
brainpilled and understands that this
 

8455
02:41:14,939 --> 02:41:16,550
brainpilled and understands that this
thing needs to self-organize and he

8456
02:41:16,550 --> 02:41:16,560
thing needs to self-organize and he
 

8457
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:19,730
thing needs to self-organize and he
needs to develop tools to allow the

8458
02:41:19,730 --> 02:41:19,740
needs to develop tools to allow the
 

8459
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:21,710
needs to develop tools to allow the
profligation of the self-organization so

8460
02:41:21,710 --> 02:41:21,720
profligation of the self-organization so
 

8461
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:24,710
profligation of the self-organization so
Twitter can become sentient and maybe

8462
02:41:24,710 --> 02:41:24,720
Twitter can become sentient and maybe
 

8463
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:26,290
Twitter can become sentient and maybe
this was a pipe dream from the beginning

8464
02:41:26,290 --> 02:41:26,300
this was a pipe dream from the beginning
 

8465
02:41:26,300 --> 02:41:29,210
this was a pipe dream from the beginning
but I felt that the enormous pressure

8466
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:29,220
but I felt that the enormous pressure
 

8467
02:41:29,220 --> 02:41:31,969
but I felt that the enormous pressure
that he was under made it impossible for

8468
02:41:31,969 --> 02:41:31,979
that he was under made it impossible for
 

8469
02:41:31,979 --> 02:41:34,490
that he was under made it impossible for
him to work on any kind of content goals

8470
02:41:34,490 --> 02:41:34,500
him to work on any kind of content goals
 

8471
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:37,309
him to work on any kind of content goals
and uh also many of the decisions that

8472
02:41:37,309 --> 02:41:37,319
and uh also many of the decisions that
 

8473
02:41:37,319 --> 02:41:39,950
and uh also many of the decisions that
he made under this pressure seemed to be

8474
02:41:39,950 --> 02:41:39,960
he made under this pressure seemed to be
 

8475
02:41:39,960 --> 02:41:42,349
he made under this pressure seemed to be
not very wise I don't think that as a

8476
02:41:42,349 --> 02:41:42,359
not very wise I don't think that as a
 

8477
02:41:42,359 --> 02:41:44,330
not very wise I don't think that as a
CEO of a social media company you should

8478
02:41:44,330 --> 02:41:44,340
CEO of a social media company you should
 

8479
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:45,889
CEO of a social media company you should
have opinions in the cultural bar in

8480
02:41:45,889 --> 02:41:45,899
have opinions in the cultural bar in
 

8481
02:41:45,899 --> 02:41:48,469
have opinions in the cultural bar in
public I think that's very short-sighted

8482
02:41:48,469 --> 02:41:48,479
public I think that's very short-sighted
 

8483
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:52,010
public I think that's very short-sighted
and it's I also suspect that it's not a

8484
02:41:52,010 --> 02:41:52,020
and it's I also suspect that it's not a
 

8485
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:54,050
and it's I also suspect that it's not a
good idea to

8486
02:41:54,050 --> 02:41:54,060
good idea to
 

8487
02:41:54,060 --> 02:41:57,550
good idea to
um

8488
02:41:57,550 --> 02:41:57,560

 

8489
02:41:57,560 --> 02:42:01,610

gram of all people yeah um over setting

8490
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:01,620
gram of all people yeah um over setting
 

8491
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:03,710
gram of all people yeah um over setting
a mastodon link and I think Paul made

8492
02:42:03,710 --> 02:42:03,720
a mastodon link and I think Paul made
 

8493
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:05,929
a mastodon link and I think Paul made
this uh intentionally because he wanted

8494
02:42:05,929 --> 02:42:05,939
this uh intentionally because he wanted
 

8495
02:42:05,939 --> 02:42:08,510
this uh intentionally because he wanted
to show Elon Musk that blocking people

8496
02:42:08,510 --> 02:42:08,520
to show Elon Musk that blocking people
 

8497
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:10,550
to show Elon Musk that blocking people
for setting a link is completely counter

8498
02:42:10,550 --> 02:42:10,560
for setting a link is completely counter
 

8499
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:13,010
for setting a link is completely counter
to any idea of free speech that he

8500
02:42:13,010 --> 02:42:13,020
to any idea of free speech that he
 

8501
02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:14,690
to any idea of free speech that he
intended to bring to Twitter and

8502
02:42:14,690 --> 02:42:14,700
intended to bring to Twitter and
 

8503
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:16,730
intended to bring to Twitter and
basically seeing that

8504
02:42:16,730 --> 02:42:16,740
basically seeing that
 

8505
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:19,190
basically seeing that
um Elon was way less principled in his

8506
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:19,200
um Elon was way less principled in his
 

8507
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:21,230
um Elon was way less principled in his
thinking there and is much more

8508
02:42:21,230 --> 02:42:21,240
thinking there and is much more
 

8509
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:24,050
thinking there and is much more
experimental and many of the things that

8510
02:42:24,050 --> 02:42:24,060
experimental and many of the things that
 

8511
02:42:24,060 --> 02:42:25,670
experimental and many of the things that
he is trying

8512
02:42:25,670 --> 02:42:25,680
he is trying
 

8513
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:26,270
he is trying
um

8514
02:42:26,270 --> 02:42:26,280
um
 

8515
02:42:26,280 --> 02:42:28,610
um
they've pen out very differently in

8516
02:42:28,610 --> 02:42:28,620
they've pen out very differently in
 

8517
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:30,830
they've pen out very differently in
Digital Society than they pen out in a

8518
02:42:30,830 --> 02:42:30,840
Digital Society than they pen out in a
 

8519
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:32,809
Digital Society than they pen out in a
car company because the effect is very

8520
02:42:32,809 --> 02:42:32,819
car company because the effect is very
 

8521
02:42:32,819 --> 02:42:34,429
car company because the effect is very
different because everything that you do

8522
02:42:34,429 --> 02:42:34,439
different because everything that you do
 

8523
02:42:34,439 --> 02:42:35,990
different because everything that you do
in a digital Society is going to have

8524
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:36,000
in a digital Society is going to have
 

8525
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,090
in a digital Society is going to have
real world cultural effects

8526
02:42:38,090 --> 02:42:38,100
real world cultural effects
 

8527
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:40,790
real world cultural effects
and so basically I find it quite

8528
02:42:40,790 --> 02:42:40,800
and so basically I find it quite
 

8529
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:43,550
and so basically I find it quite
regrettable that this guy is

8530
02:42:43,550 --> 02:42:43,560
regrettable that this guy is
 

8531
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:46,010
regrettable that this guy is
able to become de facto the pope but

8532
02:42:46,010 --> 02:42:46,020
able to become de facto the pope but
 

8533
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:48,110
able to become de facto the pope but
Twitter has more active members than the

8534
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:48,120
Twitter has more active members than the
 

8535
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:51,050
Twitter has more active members than the
Catholic church and he doesn't get it

8536
02:42:51,050 --> 02:42:51,060
Catholic church and he doesn't get it
 

8537
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:54,050
Catholic church and he doesn't get it
the power and responsibility that he has

8538
02:42:54,050 --> 02:42:54,060
the power and responsibility that he has
 

8539
02:42:54,060 --> 02:42:57,110
the power and responsibility that he has
and the ability to create something in a

8540
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:57,120
and the ability to create something in a
 

8541
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:58,969
and the ability to create something in a
society that is lasting and that is

8542
02:42:58,969 --> 02:42:58,979
society that is lasting and that is
 

8543
02:42:58,979 --> 02:43:01,490
society that is lasting and that is
producing a digital Agora in a way that

8544
02:43:01,490 --> 02:43:01,500
producing a digital Agora in a way that
 

8545
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:03,290
producing a digital Agora in a way that
has never existed before where we build

8546
02:43:03,290 --> 02:43:03,300
has never existed before where we build
 

8547
02:43:03,300 --> 02:43:05,210
has never existed before where we build
a social network on top of a social

8548
02:43:05,210 --> 02:43:05,220
a social network on top of a social
 

8549
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:08,389
a social network on top of a social
network an actual Society on top of the

8550
02:43:08,389 --> 02:43:08,399
network an actual Society on top of the
 

8551
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:09,889
network an actual Society on top of the
algorithms

8552
02:43:09,889 --> 02:43:09,899
algorithms
 

8553
02:43:09,899 --> 02:43:11,690
algorithms
so this is something that just hope

8554
02:43:11,690 --> 02:43:11,700
so this is something that just hope
 

8555
02:43:11,700 --> 02:43:13,309
so this is something that just hope
still in the future and still in the

8556
02:43:13,309 --> 02:43:13,319
still in the future and still in the
 

8557
02:43:13,319 --> 02:43:15,349
still in the future and still in the
cards but um

8558
02:43:15,349 --> 02:43:15,359
cards but um
 

8559
02:43:15,359 --> 02:43:16,969
cards but um
it's something that exists in small

8560
02:43:16,969 --> 02:43:16,979
it's something that exists in small
 

8561
02:43:16,979 --> 02:43:18,770
it's something that exists in small

being very aggressive as their results
 

8729
02:46:33,180 --> 02:46:35,929
being very aggressive as their results
that he didn't seem to show a lot of

02:46:35,929 --> 02:46:35,939
that he didn't seem to show a lot of
 

8731
02:46:35,939 --> 02:46:38,210
that he didn't seem to show a lot of
sensibility in in a way in which he was

8732
02:46:38,210 --> 02:46:38,220
sensibility in in a way in which he was
 

8733
02:46:38,220 --> 02:46:39,710
sensibility in in a way in which he was
criticizing what they were doing and

8734
02:46:39,710 --> 02:46:39,720
criticizing what they were doing and
 

8735
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:41,570

8739
02:46:44,580 --> 02:46:46,070
and uh that was not I think in any way a
shortcoming of him because I noticed

8740
02:46:46,070 --> 02:46:46,080
shortcoming of him because I noticed
 

8741
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:48,349
shortcoming of him because I noticed
that he was much much more dismissive

8742
02:46:48,349 --> 02:46:48,359
that he was much much more dismissive
 

8743
02:46:48,359 --> 02:46:50,750
that he was much much more dismissive
with respect of his own work it was his

8744
02:46:50,750 --> 02:46:50,760
with respect of his own work it was his
 

8745
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:52,670
with respect of his own work it was his
General stance and I felt that this

8746
02:46:52,670 --> 02:46:52,680
General stance and I felt that this
 

8747
02:46:52,680 --> 02:46:54,889
General stance and I felt that this
General stance is creating a lot of

8748
02:46:54,889 --> 02:46:54,899
General stance is creating a lot of
 

8749
02:46:54,899 --> 02:46:56,570
General stance is creating a lot of
liability for him because really a lot

8750
02:46:56,570 --> 02:46:56,580
liability for him because really a lot
 

8751
02:46:56,580 --> 02:46:59,929
liability for him because really a lot
of people take offense at him being not

8752
02:46:59,929 --> 02:46:59,939
of people take offense at him being not
 

8753
02:46:59,939 --> 02:47:02,330
of people take offense at him being not
like their Carnegie character who is

8754
02:47:02,330 --> 02:47:02,340
like their Carnegie character who is
 

8755
02:47:02,340 --> 02:47:04,670
like their Carnegie character who is
always smooth and make sure that

8756
02:47:04,670 --> 02:47:04,680
always smooth and make sure that
 

8757
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:06,410
always smooth and make sure that
everybody likes them so I really respect

8758
02:47:06,410 --> 02:47:06,420
everybody likes them so I really respect
 

8759
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:09,290
everybody likes them so I really respect
that he is willing to take that risk and

8760
02:47:09,290 --> 02:47:09,300
that he is willing to take that risk and
 

8761
02:47:09,300 --> 02:47:11,750
that he is willing to take that risk and
to be wrong in public and to offend

8762
02:47:11,750 --> 02:47:11,760
to be wrong in public and to offend
 

8763
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:14,150
to be wrong in public and to offend
people and he doesn't do this in in any

8764
02:47:14,150 --> 02:47:14,160
people and he doesn't do this in in any
 

8765
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:16,070
people and he doesn't do this in in any
bad way it's just most people fear or

8766
02:47:16,070 --> 02:47:16,080
bad way it's just most people fear or
 

8767
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:19,010
bad way it's just most people fear or
not all people recognize this and so I

8768
02:47:19,010 --> 02:47:19,020
not all people recognize this and so I
 

8769
02:47:19,020 --> 02:47:21,050
not all people recognize this and so I
can be much more aggressive with him

8770
02:47:21,050 --> 02:47:21,060
can be much more aggressive with him
 

8771
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:22,969
can be much more aggressive with him
than it can be with many other people

8772
02:47:22,969 --> 02:47:22,979
than it can be with many other people
 

8773
02:47:22,979 --> 02:47:25,490
than it can be with many other people
who don't play the same game because he

8774
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:25,500
who don't play the same game because he
 

8775
02:47:25,500 --> 02:47:27,230
who don't play the same game because he
understands the way in the spirit in

of the collapse of Eastern Germany and

02:48:10,020 --> 02:48:12,650
of the collapse of Eastern Germany and
the transition into Western Germany and

02:48:12,650 --> 02:48:12,660
the transition into Western Germany and
 

8815
02:48:12,660 --> 02:48:14,870
the transition into Western Germany and
me and my friends and most of the people

8816

me and my friends and most of the people
 

8817
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:17,750
me and my friends and most of the people
I knew and were East Germans and we were

8818
02:48:17,750 --> 02:48:17,760
I knew and were East Germans and we were
 

8819
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:19,670
I knew and were East Germans and we were
very poor because we didn't have money

8820
02:48:19,670 --> 02:48:19,680
very poor because we didn't have money
 

8821
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:21,889
very poor because we didn't have money
and all the capital was invested in

8822
02:48:21,889 --> 02:48:21,899
and all the capital was invested in
 

8823
02:48:21,899 --> 02:48:24,170
and all the capital was invested in
Germany and they bought our factories

8824
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:24,180
Germany and they bought our factories
 

8825
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:25,550
Germany and they bought our factories
and shut them down because they were

8826
02:48:25,550 --> 02:48:25,560
and shut them down because they were
 

8827
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:27,070
and shut them down because they were
mostly only interested in the market

8828
02:48:27,070 --> 02:48:27,080
mostly only interested in the market
 

8829
02:48:27,080 --> 02:48:29,990
mostly only interested in the market
rather than creating new production

8830
02:48:29,990 --> 02:48:30,000
rather than creating new production
 

8831
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:33,650
rather than creating new production
capacity and so uh cities were poor and

8832
02:48:33,650 --> 02:48:33,660
capacity and so uh cities were poor and
 

8833
02:48:33,660 --> 02:48:35,510
capacity and so uh cities were poor and
in this repair and we could not afford

8834
02:48:35,510 --> 02:48:35,520
in this repair and we could not afford
 

8835
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:39,889
in this repair and we could not afford
things and I could not afford to go into

8836
02:48:39,889 --> 02:48:39,899
things and I could not afford to go into
 

8837
02:48:39,899 --> 02:48:42,590
things and I could not afford to go into
a restaurant and order a meal there I

8838
02:48:42,590 --> 02:48:42,600
a restaurant and order a meal there I
 

8839
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:45,410
a restaurant and order a meal there I
would have to cook at home but I also

8840
02:48:45,410 --> 02:48:45,420
would have to cook at home but I also
 

8841
02:48:45,420 --> 02:48:47,690
would have to cook at home but I also
thought why not just have a restaurant

8842
02:48:47,690 --> 02:48:47,700
thought why not just have a restaurant
 

8843
02:48:47,700 --> 02:48:49,910
thought why not just have a restaurant
with my friends so we would open up a

8844
02:48:49,910 --> 02:48:49,920
with my friends so we would open up a
 

8845
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:52,370
with my friends so we would open up a
cafe with friends in a restaurant and we

8846
02:48:52,370 --> 02:48:52,380
cafe with friends in a restaurant and we
 

8847
02:48:52,380 --> 02:48:53,750
cafe with friends in a restaurant and we
would cook for each other in these

8848
02:48:53,750 --> 02:48:53,760
would cook for each other in these
 

8849
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,490
would cook for each other in these
restaurants and also invite the general

8850
02:48:55,490 --> 02:48:55,500
restaurants and also invite the general
 

8851
02:48:55,500 --> 02:48:57,290
restaurants and also invite the general
public and they could donate and

8852
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:57,300
public and they could donate and
 

8853
02:48:57,300 --> 02:48:59,510
public and they could donate and
eventually this became so big that we

8854
02:48:59,510 --> 02:48:59,520
eventually this became so big that we
 

8855
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:02,330
eventually this became so big that we
could turn this into uh some

8856
02:49:02,330 --> 02:49:02,340
could turn this into uh some
 

8857
02:49:02,340 --> 02:49:04,370
could turn this into uh some
Incorporated form and it became regular

8858
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:04,380
Incorporated form and it became regular
 

8859
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:06,469
Incorporated form and it became regular
restaurant at some point or we did the

8860
02:49:06,469 --> 02:49:06,479
restaurant at some point or we did the
 

8861
02:49:06,479 --> 02:49:08,090
restaurant at some point or we did the
same thing with the music movies theater

8862
02:49:08,090 --> 02:49:08,100
same thing with the music movies theater
 

8863
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:11,330
same thing with the music movies theater
we would not be able to afford to pay

8864
02:49:11,330 --> 02:49:11,340
we would not be able to afford to pay
 

8865
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:14,570
we would not be able to afford to pay
um 12 marks to watch a movie but why not

8866
02:49:14,570 --> 02:49:14,580
um 12 marks to watch a movie but why not
 

8867
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:16,190
um 12 marks to watch a movie but why not
just create our own movie theater and

just create our own movie theater and
 

8869
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:18,590
just create our own movie theater and
then invite people to pay and we would

then invite people to pay and we would
 

8871
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:20,570
then invite people to pay and we would
rent the movies

8872
02:49:20,570 --> 02:49:20,580
rent the movies
 

8873
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:22,910
rent the movies
um in a way in which a movie theater

8874
02:49:22,910 --> 02:49:22,920
um in a way in which a movie theater
 

8875
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:25,130
um in a way in which a movie theater
does and but it would be a community

8876
02:49:25,130 --> 02:49:25,140
does and but it would be a community
 

8877
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:27,469
does and but it would be a community
movie theater then which everybody who

8878
02:49:27,469 --> 02:49:27,479
movie theater then which everybody who
 

8879
02:49:27,479 --> 02:49:29,510
movie theater then which everybody who
wants to help can watch for free and

8880
02:49:29,510 --> 02:49:29,520
wants to help can watch for free and
 

8881
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:31,309
wants to help can watch for free and
builds this thing and renovates the

8882
02:49:31,309 --> 02:49:31,319
builds this thing and renovates the
 

8883
02:49:31,319 --> 02:49:33,710
builds this thing and renovates the
building and so we ended up creating

8884
02:49:33,710 --> 02:49:33,720
building and so we ended up creating
 

8885
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:36,889
building and so we ended up creating
lots and lots of infrastructure and I

8886
02:49:36,889 --> 02:49:36,899
lots and lots of infrastructure and I
 

8887
02:49:36,899 --> 02:49:38,270
lots and lots of infrastructure and I
think when you are young and you don't

8888
02:49:38,270 --> 02:49:38,280
think when you are young and you don't
 

8889
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:40,429
think when you are young and you don't
have money move to a place where this is

8890
02:49:40,429 --> 02:49:40,439
have money move to a place where this is
 

8891
02:49:40,439 --> 02:49:42,230
have money move to a place where this is
still happening move to one of those

8892
02:49:42,230 --> 02:49:42,240
still happening move to one of those
 

8893
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:43,670
still happening move to one of those
places that are undeveloped and where

8894
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:43,680
places that are undeveloped and where
 

8895
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:45,410
places that are undeveloped and where
you get critical mass of other people

8896
02:49:45,410 --> 02:49:45,420
you get critical mass of other people
 

8897
02:49:45,420 --> 02:49:47,630
you get critical mass of other people
who are starting to build infrastructure

8898
02:49:47,630 --> 02:49:47,640
who are starting to build infrastructure
 

8899
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:49,429
who are starting to build infrastructure
to live in and that's super satisfying

8900
02:49:49,429 --> 02:49:49,439
to live in and that's super satisfying
 

8901
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:50,809
to live in and that's super satisfying
because you're not just creating

8902
02:49:50,809 --> 02:49:50,819
because you're not just creating
 

8903
02:49:50,819 --> 02:49:52,550
because you're not just creating
infrastructure but we are creating a

8904
02:49:52,550 --> 02:49:52,560
infrastructure but we are creating a
 

8905
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:54,650
infrastructure but we are creating a
small society that is building culture

8906
02:49:54,650 --> 02:49:54,660
small society that is building culture
 

8907
02:49:54,660 --> 02:49:57,590
small society that is building culture
and ways to interact with each other and

8908
02:49:57,590 --> 02:49:57,600
and ways to interact with each other and
 

8909
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:59,570
and ways to interact with each other and
that's much much more satisfying than

8910
02:49:59,570 --> 02:49:59,580
that's much much more satisfying than
 

8911
02:49:59,580 --> 02:50:03,309
that's much much more satisfying than
going into some kind of chain and

8912
02:50:03,309 --> 02:50:03,319
going into some kind of chain and
 

8913
02:50:03,319 --> 02:50:06,590
going into some kind of chain and
get your needs met by ordering food from

8914
02:50:06,590 --> 02:50:06,600
get your needs met by ordering food from
 

8915
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:08,090
get your needs met by ordering food from
this chain and so on so not just

8916
02:50:08,090 --> 02:50:08,100
this chain and so on so not just
 

8917
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:10,330
this chain and so on so not just
consuming culture but creating culture

8918
02:50:10,330 --> 02:50:10,340
consuming culture but creating culture
 

8919
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:12,410
consuming culture but creating culture
and you don't always have that choice

8920
02:50:12,410 --> 02:50:12,420
and you don't always have that choice
 

8921
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:14,030
and you don't always have that choice
that's why I prefaced it when you do

8922
02:50:14,030 --> 02:50:14,040
that's why I prefaced it when you do
 

8923
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:15,530
that's why I prefaced it when you do
have the choice and there are many rules

8924
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:15,540
have the choice and there are many rules
 

8925
02:50:15,540 --> 02:50:17,150
have the choice and there are many rules
that need to be played like we need

8926
02:50:17,150 --> 02:50:17,160
that need to be played like we need
 

8927
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:18,290
that need to be played like we need
people who take care of radio

8928
02:50:18,290 --> 02:50:18,300
people who take care of radio
 

8929
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:20,690
people who take care of radio
distribution in society and so on but

8930
02:50:20,690 --> 02:50:20,700
distribution in society and so on but
 

8931
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:21,889
distribution in society and so on but
when you have the choice to create

8932
02:50:21,889 --> 02:50:21,899
when you have the choice to create
 

8933
02:50:21,899 --> 02:50:23,990
when you have the choice to create
something always go for creation it's so

8934
02:50:23,990 --> 02:50:24,000
something always go for creation it's so
 

8935
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,809
something always go for creation it's so
much more satisfying and it also is this

8936
02:50:26,809 --> 02:50:26,819
much more satisfying and it also is this
 

8937
02:50:26,819 --> 02:50:29,750
much more satisfying and it also is this
is what life is about I think yeah

8938
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:29,760
is what life is about I think yeah

02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:40,250
of a life of a philosopher in a nutshell
it's birth and death and in between

8946
02:50:40,250 --> 02:50:40,260
it's birth and death and in between
 

8947

it's birth and death and in between
it's a chubby guy and says why though

8948
02:50:45,110 --> 02:50:45,120

 

8949
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:46,490

um

8950
02:50:46,490 --> 02:50:46,500
um
 

8951
02:50:46,500 --> 02:50:48,849
um
what do you think is the answer to that

8952
02:50:48,849 --> 02:50:48,859
what do you think is the answer to that
 

8953
02:50:48,859 --> 02:50:51,950
what do you think is the answer to that
well the answer is that everything that

8954
02:50:51,950 --> 02:50:51,960
well the answer is that everything that
 

8955
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:56,150
well the answer is that everything that
can exist might exist and in many ways

8956
02:50:56,150 --> 02:50:56,160
can exist might exist and in many ways
 

8957
02:50:56,160 --> 02:50:58,730
can exist might exist and in many ways
you take an ecological perspective the

8958
02:50:58,730 --> 02:50:58,740
you take an ecological perspective the
 

8959
02:50:58,740 --> 02:51:00,050
you take an ecological perspective the
same way as when you look at human

8960
02:51:00,050 --> 02:51:00,060
same way as when you look at human
 

8961
02:51:00,060 --> 02:51:02,450
same way as when you look at human
opinions and cultures it's not that

8962
02:51:02,450 --> 02:51:02,460
opinions and cultures it's not that
 

8963
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:04,910
opinions and cultures it's not that
there is right and wrong opinions uh

8964
02:51:04,910 --> 02:51:04,920
there is right and wrong opinions uh
 

8965
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:05,990
there is right and wrong opinions uh
when you look at this from this

8966
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,000
when you look at this from this
 

8967
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,750
when you look at this from this
ecological perspective but every opinion

8968
02:51:08,750 --> 02:51:08,760
ecological perspective but every opinion
 

8969
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:10,490
ecological perspective but every opinion
that fits between two human years might

8970
02:51:10,490 --> 02:51:10,500
that fits between two human years might
 

8971
02:51:10,500 --> 02:51:12,950
that fits between two human years might
be between two human years and

8972
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:12,960
be between two human years and
 

8973
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:15,889
be between two human years and
um so when I see in a strange opinion on

8974
02:51:15,889 --> 02:51:15,899
um so when I see in a strange opinion on
 

8975
02:51:15,899 --> 02:51:18,230
um so when I see in a strange opinion on
social media it's not that I feel that I

8976
02:51:18,230 --> 02:51:18,240
social media it's not that I feel that I
 

8977
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:20,090
social media it's not that I feel that I
have a need to get upset it's often more

8978
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,100
have a need to get upset it's often more
 

8979
02:51:20,100 --> 02:51:22,849
have a need to get upset it's often more
that a oh there you are and and your

8980
02:51:22,849 --> 02:51:22,859
that a oh there you are and and your
 

8981
02:51:22,859 --> 02:51:25,309
that a oh there you are and and your
opinion is incentivized then it's going

8982
02:51:25,309 --> 02:51:25,319
opinion is incentivized then it's going
 

8983
02:51:25,319 --> 02:51:27,590
opinion is incentivized then it's going
to be abundant and this when you take

8984
02:51:27,590 --> 02:51:27,600
to be abundant and this when you take
 

8985
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:29,450
to be abundant and this when you take
this ecological perspective also on

8986
02:51:29,450 --> 02:51:29,460
this ecological perspective also on
 

8987
02:51:29,460 --> 02:51:30,950
this ecological perspective also on
yourself and you realize you're just one

8988
02:51:30,950 --> 02:51:30,960
yourself and you realize you're just one
 

8989
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:32,690
yourself and you realize you're just one
of these mushrooms that are popping up

8990
02:51:32,690 --> 02:51:32,700
of these mushrooms that are popping up
 

8991
02:51:32,700 --> 02:51:34,550
of these mushrooms that are popping up
and doing their thing and you can

8992
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:34,560
and doing their thing and you can
 

8993
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:37,070
and doing their thing and you can
depending on where you chose to grow and

8994
02:51:37,070 --> 02:51:37,080
depending on where you chose to grow and
 

8995
02:51:37,080 --> 02:51:38,990
depending on where you chose to grow and
where you happen to grow you can

8996
02:51:38,990 --> 02:51:39,000
where you happen to grow you can
 

8997
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,910
where you happen to grow you can
flourish or not doing this or that

8998
02:51:40,910 --> 02:51:40,920
flourish or not doing this or that
 

8999
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:42,950
flourish or not doing this or that
strategy and it's still all the same

9000
02:51:42,950 --> 02:51:42,960
strategy and it's still all the same
 

9001
02:51:42,960 --> 02:51:44,690
strategy and it's still all the same
life at some level it's all the same

9002
02:51:44,690 --> 02:51:44,700
life at some level it's all the same
 

9003
02:51:44,700 --> 02:51:46,370
life at some level it's all the same
experience of being a conscious being in

9004
02:51:46,370 --> 02:51:46,380
experience of being a conscious being in
 

9005
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:48,590
experience of being a conscious being in
the world and you do have some choice

9006
02:51:48,590 --> 02:51:48,600
the world and you do have some choice
 

9007
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:51,650
the world and you do have some choice
about who you want to be more than any

9008
02:51:51,650 --> 02:51:51,660
about who you want to be more than any
 

9009
02:51:51,660 --> 02:51:54,349
about who you want to be more than any
other animal has that to me is

9010
02:51:54,349 --> 02:51:54,359
other animal has that to me is
 

9011
02:51:54,359 --> 02:51:56,450
other animal has that to me is
fascinating and so I think that rather

9012
02:51:56,450 --> 02:51:56,460
fascinating and so I think that rather
 

9013
02:51:56,460 --> 02:51:58,969
fascinating and so I think that rather
than asking yourself what is the one way

9014
02:51:58,969 --> 02:51:58,979
than asking yourself what is the one way
 

9015
02:51:58,979 --> 02:52:00,950
than asking yourself what is the one way
to be

9016
02:52:00,950 --> 02:52:00,960
to be
 

9017
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:02,330
to be
um think about what are the

9018
02:52:02,330 --> 02:52:02,340
um think about what are the
 

9019
02:52:02,340 --> 02:52:04,070
um think about what are the
possibilities that I have what would be

9020
02:52:04,070 --> 02:52:04,080
possibilities that I have what would be
 

9021
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:05,690
possibilities that I have what would be
the most interesting way to be that I

9022
02:52:05,690 --> 02:52:05,700
the most interesting way to be that I
 

9023
02:52:05,700 --> 02:52:07,610
the most interesting way to be that I
can be because everything is possible so

9024
02:52:07,610 --> 02:52:07,620
can be because everything is possible so
 

9025
02:52:07,620 --> 02:52:09,050
can be because everything is possible so
you get to explore this not everything

9026
02:52:09,050 --> 02:52:09,060
you get to explore this not everything
 

9027
02:52:09,060 --> 02:52:11,330
you get to explore this not everything
is possible many things fail most things

9028
02:52:11,330 --> 02:52:11,340
is possible many things fail most things
 

9029
02:52:11,340 --> 02:52:12,349
is possible many things fail most things
