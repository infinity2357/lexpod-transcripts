well hate speech is much more important
 

243
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,650
well hate speech is much more important
than love speech and the reason is I'm

244
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,660
than love speech and the reason is I'm
 

245
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,749
than love speech and the reason is I'm
much more interested in knowing whom I

246
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:56,759
much more interested in knowing whom I

important
so it should be brought to the surface

284
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
so it should be brought to the surface
 

285
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,529
so it should be brought to the surface
rather than operate in Shadows

well in a free Society

well in a free Society
 

297
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,969
well in a free Society
thoughts start in the brain and then

298
00:05:58,969 --> 00:05:58,979
thoughts start in the brain and then
 

299
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,249
thoughts start in the brain and then
they come out the mouth

300
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:01,259
they come out the mouth
 

301
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,409
they come out the mouth
so there are different ends of the same

302
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:03,419
so there are different ends of the same
 

303
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,469
so there are different ends of the same
Spectrum so to you the censorship of

304
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
Spectrum so to you the censorship of
 

305
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,230
Spectrum so to you the censorship of
speech eventually leads to a censorship

306
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,240
speech eventually leads to a censorship
 

307
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,870
speech eventually leads to a censorship
of thought of course censorship of the

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,990
mode by which other people know what
you're thinking

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,210
you're thinking
so there's some aspect of our society

314
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,220
so there's some aspect of our society
 

315
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,430
so there's some aspect of our society
that is uh the thinking is done

316
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
that is uh the thinking is done
 

317
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,350
that is uh the thinking is done
collectively and without being able to

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
collectively and without being able to
 

319
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,969
collectively and without being able to
speak to each other we cannot do this

320
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:22,979
speak to each other we cannot do this
 

321
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,950
speak to each other we cannot do this
kind of collective ranking and out of

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
kind of collective ranking and out of

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,170
kind of collective ranking and out of

of speech comes truth that isn't no
 

327
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,969
of speech comes truth that isn't no
necessarily so

328
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:31,979
necessarily so
 

329
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,950
necessarily so
but I do think that when there's free

330
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:33,960
but I do think that when there's free
 

331
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,710
but I do think that when there's free
speech better decisions are made because

332
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
speech better decisions are made because
 

333
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,710
speech better decisions are made because
people put their views on the table in a

334
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:39,720
people put their views on the table in a
 

335
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,450
people put their views on the table in a
Frank accurate way and then those views

336
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:44,460
Frank accurate way and then those views
 

337
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,129
Frank accurate way and then those views
mixed together

338
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:46,139
mixed together
 

339
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,990
mixed together
and clash and out of that usually

340
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
and clash and out of that usually
 

341
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,990
and clash and out of that usually
comes the better the better decision

342
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
comes the better the better decision
 

343
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,770
comes the better the better decision
not always but usually more more often

344
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:57,780
not always but usually more more often
 

345
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,230
not always but usually more more often
than not but if somebody is not allowed

346
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
than not but if somebody is not allowed
 

347
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,469
than not but if somebody is not allowed
to be a you know sit at the table of

348
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:03,479
to be a you know sit at the table of
 

349
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,029
to be a you know sit at the table of
decision making

350
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
decision making
 

351
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,129
decision making
then the decision-making process is

352
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:07,139
then the decision-making process is
 

353
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,170
then the decision-making process is
poorer

354
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,180
poorer
 

355
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,150
poorer
um less robust

356
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,160
um less robust
 

357
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,010
um less robust
diverse

358
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,020
diverse
 

359
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,409
diverse
and ultimately less successful

360
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:15,419
and ultimately less successful
 

361
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,710
and ultimately less successful
so can you elaborate on the idea Free

362
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
so can you elaborate on the idea Free
 

363
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,330
so can you elaborate on the idea Free
Speech absolutism

364
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:20,340
Speech absolutism
 

365
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,890
Speech absolutism
so

366
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:21,900
so
 

367
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,110
so
hate speech

368
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,120
hate speech
 

369
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,210
hate speech
can be quite painful to quite a large

370
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,220
can be quite painful to quite a large
 

371
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,089
can be quite painful to quite a large
number of people does this worry you yep

372
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:29,099
number of people does this worry you yep
 

373
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,809
number of people does this worry you yep
living in a free Society

374
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:31,819
living in a free Society
 

375
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,730
living in a free Society
requires that you expose yourself to

376
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:34,740
requires that you expose yourself to
 

377
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,029

some discomfort you call it pain
 

379
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,790
some discomfort you call it pain
it's maybe emotional pain it's not

380
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
it's maybe emotional pain it's not
 

381
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,070
it's maybe emotional pain it's not
physical pain

but

386
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
but
 

387
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,390

and if there is censorship on campuses

902
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:05,820
and if there is censorship on campuses
 

903
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,690
and if there is censorship on campuses
it's highly destructive of the

it's highly destructive of the

and ultimately to the entire Society you

908
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
and ultimately to the entire Society you
 

909
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,930
and ultimately to the entire Society you
know we have in the Sciences

910
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:17,940
know we have in the Sciences
 

911
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,350
know we have in the Sciences
um we have a scientific method

912
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
um we have a scientific method
 

913
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,450
um we have a scientific method
so scientific method is you try

914
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:23,460
so scientific method is you try
 

915
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,510
so scientific method is you try
experiments and you see which ones work

916
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:26,520
experiments and you see which ones work
 

917
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,789
experiments and you see which ones work
and then you develop theories based to

918
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
and then you develop theories based to
 

919
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,310
and then you develop theories based to
public results of experiments well this

920
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,320
public results of experiments well this
 

921
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,810
public results of experiments well this
is not much different from every other

922
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:32,820
is not much different from every other
 

923
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,190
is not much different from every other
aspect of life

924
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,200
aspect of life
 

925
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,590
aspect of life
you have to entertain different views on

926
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:36,600
you have to entertain different views on
 

927
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,870
you have to entertain different views on
different subjects you hear all the

928
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
different subjects you hear all the
 

929
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,730
different subjects you hear all the
views and you make a decision as to

930
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:40,740
views and you make a decision as to
 

931
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,830
views and you make a decision as to
which one's accurate which one's not

932
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:42,840
which one's accurate which one's not
 

933
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,950
which one's accurate which one's not
so the scientific method I apply to

934
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:45,960
so the scientific method I apply to
 

935
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,610
so the scientific method I apply to

scientific method includes ideas hateful
 

943
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,730

ideas also correct if you don't allow

945
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,270
ideas also correct if you don't allow
hateful ideas I mean when scientists do

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,280
hateful ideas I mean when scientists do
 

947
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,090

experiments nobody says to them oh you

experiments nobody says to them oh you
 

949
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,370
experiments nobody says to them oh you
know don't don't do that experiment

950
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:07,380
know don't don't do that experiment
 

951
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,409
know don't don't do that experiment
because it would be very bad if that

952
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:09,419
because it would be very bad if that
 

953
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,450
because it would be very bad if that
turns out to be accurate you know that

the reasons they insult them because

1430
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520
the reasons they insult them because
 

1431
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,149
the reasons they insult them because
they're if they feel inferior yeah I

01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:02,160
no conditions attached to it I think
 

2913
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,309
no conditions attached to it I think
it's emotionally complicated I don't

chomski who make the case that that is
 

2995
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,390
chomski who make the case that that is
far more evil than

01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:43,400
far more evil than
 

2997
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,049
far more evil than
accepting money from Jeffrey Epps yes

2998
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:48,059

to not give naming rights
 

3011
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,789
to not give naming rights
but I think giving morals tested donors

3012

but I think giving morals tested donors
 

3013
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,150
but I think giving morals tested donors
is a is a Pandora's Box

university one of the reasons is
 

3053
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,170
university one of the reasons is
essential is because the university is

so I think that words

3954
01:21:49,149 --> 01:21:49,159
so I think that words
 

3955
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:52,310
so I think that words
unpleasant ideas as expressed by words

3956
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:52,320
unpleasant ideas as expressed by words
 

3957
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,750
unpleasant ideas as expressed by words
are essential for communicating fact and

3958
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:56,760
are essential for communicating fact and
 

3959
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:00,410
are essential for communicating fact and
truth and reality and that's why I think

3960
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:00,420
truth and reality and that's why I think
 

3961
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:04,189
truth and reality and that's why I think
that we should not whitewash language we

3962
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:04,199
that we should not whitewash language we
 

3963
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:05,870
that we should not whitewash language we
should not whitewash the fact that

3964
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:05,880
should not whitewash the fact that
 

3965
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,470

Jeffrey Epstein was pretty close to MIT

3966
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:08,480
Jeffrey Epstein was pretty close to MIT
 

3967
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,990
Jeffrey Epstein was pretty close to MIT
and Harvard and Harvard

3968
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,000
and Harvard and Harvard

01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
um and um your reality reality actually
 

3971
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,350
um and um your reality reality actually
means something yeah but from the role

3972
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:18,360
means something yeah but from the role
 

3973
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,729
means something yeah but from the role
of the interviewer that's something I

3974
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:19,739
of the interviewer that's something I
 

3975
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:22,070
of the interviewer that's something I
have to think a lot about whether

3976
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:22,080
have to think a lot about whether
 

3977
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,970

interviewing Hitler you said exposing
I think

3980
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:27,480
I think
 

3981
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,330
I think
it's hard to know what Hitler's like in

3982
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:29,340
it's hard to know what Hitler's like in
 

3983
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,770
it's hard to know what Hitler's like in
a room but

3984
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:30,780
a room but
 

3985
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,930
a room but
uh it's also hard to know I've never met

Jeffrey ever since cartoon know what
Jeffrey Epstein is like in a room but I

3990
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:37,260
Jeffrey Epstein is like in a room but I
 

3991
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,390
Jeffrey Epstein is like in a room but I
imagine to some degree they're

3992
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:38,400
imagine to some degree they're
 

3993
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,070
imagine to some degree they're
charismatic figures

3994
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
charismatic figures
 

3995
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,530
