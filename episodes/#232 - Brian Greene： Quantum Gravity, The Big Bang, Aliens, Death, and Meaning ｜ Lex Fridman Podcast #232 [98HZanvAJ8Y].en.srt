that's quite a depressing statement as

consciousness so let me ask

60
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
consciousness so let me ask
 

61
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,910
consciousness so let me ask
what is the more hopeful perspective to

62
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
what is the more hopeful perspective to
 

63
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,910
what is the more hopeful perspective to
take on the story

64
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
take on the story
 

65
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,109
take on the story
well i think the more hopeful

66
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
well i think the more hopeful
 

67
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,070
well i think the more hopeful
perspective is to more fully

68
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
perspective is to more fully
 

69
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,870
perspective is to more fully
understand

70
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
understand
 

71
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,550
understand
what was driving bertrand russell to

72
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
what was driving bertrand russell to
 

73
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,230
what was driving bertrand russell to
this perspective

74
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
this perspective
 

75
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,469
this perspective
and then to see it within

76
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
and then to see it within
 

77
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,550
and then to see it within
a broader context

78
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
a broader context
 

79
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,870
a broader context
and really that's in some sense what

80
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
and really that's in some sense what
 

81
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,550
and really that's in some sense what
what my book until the end the time is

82
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
what my book until the end the time is
 

83
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,550
what my book until the end the time is
all about but

84
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
all about but
 

85
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,030
all about but
in brief i would say that there's a lot

86
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
in brief i would say that there's a lot
 

87
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,950
in brief i would say that there's a lot
of truth to what bertrand russell was

88
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
of truth to what bertrand russell was
 

89
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,389
of truth to what bertrand russell was
saying there when you look at the second

90
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
saying there when you look at the second
 

91
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,149
saying there when you look at the second
law of thermodynamics which is the

92
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
law of thermodynamics which is the
 

93
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,230
law of thermodynamics which is the
underlying scientific idea that's

94
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
underlying scientific idea that's
 

95
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,469
underlying scientific idea that's
driving this notion that everything's

96
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
driving this notion that everything's
 

97
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,749
driving this notion that everything's
going to wither decay fall apart yeah

98
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
going to wither decay fall apart yeah
 

99
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,389
going to wither decay fall apart yeah
that's true second law of thermodynamics

100
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
that's true second law of thermodynamics
 

101
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,990
that's true second law of thermodynamics
establishes that

102
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
establishes that
 

103
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,510
establishes that
disorder entropy in aggregate is always

104
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
disorder entropy in aggregate is always
 

105
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,789
disorder entropy in aggregate is always
on the rise and that is indeed

106
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
on the rise and that is indeed
 

107
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,870
on the rise and that is indeed
interpretable as disintegration and

108
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
interpretable as disintegration and
 

109
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,550
interpretable as disintegration and
destruction over sufficiently long time

110
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
destruction over sufficiently long time
 

111
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,390
destruction over sufficiently long time
scales but my view is when you recognize

112
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
scales but my view is when you recognize
 

113
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,790
scales but my view is when you recognize
how special that makes us

114
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
how special that makes us
 

115
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,510
how special that makes us
that we are these exquisitely ordered

116
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
that we are these exquisitely ordered
 

117
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,750
that we are these exquisitely ordered
configurations of particles that only

118
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
configurations of particles that only
 

119
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,229
configurations of particles that only
will last for a blink of an eye in

cosmological time like terms the fact

cosmological time like terms the fact
 

123
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,270

that we're here and we can do what we do

that we're here and we can do what we do
 

125
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,150
that we're here and we can do what we do
to me

126
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
to me
 

127
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,910
to me
that's just

128
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
that's just
 

129
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,630
that's just
really something that inspires gratitude

130
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
really something that inspires gratitude
 

131
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,990
really something that inspires gratitude
and wonder

132
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
and wonder
 

133
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,270
and wonder
and and a sense of of deep

134
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
and and a sense of of deep
 

135
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,390

purpose by virtue of being these unique

136
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
purpose by virtue of being these unique
 

137
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,110
purpose by virtue of being these unique
collections of entities that happen to

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
collections of entities that happen to
 

139
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,270
collections of entities that happen to
rise up look around and try to figure

140
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
rise up look around and try to figure
 

141
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,030
rise up look around and try to figure
out where we are and what the heck we

142
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
out where we are and what the heck we
 

143
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,470
out where we are and what the heck we
should do with our time

144
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
should do with our time
 

145
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,229
should do with our time
so it's not that i would disagree with

146
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
so it's not that i would disagree with
 

147
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,670
so it's not that i would disagree with
burch and russell

148
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
burch and russell
 

149
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,990
burch and russell
in terms of the

150
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
in terms of the
 

151
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,190
in terms of the
basic

152
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
basic
 

153
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,309
basic
physics and the basic unfolding but i

154
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
physics and the basic unfolding but i
 

155
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,390
physics and the basic unfolding but i
think it's really a matter of the slant

156
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
think it's really a matter of the slant
 

157
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,229
think it's really a matter of the slant
that you take on what it means for us

158
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
that you take on what it means for us
 

159
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,350
that you take on what it means for us
so maybe

160
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
so maybe
 

161
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,350
so maybe
we'll skip around a bit but let me ask

162
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
we'll skip around a bit but let me ask
 

163
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,949
we'll skip around a bit but let me ask
the biggest possible question then you

164
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
the biggest possible question then you
 

165
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,430
the biggest possible question then you
said purpose so what's the meaning of it

166
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
said purpose so what's the meaning of it
 

167
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,390
said purpose so what's the meaning of it
all then

168
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
all then
 

169
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,110
all then
is uh is there a meaning to life that we

170
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
is uh is there a meaning to life that we
 

171
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,149
is uh is there a meaning to life that we
can

172
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
can
 

173
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,990
can
take from this

174
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
take from this
 

175
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,070
take from this
from this brief

176
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
from this brief
 

177
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,270
from this brief
emergence of complexity that arises from

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
emergence of complexity that arises from
 

179
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,990
emergence of complexity that arises from
simple things and then goes into

180
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
simple things and then goes into
 

181
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,390
simple things and then goes into
a heat death that is once again returns

182
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
a heat death that is once again returns
 

183
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,550
a heat death that is once again returns
to simple things as the march of the

second law the thermodynamics goes on i

186
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
second law the thermodynamics goes on i
 

187
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,710
second law the thermodynamics goes on i
think there is but i don't think it's a

188
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
think there is but i don't think it's a
 

189
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,470
think there is but i don't think it's a
universal answer

190
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
universal answer
 

191
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,470
universal answer
and so i think throughout

192
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
and so i think throughout
 

193
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,710
and so i think throughout
the ages there has been

the ages there has been
 

195
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,190
the ages there has been
a kind of quest for

196
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
a kind of quest for
 

197
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,309
a kind of quest for
some

198
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
some
 

199
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,030
some
final way of articulating meaning and

200
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
final way of articulating meaning and
 

201
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,430
final way of articulating meaning and
purpose whether it's god

202
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
purpose whether it's god
 

203
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,789
purpose whether it's god
whether it's love whether it's

00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
whether it's love whether it's
 

205

whether it's love whether it's
companionship i mean many people put

taking this question on
 

211
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,509
taking this question on
and there is no one right answer when

212
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
and there is no one right answer when
 

213
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,149
and there is no one right answer when
you recognize deeply

00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
you recognize deeply
 

215
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,270
you recognize deeply
that the universe doesn't care there is

216
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
that the universe doesn't care there is
 

217
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,110
that the universe doesn't care there is
nothing out there

nothing out there

nothing out there
that is the final answer it's not as

is a fool's errand every individual has

is a fool's errand every individual has
the capacity to make their own meaning

the capacity to make their own meaning

the capacity to make their own meaning

some platitude that is what we are

00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,670
some platitude that is what we are
because there is no fundamental answer

this really is the deep lesson of

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,749
this really is the deep lesson of

some level where you can objectively say

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,390
some level where you can objectively say
that whatever we've got going on here is

that whatever we've got going on here is

it's kind of um

our tools i mean
 

311
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,510
our tools i mean
so i have to ask as you described in

312
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
so i have to ask as you described in
 

313
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,189
so i have to ask as you described in
your book once again

314
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
your book once again
 

315
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,590
your book once again
uh schroedinger wrote the book what is

316
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
uh schroedinger wrote the book what is
 

317
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,510
uh schroedinger wrote the book what is
life based on the few lectures he gave

318
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
life based on the few lectures he gave
 

319
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,110
life based on the few lectures he gave
in 1944

320
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
in 1944
 

321
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,710
in 1944
so let me ask

322
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
so let me ask
 

323
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,629
so let me ask
the fundamental question here

324
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
the fundamental question here
 

325
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,830
the fundamental question here
what is

326
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
what is
 

327
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,070
what is
life this particular thing we got going

328
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
life this particular thing we got going
 

329
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,309
life this particular thing we got going
on here this pocket of complexity that

330
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
on here this pocket of complexity that
 

331
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,230
on here this pocket of complexity that
emerged from such simple things yeah

332
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
emerged from such simple things yeah
 

333
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,990
emerged from such simple things yeah
it's a tough question i asked that

334

501
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,110
uh or is it somewhere in between as you
also talk about

502
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
also talk about
 

503
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,110
also talk about
again very hard to know at which point

504
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
again very hard to know at which point
 

505
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,269
again very hard to know at which point
this consciousness yeah

506
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
this consciousness yeah
 

507
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,670
this consciousness yeah
emerge like if you if you were to sort

508
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
emerge like if you if you were to sort
 

509
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,110
emerge like if you if you were to sort
of took us

510
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
of took us
 

511
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,030
of took us
a survey and made bets

512
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
a survey and made bets
 

513
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,269
a survey and made bets
about other earth-like planets in the

514
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
about other earth-like planets in the
 

515
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,190
about other earth-like planets in the
universe where do you think they get

516
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
universe where do you think they get
 

517
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,110
universe where do you think they get
stuck the most well i would certainly

518
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
stuck the most well i would certainly
 

519
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,870
stuck the most well i would certainly
see if we're going to go all the way to

520
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
see if we're going to go all the way to
 

521
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,870
see if we're going to go all the way to
conscious beings like ourselves i would

522
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
conscious beings like ourselves i would
 

523
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,030
conscious beings like ourselves i would
put it at the onset of consciousness

524
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
put it at the onset of consciousness
 

525
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,230
put it at the onset of consciousness
which again

526
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
which again
 

527
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,230
which again
i think is a continuum i don't think it

528
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
i think is a continuum i don't think it
 

529
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,790
i think is a continuum i don't think it
is something that you can draw the line

530
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
is something that you can draw the line
 

531
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,030
is something that you can draw the line
in the sand but there are obvious

532
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
in the sand but there are obvious
 

533
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,550
in the sand but there are obvious
circumstances there are obvious

534
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
circumstances there are obvious
 

535
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,110
circumstances there are obvious
creatures such as ourselves where we do

536
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
creatures such as ourselves where we do
 

537
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,829
creatures such as ourselves where we do
recognize a certain kind of

538
00:09:58,829 --> 00:09:58,839
recognize a certain kind of
 

539
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,750
recognize a certain kind of
self-reflective conscious awareness

540
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
self-reflective conscious awareness
 

541
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,389
self-reflective conscious awareness
and if we think about what

542
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
and if we think about what
 

543
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,670
and if we think about what
it would require for a system of living

544
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
it would require for a system of living
 

545
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,870
it would require for a system of living
beings to acquire consciousness

546
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
beings to acquire consciousness
 

547
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,430
beings to acquire consciousness
i think that's probably the hardest part

548
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
i think that's probably the hardest part
 

549
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,630
i think that's probably the hardest part
because look

550
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
because look
 

551
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,829
because look
take earth

552
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
take earth
 

553
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,230
take earth
and recognize that it weren't for you

554
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
and recognize that it weren't for you
 

555
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,269
and recognize that it weren't for you
know some singular event 65 million

556
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
know some singular event 65 million
 

557
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,990
know some singular event 65 million
years ago where this large rock slams

558
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
years ago where this large rock slams
 

559
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,470
years ago where this large rock slams
into planet earth and wipes out the

560
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
into planet earth and wipes out the
 

561
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,430
into planet earth and wipes out the
dinosaurs maybe the dinosaurs would

562
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
dinosaurs maybe the dinosaurs would
 

563
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,790
dinosaurs maybe the dinosaurs would
still rule the planet and

564
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
still rule the planet and
 

565
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,590
still rule the planet and
they may well have not developed the

566
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
they may well have not developed the
 

567
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,870
they may well have not developed the
kind of conscious awareness that we have

568
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
kind of conscious awareness that we have
 

569
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,590
kind of conscious awareness that we have
so

570
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
so
 

571
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,430
so
for billions of years on this planet

572
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
for billions of years on this planet
 

573
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,870
for billions of years on this planet
there was life

574
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
there was life
 

575
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,870
there was life
that didn't have the kind of conscious

576
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
that didn't have the kind of conscious
 

577
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,910
that didn't have the kind of conscious
awareness that we have and it was an

578
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
awareness that we have and it was an
 

579
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,269
awareness that we have and it was an
accidental event in astrophysical

580
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
accidental event in astrophysical
 

581
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,430
accidental event in astrophysical
history that allowed a mammalian species

582
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
history that allowed a mammalian species
 

583
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,150
history that allowed a mammalian species
like us to ultimately be the end product

584
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
like us to ultimately be the end product
 

585
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,230
like us to ultimately be the end product
and so yeah i could imagine there's a

586
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
and so yeah i could imagine there's a
 

587
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,910
and so yeah i could imagine there's a
lot of life out there

588
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
lot of life out there
 

589
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,750
lot of life out there
but perhaps none of it's

590
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
but perhaps none of it's
 

591
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,470
but perhaps none of it's
wondering what's the meaning of life or

592
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
wondering what's the meaning of life or
 

593
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,550
wondering what's the meaning of life or
trying to make sense of it

594
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
trying to make sense of it
 

595
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,470
trying to make sense of it
just going about its business of

596
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
just going about its business of
 

597
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,949
just going about its business of
survival which of course is the dominant

598
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
survival which of course is the dominant
 

599
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,790
survival which of course is the dominant
activity that life on this planet has

600
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
activity that life on this planet has
 

601
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,670
activity that life on this planet has
practice we are a rare exception to that

602
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
practice we are a rare exception to that
 

603
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,430
practice we are a rare exception to that
and i really appreciate that you lean

604
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
and i really appreciate that you lean
 

605
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,110
and i really appreciate that you lean
into some of these unanswerable

606
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
into some of these unanswerable
 

607
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,350
into some of these unanswerable
questions to me today but the

608
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
questions to me today but the
 

609
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,350
questions to me today but the
so you think about consciousness

610
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
so you think about consciousness
 

611
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,269
so you think about consciousness
not as like a phase shift the binary

612
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
not as like a phase shift the binary
 

613
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,750
not as like a phase shift the binary
zero one you think uh

614
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
zero one you think uh
 

615
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,269
zero one you think uh
it was a continuum that humans somehow

616
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
it was a continuum that humans somehow
 

617
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,509
it was a continuum that humans somehow
are maybe some of the most conscious

618
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
are maybe some of the most conscious
 

619
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,350
are maybe some of the most conscious
beings on earth

620
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
beings on earth
 

621
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,949
beings on earth
so you're so

622
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
so you're so
 

623
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,829
so you're so
i mean people will dispute that

624
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
i mean people will dispute that
 

625
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,030
i mean people will dispute that
yes i mean whoa and it's a very hard

626
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
yes i mean whoa and it's a very hard
 

627
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,269
yes i mean whoa and it's a very hard
argument people will dispute that rocks

628
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
argument people will dispute that rocks
 

629
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,110
argument people will dispute that rocks
probably will stay quiet on the matter

630
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
probably will stay quiet on the matter
 

631
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,750
probably will stay quiet on the matter
maybe not right for the moment they're

632
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
maybe not right for the moment they're
 

633
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,470
maybe not right for the moment they're
waiting for their opportunity but but

634
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
waiting for their opportunity but but
 

635
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,190
waiting for their opportunity but but
but i i i agree that um look even when

636
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
but i i i agree that um look even when
 

637
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,509
but i i i agree that um look even when
you and i look at each other i

638
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
you and i look at each other i
 

639
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,509
you and i look at each other i
am not fully convinced

640
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
am not fully convinced
 

641
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,430
am not fully convinced
that you're a conscious being right i

642
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
that you're a conscious being right i
 

643
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,269
that you're a conscious being right i
mean i think that you are on to me i

644
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
mean i think that you are on to me i
 

645
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,430
mean i think that you are on to me i
mean your behavior is such that that's

646
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
mean your behavior is such that that's
 

647
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,190
mean your behavior is such that that's
the best explanation for what's going on

648
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
the best explanation for what's going on
 

649
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,350
the best explanation for what's going on
but of course we're all in the position

650
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
but of course we're all in the position
 

651
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,829
but of course we're all in the position
of only having direct awareness of our

652
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
of only having direct awareness of our
 

653
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,829
of only having direct awareness of our
own conscious

654
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
own conscious
 

655
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,150
own conscious
being and therefore when it comes to

656
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
being and therefore when it comes to
 

657
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,150
being and therefore when it comes to
other creatures in the world we're in a

658
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
other creatures in the world we're in a
 

659
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,910
other creatures in the world we're in a
similar state of ignorance regarding

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
similar state of ignorance regarding
 

661
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,389
similar state of ignorance regarding
what's actually happening inside of

what's actually happening inside of

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,590
from the ones that we have successfully
dealt with over the course of centuries

830
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
dealt with over the course of centuries
 

831
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,269
dealt with over the course of centuries
in science where we look at the motion

832
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
in science where we look at the motion
 

833
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,030
in science where we look at the motion
of the moon everybody can look everybody

834
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
of the moon everybody can look everybody
 

835
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,350
of the moon everybody can look everybody
can measure it we look at you know the

836
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
can measure it we look at you know the
 

837
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,829
can measure it we look at you know the
properties of hydrogen when you shine

838
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
properties of hydrogen when you shine
 

839
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,389
properties of hydrogen when you shine
lasers on everybody can look at the data

840
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
lasers on everybody can look at the data
 

841
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,870
lasers on everybody can look at the data
and understand it and so it seems like a

842
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
and understand it and so it seems like a
 

843
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,030
and understand it and so it seems like a
fundamentally different problem and in

844
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
fundamentally different problem and in
 

845
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,230
fundamentally different problem and in
that sense it seems like it is hard

846
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
that sense it seems like it is hard
 

847
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,389
that sense it seems like it is hard
relative to the others but

848
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
relative to the others but
 

849
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,069
relative to the others but
i do think ultimately that the

850
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
i do think ultimately that the
 

851
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,949
i do think ultimately that the
explanation will be as you recount i

852
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
explanation will be as you recount i
 

853
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,110
explanation will be as you recount i
think that a hundred years from now or

854
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
think that a hundred years from now or
 

855
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,470
think that a hundred years from now or
maybe it's a thousand it's hard to

856
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
maybe it's a thousand it's hard to
 

857
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,550
maybe it's a thousand it's hard to
predict the time scale for

858
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
predict the time scale for
 

859
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,790
predict the time scale for
developments but i think we'll get to a

860
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
developments but i think we'll get to a
 

861
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,629
developments but i think we'll get to a
place where we'll look back and kind of

862
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
place where we'll look back and kind of
 

863
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,829
place where we'll look back and kind of
smile

864
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
smile
 

865
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,629

at
 

867
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,269
at
those folks in the 20th century and

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
those folks in the 20th century and
 

869
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,509
those folks in the 20th century and
before 21st century and before who

before 21st century and before who
 

871
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,829
before 21st century and before who
thought consciousness was so incredibly

872
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
thought consciousness was so incredibly
 

873
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,269
thought consciousness was so incredibly
mysterious when the reality of it is

874
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
mysterious when the reality of it is
 

875
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,990
mysterious when the reality of it is
it's just a thing that happens when

876
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
it's just a thing that happens when
 

877
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,870
it's just a thing that happens when
particles come together and and however

878
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
particles come together and and however
 

879
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,230
particles come together and and however
mysterious that feels right now

880
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
mysterious that feels right now
 

881
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,670
mysterious that feels right now
i think for instance when we start to

882
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
i think for instance when we start to
 

883
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,749
i think for instance when we start to
build conscious systems you know things

884
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
build conscious systems you know things
 

885
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,350
build conscious systems you know things
that you know you're more familiar with

886
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
that you know you're more familiar with
 

887
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,509
that you know you're more familiar with
than i am when we start to build these

888
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
than i am when we start to build these
 

889
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,990
than i am when we start to build these
artificial systems and those systems

890
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
artificial systems and those systems
 

891
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,749
artificial systems and those systems
report to us

892
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
report to us
 

893
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,110
report to us
i'm feeling sad

894
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
i'm feeling sad
 

895
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,870
i'm feeling sad
i'm feeling anxious yeah there's a world

896
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
i'm feeling anxious yeah there's a world
 

897
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,670
i'm feeling anxious yeah there's a world
going on inside here i think the mystery

898
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
going on inside here i think the mystery
 

899
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,670
going on inside here i think the mystery
of consciousness will just begin to

900
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
of consciousness will just begin to
 

901
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,590
of consciousness will just begin to
evaporate well that's

902
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
evaporate well that's
 

903
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,910
evaporate well that's
first of all beautifully put and i agree

904
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
first of all beautifully put and i agree
 

905
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,829
first of all beautifully put and i agree
with you completely just the way you

906
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
with you completely just the way you
 

907
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,310
with you completely just the way you
said it it'll begin to evaporate

908
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
said it it'll begin to evaporate
 

909
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,069
said it it'll begin to evaporate
i have built quite a few robots and have

910
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
i have built quite a few robots and have
 

911
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,269
i have built quite a few robots and have
had them do emotion

912
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
had them do emotion
 

913
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,990
had them do emotion
emotional type things and it's immediate

914
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
emotional type things and it's immediate
 

915
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,430
emotional type things and it's immediate
that exactly what you're saying this

916
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
that exactly what you're saying this
 

917
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,269
that exactly what you're saying this
kind of mystery of consciousness starts

918
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
kind of mystery of consciousness starts
 

919
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,350
kind of mystery of consciousness starts
to evaporate that

920
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
to evaporate that
 

921
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,629
to evaporate that
the

922
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
the
 

923
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,670
the
kind of need to truly understand to

924
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
kind of need to truly understand to
 

925
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,269
kind of need to truly understand to
solve the hard problem of consciousness

926
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
solve the hard problem of consciousness
 

927
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,189
solve the hard problem of consciousness
like disappears because

928
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
like disappears because
 

929
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:01,990
like disappears because
well

930
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
well
 

931
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,749
well
i don't really care

932
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
i don't really care
 

933
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,829
i don't really care
if i understand what can solve the hard

934
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
if i understand what can solve the hard
 

935
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,990
if i understand what can solve the hard
problem of consciousness that thing sure

936
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
problem of consciousness that thing sure
 

937
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,750
problem of consciousness that thing sure
as heck looks conscious you know i feel

938
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
as heck looks conscious you know i feel
 

939
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,710
as heck looks conscious you know i feel
like that way when i interact with a dog

940
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
like that way when i interact with a dog
 

941
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,630
like that way when i interact with a dog
i don't need to

942
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
i don't need to
 

943
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,870
i don't need to
solve the problem of consciousness to to

944
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
solve the problem of consciousness to to
 

945
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,110
solve the problem of consciousness to to
be able to interact

946
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
be able to interact
 

947
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,110
be able to interact
and richly

948
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
and richly
 

949
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,429
and richly
enjoy the experience with this other

950
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
enjoy the experience with this other
 

951
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,350
enjoy the experience with this other
living being obviously same thing with

952
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
living being obviously same thing with
 

953
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,189
living being obviously same thing with
other humans i don't need to fully

954
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
other humans i don't need to fully
 

955
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,830
other humans i don't need to fully
understand it and there's some aspect

956
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
understand it and there's some aspect
 

957
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,029
understand it and there's some aspect
maybe this is a little bit too

958
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
maybe this is a little bit too
 

959
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,029
maybe this is a little bit too
engineering focused but there's some

960
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
engineering focused but there's some
 

961
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,310
engineering focused but there's some
aspect in which it feels like

962
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
aspect in which it feels like
 

963
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,470
aspect in which it feels like
consciousness is just a

964
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
consciousness is just a
 

965
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,630
consciousness is just a
nice trick

966
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
nice trick
 

967
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,590
nice trick
to help us communicate with each other

968
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
to help us communicate with each other
 

969
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,710
to help us communicate with each other
it sounds ridiculous to say but

970
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
it sounds ridiculous to say but
 

971
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,710
it sounds ridiculous to say but
sort of uh

972
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
sort of uh
 

973
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,909
sort of uh
the ability to experience the world is

974
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
the ability to experience the world is
 

975
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,870
the ability to experience the world is
very useful in a subjective sense it's

976
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
very useful in a subjective sense it's
 

977
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,350
very useful in a subjective sense it's
very useful to put yourself in that

978
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
very useful to put yourself in that
 

979
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,510
very useful to put yourself in that
world and to be able to describe the

980
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
world and to be able to describe the
 

981
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,590
world and to be able to describe the
experience to others yeah it could be

982
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
experience to others yeah it could be
 

983
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,390
experience to others yeah it could be
just the social and the emerge obviously

984
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
just the social and the emerge obviously
 

985
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,070
just the social and the emerge obviously
animals the sort of more primitive

986
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
animals the sort of more primitive
 

987
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,230
animals the sort of more primitive
animals might experience consciousness

988
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
animals might experience consciousness
 

989
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,710
animals might experience consciousness
in some more primitive way

990
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:08,720
in some more primitive way
 

991
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,110
in some more primitive way
but this kind of rich

992
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
but this kind of rich
 

993
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,470
but this kind of rich
subjective experience that we think

994
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
subjective experience that we think
 

995
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,390
subjective experience that we think
about as humans i think it's probably

996
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
about as humans i think it's probably
 

997
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,669
about as humans i think it's probably
deeply coupled like language and poetry

998
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
deeply coupled like language and poetry
 

999
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,549
deeply coupled like language and poetry
yeah that resonates with my view as well

1000
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
yeah that resonates with my view as well
 

1001
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,669
yeah that resonates with my view as well
i mean there's a

1002
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
i mean there's a
 

1003
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,510
i mean there's a
scientist maybe you've spoken to michael

1004
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
scientist maybe you've spoken to michael
 

1005
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,390
scientist maybe you've spoken to michael
graziano from princeton yeah he um

1006
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
graziano from princeton yeah he um
 

1007
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,190
graziano from princeton yeah he um
he's developed ideas of consciousness

1008
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
he's developed ideas of consciousness
 

1009
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,029
he's developed ideas of consciousness
that look i don't think they solve the

1010
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
that look i don't think they solve the
 

1011
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,110
that look i don't think they solve the
problem but i think they do illuminate

1012
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
problem but i think they do illuminate
 

1013
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,070
problem but i think they do illuminate
it in an interesting way where basically

1014
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
it in an interesting way where basically
 

1015
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,350
it in an interesting way where basically
we

1016
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
we
 

1017
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,870
we
are not aware

1018
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
are not aware
 

1019
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,070
are not aware
of all the underlying physiochemical

1020
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
of all the underlying physiochemical
 

1021
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,029
of all the underlying physiochemical
processes that make our brains and our

1022
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
processes that make our brains and our
 

1023
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,909
processes that make our brains and our
inner worlds tick the way they do

1024
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
inner worlds tick the way they do
 

1025
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,950
inner worlds tick the way they do
and because of that dissociation between

1026
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
and because of that dissociation between
 

1027
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,230
and because of that dissociation between
sensation and the physics of it and the

1028
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
sensation and the physics of it and the
 

1029
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,710
sensation and the physics of it and the
chemistry of it and the biology of it it

1030
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
chemistry of it and the biology of it it
 

1031
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,190
chemistry of it and the biology of it it
feels like our minds and our inner

1032
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
feels like our minds and our inner
 

1033
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,830
feels like our minds and our inner
worlds are just untethered like floating

1034
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
worlds are just untethered like floating
 

1035
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,110
worlds are just untethered like floating
somewhere in this gray matter inside of

1036
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
somewhere in this gray matter inside of
 

1037
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,390
somewhere in this gray matter inside of
our heads

1038
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
our heads
 

1039
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,310
our heads
and the way i like to think of it is

1040
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
and the way i like to think of it is
 

1041
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,830
and the way i like to think of it is
like look you know if um if if if you're

1042
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
like look you know if um if if if you're
 

1043
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,789
like look you know if um if if if you're
in a dark room right and and i had

1044
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
in a dark room right and and i had
 

1045
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,430
in a dark room right and and i had
glow-in-the-dark paint on my fingers so

1046
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,440
glow-in-the-dark paint on my fingers so
 

1047
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,350
glow-in-the-dark paint on my fingers so
all you saw was my fingers dancing

1048
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
all you saw was my fingers dancing
 

1049
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,990
all you saw was my fingers dancing
around there'd be something mysterious

1050
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
around there'd be something mysterious
 

1051
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,070
around there'd be something mysterious
how how could those fingers be doing

1052
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
how how could those fingers be doing
 

1053
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,110
how how could those fingers be doing
that and then you turn a light you

1054
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
that and then you turn a light you
 

1055
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,430
that and then you turn a light you
realize oh there's this arm underlying

1056
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
realize oh there's this arm underlying
 

1057
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,789
realize oh there's this arm underlying
it and that's the deep physical

1058
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
it and that's the deep physical
 

1059
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,029
it and that's the deep physical
connection explains it all and i think

1060
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
connection explains it all and i think
 

1061
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,270
connection explains it all and i think
that's what we're missing the deep

1062
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
that's what we're missing the deep
 

1063
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,270
that's what we're missing the deep
physical connection between what's

1064
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
physical connection between what's
 

1065
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,350
physical connection between what's
happening up here and what is

1066
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
happening up here and what is
 

1067
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,510
happening up here and what is
responsible for it in a physical

1068
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
responsible for it in a physical
 

1069
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,990
responsible for it in a physical
chemical biological way and so to me

1070
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
chemical biological way and so to me
 

1071
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,029
chemical biological way and so to me
that at least gives me some

1072
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
that at least gives me some
 

1073
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,270
that at least gives me some
understanding of why consciousness feels

1074
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
understanding of why consciousness feels
 

1075
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,710
understanding of why consciousness feels
so mysterious because we are suppressing

1076
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
so mysterious because we are suppressing
 

1077
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,630
so mysterious because we are suppressing
all of the underlying

1078
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
all of the underlying
 

1079
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,110
all of the underlying
science that ultimately is responsible

1080
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
science that ultimately is responsible
 

1081
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,190
science that ultimately is responsible
for it and one day we will reveal that

1082
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
for it and one day we will reveal that
 

1083
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,669
for it and one day we will reveal that
more fully and i think that will help us

1084
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
more fully and i think that will help us
 

1085
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,750
more fully and i think that will help us
tether this experience to something

1086
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
tether this experience to something
 

1087
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,430
tether this experience to something
quite tangible in the world i wonder

1088
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
quite tangible in the world i wonder
 

1089
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,350
quite tangible in the world i wonder
if the mystery

1090
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
if the mystery
 

1091
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,789
if the mystery
is uh

1092
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
is uh
 

1093
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,789
is uh
an important component of enjoying

1094
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
an important component of enjoying
 

1095
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,070
an important component of enjoying
something

1096
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
something
 

1097
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,630
something
so once once we know how this thing

1098
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
so once once we know how this thing
 

1099
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,149
so once once we know how this thing
works

1100
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
works
 

1101
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,990
works
maybe we uh

1102
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
maybe we uh
 

1103
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,830
maybe we uh
will no longer enjoy

1104
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
will no longer enjoy
 

1105
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,909
will no longer enjoy
like this conversation we'll seek other

1106
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:19,919
like this conversation we'll seek other
 

1107
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,390
like this conversation we'll seek other
sources of enjoyment but

1108
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
sources of enjoyment but
 

1109
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,230
sources of enjoyment but
there's uh this is again from an

1110
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
there's uh this is again from an
 

1111
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,990
there's uh this is again from an
engineering perspective i wonder if the

1112
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
engineering perspective i wonder if the
 

1113
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,190
engineering perspective i wonder if the
mystery

1114
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
mystery
 

1115
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,669
mystery
is is an important component well you

1116
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
is is an important component well you
 

1117
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,669
is is an important component well you
know there's have you ever seen

1118
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
know there's have you ever seen
 

1119
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,470
know there's have you ever seen
there's this beautiful interview that

1120
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
there's this beautiful interview that
 

1121
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,549
there's this beautiful interview that
richard feynman did

1122
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
richard feynman did
 

1123
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,950
richard feynman did
you know great nobel laureate physicist

1124
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
you know great nobel laureate physicist
 

1125
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,070
you know great nobel laureate physicist
responsible for a lot of our

1126
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
responsible for a lot of our
 

1127
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,909
responsible for a lot of our
understanding of quantum mechanics

1128
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
understanding of quantum mechanics
 

1129
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,990
understanding of quantum mechanics
quantum fields and so forth and he

1130
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,000
quantum fields and so forth and he
 

1131
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,430
quantum fields and so forth and he
was in a conversation with an

1132
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
was in a conversation with an
 

1133
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,590
was in a conversation with an
interviewer where he noted that some

1134
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
interviewer where he noted that some
 

1135
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,470
interviewer where he noted that some
people feel like once the mystery is

1136
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
people feel like once the mystery is
 

1137
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,549
people feel like once the mystery is
gone once science explains something

1138
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
gone once science explains something
 

1139
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,669
gone once science explains something
it

1140
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
it
 

1141
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,590
it
the beauty goes away you know the wonder

1142
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
the beauty goes away you know the wonder
 

1143
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,750
the beauty goes away you know the wonder
if it goes away and he was

1144
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
if it goes away and he was
 

1145
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,990
if it goes away and he was
emphasizing in his response to that he's

1146
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
emphasizing in his response to that he's
 

1147
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,390
emphasizing in his response to that he's
like no that's not the right way of

1148
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
like no that's not the right way of
 

1149
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,669
like no that's not the right way of
thinking about he says look when i look

1150
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
thinking about he says look when i look
 

1151
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,430
thinking about he says look when i look
at a rose

1152
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
at a rose
 

1153
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,270
at a rose
he says yeah i can still

1154

he says yeah i can still
deeply enjoy the aroma the color the

1156
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
deeply enjoy the aroma the color the
 

1157
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,029
deeply enjoy the aroma the color the
texture he says but what i can do that

1158
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
texture he says but what i can do that
 

1159
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,870
texture he says but what i can do that
you can't if you're not a physicist i

1160
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
you can't if you're not a physicist i
 

1161
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,110
you can't if you're not a physicist i
can look more deeply and understand

1162
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
can look more deeply and understand
 

1163
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,950
can look more deeply and understand
where the red comes from where the aroma

1164
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
where the red comes from where the aroma
 

1165
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,390
where the red comes from where the aroma
comes from where the structure comes

1166
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
comes from where the structure comes
 

1167
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,110
comes from where the structure comes
from he says that only

1168
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
from he says that only
 

1169
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,470
from he says that only
augments

1170
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
augments
 

1171
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,750
augments
my wonder it only augments my experience

1172
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
my wonder it only augments my experience
 

1173
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,230
my wonder it only augments my experience
it doesn't flatten it or take away from

1174
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
it doesn't flatten it or take away from
 

1175
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,310
it doesn't flatten it or take away from
it so

1176
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
it so
 

1177
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,909
it so
yeah well i sort of take that as a bit

1178
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
yeah well i sort of take that as a bit
 

1179
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,029
yeah well i sort of take that as a bit
of a

1180
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039
of a
 

1181
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,149
of a
of a motto in some sense that that there

1182
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:40,159
of a motto in some sense that that there
 

1183
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,190
of a motto in some sense that that there
is a wonder that comes from a kind of

1184
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
is a wonder that comes from a kind of
 

1185
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,549
is a wonder that comes from a kind of
ignorance and i don't mean that in a

1186
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
ignorance and i don't mean that in a
 

1187
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,470
ignorance and i don't mean that in a
derogatory sense but just from not

1188
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
derogatory sense but just from not
 

1189
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,549
derogatory sense but just from not
knowing so there is a wonder that comes

1190
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
knowing so there is a wonder that comes
 

1191
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,630
knowing so there is a wonder that comes
from mystery there's another kind of

1192
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
from mystery there's another kind of
 

1193
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,350
from mystery there's another kind of
wonder that comes from knowing

1194
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
wonder that comes from knowing
 

1195
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,630
wonder that comes from knowing
and and and deep knowing and i think

1196
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
and and and deep knowing and i think
 

1197
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,350
and and and deep knowing and i think
that kind of wonder has its own

1198
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
that kind of wonder has its own
 

1199
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,830
that kind of wonder has its own
special character that in some ways can

1200
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
special character that in some ways can
 

1201
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,549
special character that in some ways can
be more gratifying

1202
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
be more gratifying
 

1203
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,029
be more gratifying
i hope he's right i hope you're right

1204
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
i hope he's right i hope you're right
 

1205
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,510
i hope he's right i hope you're right
and but there's also i remember he

1206
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
and but there's also i remember he
 

1207
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,669
and but there's also i remember he
he said something about like an

1208
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
he said something about like an
 

1209
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,430
he said something about like an
like science is an onion or something

1210
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
like science is an onion or something
 

1211
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,350
like science is an onion or something
like that you can peel back you can keep

1212
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
like that you can peel back you can keep
 

1213
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,950
like that you can peel back you can keep
it keep peeling back i mean there is

1214
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
it keep peeling back i mean there is
 

1215
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,149
it keep peeling back i mean there is
also

1216
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
also
 

1217
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,669
also
when you understand something there's

1218
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
when you understand something there's
 

1219
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,909
when you understand something there's
always a sense that there's more mystery

1220
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
always a sense that there's more mystery
 

1221
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,190
always a sense that there's more mystery
to understand

1222
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
to understand
 

1223
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,990
to understand
like you never get to the bottom of the

1224
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
like you never get to the bottom of the
 

1225
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,070
like you never get to the bottom of the
mystery but i think it's also different

1226
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
mystery but i think it's also different
 

1227
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,590
mystery but i think it's also different
than you know

1228

than you know
 

1229
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,230

00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
magician right the magician you know
 

1233
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,990
magician right the magician you know
does some trick you learn how it sounds

1234
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000

like oh my god that was that's
 

1237
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,110

it's very possible then say in physics

1272
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
it's very possible then say in physics
 

1273
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,270
it's very possible then say in physics

it's possible that
that understanding is only going to

thing yeah i think it will i think it

1290
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
thing yeah i think it will i think it
 

1291
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,789
thing yeah i think it will i think it
will i think it has it has so far

1292
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
will i think it has it has so far
 

1293
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,470
will i think it has it has so far
but the other side of it which you which

1294
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
but the other side of it which you which
 

1295
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,149
but the other side of it which you which
you emphasize is

1296
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
you emphasize is
 

1297
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,590
you emphasize is
it's not like science somehow

1298
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
it's not like science somehow

reaches an end right there are certain

1300
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
reaches an end right there are certain
 

1301
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,310
reaches an end right there are certain

categories of questions that do reach an
 

1303
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,630
categories of questions that do reach an
end i think we one day we'll close the

1304
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
end i think we one day we'll close the
 

1305
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,789
end i think we one day we'll close the
book on nature's ingredients and the

00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
book on nature's ingredients and the
 

1307
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,269

that maybe it goes on forever smaller

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
that maybe it goes on forever smaller
 

1311
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,029
that maybe it goes on forever smaller
and smaller maybe they're deeper and

1312
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
and smaller maybe they're deeper and
 

1313
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,789
and smaller maybe they're deeper and
deeper laws but i i don't think so i

1314
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
deeper laws but i i don't think so i
 

1315
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,310
deeper laws but i i don't think so i
think that there's going to be a

1316
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
think that there's going to be a
 

1317
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,669
think that there's going to be a
collection of ingredients in a

1318
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
collection of ingredients in a
 

1319
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,990
collection of ingredients in a
collection of basic laws that chapter

1320
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
collection of basic laws that chapter
 

1321
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,190
collection of basic laws that chapter
will close

1322
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
will close
 

1323
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,310
will close
but

1324
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
but
 

1325
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,549
but
it's one chapter now we take that

1326
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
it's one chapter now we take that
 

1327
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,029
it's one chapter now we take that
knowledge and we try to understand how

1328
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
knowledge and we try to understand how
 

1329
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,870
knowledge and we try to understand how
the world builds the structures that it

1330
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
the world builds the structures that it
 

1331
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,750
the world builds the structures that it
does you know from planets to people to

1332
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
does you know from planets to people to
 

1333
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,190
does you know from planets to people to
black holes

1334
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
black holes
 

1335
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,510
black holes
to the possibility of other universes

1336
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
to the possibility of other universes
 

1337
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,590
to the possibility of other universes
and every step of the way

1338
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
and every step of the way
 

1339
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,750
and every step of the way
the collection of questions that we

1340
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
the collection of questions that we
 

1341
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,149
the collection of questions that we
don't know the answer to only blossoms

1342
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
don't know the answer to only blossoms
 

1343
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,269
don't know the answer to only blossoms
and so

1344
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
and so
 

1345
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,350
and so
there's a there's a deep

1346
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,360
there's a there's a deep
 

1347
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,870
there's a there's a deep
sense of gratification from

1348
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
sense of gratification from
 

1349
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,310
sense of gratification from
understanding certain quantities of the

1350
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
understanding certain quantities of the
 

1351
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,110
understanding certain quantities of the
world but i would say that if you take a

1352
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
world but i would say that if you take a
 

1353
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,390
world but i would say that if you take a
ratio

1354
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
ratio
 

1355
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,269
ratio
of what we understand to the things that

1356
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
of what we understand to the things that
 

1357
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,510
of what we understand to the things that
we know that we don't yet understand

1358
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
we know that we don't yet understand
 

1359
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,430
we know that we don't yet understand
that ratio keeps getting smaller and

1360
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
that ratio keeps getting smaller and
 

1361
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,950
that ratio keeps getting smaller and
smaller because the things that we know

1362
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
smaller because the things that we know
 

1363
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,549
smaller because the things that we know
that we don't understand grows larger

1364
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
that we don't understand grows larger
 

1365
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,470
that we don't understand grows larger
and larger

1366
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:54,480
and larger
 

1367
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,549
and larger
do you have a hope that we solve that

1368
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
do you have a hope that we solve that
 

1369
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,549
do you have a hope that we solve that
theory of everything puzzle

1370
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
theory of everything puzzle
 

1371
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,789
theory of everything puzzle
in the next few decades so there's been

1372
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
in the next few decades so there's been
 

1373
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,669
in the next few decades so there's been
a bunch of attempts from string theory

1374
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
a bunch of attempts from string theory
 

1375
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,909
a bunch of attempts from string theory
to all kinds of attempts of trying to

1376
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
to all kinds of attempts of trying to
 

1377
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,990
to all kinds of attempts of trying to
solve quantum gravity or basically come

1378
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
solve quantum gravity or basically come
 

1379
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,149
solve quantum gravity or basically come
up with a theory for quantum gravity

1380
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
up with a theory for quantum gravity
 

1381
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,269
up with a theory for quantum gravity
there's a lot of uh complexities to this

1382
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
there's a lot of uh complexities to this
 

1383
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,070
there's a lot of uh complexities to this
one for experimental validation

1384
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
one for experimental validation
 

1385
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,909
one for experimental validation
you have to observe effects that are

1386
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
you have to observe effects that are
 

1387
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,230
you have to observe effects that are
very difficult to uh measure

1388
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
very difficult to uh measure
 

1389
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,830
very difficult to uh measure
so you have to build like that's like an

1390
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
so you have to build like that's like an
 

1391
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,510
so you have to build like that's like an
engineering challenge

1392
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
engineering challenge
 

1393
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,110
engineering challenge
and then there's the theory challenge

1394
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
and then there's the theory challenge
 

1395
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,789
and then there's the theory challenge
which is like

1396
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799
which is like
 

1397
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,029
which is like
it seems very difficult to connect the

1398
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
it seems very difficult to connect the
 

1399
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,830
it seems very difficult to connect the
laws of gravity to quantum mechanics do

1400
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:31,840
laws of gravity to quantum mechanics do
 

1401
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,909
laws of gravity to quantum mechanics do
you have a hope or are we

1402
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
you have a hope or are we
 

1403
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,789
you have a hope or are we
hopelessly stuck well i have to have to

1404
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
hopelessly stuck well i have to have to
 

1405
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,870
hopelessly stuck well i have to have to
have a hope i mean it's

1406
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
have a hope i mean it's
 

1407
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,789
have a hope i mean it's
in some sense but i devote at least part

1408
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799
in some sense but i devote at least part
 

1409
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,750
in some sense but i devote at least part
of my

1410
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,760
of my
 

1411
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,070
of my
professional life toward trying to make

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
professional life toward trying to make
 

1413
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,909
professional life toward trying to make
progress on i'm glad you use the phrase

1414
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
progress on i'm glad you use the phrase
 

1415
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,350
progress on i'm glad you use the phrase
quantum gravity

1416
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
quantum gravity
 

1417
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,110
quantum gravity
i'm not a great fan of the theory of

1418
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120
i'm not a great fan of the theory of
 

1419
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,350
i'm not a great fan of the theory of
everything phrase because

1420
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
everything phrase because
 

1421
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,190
everything phrase because
it does make other scientists feel like

1422
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
it does make other scientists feel like
 

1423
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,710
it does make other scientists feel like
if they're not working on this what are

1424
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
if they're not working on this what are
 

1425
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,549
if they're not working on this what are
they working on man's like you know

1426
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
they working on man's like you know
 

1427
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,510
they working on man's like you know
there's not much left when you're

1428
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
there's not much left when you're
 

1429
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,710
there's not much left when you're
talking about theory of everything

1430
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
talking about theory of everything
 

1431
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,549
talking about theory of everything
biology is just small d yeah right

1432
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
biology is just small d yeah right
 

1433
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,350
biology is just small d yeah right
exactly

1434
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
exactly
 

1435
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,590
exactly
yeah so so it is really trying to put

1436
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:03,600
yeah so so it is really trying to put
 

1437
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,070
yeah so so it is really trying to put
gravity and quantum mechanics together

1438
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,080
gravity and quantum mechanics together
 

1439
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,870
gravity and quantum mechanics together
and uh since i was a college kid i was

1440
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
and uh since i was a college kid i was
 

1441
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,950
and uh since i was a college kid i was
uh deeply fascinated with gravity

1442
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
uh deeply fascinated with gravity
 

1443
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,990
uh deeply fascinated with gravity
and as i learned quantum mechanics the

1444
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
and as i learned quantum mechanics the
 

1445
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,870
and as i learned quantum mechanics the
the notion of physicists being stumped

1446
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
the notion of physicists being stumped
 

1447
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,630
the notion of physicists being stumped
and trying to blend them together how

1448
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
and trying to blend them together how
 

1449
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,430
and trying to blend them together how
could one not get fired up about maybe

1450
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
could one not get fired up about maybe
 

1451
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,830
could one not get fired up about maybe
contributing something to that journey

1452
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
contributing something to that journey
 

1453
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,590
contributing something to that journey
and so we've been on this you know i've

1454
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
and so we've been on this you know i've
 

1455
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,350
and so we've been on this you know i've
been on this for 30 years since i was a

1456
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
been on this for 30 years since i was a
 

1457
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,669
been on this for 30 years since i was a
student we we have made progress

1458
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679
student we we have made progress
 

1459
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,510
student we we have made progress
we do have ideas you mentioned strength

1460
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
we do have ideas you mentioned strength
 

1461
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,630
we do have ideas you mentioned strength
theory is one possible scenario it's not

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,350
made progress on this issue of
experimental verification validation

1474
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
experimental verification validation
 

1475
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,789
experimental verification validation
which as you know it is a vital part of

1476
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
which as you know it is a vital part of
 

1477
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,110
which as you know it is a vital part of
the story so i would have hoped that by

1478
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
the story so i would have hoped that by
 

1479
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,750
the story so i would have hoped that by
now we would have made contact with

1480
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,760
now we would have made contact with
 

1481
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,950
now we would have made contact with
observation if you would have

1482
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
observation if you would have
 

1483
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,830
observation if you would have
interviewed me back in the 80s when i

1484
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
interviewed me back in the 80s when i
 

1485
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,789
interviewed me back in the 80s when i
was you know a wild bright-eyed kid

1486
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:04,799
was you know a wild bright-eyed kid
 

1487
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,710
was you know a wild bright-eyed kid
trying to make headway working 18 hours

1488
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
trying to make headway working 18 hours
 

1489
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,990
trying to make headway working 18 hours
a day on this sort of stuff i would have

1490
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
a day on this sort of stuff i would have
 

1491
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,710
a day on this sort of stuff i would have
said yeah by by 2021 yeah we're gonna

1492
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
said yeah by by 2021 yeah we're gonna
 

1493
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,230
said yeah by by 2021 yeah we're gonna
know whether it's right or wrong we'll

1494
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
know whether it's right or wrong we'll
 

1495
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,149
know whether it's right or wrong we'll
make contact i would have said look

1496
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
make contact i would have said look
 

1497
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,430
make contact i would have said look
there may be certain mathematical

1498
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,440
there may be certain mathematical
 

1499
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,110
there may be certain mathematical
puzzles that we've got to work out but

1500
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
puzzles that we've got to work out but
 

1501
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,870
puzzles that we've got to work out but
we'll know enough to make contact with

1502
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
we'll know enough to make contact with
 

1503
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,430
we'll know enough to make contact with
experiment that has not happened

1504
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
experiment that has not happened
 

1505
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,950
experiment that has not happened
on the other hand if you would have

1506
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
on the other hand if you would have
 

1507
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,190
on the other hand if you would have
interviewed me back then and asked me

1508
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
interviewed me back then and asked me
 

1509
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,830
interviewed me back then and asked me
will we be able to talk about

1510
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
will we be able to talk about
 

1511
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,190
will we be able to talk about
detailed qualities of black holes and

1512
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,200
detailed qualities of black holes and
 

1513
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,070
detailed qualities of black holes and
understand them at the uh the level of

1514
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
understand them at the uh the level of
 

1515
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,110
understand them at the uh the level of
detail that we actually i i would have

1516
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
detail that we actually i i would have
 

1517
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,710
detail that we actually i i would have
said no i i don't think that we're going

1518
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:38,720
said no i i don't think that we're going
 

1519
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,870
said no i i don't think that we're going
to be able to do that will we have a

1520
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
to be able to do that will we have a
 

1521
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,710
to be able to do that will we have a
an exact formulation of strength here in

1522
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:42,720
an exact formulation of strength here in
 

1523
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,389
an exact formulation of strength here in
certain circumstances no i don't think

1524
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:44,399
certain circumstances no i don't think
 

1525
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,470
certain circumstances no i don't think
we're going to have that and yet we do

1526
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
we're going to have that and yet we do
 

1527
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,990
we're going to have that and yet we do
so it's just to say you don't know where

1528
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
so it's just to say you don't know where
 

1529
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,750
so it's just to say you don't know where
the progress is going to happen but yes

1530
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:51,760
the progress is going to happen but yes
 

1531
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,909
the progress is going to happen but yes
i do hold out hope that

1532
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
i do hold out hope that
 

1533
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,909
i do hold out hope that
maybe before i move on

1534
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
maybe before i move on
 

1535
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,590
maybe before i move on
to wherever i don't think there is an

1536
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
to wherever i don't think there is an
 

1537
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,630
to wherever i don't think there is an
after but i i would love before i

1538
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
after but i i would love before i
 

1539
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,070
after but i i would love before i
leave this earth to to know the answer

1540
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
leave this earth to to know the answer
 

1541
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,870
leave this earth to to know the answer
but

1542
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
but
 

1543
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,029
but
you know science and the universe it's

1544
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
you know science and the universe it's
 

1545
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,230
you know science and the universe it's
not about

1546
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
not about
 

1547
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,510
not about
pleasing any individual it is what it is

1548
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
pleasing any individual it is what it is
 

1549
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,669
pleasing any individual it is what it is
and so we just press onward and we'll

1550
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
and so we just press onward and we'll
 

1551
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,070
and so we just press onward and we'll
see where it goes so in terms of string

1552
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
see where it goes so in terms of string
 

1553
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,950
see where it goes so in terms of string

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
popular for for a few decades but has
 

1565
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,870

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,149
recently fallen out of favor or at least
there's been like

00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,159
there's been like
 

1569
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,470
there's been like
you know it became more popular to kind

1570
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,480
you know it became more popular to kind

of

1572
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
of
 

1573
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,710
of
ask the question

1574
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:36,720
ask the question
 

1575
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,269
ask the question
is string theory really the answer

1576
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
is string theory really the answer
 

1577
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,350
is string theory really the answer
where do you fall on this like how do

1578
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,360
where do you fall on this like how do
 

1579
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,510
where do you fall on this like how do
you make sense of this puzzle why do you

1580
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,520
you make sense of this puzzle why do you
 

1581
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,669
you make sense of this puzzle why do you
think it has fallen out of favor yeah so

1582
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:45,679
think it has fallen out of favor yeah so
 

1583
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,430
think it has fallen out of favor yeah so
i don't i would actually challenge the

1584
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
i don't i would actually challenge the
 

1585
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,070
i don't i would actually challenge the
statement that's fallen out of favor

1586
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,080
statement that's fallen out of favor
 

1587
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,830
statement that's fallen out of favor
i would say that

1588
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
i would say that
 

1589
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,029
i would say that
any

1590
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039
any

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
has yet seen on that block yeah it's
 

1597
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,870
has yet seen on that block yeah it's
going to attract attention

1598
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
going to attract attention
 

1599
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,909

now at the same time you also need to
judge whether it makes contact with

1630
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
judge whether it makes contact with
 

1631
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,710
judge whether it makes contact with
experiment as we discussed before too

1632
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:42,720
experiment as we discussed before too
 

1633
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,029
experiment as we discussed before too
and on that measure we're still

1634
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
and on that measure we're still
 

1635
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,710
and on that measure we're still
challenged so

1636
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720
challenged so
 

1637
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,070
challenged so
i would say that

1638
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
i would say that
 

1639
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,950
i would say that
many strengthers myself included

1640
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
many strengthers myself included

it has the tremendous progress that it

1644
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:57,279
it has the tremendous progress that it
 

1645
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,590
it has the tremendous progress that it
had 30 40 years ago that hasn't gone

had 30 40 years ago that hasn't gone
 

1647
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,070
had 30 40 years ago that hasn't gone
away but we've become

00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
away but we've become
 

1649
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,269
away but we've become
better equipped at assessing

00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
better equipped at assessing
 

1651
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,830
better equipped at assessing
the long journey ahead and that was

1652
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
the long journey ahead and that was
 

1653
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,669
the long journey ahead and that was
something that we weren't particularly

1654
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:09,679
something that we weren't particularly
 

1655

that will bring this chapter to a close
now i have to say i think it was more

1670
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
now i have to say i think it was more
 

1671

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,190
the younger physicists who were saying
that some of the more seasoned even if

1674
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
that some of the more seasoned even if

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,750
i don't know if they were rolling their

1681
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,230

to be a long long journey i think people

1682
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
to be a long long journey i think people
 

1683
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,070
to be a long long journey i think people

i think they knew that we were in for a

1696
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
i think they knew that we were in for a
 

1697
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,789
i think they knew that we were in for a
long haul

00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:58,799
long haul
 

1699
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,750
long haul
and and that's the nature of science

1700
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
and and that's the nature of science
 

1701
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,230

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,110
disappointed and i think there were
people who were disappointed and moved

people who were disappointed and moved
 

1721
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,310
people who were disappointed and moved
on and work on other subjects if we were

on and work on other subjects if we were

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,190
on and work on other subjects if we were
in in the way that einstein was in

where
what the answers to the deep questions

what the answers to the deep questions
 

1733
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,070
what the answers to the deep questions
would be then i think string theory has

1734
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
would be then i think string theory has
 

1735
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,750
would be then i think string theory has
been a rich source of material that has

1736
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:35,760
been a rich source of material that has

been a rich source of material that has

the frontier forward there's a few

1742
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:41,679
the frontier forward there's a few
 

1743
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,990
the frontier forward there's a few
qualities about string theory which are

1744
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
qualities about string theory which are
 

1745
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,950
qualities about string theory which are
weird

1746
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:44,960
weird
 

1747
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,750
weird
i mean a lot of physics is just weird

1748
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
i mean a lot of physics is just weird
 

1749
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,070
i mean a lot of physics is just weird
and beautiful so let me ask the question

1750
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,080
and beautiful so let me ask the question
 

1751
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,230
and beautiful so let me ask the question
what do you as most beautiful about

1752
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,240
what do you as most beautiful about
 

1753
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,269
what do you as most beautiful about
string theory well but what attracted me

1754
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:55,279
string theory well but what attracted me
 

1755
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,830
string theory well but what attracted me
to the theory at the outset

1756
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
to the theory at the outset
 

1757
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,990
to the theory at the outset

mechanics together which i think is um

1760
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320
mechanics together which i think is um

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,549

it's true claim to fame at least on

1762
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
it's true claim to fame at least on
 

1763
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,549
it's true claim to fame at least on
paper it's able to do that

what attracted me to here was the fact

1766
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
what attracted me to here was the fact
 

1767
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,750
what attracted me to here was the fact
that it requires extra dimensions of

1768
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
that it requires extra dimensions of
 

1769
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,029
that it requires extra dimensions of
space

1770
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
space
 

1771
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,269
space
and this was an idea that intrigued me

1772
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:15,279
and this was an idea that intrigued me
 

1773
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,310
and this was an idea that intrigued me
in a very deep way even before i really

1774
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,320
in a very deep way even before i really
 

1775
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,470
in a very deep way even before i really
understood what it meant

1776
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
understood what it meant
 

1777
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,909
understood what it meant
i somehow

i somehow
 

1779
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,990
i somehow
had i mean talk about sort of the

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
had i mean talk about sort of the
 

1781
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,750
had i mean talk about sort of the
emotional part of consciousness and the

1782
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
emotional part of consciousness and the
 

1783
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,710
emotional part of consciousness and the
cognitive part in some perhaps you call

1784
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
cognitive part in some perhaps you call
 

1785
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,830
cognitive part in some perhaps you call
it strange in some strange emotional way

time before i really knew what it meant

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
time before i really knew what it meant
 

1793
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,590

it just spoke to me i don't know how

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
it just spoke to me i don't know how
 

1795

and then

1798
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:44,399
and then
 

1799
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,350
and then
when i subsequently learned that people

1800
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
when i subsequently learned that people
 

1801
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,110
when i subsequently learned that people
had thought about more dimensions of

that allows you to
 

1883
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,950
that allows you to
sort of come up with tricks to describe

sort of come up with tricks to describe

you would
 

1901
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,470
you would
say that the three space dimensions

say that the three space dimensions
 

1903

and it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean
 

1963
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,430
and it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean
it won't happen

it won't happen
 

1965
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,349
it won't happen
but that would be

00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:43,359
but that would be
 

1967
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,349
but that would be
a stunning moment in the history of the

one real concrete way that you could

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,990
one real concrete way that you could
find evidence for extra dimensions but

2050
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,000
find evidence for extra dimensions but
 

2051
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,829
find evidence for extra dimensions but
yeah since extra dimensions are of space

2052
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
yeah since extra dimensions are of space
 

2053
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,390
yeah since extra dimensions are of space
and gravity is something that

of the extra dimensions if you had
 

2065
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,829
of the extra dimensions if you had

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,589
related to string theory do you think
they will be do you think you have to

they will be do you think you have to
have experimental validation or can a

have experimental validation or can a

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,870
yeah it certainly as a matter of

so

the mathematics of it but the actual

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,430
the mathematics of it but the actual
detection of it you know the higgs

2116
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
detection of it you know the higgs

you know it was an idea that came from

2120
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
you know it was an idea that came from
 

2121
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,150
you know it was an idea that came from
the 1960s peter higgs and others in fact

2122
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
the 1960s peter higgs and others in fact
 

2123
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,230
the 1960s peter higgs and others in fact
and it wasn't until

2124
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,240
and it wasn't until
 

2125
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,589
and it wasn't until
2012

2126
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:39,599
2012
 

2127
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,470
2012
on july 4th when the announcement came

2128
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,480
on july 4th when the announcement came
 

2129
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,150
on july 4th when the announcement came
that this protocol had been detected the

2130
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
that this protocol had been detected the
 

2131
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,109
that this protocol had been detected the
large hadron collider that people viewed

2132
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
large hadron collider that people viewed
 

2133
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,190
large hadron collider that people viewed
it as eligible for the nobel prize the

2134
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,200
it as eligible for the nobel prize the
 

2135
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,710
it as eligible for the nobel prize the
idea was there the math was there but

2136
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
idea was there the math was there but
 

2137
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,910
idea was there the math was there but
you needed to

2138
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:51,920
you needed to
 

2139
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,470
you needed to
confirm it indeed the prize ultimately

2140
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,480
confirm it indeed the prize ultimately
 

2141
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,790
confirm it indeed the prize ultimately
was awarded so i'm not surprised

2142
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:56,800
was awarded so i'm not surprised
 

2143
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,910
was awarded so i'm not surprised
in fact i would have been surprised if a

2144
00:38:59,910 --> 00:38:59,920
in fact i would have been surprised if a
 

2145
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,310
in fact i would have been surprised if a
nobel prize had been awarded in the

2146
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
nobel prize had been awarded in the
 

2147
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,030
nobel prize had been awarded in the
arena of string theory because it's far

2148
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,040
arena of string theory because it's far
 

2149
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,910
arena of string theory because it's far
too

2150
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:05,920
too
 

2151
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,990
too
speculative right now it's far too

2152
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,000
speculative right now it's far too
 

2153
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,230
speculative right now it's far too
hypothetical in fact

2154
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,240
hypothetical in fact
 

2155
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,109
hypothetical in fact
i am sympathetic to the view

2156
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:13,119
i am sympathetic to the view
 

2157
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,470
i am sympathetic to the view
that it really shouldn't be called

2158
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,480
that it really shouldn't be called
 

2159
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,430
that it really shouldn't be called
string theory it degrades the word

2160
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:17,440
string theory it degrades the word
 

2161
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,550
string theory it degrades the word
theory

2162
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
theory
 

2163
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,790
theory
because theory in science of course

2164
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
because theory in science of course
 

2165
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,750
because theory in science of course
means the best available explanation for

2166
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,760
means the best available explanation for
 

2167
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,750
means the best available explanation for
the things that we observe in the world

2168
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
the things that we observe in the world
 

2169
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,990
the things that we observe in the world
the things that we measure in

2170
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,000
the things that we measure in
 

2171
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,710
the things that we measure in
experiments about the world

2172
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
experiments about the world
 

2173
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,510
experiments about the world
and string theory does not do that at

2174
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:33,520
and string theory does not do that at
 

2175
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,430
and string theory does not do that at
least not yet so it really should be

2176
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:35,440
least not yet so it really should be
 

2177
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,990
least not yet so it really should be
the string hypothesis right we're at an

2178
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000
the string hypothesis right we're at an
 

2179
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,390
the string hypothesis right we're at an
earlier stage of development

2180
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
earlier stage of development
 

2181
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,550
earlier stage of development
and that's not the kind of thing that

2182
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:42,560
and that's not the kind of thing that
 

2183
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,430
and that's not the kind of thing that
nobel prizes should be awarded for

2184
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,440
nobel prizes should be awarded for
 

2185
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,349
nobel prizes should be awarded for
what do you think about the critics out

2186
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359
what do you think about the critics out
 

2187
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,150
what do you think about the critics out
there peter white he's from colombia too

2188
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
there peter white he's from colombia too
 

2189
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,349
there peter white he's from colombia too
i think sabine hafenstadter

2190
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:53,359
i think sabine hafenstadter
 

2191
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,430
i think sabine hafenstadter
is that a healthy thing or should we

2192
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
is that a healthy thing or should we
 

2193
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,910
is that a healthy thing or should we
sort of focus on sort of the optimism of

2194
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:57,920
sort of focus on sort of the optimism of
 

2195
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,310
sort of focus on sort of the optimism of
of these hypotheses yeah

2196
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,320
of these hypotheses yeah
 

2197
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,069
of these hypotheses yeah
it's actually a good way that you frame

2198
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:02,079
it's actually a good way that you frame
 

2199
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:02,950
it's actually a good way that you frame
it

2200
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
it
 

2201
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,390
it
because

2202
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,400
because
 

2203
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,790
because
i'm always

2204
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
i'm always
 

2205
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,109
i'm always
somewhat repelled

2206
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
somewhat repelled
 

2207
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,790
somewhat repelled
by

2208
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:10,800
by
 

2209
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,630
by
views of the world

2210
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:12,640
views of the world
 

2211
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,870
views of the world
that start from the negative

2212
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:14,880
that start from the negative
 

2213
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,309
that start from the negative
try to cut down an idea try to say

2214
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:18,319
try to cut down an idea try to say
 

2215
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,270
try to cut down an idea try to say
that's the wrong way of thinking about

2216
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,280
that's the wrong way of thinking about
 

2217
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,190
that's the wrong way of thinking about
things and so on i'm

2218
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,200
things and so on i'm
 

2219
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,030
things and so on i'm
much more drawn maybe because i'm an

2220
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
much more drawn maybe because i'm an
 

2221
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,870
much more drawn maybe because i'm an
optimist i don't know i'm much more

2222
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,880
optimist i don't know i'm much more
 

2223
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,670
optimist i don't know i'm much more
drawn to those who go out into the world

2224
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:29,680
drawn to those who go out into the world
 

2225
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,470
drawn to those who go out into the world
with new ideas yeah and and don't try to

2226
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
with new ideas yeah and and don't try to
 

2227
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,309
with new ideas yeah and and don't try to
cut down one idea but rather present

2228
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:36,319
cut down one idea but rather present
 

2229
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,710
cut down one idea but rather present
another one that might be better

2230
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
another one that might be better
 

2231
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,030
another one that might be better
and so you make the first idea maybe

2232
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040
and so you make the first idea maybe
 

2233
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,670
and so you make the first idea maybe
strengthy irrelevant because you've come

2234
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
strengthy irrelevant because you've come
 

2235
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,109
strengthy irrelevant because you've come
up with the

2236
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
up with the
 

2237
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,510
up with the
better approach to the world

2238
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,520
better approach to the world
 

2239
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,910
better approach to the world
so do i think it's healthy look i think

2240
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:49,920
so do i think it's healthy look i think
 

2241
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,270
so do i think it's healthy look i think
having a wide

2242
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
having a wide
 

2243
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,550
having a wide
range of

2244
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
range of
 

2245
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,710
range of
views and perspectives is generally a

2246
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
views and perspectives is generally a
 

2247
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,390
views and perspectives is generally a
healthy thing

2248
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,400
healthy thing
 

2249
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,309
healthy thing
i think it's good to have

2250
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:58,319
i think it's good to have
 

2251
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,349
i think it's good to have
arguments within a subject in order that

2252
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:01,359
arguments within a subject in order that
 

2253
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,990
arguments within a subject in order that
you stay fresh and you stay focused on

2254
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,000
you stay fresh and you stay focused on
 

2255
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,109
you stay fresh and you stay focused on
the things

2256
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:05,119
the things
 

2257
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,829
the things
that matter but in the end of the day i

2258
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:07,839
that matter but in the end of the day i
 

2259
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,589
that matter but in the end of the day i
think it's a more

2260
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:09,599
think it's a more
 

2261
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,710
think it's a more
vital contribution to give us something

2262
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:12,720
vital contribution to give us something
 

2263
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,550
vital contribution to give us something
new rather than to criticize something

2264
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:14,560
new rather than to criticize something
 

2265
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,630
new rather than to criticize something
that's there yeah i'm totally with you

2266
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
that's there yeah i'm totally with you
 

2267
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,230
that's there yeah i'm totally with you
um but it could be just the nature of

2268
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
um but it could be just the nature of
 

2269
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,550
um but it could be just the nature of
being an optimist i and also just a

2270
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
being an optimist i and also just a
 

2271
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,349
being an optimist i and also just a
a love of engineering it's there's it it

2272
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:25,359
a love of engineering it's there's it it
 

2273
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,069
a love of engineering it's there's it it
helps nobody by criticizing

2274
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
helps nobody by criticizing
 

2275
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,990
helps nobody by criticizing
the uh the rocket that somebody else

2276
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,000
the uh the rocket that somebody else
 

2277
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,910
the uh the rocket that somebody else
built just build a

2278
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
built just build a
 

2279
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,190
built just build a
bigger cheaper better rocket

2280
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,200
bigger cheaper better rocket
 

2281
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,990
bigger cheaper better rocket
exactly yeah and that seems to be how uh

2282
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,000
exactly yeah and that seems to be how uh
 

2283
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,430
exactly yeah and that seems to be how uh
human civilization can progress

2284
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
human civilization can progress
 

2285
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,430
human civilization can progress
effectively

2286
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
effectively
 

2287
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,990
effectively
we we've uh mentioned the second law of

00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,000
we we've uh mentioned the second law of
 

2289
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,670
we we've uh mentioned the second law of
thermodynamics i got to ask you about

2290
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:45,680
thermodynamics i got to ask you about
 

2291
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,710
thermodynamics i got to ask you about
time

2292
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:46,720
time
 

2293
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,630
time
yeah and

2294
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
yeah and
 

2295
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,190
yeah and
do you do you think of time as emergent

2296
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,200
do you do you think of time as emergent
 

2297
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,910
do you do you think of time as emergent
or fundamental to our universe i like to

2298
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
or fundamental to our universe i like to
 

2299
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,910
or fundamental to our universe i like to
think of it as emergent

2300
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:55,920
think of it as emergent
 

2301
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,030
think of it as emergent
i don't

2302
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,040
i don't
 

2303
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,790
i don't
have a solid reason for that perspective

2304
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:00,800
have a solid reason for that perspective
 

2305
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,790
have a solid reason for that perspective
i have a lot of hints of reasons that

2306
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:02,800
i have a lot of hints of reasons that
 

2307
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,230
i have a lot of hints of reasons that
some of which come out of string theory

2308
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
some of which come out of string theory
 

2309
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,870
some of which come out of string theory
and quantum gravity that perhaps would

2310
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:06,880
and quantum gravity that perhaps would
 

2311
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,109
and quantum gravity that perhaps would
be worth talking about

2312
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119
be worth talking about
 

2313
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,910
be worth talking about
but what i would say is

2314
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
but what i would say is
 

2315
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,829
but what i would say is
time is

2316
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:13,839
time is
 

2317
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,870
time is
the most familiar quality of experience

2318
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:16,880
the most familiar quality of experience
 

2319
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,790
the most familiar quality of experience
because there's nothing that takes place

2320
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:18,800
because there's nothing that takes place
 

2321
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,870
because there's nothing that takes place
that doesn't take place within an

00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
that doesn't take place within an

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,349
that doesn't take place within an
interval of time and yet at the same

it is perhaps the most mysterious

it is perhaps the most mysterious

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,910
it is perhaps the most mysterious
quality of the world so it's a wonderful

it allows us the language for talking

it allows us the language for talking

it allows us to envision the events of

it allows us to envision the events of

the structure and the organization to

think about things in that kind of a
 

2363
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,510
think about things in that kind of a
progression but

2364
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:09,520
progression but
 

2365
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,190
progression but
what actually is it

2366
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200
what actually is it
 

2367
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,109
what actually is it
i i don't really know and that's so

2368
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:13,119
i i don't really know and that's so
 

2369
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,550
i i don't really know and that's so
strange because

2370
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,560
strange because
 

2371
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,910
strange because
we can measure it

2372
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:15,920
we can measure it
 

2373
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,990
we can measure it
right i mean there are laboratories in

2374
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,000
right i mean there are laboratories in
 

2375
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,630
right i mean there are laboratories in
the world that measure this thing called

00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,640
the world that measure this thing called

time to spectacular precision
 

2379
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,790
time to spectacular precision
but you know if you go up to the folks

2380
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:26,800
but you know if you go up to the folks
 

2381
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,390
but you know if you go up to the folks
and say like

2382
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:28,400
and say like
 

2383
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,390
and say like
what is it that you're actually

2384
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,400
what is it that you're actually
 

2385
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,750
what is it that you're actually
measuring

2386
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:31,760
measuring
 

2387
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,349
measuring
i don't know that they can really

2388
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
i don't know that they can really
 

2389
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,510
i don't know that they can really
articulate the kind of answer that you

2390
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:35,520
articulate the kind of answer that you
 

2391
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,030
articulate the kind of answer that you
would expect

2392
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
would expect
 

2393
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,190
would expect
from those who are engineering a device

2394
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
from those who are engineering a device
 

2395
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,270
from those who are engineering a device
that can measure something called time

2396
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
that can measure something called time
 

2397
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,030
that can measure something called time
to that level of precision

2398
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
to that level of precision
 

2399
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,870
to that level of precision
so it's a very curious combination

2400
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:46,880
so it's a very curious combination
 

2401
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,670
so it's a very curious combination
what do you make of the one-way

2402
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
what do you make of the one-way
 

2403
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,190
what do you make of the one-way
feeling of causality like is causality

2404
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,200
feeling of causality like is causality
 

2405
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,470
feeling of causality like is causality
a thing or is that too just a human

2406
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:56,480
a thing or is that too just a human

story
 

2409
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,589
story
that we put on top of this emerging

that we put on top of this emerging
phenomena of time i don't know

2412
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:01,839
phenomena of time i don't know
 

2413
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,829
phenomena of time i don't know
um i can give you my my guess and my

2414
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:03,839
um i can give you my my guess and my
 

2415
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,750
um i can give you my my guess and my
intuition about it

2416
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
intuition about it
 

2417
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,030
intuition about it
i do think that at the macroscopic level

2418
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:09,040
i do think that at the macroscopic level
 

2419
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,390
i do think that at the macroscopic level
if we're talking about sort of the human

2420
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
if we're talking about sort of the human
 

2421
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,750
if we're talking about sort of the human
experience of time i do think at the

2422
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
experience of time i do think at the
 

2423
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,190
experience of time i do think at the
macroscopic level there is a fundamental

2424
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
macroscopic level there is a fundamental
 

2425
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,950
macroscopic level there is a fundamental
notion of causality that does emerge

2426
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
notion of causality that does emerge
 

2427
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,550
notion of causality that does emerge
from a starting point that may not have

2428
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
from a starting point that may not have
 

2429
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,470
from a starting point that may not have
causality built in so i certainly would

2430
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:22,480
causality built in so i certainly would
 

2431
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,470
causality built in so i certainly would
allow that at the deepest

2432
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480
allow that at the deepest
 

2433
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,950
allow that at the deepest
description of reality when we finally

00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
description of reality when we finally
 

2435
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,790
description of reality when we finally
have that on the table

00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
have that on the table
 

2437
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,829
have that on the table
we may not see causality directly at

2438
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:31,839
we may not see causality directly at
 

2439
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,390
we may not see causality directly at
that fundamental level but i do believe

2440
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,400
that fundamental level but i do believe
 

2441
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,710
that fundamental level but i do believe
that we will understand how to go from

2442
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
that we will understand how to go from
 

2443
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,589
that we will understand how to go from
that fundamental level to a world where

2444
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
that fundamental level to a world where
 

2445
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,750
that fundamental level to a world where
at the macroscopic level there is this

2446
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,760
at the macroscopic level there is this
 

2447
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,309
at the macroscopic level there is this
notion of a causes b

2448
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:44,319
notion of a causes b
 

2449
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,510
notion of a causes b
a notion that einstein deeply embraced

2450
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
a notion that einstein deeply embraced
 

2451
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,030
a notion that einstein deeply embraced
in his special theory of relativity

2452
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,040
in his special theory of relativity
 

2453
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,670
in his special theory of relativity
where he showed that time has qualities

2454
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:51,680
where he showed that time has qualities
 

2455
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,190
where he showed that time has qualities
that we wouldn't expect based on

00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,200
that we wouldn't expect based on

to each other our clocks

2460
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,920
to each other our clocks
 

2461
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,910
to each other our clocks
tick off time at different rate and our

2462
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
tick off time at different rate and our
 

2463
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,550
tick off time at different rate and our
clocks is just a means of measuring this

2464
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
clocks is just a means of measuring this
 

2465
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,710
clocks is just a means of measuring this
thing called time so this is really time

2466
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
thing called time so this is really time
 

2467
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,630
thing called time so this is really time
that we're talking about time for you

2468
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:06,640
that we're talking about time for you
 

2469
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,230
that we're talking about time for you
and time for me are different if we're

2470
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,240
and time for me are different if we're
 

2471
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,069
and time for me are different if we're
in relative motion he then shows in the

00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:10,079
in relative motion he then shows in the
 

2473
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,309
in relative motion he then shows in the
general theory of relativity that if

2474
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:12,319
general theory of relativity that if
 

2475
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,870
general theory of relativity that if
we're experiencing different gravity

we're experiencing different gravity
 

2477
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,230
we're experiencing different gravity
different gravitational fields or

2478
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:16,240
different gravitational fields or
 

2479
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,349
different gravitational fields or
actually more precisely different

2480
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:17,359
actually more precisely different
 

2481
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,190
actually more precisely different

time will elapse for us at different
 

2485
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,069
time will elapse for us at different
rates these are things that are

2486
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079
rates these are things that are
 

2487
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,510
rates these are things that are
astoundingly strange that give rise to a

2488
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:27,520
astoundingly strange that give rise to a
 

2489
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,910
astoundingly strange that give rise to a
scientific notion of time travel okay so

2490
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920
scientific notion of time travel okay so
 

2491
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,349
scientific notion of time travel okay so
this is this is how far einstein took us

2492
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359
this is this is how far einstein took us
 

2493
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,550
this is this is how far einstein took us
in

2494
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,560
in
 

2495
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,630
in
wiping away the old understanding of

2496
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:36,640
wiping away the old understanding of
 

2497
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,190
wiping away the old understanding of
time and injecting a new understanding

2498
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,200
time and injecting a new understanding
 

2499
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,829
time and injecting a new understanding
of its qualities so so there's so much

2500
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:41,839
of its qualities so so there's so much
 

2501
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,390
of its qualities so so there's so much
about time that's counterintuitive

2502
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:44,400
about time that's counterintuitive
 

2503
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,630
about time that's counterintuitive
but i do not think that we're ever going

2504
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:46,640
but i do not think that we're ever going
 

2505
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,270
but i do not think that we're ever going
to wipe away causality at the

2506
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:49,280
to wipe away causality at the
 

2507
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,109
to wipe away causality at the
macroscopic at the microscope i mean

2508
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:51,119
macroscopic at the microscope i mean
 

2509
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,550
macroscopic at the microscope i mean
there's so many interesting things at

2510
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
there's so many interesting things at
 

2511
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,470
there's so many interesting things at
the macroscopic level that may only

2512
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480
the macroscopic level that may only
 

2513
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,430
the macroscopic level that may only
exist at the microscopic level yeah like

2514
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,440
exist at the microscopic level yeah like
 

2515
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,030
exist at the microscopic level yeah like
we already talked about consciousness

2516
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,040
we already talked about consciousness
 

2517
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,550
we already talked about consciousness
that that very well could be one of the

2518
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,560
that that very well could be one of the
 

2519
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,349
that that very well could be one of the
things you mentioned time travel so

2520
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:03,359
things you mentioned time travel so
 

2521
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,309
things you mentioned time travel so
um

2522
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319
um
 

2523
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,870
um
i mean according to einstein

2524
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
i mean according to einstein
 

2525
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,589
i mean according to einstein
and

2526
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:07,599
and
 

2527
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,109
and
in general

2528
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:09,119
in general
 

2529
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:09,990
in general
what

2530
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,000
what
 

2531
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,069
what
types of travel do you think our

2532
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
types of travel do you think our
 

2533
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,309
types of travel do you think our
physical universe allows well certainly

2534
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
physical universe allows well certainly
 

2535
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,589
physical universe allows well certainly
allows

2536
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:15,599
allows
 

2537
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,349
allows
time travel to the future and i'm not

2538
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:17,359
time travel to the future and i'm not
 

2539
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,349
time travel to the future and i'm not
talking about the silly thing that you

2540
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359
talking about the silly thing that you
 

2541
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,270
talking about the silly thing that you
and i are now going into the future

2542
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
and i are now going into the future
 

2543
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,790
and i are now going into the future
second by second second i'm talking

2544
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:22,800
second by second second i'm talking
 

2545
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,510
second by second second i'm talking
about really the diversion that you see

2546
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,520
about really the diversion that you see
 

2547
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,230
about really the diversion that you see
in hollywood at least in terms of its

2548
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,240
in hollywood at least in terms of its
 

2549
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,309
in hollywood at least in terms of its

an individual
 

2553
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,870
an individual
can follow an einsteinian

2554
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880
can follow an einsteinian
 

2555
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,390
can follow an einsteinian
strategy

2556
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:36,400
strategy
 

2557
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,349
strategy
and

2558
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:37,359
and
 

2559
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,190
and
propel themselves

00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
propel themselves
 

2561
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,349

00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
turn to guys you know who know how to
 

2575
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,069
turn to guys you know who know how to
build stuff i can't do it like you build

2576
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:58,079
build stuff i can't do it like you build
 

2577
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,829
build stuff i can't do it like you build
a ship that can go out into the universe

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,109
you're essentially traveling forward in

uh what about traveling back in time

2674
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
uh what about traveling back in time
 

2675
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,510
uh what about traveling back in time
yeah that's the um

2676
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:39,520
yeah that's the um
 

2677
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,829
yeah that's the um
that is a natural next question

2678
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:41,839
that is a natural next question
 

2679
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,150
that is a natural next question
especially if you uh if you're doing if

2680
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
especially if you uh if you're doing if
 

2681
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,589
especially if you uh if you're doing if
you're going on one of these journeys is

2682
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:45,599
you're going on one of these journeys is
 

2683
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,270
you're going on one of these journeys is
it a one-way journey yeah can you can

2684
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
it a one-way journey yeah can you can
 

2685
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,790
it a one-way journey yeah can you can
you come back

2686
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:48,800
you come back
 

2687
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,470
you come back
and

2688
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:50,480
and
 

2689
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,549
and
the physics community doesn't speak with

2690
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:52,559
the physics community doesn't speak with
 

2691
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,349
the physics community doesn't speak with
a unified voice on this as yet but i

2692
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:55,359
a unified voice on this as yet but i
 

2693
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,750
a unified voice on this as yet but i
would say that the dominant perspective

2694
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
would say that the dominant perspective
 

2695
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,150
would say that the dominant perspective
is that you cannot get back

2696
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,160
is that you cannot get back
 

2697
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,750
is that you cannot get back
now having said that there are proposals

2698
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:03,760
now having said that there are proposals

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,230
could travel to the past and
we've seen some of these again hollywood

00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
we've seen some of these again hollywood

this idea of a wormhole like jody foster

2714
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200
this idea of a wormhole like jody foster
 

2715
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,349
this idea of a wormhole like jody foster
and contact went through a wormhole

2716
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
and contact went through a wormhole
 

2717
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,790
and contact went through a wormhole
deep space nine star i'm sure there are

00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:26,800
deep space nine star i'm sure there are
 

2719
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,470
deep space nine star i'm sure there are
many other examples where these ideas

2720
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
many other examples where these ideas
 

2721
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,390
many other examples where these ideas
that i've probably never even seen

that i've probably never even seen
 

2723
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,190
that i've probably never even seen
but with wormholes there's at least a

2724
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,200
but with wormholes there's at least a
 

2725
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,990
but with wormholes there's at least a
proposal of how you could take a

2726
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:36,000
proposal of how you could take a
 

2727
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,150
proposal of how you could take a
wormhole tunnel through space-time

2728

wormhole tunnel through space-time
 

2729

00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
relative to each other which would mean
 

2737
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,190
relative to each other which would mean
one's ahead and one's behind which means

2738

one's ahead and one's behind which means
 

2739
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,470
one's ahead and one's behind which means
if you go through one direction you

if you go through one direction you

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,390
if you go through one direction you
travel to the future if you go back you

now
 

2747
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,069
now
we don't know if there are wormholes

00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
we don't know if there are wormholes

we don't know if there are wormholes
possible according to einstein correct

they are possible according to einstein
 

2753
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,309
they are possible according to einstein
but even einstein was very quick to say

2754
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
but even einstein was very quick to say
 

2755
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,470
but even einstein was very quick to say
just because my math allows for

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,230
just because my math allows for
something doesn't mean it's real and he

2758
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:08,240
something doesn't mean it's real and he
 

2759
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,670
something doesn't mean it's real and he
famously didn't even believe in black

2760
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:09,680
famously didn't even believe in black
 

2761
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,510
famously didn't even believe in black
holes yeah didn't believe in the big

2762
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:11,520
holes yeah didn't believe in the big
 

2763
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,870
holes yeah didn't believe in the big
bang right and yet the big the the black

2764
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
bang right and yet the big the the black
 

2765
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,950
bang right and yet the big the the black
hole issue has really been settled now

2766
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:16,960
hole issue has really been settled now
 

2767
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,910
hole issue has really been settled now
we have

2768
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
we have
 

2769
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,950
we have
radio telescopic photographs of the

2770
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:20,960
radio telescopic photographs of the
 

2771
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,150
radio telescopic photographs of the
black hole in m87 who's in newspapers

2772
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,160
black hole in m87 who's in newspapers
 

2773
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,910
black hole in m87 who's in newspapers
around the world just a couple of years

2774
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:25,920
around the world just a couple of years
 

2775
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,030
around the world just a couple of years
ago so

2776
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:27,040
ago so
 

2777
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,950
ago so
so it's just to say that just because

2778
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:28,960
so it's just to say that just because
 

2779
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,349
so it's just to say that just because
it's in einstein's math um it doesn't

2780
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:31,359
it's in einstein's math um it doesn't
 

2781
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,589
it's in einstein's math um it doesn't
mean it's real but yes it is the case

2782
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
mean it's real but yes it is the case
 

2783
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,990
mean it's real but yes it is the case
that wormholes are allowed by einstein's

2784
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,000
that wormholes are allowed by einstein's
 

2785
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,990
that wormholes are allowed by einstein's
equations and in principle

2786
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:38,000
equations and in principle
 

2787
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,589

you can imagine you know putting

00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
you can imagine you know putting
 

2789
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,670
you can imagine you know putting
electric charges on the openings of the

2790
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:41,680
electric charges on the openings of the
 

2791
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,230
electric charges on the openings of the
wormhole allowing you to toe them around

2792
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
wormhole allowing you to toe them around
 

2793
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,069
wormhole allowing you to toe them around
in a manner that could yield this

2794
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:46,079
in a manner that could yield this
 

2795
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,230
in a manner that could yield this
temporal asymmetry between them maybe

2796
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,240
temporal asymmetry between them maybe
 

2797
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,390

00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:50,400
you toe one of the mouths to the edge of
 

2799
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,710
you toe one of the mouths to the edge of
a black hole in principle you can do

2800
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:52,720
a black hole in principle you can do
 

2801
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,430
a black hole in principle you can do
this slowing down the passage of time

2802
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
this slowing down the passage of time
 

2803
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,190
this slowing down the passage of time
near that black hole and then when you

2804
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,200
near that black hole and then when you
 

2805
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,990
near that black hole and then when you
bring it back it will be well out of

2806
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,000
bring it back it will be well out of
 

2807
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,069
bring it back it will be well out of
sync with the other opening and

2809
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,230

therefore could be a significant

00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
therefore could be a significant
 

2811
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,950
therefore could be a significant

wormhole open assuming it does exist
 

2819
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,349
wormhole open assuming it does exist
could you ever travel through a wormhole

2820
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:17,359
could you ever travel through a wormhole
 

2821
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,750
could you ever travel through a wormhole
or would there be a requirement of some

2822
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:19,760
or would there be a requirement of some
 

2823
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,790
or would there be a requirement of some
kind of exotic matter to prop it open

00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
kind of exotic matter to prop it open
 

2825
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,190
kind of exotic matter to prop it open
that perhaps doesn't exist so

00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
that perhaps doesn't exist so
 

2827
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,190
that perhaps doesn't exist so
there are many many issues that people

00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
there are many many issues that people
 

2829
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,109
there are many many issues that people
have raised and i would say that the

2830
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:29,119
have raised and i would say that the
 

2831
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,870

general sentiment
 

2833
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,950

uh
sorry to go crazy for a second but if

00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
sorry to go crazy for a second but if
 

2873
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,109
sorry to go crazy for a second but if
you have like the pan psychosome idea

you have like the pan psychosome idea
 

2875

00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,200
something like that in that view of the
 

2885
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,630
something like that in that view of the

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,390
understand that part maybe traveling is
super easy yeah

2890
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:28,400
super easy yeah

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,309
super easy yeah
it does not follow the constraints of

00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:33,839
something like this yeah so
 

2897
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,230
something like this yeah so
look i have i have a definite

look i have i have a definite

what we described earlier is just the

what we described earlier is just the

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,309
what we described earlier is just the

made the rock happy
 

2911
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,710
made the rock happy
exactly you know so so

2912
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:52,720
exactly you know so so
 

2913
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,030
exactly you know so so
it isn't the approach that

2914
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,040
it isn't the approach that
 

2915
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,910
it isn't the approach that
feels to me the the most likely but i i

00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:57,920
feels to me the the most likely but i i
 

2917
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,510
feels to me the the most likely but i i
see the logic

2918
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,520
see the logic
 

2919
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,470
see the logic
if you've got the puzzle how do mindless

2920
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
if you've got the puzzle how do mindless
 

2921
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,430
if you've got the puzzle how do mindless
particles build mind one resolution

2922
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:05,440
particles build mind one resolution
 

2923
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,150
particles build mind one resolution
might be the particles are not mindless

2924
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,160
might be the particles are not mindless
 

2925
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,430
might be the particles are not mindless
the particles have some kind of

2926
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,440
the particles have some kind of
 

2927
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,510
the particles have some kind of
proto-conscious quality so there's

2928
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:11,520
proto-conscious quality so there's
 

2929
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,349
proto-conscious quality so there's
there's something appealing about that

2930
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:13,359
there's something appealing about that
 

2931
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,069
there's something appealing about that
straightforward solution to the puzzle

2932
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
straightforward solution to the puzzle
 

2933
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,230
straightforward solution to the puzzle
and if that's the case if we do live in

2934
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:18,240
and if that's the case if we do live in
 

2935
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,030
and if that's the case if we do live in
a pan-psychist world where there's a

2936
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:21,040
a pan-psychist world where there's a
 

2937
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,030
a pan-psychist world where there's a
degree of consciousness residing in

2938
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
degree of consciousness residing in
 

2939
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,710
degree of consciousness residing in
everything in the world around us then

2940
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
everything in the world around us then
 

2941
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,549
everything in the world around us then
yes i do think some

2942
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:26,559
yes i do think some
 

2943
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,710
yes i do think some
interesting possibilities might emerge

2944
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:28,720
interesting possibilities might emerge
 

2945
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,670
interesting possibilities might emerge
where maybe there's a way of communing

2946
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:31,680
where maybe there's a way of communing
 

2947
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,230
where maybe there's a way of communing
with physical reality

2948
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:34,240
with physical reality
 

2949
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,790
with physical reality
in a in a deeper way than we have so far

2950
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:36,800
in a in a deeper way than we have so far
 

2951
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,430
in a in a deeper way than we have so far
i mean we as human beings a vital part

2952
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
i mean we as human beings a vital part
 

2953
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,910
i mean we as human beings a vital part
of our existence is human to human

2954
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:41,920
of our existence is human to human
 

2955
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,790
of our existence is human to human
communication contact we live in social

2956
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:44,800
communication contact we live in social
 

2957
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,390
communication contact we live in social
groups and that's what it's allowed us

2958
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,400
groups and that's what it's allowed us
 

2959
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,790
groups and that's what it's allowed us
to get to the place where we've gotten

2960
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:48,800
to get to the place where we've gotten
 

2961
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,910
to get to the place where we've gotten
imagine

2962
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:49,920
imagine
 

2963
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,390
imagine
that we have long missed that there's

2964
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
that we have long missed that there's
 

2965
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,030
that we have long missed that there's
other consciousness out there and some

2966
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,040
other consciousness out there and some
 

2967
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,510
other consciousness out there and some
kind of relationship or communion with

2968
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:57,520
kind of relationship or communion with
 

2969
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,990
kind of relationship or communion with
that larger conscious possibility would

2970
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
that larger conscious possibility would
 

2971
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,630
that larger conscious possibility would
take us to a different place now do i do

2972
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
take us to a different place now do i do
 

2973
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,630
take us to a different place now do i do
i buy into this yet i don't i don't see

2974
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:04,640
i buy into this yet i don't i don't see
 

2975
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,390
i buy into this yet i don't i don't see
any evidence for it

2976
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:06,400
any evidence for it
 

2977
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,950
any evidence for it
but do i have an open mind and allow for

2978
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:08,960
but do i have an open mind and allow for
 

2979
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,349
but do i have an open mind and allow for
the possibility in the future yeah i do

2980
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:13,359
the possibility in the future yeah i do
 

2981
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,750
the possibility in the future yeah i do
so if that's not the case and you have

2982
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
so if that's not the case and you have
 

2983
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,710
so if that's not the case and you have
these

2984
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:16,720
these
 

2985
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,069
these
simple particles that at the macro level

2986
00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:20,079
simple particles that at the macro level
 

2987
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,990
simple particles that at the macro level
emerges some interesting stuff like

2988
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,000
emerges some interesting stuff like
 

2989
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,390
emerges some interesting stuff like
consciousness another thing you write

2990
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:24,400
consciousness another thing you write
 

2991
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,270
consciousness another thing you write
about in the until the end of time book

2992
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:27,280
about in the until the end of time book
 

2993
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,910
about in the until the end of time book
is the the thing that seems to emerge at

2994
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:29,920
is the the thing that seems to emerge at
 

2995
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,390
is the the thing that seems to emerge at
the macro level is the feeling

2996
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:32,400
the macro level is the feeling
 

2997
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,790
the macro level is the feeling
like uh that like there's a free will

2998
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:34,800
like uh that like there's a free will
 

2999
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,710
like uh that like there's a free will
like we decide to do stuff and you have

3000
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
like we decide to do stuff and you have
 

3001
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,030
like we decide to do stuff and you have
a really interesting take here

3002
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,040
a really interesting take here
 

3003
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,510
a really interesting take here
which is

3004
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,520
which is
 

3005
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,589
which is
no there's not a free will i'm just

3006
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:43,599
no there's not a free will i'm just
 

3007
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:44,710
no there's not a free will i'm just
going to speak for you and then you

3008
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
going to speak for you and then you
 

3009
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,789
going to speak for you and then you
should correct me no there's not a free

3010
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:46,799
should correct me no there's not a free
 

3011
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:47,990
should correct me no there's not a free
will

3012
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
will
 

3013
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,589
will
but there is

3014
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:49,599
but there is
 

3015
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,710
but there is
an experience of freedom yeah

3016
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:52,720
an experience of freedom yeah
 

3017
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,069
an experience of freedom yeah
yeah

3018
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,079
yeah
 

3019
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,870
yeah
which i i really love so where does the

3020
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:56,880
which i i really love so where does the
 

3021
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,230
which i i really love so where does the
experience

3022
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
experience
 

3023
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,150
experience
where does freedom come from if we don't

3024
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
where does freedom come from if we don't
 

3025
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,630
where does freedom come from if we don't
have any kind of physics based free will

3026
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:02,640
have any kind of physics based free will
 

3027
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,750
have any kind of physics based free will
yeah and and so the idea

3028
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
yeah and and so the idea
 

3029
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,349
yeah and and so the idea
follows naturally from all that we've

3030
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359
follows naturally from all that we've
 

3031
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,950
follows naturally from all that we've
been talking about let's make the

3032
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:08,960
been talking about let's make the
 

3033
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,470
been talking about let's make the
assumption

3034
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:10,480
assumption
 

3035
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,470
assumption
that all there is in the physical

3036
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:12,480
that all there is in the physical
 

3037
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,349
that all there is in the physical
universe is stuff governed by laws we

3038
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:15,359
universe is stuff governed by laws we
 

3039
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,270
universe is stuff governed by laws we
may not have those laws may may not know

3040
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,280
may not have those laws may may not know
 

3041
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,430
may not have those laws may may not know
what the fundamental stuff is yet

3042
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
what the fundamental stuff is yet
 

3043
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,390
what the fundamental stuff is yet
but everything we know in science points

3044
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,400
but everything we know in science points
 

3045
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,309
but everything we know in science points
in the direction that it's physical

3046
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:24,319
in the direction that it's physical
 

3047
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,750
in the direction that it's physical
stuff governed by universal laws

3048
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:27,760
stuff governed by universal laws
 

3049
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,549
stuff governed by universal laws
and

3050
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
and
 

3051
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,549
and
that being the case or that being the

3052
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:30,559
that being the case or that being the
 

3053
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,030
that being the case or that being the
assumption then you come to a particular

3054
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:33,040
assumption then you come to a particular
 

3055
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,870
assumption then you come to a particular
collection of those ingredients called a

about and making decisions i mean all of
 

3247
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,710
about and making decisions i mean all of

that you can say it's

00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,910
that you can say it's
anthropomorphization but

um what what is that that emergence

3256
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,280
um what what is that that emergence
 

3257
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,950
um what what is that that emergence
thing is is that

3258
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:28,960
thing is is that
 

3259
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,470
thing is is that
within the realm of physics to

within the realm of physics to
 

3261
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,109
within the realm of physics to
understand is it uh

3262
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:33,119
understand is it uh
 

3263
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,430
understand is it uh
is it within the realm of poetry where

that ever be understood by science so

3270
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:41,599
that ever be understood by science so
 

3271
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,670
that ever be understood by science so
here's here's the way that i think about

3272
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:43,680
here's here's the way that i think about
 

3273
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,270
here's here's the way that i think about
it so there are

3274
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
it so there are
 

3275
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,069
it so there are
clearly qualities of the world that

3276
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,079
clearly qualities of the world that
 

3277
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,870
clearly qualities of the world that
emerge on macroscopic scales

3278
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:50,880
emerge on macroscopic scales
 

3279
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,670
emerge on macroscopic scales
our sense of beauty wonder consciousness

00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:53,680
our sense of beauty wonder consciousness
 

3281
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,829
our sense of beauty wonder consciousness
all these kinds of qualities

3282
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:55,839
all these kinds of qualities
 

3283
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,630
all these kinds of qualities
do i feel that they ultimately are

3284
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:58,640
do i feel that they ultimately are
 

3285
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,270
do i feel that they ultimately are
explainable from the laws of physics i

3288
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
do
 

3289
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,950
do
there is nothing that's not ultimately

3290
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:04,960
there is nothing that's not ultimately
 

3291

so

3298
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:11,839
so
 

3299
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,829
so
you got the particles you got the laws

3300
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:13,839
you got the particles you got the laws
 

3301
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:17,109
you got the particles you got the laws
and you have things that emerge from the

3302
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:17,119
and you have things that emerge from the
 

3303
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,630
and you have things that emerge from the
choreographed motions of those particles

3304
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:20,640
choreographed motions of those particles
 

3305
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,109
choreographed motions of those particles

talking about these emergent qualities
 

3309
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,430
talking about these emergent qualities
usually not

if i was to
 

3313
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,109

3357
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,470
understanding of the physical world it's
useful to talk about things in this very

about things in the poetic language of
 

3365
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,390
about things in the poetic language of
human experience but do not lose sight

human experience but do not lose sight

01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,990
human experience but do not lose sight
of the fact and some people do they say

01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,000
of the fact and some people do they say
 

3369
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,750
of the fact and some people do they say
oh it's just an emerging phenomenon

01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:33,760
oh it's just an emerging phenomenon
 

3371
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,950
oh it's just an emerging phenomenon
don't lose sight of the fact that

3372
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
don't lose sight of the fact that
 

3373
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,670
don't lose sight of the fact that
emergent phenomena are emerging

3374
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
emergent phenomena are emerging
 

3375
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,829
emergent phenomena are emerging
from this deeper understanding that

3376
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:39,839
from this deeper understanding that
 

3377
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,829
from this deeper understanding that
comes from the reductionist account of

3378
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:41,839
comes from the reductionist account of
 

3379
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,510
comes from the reductionist account of
physical law and there's a lot of

3380
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:43,520
physical law and there's a lot of
 

3381
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,990
physical law and there's a lot of
insight to come from that such as

3382
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000
insight to come from that such as
 

3383
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,750
insight to come from that such as
the freedom that you thought that you

3384
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760
the freedom that you thought that you
 

3385
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,589
the freedom that you thought that you
had the freedom of will that you thought

3386
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:49,599
had the freedom of will that you thought
 

3387
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,150
had the freedom of will that you thought
you had it doesn't have a basis in that

3388
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:52,160
you had it doesn't have a basis in that
 

3389
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,150
you had it doesn't have a basis in that
reductionist account so it's not real

3390
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,160

 

3391
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,230

so speaking of the poetry of human

3392
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240
so speaking of the poetry of human
 

3393
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,309
so speaking of the poetry of human
experience you mentioned the images of

3394
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
experience you mentioned the images of
 

3395
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,990
experience you mentioned the images of
the black holes how did it make you feel

3396
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:02,000
the black holes how did it make you feel
 

3397
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,990
the black holes how did it make you feel
a few years ago when that first image

3398
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,000
a few years ago when that first image
 

3399
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,549
a few years ago when that first image
came out it's truly amazing

3400
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:06,559
came out it's truly amazing
 

3401
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,309
came out it's truly amazing
a sense of

3402
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:08,319
a sense of
 

3403
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,870
a sense of
well i guess the feeling was

3404
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:10,880
well i guess the feeling was
 

3405
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,950
well i guess the feeling was
both amazing and and there's a little

3406
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:12,960
both amazing and and there's a little
 

3407
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,549
both amazing and and there's a little
sense of um

3408
01:02:14,549 --> 01:02:14,559
sense of um
 

3409
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,190
sense of um
jealousy is not quite the right word

3410
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,200
jealousy is not quite the right word
 

3411
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,630
jealousy is not quite the right word
but a sense of

3412
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:18,640
but a sense of
 

3413
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,470
but a sense of
longing yeah i think that's a better

3414
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,480
longing yeah i think that's a better
 

3415
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,990
longing yeah i think that's a better
word because

3416
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000
word because
 

3417
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,630
word because
here's a subject that started with

string theory right i mean holy

3466
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:16,240
string theory right i mean holy
 

3467
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,630
string theory right i mean holy
mathematical subject at the outset and

3468
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:18,640
mathematical subject at the outset and
 

3469
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,630
mathematical subject at the outset and
still pretty much a holy mathematical

3470
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640
still pretty much a holy mathematical
 

3471
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,470
still pretty much a holy mathematical
subject today

3472
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480
subject today
 

3473
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,630
subject today
yeah do we long

3474
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:24,640
yeah do we long
 

3475
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,710
yeah do we long
for that image where we can look at it

3476
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720
for that image where we can look at it
 

3477
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,069
for that image where we can look at it
and say

3478
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:28,079
and say
 

3479
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,109
and say
string it's real i mean you know i mean

3480
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
string it's real i mean you know i mean
 

3481
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,430
string it's real i mean you know i mean
how thrilling how thrilling to be part

3482
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:33,440
how thrilling how thrilling to be part
 

3483
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,430
how thrilling how thrilling to be part
of that journey to be part of that that

3484
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:35,440
of that journey to be part of that that
 

3485
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,829
of that journey to be part of that that
step that moves things from the abstract

3486
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:37,839
step that moves things from the abstract
 

3487
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,230
step that moves things from the abstract
to the concrete

3488
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,240
to the concrete
 

3489
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,870
to the concrete
yeah uh so like the image of the dna the

3490
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:42,880
yeah uh so like the image of the dna the
 

3491
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,670
yeah uh so like the image of the dna the
early images of the dna for example uh

3492
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
early images of the dna for example uh
 

3493
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,750
early images of the dna for example uh
but there is something especially so the

3494
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
but there is something especially so the
 

3495
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,750
but there is something especially so the
problem with strings

3496
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:49,760
problem with strings
 

3497
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,829
problem with strings
is they're tiny so it's harder to take a

3498
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:51,839
is they're tiny so it's harder to take a
 

3499
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,950
is they're tiny so it's harder to take a
picture i in in the following sense when

3500
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:54,960
picture i in in the following sense when
 

3501
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,029
picture i in in the following sense when
you think of a black hole i mean you

3502
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
you think of a black hole i mean you
 

3503
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,349
you think of a black hole i mean you
have a swirl of i guess what is i i

3504
01:03:59,349 --> 01:03:59,359
have a swirl of i guess what is i i
 

3505
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,589
have a swirl of i guess what is i i
don't even know it's dust to go whatever

3506
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:01,599
don't even know it's dust to go whatever
 

3507
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,549
don't even know it's dust to go whatever
light creeding onto the uh event horizon

3508
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:04,559
light creeding onto the uh event horizon
 

3509
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,470
light creeding onto the uh event horizon
and then there's darkness yeah center

3510
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
and then there's darkness yeah center
 

3511
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,950
and then there's darkness yeah center
and you you just imagine so that picture

3512
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
and you you just imagine so that picture
 

3513
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,990
and you you just imagine so that picture
in particular i guess is of a gigantic

3514
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,000
in particular i guess is of a gigantic
 

3515
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,349
in particular i guess is of a gigantic
black hole so you just i mean it's 10

3516
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:15,359
black hole so you just i mean it's 10
 

3517
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,789
black hole so you just i mean it's 10
million billion billions of times the

3518
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:16,799
million billion billions of times the
 

3519
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,710
million billion billions of times the
mass of the sun yeah so it's both

3520
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
mass of the sun yeah so it's both
 

3521
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,630
mass of the sun yeah so it's both
exciting and terrifying i mean i don't i

3522
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:20,640
exciting and terrifying i mean i don't i
 

3523
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,510
exciting and terrifying i mean i don't i
don't know where you fall on the

3524
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
don't know where you fall on the
 

3525
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,190
don't know where you fall on the
spectrum i think

3526
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,200
spectrum i think
 

3527
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,510
spectrum i think
it's exciting at first like the longer i

3528
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
it's exciting at first like the longer i
 

3529
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,109
it's exciting at first like the longer i
think about it every time i think about

3530
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:27,119
think about it every time i think about
 

3531
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,430
think about it every time i think about
it the more terrifying it becomes so it

3532
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
it the more terrifying it becomes so it
 

3533
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,109
it the more terrifying it becomes so it
always starts exciting

3534
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:31,119
always starts exciting
 

3535
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,430
always starts exciting
and then it goes to terrifying and both

3536
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
and then it goes to terrifying and both
 

3537
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,309
and then it goes to terrifying and both
are

3538
01:04:34,309 --> 01:04:34,319
are
 

3539
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,630
are
feelings very human feelings that i

3540
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
feelings very human feelings that i
 

3541
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,230
feelings very human feelings that i
appreciate

3542
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
appreciate
 

3543
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,390
appreciate
it's like terrified aw

3544
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
it's like terrified aw
 

3545
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,109
it's like terrified aw
somehow it's still beautiful that's a

3546
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
somehow it's still beautiful that's a
 

3547
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,630
somehow it's still beautiful that's a
good way of saying it i think i kind of

3548
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,640
good way of saying it i think i kind of
 

3549
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,230
good way of saying it i think i kind of
share that that reaction because there

3550
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:46,240
share that that reaction because there
 

3551
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,069
share that that reaction because there
is a way in which

3552
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:48,079
is a way in which
 

3553
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,150
is a way in which
when you work on this subject like all

3554
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:50,160
when you work on this subject like all

the time
i teach it i teach about black holes

3558
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440
i teach it i teach about black holes
 

3559
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,710
i teach it i teach about black holes
write the equations on the blackboard

3560
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:56,720
write the equations on the blackboard
 

3561
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,190
write the equations on the blackboard
the ideas

3562
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,200
the ideas
 

3563
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,470
the ideas
reside

3564
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:00,480
reside
 

3565
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,190
reside
in a very cognitive

3566
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
in a very cognitive
 

3567
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,910
in a very cognitive
i don't know mathematical portion of the

3568
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
i don't know mathematical portion of the
 

3569
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,870
i don't know mathematical portion of the
brain or at least for me and it's only

3570
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
brain or at least for me and it's only
 

3571
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,670
brain or at least for me and it's only
when you like sit down and it's quiet

3572
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:11,680
when you like sit down and it's quiet
 

3573
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,190
when you like sit down and it's quiet
and you start to contemplate wait wait

3574
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,200
and you start to contemplate wait wait
 

3575
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,470
and you start to contemplate wait wait
wait wait this is just like a

3576
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:14,480
wait wait this is just like a
 

3577
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,029
wait wait this is just like a
mathematical game

3578
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:17,039
mathematical game
 

3579
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,589
mathematical game
there are these monsters out there now i

3580
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:19,599
there are these monsters out there now i
 

3581
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,069
there are these monsters out there now i
don't not in it in a sense of i fear for

3582
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:22,079
don't not in it in a sense of i fear for
 

3583
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,670
don't not in it in a sense of i fear for
my life but it's

3584
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,680
my life but it's
 

3585
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,190
my life but it's
a sense of

3586
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:25,200
a sense of
 

3587
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,470
a sense of
how extraordinary is this universe and

3588
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:28,480
how extraordinary is this universe and
 

3589
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,109
how extraordinary is this universe and
so it is breathtaking how powerful

3590
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:31,119
so it is breathtaking how powerful
 

3591
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,190
so it is breathtaking how powerful
nature is yeah how stupendously powerful

3592
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,200
nature is yeah how stupendously powerful
 

3593
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,390
nature is yeah how stupendously powerful
nature is

3594
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:36,400
nature is
 

3595
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,190
nature is
um

3596
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200
um
 

3597
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,029
um
and so there is

3598
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:39,039
and so there is
 

3599
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,549
and so there is
a deep

3600
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:40,559
a deep
 

3601
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,870
a deep
sense of humility that i think this

3602
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:42,880
sense of humility that i think this
 

3603
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,589
sense of humility that i think this
instills if you really allow the ideas

3604
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
instills if you really allow the ideas
 

3605
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,150
instills if you really allow the ideas
to sink in

3606
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:48,160
to sink in
 

3607
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,390
to sink in
well i have to ask about the most

3608
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
well i have to ask about the most
 

3609
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,109
well i have to ask about the most
stupendously powerful thing to have ever

3610
01:05:53,109 --> 01:05:53,119
stupendously powerful thing to have ever
 

3611
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,630
stupendously powerful thing to have ever
happened in our universe which is the

3612
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:54,640
happened in our universe which is the
 

3613
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,309
happened in our universe which is the
big bang yeah

3614
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:56,319
big bang yeah
 

3615
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,710
big bang yeah
what's up with the big bang

3616
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:58,720
what's up with the big bang
 

3617
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,470
what's up with the big bang
so we can i mean with gravitational

3618
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:00,480
so we can i mean with gravitational
 

3619
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,510
so we can i mean with gravitational
waves the hope is when you have

3620
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
waves the hope is when you have
 

3621
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,950
waves the hope is when you have
more and more accurate measurements of

3622
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:04,960
more and more accurate measurements of
 

3623
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,470
more and more accurate measurements of
the gravitational waves you can crawl

3624
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:06,480
the gravitational waves you can crawl
 

3625
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,230
the gravitational waves you can crawl
back further and further back in time

3626
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,240
back further and further back in time
 

3627
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,789
back further and further back in time
towards the big bang

3628
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:10,799
towards the big bang
 

3629
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:11,990
towards the big bang
do you ever hope that we'll be able to

3630
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:12,000
do you ever hope that we'll be able to
 

3631
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,510
do you ever hope that we'll be able to
understand

3632
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:13,520
understand
 

3633
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,549
understand
the

3634
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:14,559
the
 

3635
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,950
the
the early spark that created

3636
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
the early spark that created
 

3637
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,789
the early spark that created
our universe yeah

3638
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:18,799
our universe yeah
 

3639
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,190
our universe yeah
you know that and the deep

3640
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:21,200
you know that and the deep
 

3641
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,309
you know that and the deep
interior of a black hole i think the the

3642
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:24,319
interior of a black hole i think the the
 

3643
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,789
interior of a black hole i think the the
biggest mysteries that we hope

3644
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:26,799
biggest mysteries that we hope
 

3645
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,630
biggest mysteries that we hope
the melding of quantum mechanics and

3646
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:28,640
the melding of quantum mechanics and
 

3647
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,710
the melding of quantum mechanics and
gravity will reveal will illuminate and

3648
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
gravity will reveal will illuminate and
 

3649
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,510
gravity will reveal will illuminate and
you know what question could be

3650
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
you know what question could be
 

3651
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,069
you know what question could be
more captivating than why is there

3652
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:38,079
more captivating than why is there
 

3653
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,309
more captivating than why is there
something rather than nothing right why

3654
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
something rather than nothing right why
 

3655
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:43,190
something rather than nothing right why
is there a universe at all

3656
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:43,200
is there a universe at all
 

3657
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,950
is there a universe at all
and will the theories that we're

3658
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:44,960
and will the theories that we're
 

3659
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,270
and will the theories that we're
developing take us

3660
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:47,280
developing take us
 

3661
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,589
developing take us
to an answer to that i don't know

3662
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:49,599
to an answer to that i don't know
 

3663
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,349
to an answer to that i don't know
even if we truly knew what the big bang

3664
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:51,359
even if we truly knew what the big bang
 

3665
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,349
even if we truly knew what the big bang
is that's a big question it's own right

3666
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:53,359
is that's a big question it's own right
 

3667
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,710
is that's a big question it's own right
one would still be left with the

3668
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
one would still be left with the
 

3669
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,549
one would still be left with the
question well okay

3670
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:56,559
question well okay
 

3671
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,230
question well okay
so you've explained the process by which

3672
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:00,240
so you've explained the process by which
 

3673
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,870
so you've explained the process by which
a tiny nugget of a

3674
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:02,880
a tiny nugget of a
 

3675
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,990
a tiny nugget of a
universe a kind of nugget of space-time

3676
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,000
universe a kind of nugget of space-time
 

3677
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,710
universe a kind of nugget of space-time
can undergo some kind of growth to yield

3678
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:08,720
can undergo some kind of growth to yield
 

3679
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,789
can undergo some kind of growth to yield
the world around us but

3680
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
the world around us but
 

3681
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,950
the world around us but
presumably in that explanation you're

3682
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
presumably in that explanation you're
 

3683
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,190
presumably in that explanation you're
going to involve mathematics

3684
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,200
going to involve mathematics
 

3685
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,910
going to involve mathematics
and some ingredients like quantum fields

3686
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:17,920
and some ingredients like quantum fields
 

3687
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,750
and some ingredients like quantum fields
or or matter or energy or something

3688
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:21,760
or or matter or energy or something
 

3689
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,430
or or matter or energy or something
where did that stuff

3690
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:23,440
where did that stuff
 

3691
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,910
where did that stuff
come from you know can we get to that

3692
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
come from you know can we get to that
 

3693
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,510
come from you know can we get to that
level of explanation i don't know but it

3694
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
level of explanation i don't know but it
 

3695
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,109
level of explanation i don't know but it
is remarkable

3696
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
is remarkable
 

3697
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:29,990
is remarkable
that

3698
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000
that
 

3699
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,789
that
if you ask what happened

3700
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:32,799
if you ask what happened
 

3701
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,950
if you ask what happened
a millionth of a second after the big

3702
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:34,960
a millionth of a second after the big
 

3703
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,910
a millionth of a second after the big
bang

3704
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:35,920
bang
 

3705
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,710
bang
it's not really that controversial

3706
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:38,720
it's not really that controversial
 

3707
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,870
it's not really that controversial
any longer right even though there's a

3708
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
any longer right even though there's a
 

3709
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,029
any longer right even though there's a
lot of argument in the field and it's

3710
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
lot of argument in the field and it's
 

3711
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,270
lot of argument in the field and it's
very heated right now i should say

3712
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280
very heated right now i should say
 

3713
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,950
very heated right now i should say
regarding what is the right theory of

3714
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:48,960
regarding what is the right theory of
 

3715
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,670
regarding what is the right theory of
the big bang what is the right theory of

3716
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:51,680
the big bang what is the right theory of
 

3717
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,829
the big bang what is the right theory of
early universe cosmology where i mean

3718
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:53,839
early universe cosmology where i mean
 

3719
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,430
early universe cosmology where i mean

heated arguments about that no pun
 

3727
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,789

intended yeah right exactly um but but

3728
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:04,799
intended yeah right exactly um but but
 

3729
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,789

but you go like a millionth of a second

3730
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:06,799
but you go like a millionth of a second
 

3731
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:09,349
but you go like a millionth of a second
after that yeah and and we're on pretty

3732
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:09,359
after that yeah and and we're on pretty
 

3733

01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:13,520
yeah to understand you know what
 

3737
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,349
yeah to understand you know what
happened from that point forward

3738
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:15,359
happened from that point forward
 

3739
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,229
happened from that point forward
but to go back is is is controversial so

3740
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
but to go back is is is controversial so
 

3741
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,070

ideas which they claim

3882
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:45,920
ideas which they claim
 

3883
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,910
ideas which they claim
yield the same predictions as inflation

3884
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:47,920
yield the same predictions as inflation
 

3885
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,110
yield the same predictions as inflation
and cosmology for those temperature

3886
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,120
and cosmology for those temperature
 

3887
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,350
and cosmology for those temperature
differences across space but don't

3888
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:51,360
differences across space but don't
 

3889
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,189
differences across space but don't
suffer from these problems and then the

3890
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:53,199
suffer from these problems and then the
 

3891
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,510
suffer from these problems and then the
inflationary cosmology folks say no no

3892
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:55,520
inflationary cosmology folks say no no
 

3893
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,830
inflationary cosmology folks say no no
no hang on you know your theories

3894
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:57,840
no hang on you know your theories
 

3895
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,070
no hang on you know your theories
suffers from different problems and so

3896
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:00,080
suffers from different problems and so
 

3897
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,470
suffers from different problems and so
the arguments goes it's a healthy debate

3898
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:02,480
the arguments goes it's a healthy debate
 

3899
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,950
the arguments goes it's a healthy debate
talk about real debates and science

3900
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
talk about real debates and science
 

3901
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,790
talk about real debates and science
so when you ask what's up with the big

3902
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:06,800
so when you ask what's up with the big
 

3903
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,669
so when you ask what's up with the big
bang

3904
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
bang
 

3905
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,229

i don't know right now um if you would

3906
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:10,239
i don't know right now um if you would
 

3907
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,790
i don't know right now um if you would
have asked me five years ago

3908
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:12,800
have asked me five years ago
 

3909
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,630
have asked me five years ago
maybe even less than that three or four

3910
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:14,640
maybe even less than that three or four
 

3911
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,149
maybe even less than that three or four
years ago i've said look

3912
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:16,159
years ago i've said look
 

3913
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:19,030
years ago i've said look
inflation on cosmology has some issues

3914
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:19,040
inflation on cosmology has some issues
 

3915
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,189
inflation on cosmology has some issues
but the package of explanations it

3916
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:21,199
but the package of explanations it
 

3917
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,430
but the package of explanations it
provides is so potent

3918
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:23,440
provides is so potent
 

3919
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,950
provides is so potent
and the issues that beset it are

3920
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:26,960
and the issues that beset it are
 

3921
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,950
and the issues that beset it are
seemingly solvable to me

3922
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:28,960
seemingly solvable to me
 

3923
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,790
seemingly solvable to me
that i would imagine it's going to in

3924
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:30,800
that i would imagine it's going to in
 

3925
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,709
that i would imagine it's going to in
the end win out

3926
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:32,719
the end win out
 

3927
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,310
the end win out
i would still say that today but i

3928
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
i would still say that today but i
 

3929
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,630
i would still say that today but i
wouldn't say it as loudly i wouldn't say

3930
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:36,640
wouldn't say it as loudly i wouldn't say
 

3931
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,510
wouldn't say it as loudly i wouldn't say
it as confidently i think it's worth

3932
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
it as confidently i think it's worth
 

3933
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,229
it as confidently i think it's worth
thinking about alternate ideas and it

3934
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:42,239
thinking about alternate ideas and it
 

3935
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,310
thinking about alternate ideas and it
could be the case that the paradigm at

3936
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:44,320
could be the case that the paradigm at
 

3937
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,790
could be the case that the paradigm at
some point shifts

3938
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:46,800
some point shifts
 

3939
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,790
some point shifts
does dark matter and dark energy fit

3940
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:48,800
does dark matter and dark energy fit
 

3941
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,830
does dark matter and dark energy fit
into the

3942
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:49,840
into the
 

3943
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,390
into the
shifting of the explanations for those

01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:52,400
shifting of the explanations for those
 

3945
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,750

yeah certainly so so dark energy has uh

3946
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:55,760
yeah certainly so so dark energy has uh
 

3947
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,310
yeah certainly so so dark energy has uh
in in the inflationary theory

3948
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
in in the inflationary theory
 

3949
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,149
in in the inflationary theory
is kind of a big mystery

3950
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:00,159
is kind of a big mystery
 

3951
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,350
is kind of a big mystery
so

3952
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
so
 

3953
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,110
so
dark energy is the

3954
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,120
dark energy is the
 

3955
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,709
dark energy is the
observational

realization in the last 20 years that
 

3959
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,510
realization in the last 20 years that
not only is the universe expanding it's

3960
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:09,520
not only is the universe expanding it's
 

3961
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,510
not only is the universe expanding it's
expanding ever more quickly

3962
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
expanding ever more quickly
 

3963
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,830

something is still pushing things
 

3965
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,470
something is still pushing things
outward and the explanation is that

3966
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:16,480
outward and the explanation is that
 

3967
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,390
outward and the explanation is that
there's like a residual version of the

repulsive gravity from the early
 

3971
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,790

that number
have come from now there are people who

01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
have come from now there are people who
 

4009
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,990
have come from now there are people who
suggest resolution to it so it's not

suggest resolution to it so it's not
 

4011
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,550
suggest resolution to it so it's not
like we're totally in the dark on it but

like we're totally in the dark on it but
 

4013

that they have a more natural

explanation of the dark energy that it
 

4023
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,270

that
 

4027
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:23,430
that
is their cosmological paradigm so yeah

4028
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,440
is their cosmological paradigm so yeah

our view of dark energy may change from

01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,390
our view of dark energy may change from
deeply mysterious to deeply integrate it

01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,030
think that information can bleed through
from before the big bang to the after

4044
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,040
from before the big bang to the after
 

4045
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,510
from before the big bang to the after
the big bang yeah is that uh is the big

4046
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:43,520
the big bang yeah is that uh is the big
 

4047
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,790
the big bang yeah is that uh is the big
bang uh

4048
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:44,800
bang uh
 

4049
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,870
bang uh
like a full erasure of the hard drive or

4050
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880
like a full erasure of the hard drive or
 

4051
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,149
like a full erasure of the hard drive or
is there some information that could

4052
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:48,159
is there some information that could
 

4053
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:51,430
is there some information that could
bleed through yeah i mean so sir roger

4054
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,440
bleed through yeah i mean so sir roger
 

4055
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,990
bleed through yeah i mean so sir roger

we talk about a singularity has this

4142

we talk about a singularity has this
 

4143
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,070
we talk about a singularity has this
really sexy term the singularity yeah

4144
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:30,080
really sexy term the singularity yeah
 

4145
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,709
really sexy term the singularity yeah
but a singularity is is in more ordinary

4146
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:32,719
but a singularity is is in more ordinary

it's nonsensical it's like taking one

4154
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:41,760
it's nonsensical it's like taking one
 

4155
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,510
it's nonsensical it's like taking one
divided by zero you put that into a

4157
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,669
divided by zero you put that into a
calculator and it says e error right it

4158
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679

01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,709
does not make sense doesn't compute and
and so it's very hard

4162

and so it's very hard
 

4163
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:51,669

that there's consensus on these ideas so
 

4181
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,470
that there's consensus on these ideas so
when one talks about information sort of

01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,310
don't think that there's a general sense
that that is the case as yet but it

4204
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
that that is the case as yet but it
 

4205
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,189
that that is the case as yet but it
could be that look i life is so short

4206
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:35,199
could be that look i life is so short
 

4207
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,270
could be that look i life is so short
that i i haven't had the time to deeply

4208
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
that i i haven't had the time to deeply
 

4209
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,709
that i i haven't had the time to deeply
delve into all the mathematical

4210
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:38,719
delve into all the mathematical
 

4211
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,229
delve into all the mathematical
intricacies of all the ideas that have

4212
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:40,239
intricacies of all the ideas that have
 

4213
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,910
intricacies of all the ideas that have
been put forward if i did that i'd never

4214
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:41,920
been put forward if i did that i'd never
 

4215
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,110
been put forward if i did that i'd never
do anything else

4216
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,120
do anything else
 

4217
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,790
do anything else
but that that's what the issue is and of

4218
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,800
but that that's what the issue is and of
 

4219
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,030
but that that's what the issue is and of
course it's just math there may be holes

4220
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,040
course it's just math there may be holes
 

4221
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,630
course it's just math there may be holes
there may be uh

4222
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
there may be uh
 

4223
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,070
there may be uh
there may be gaps in our our

4224
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,080
there may be gaps in our our
 

4225
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,149
there may be gaps in our our
understanding in the way we're modeling

4226
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159
understanding in the way we're modeling
 

4227
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,669
understanding in the way we're modeling
physical variables well that's the point

4228
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:55,679
physical variables well that's the point
 

4229
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,030
physical variables well that's the point
in fact when you said i was about to

4230
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,040
in fact when you said i was about to
 

4231
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,709
in fact when you said i was about to
jump in and say modeling but you got

4232
01:16:58,709 --> 01:16:58,719
jump in and say modeling but you got
 

4233
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,830
jump in and say modeling but you got
there first and it's exactly the right

4234
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:00,840
there first and it's exactly the right
 

4235
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,950
there first and it's exactly the right
point you're talking about the universe

4236
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
point you're talking about the universe
 

4237
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,990
point you're talking about the universe
here

4238
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:04,000
here
 

4239
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,270
here
right and the

4240
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,280
right and the
 

4241
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,470
right and the
how do you how do you talk about the

4242
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:06,480
how do you how do you talk about the
 

4243
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,149
how do you how do you talk about the
universe with a straight face

4244
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
universe with a straight face
 

4245
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,149
universe with a straight face
mathematically and the way you do it is

4246
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
mathematically and the way you do it is
 

4247
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,910
mathematically and the way you do it is
you you simplify

4248
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:11,920
you you simplify
 

4249
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,070
you you simplify
you throw away those characteristics of

4250
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:14,080
you throw away those characteristics of
 

4251
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,350
you throw away those characteristics of
the universe that you don't think are

4252
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:15,360
the universe that you don't think are
 

4253
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,350
the universe that you don't think are
vital to a full understanding and so

4254
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,360
vital to a full understanding and so
 

4255
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,790
vital to a full understanding and so
we're going to get to a point people are

4256
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:20,800
we're going to get to a point people are
 

4257
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,709
we're going to get to a point people are
starting to where we've got to go beyond

4258
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
starting to where we've got to go beyond
 

4259
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,630
starting to where we've got to go beyond
those simplifications

4260
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640
those simplifications
 

4261
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,070
those simplifications
and so cosmology has for a long time

4262
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,080
and so cosmology has for a long time
 

4263
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,669
and so cosmology has for a long time
modeled the universe in the most

4264
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:29,679
modeled the universe in the most
 

4265
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,189
modeled the universe in the most
simplest terms homogeneous isotropic

4266
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
simplest terms homogeneous isotropic
 

4267
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,030
simplest terms homogeneous isotropic
it has just a few parameters that

4268
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
it has just a few parameters that
 

4269
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,270
it has just a few parameters that
describe it the average density of mass

4270
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280
describe it the average density of mass
 

4271
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,870
describe it the average density of mass
and energy and so forth we have to go

4272
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880
and energy and so forth we have to go
 

4273
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,470
and energy and so forth we have to go
beyond those simplifications and that

4274
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:40,480
beyond those simplifications and that
 

4275
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,910
beyond those simplifications and that
will require

4276
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:41,920
will require
 

4277
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,430
will require
putting these things on computers we're

4278
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
putting these things on computers we're
 

4279
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,870
putting these things on computers we're
not going to be able to do calculations

4280
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
not going to be able to do calculations
 

4281
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,550
not going to be able to do calculations
there so much as

4282
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:46,560
there so much as
 

4283
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,790
there so much as
astrophysics has gone beyond many

4284
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:48,800
astrophysics has gone beyond many
 

4285
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,550
astrophysics has gone beyond many
simplifications to now give really

4286
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:50,560
simplifications to now give really
 

4287
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,270
simplifications to now give really
detailed simulations of star systems and

4288
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:53,280
detailed simulations of star systems and
 

4289
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,350
detailed simulations of star systems and
galaxies and so forth we're going to

4290
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:55,360
galaxies and so forth we're going to
 

4291
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,790
galaxies and so forth we're going to
have to do that with cosmology and

4292
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:56,800
have to do that with cosmology and
 

4293
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,950
have to do that with cosmology and
people are starting to do that today

4294
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:58,960
people are starting to do that today
 

4295
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,630
people are starting to do that today
yeah i've seen some interesting work on

4296
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:00,640
yeah i've seen some interesting work on
 

4297
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,030
yeah i've seen some interesting work on
uh simulation

4298
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,040
uh simulation
 

4299
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,870
uh simulation
most simulation cosmology by the way is

4300
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:04,880
most simulation cosmology by the way is
 

4301
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,310
most simulation cosmology by the way is
just awesome but

4302
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:06,320
just awesome but
 

4303
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,830
just awesome but
you know just like simulation of the

4304
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:07,840
you know just like simulation of the
 

4305
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,149
you know just like simulation of the
early formation of our solar system to

4306
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:10,159
early formation of our solar system to
 

4307
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:11,350
early formation of our solar system to
understand

4308
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:11,360
understand
 

4309
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,070
understand
how the like the ore cloud and just

4310
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
how the like the ore cloud and just
 

4311
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,709
how the like the ore cloud and just
i don't know the the whole of it the how

4312
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:16,719
i don't know the the whole of it the how
 

4313
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,390
i don't know the the whole of it the how
earth came to be yeah

4314
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:18,400
earth came to be yeah
 

4315
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,950
earth came to be yeah
like how jupiter just

4316
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:20,960
like how jupiter just
 

4317
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,950
like how jupiter just
protects us protects us and then there's

4318
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:22,960
protects us protects us and then there's
 

4319
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,590
protects us protects us and then there's
like weird like

4320
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
like weird like
 

4321
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,110
like weird like
moons and

4322
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:27,120
moons and
 

4323
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,950
moons and
volcanoes and

4324
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:28,960
volcanoes and
 

4325
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,550
volcanoes and
and like modeling all of that the

4326
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,560
and like modeling all of that the
 

4327
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,390
and like modeling all of that the
formation of all that

4328
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:32,400
formation of all that
 

4329
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,430
formation of all that
uh is fascinating yeah because that

4330
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:35,440
uh is fascinating yeah because that
 

4331
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,830
uh is fascinating yeah because that
naturally is the question of how does

4332
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840
naturally is the question of how does
 

4333
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,030
naturally is the question of how does
life emerge and these kinds of rocks

4334
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:41,040
life emerge and these kinds of rocks
 

4335
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,830
life emerge and these kinds of rocks
how does a rock become a rabbit yeah

4336
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
how does a rock become a rabbit yeah
 

4337
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,350
how does a rock become a rabbit yeah
uh but

4338
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:45,360
uh but
 

4339
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,669
uh but
speaking of models uh there's an

4340
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:47,679
speaking of models uh there's an
 

4341
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,149
speaking of models uh there's an
equation called the drake equation

4342
01:18:50,149 --> 01:18:50,159
equation called the drake equation
 

4343
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,630
equation called the drake equation
we were talking about life

4344
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:52,640
we were talking about life
 

4345
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,110
we were talking about life
have to ask when you're at the highest

4346
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
have to ask when you're at the highest
 

4347
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,910
have to ask when you're at the highest
level first when you look out there

4348
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:57,920
level first when you look out there
 

4349
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,830
level first when you look out there
how many alien civilizations do you

4350
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
how many alien civilizations do you
 

4351
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,830
how many alien civilizations do you
think are out there

4352
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:01,840
think are out there
 

4353
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,630
think are out there
zero one or many

4354
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:04,640
zero one or many
 

4355
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,510
zero one or many
so

4356
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:05,520
so
 

4357
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,830
so
if you say

4358
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:06,840
if you say
 

4359
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,950
if you say
civilization i

4360
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:08,960
civilization i
 

4361
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,310
civilization i
would bring my number way down

4362
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:12,320
would bring my number way down
 

4363
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,870
would bring my number way down
it could be zero

01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:14,880
it could be zero
 

4365
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,510
it could be zero
if you talk about life

4366
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:17,520
if you talk about life
 

4367
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,310
if you talk about life
i think it could be many

4368
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,320
i think it could be many
 

4369
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,470
i think it could be many
as we were saying before i think the

4370
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480
as we were saying before i think the
 

4371
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,390
as we were saying before i think the
move from life

4372
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:24,400
move from life
 

4373
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,470
move from life
to consciousness the kinds of beings

that would build what we would recognize

4376
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:28,880
that would build what we would recognize
 

4377
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,709
that would build what we would recognize
as a civilization

it might be oversimplifying things but

it might be oversimplifying things but
 

4425
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,470
it might be oversimplifying things but
just observing the power of the

just observing the power of the

just observing the power of the

evolutionary process
 

4429
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,149
evolutionary process
i tend to believe

4430
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:34,159
i tend to believe
 

4431
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:36,550
i tend to believe
and like you read

4432
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,560
and like you read
 

4433
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,270
and like you read
different theories of how we went

4434
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:39,280
different theories of how we went
 

4435
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,470
different theories of how we went
uh

4436
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:40,480
uh
 

4437
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,110
uh
how homo sapiens evolved

4438
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
how homo sapiens evolved
 

4439
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,430
how homo sapiens evolved
it seems like the evolutionary process

4440
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:45,440
it seems like the evolutionary process
 

4441
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,350
it seems like the evolutionary process
naturally leads to

or creatures like that or much better

4448
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:52,159
or creatures like that or much better
 

4449
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,030
or creatures like that or much better
than that so to me the

4450
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:55,040
than that so to me the
 

4451
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,189
than that so to me the
there's several scary scenarios so

4452
01:20:59,189 --> 01:20:59,199
there's several scary scenarios so
 

4453
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,430
there's several scary scenarios so
okay the positive scenario is life

4454
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,440
okay the positive scenario is life
 

4455
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,510
okay the positive scenario is life
itself is really difficult so that

4456
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:03,520
itself is really difficult so that
 

4457
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,990
itself is really difficult so that
origin of life is difficult that's

4458
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,000
origin of life is difficult that's
 

4459
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,990
origin of life is difficult that's
exciting for many reasons

4460
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:08,000
exciting for many reasons
 

4461
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:08,950
exciting for many reasons
because

4462
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:08,960
because
 

4463
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,750
because
we might be able to prove that wrong

4464
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
we might be able to prove that wrong
 

4465
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,149
we might be able to prove that wrong
easily in the near term by finding life

4466
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:14,159
easily in the near term by finding life
 

4467
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,830
easily in the near term by finding life
elsewhere sure

4468
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
elsewhere sure
 

4469
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,350
elsewhere sure
the scary thing to me is if uh

4470
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:19,360
the scary thing to me is if uh
 

4471
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,270
the scary thing to me is if uh
life is easy

4472
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:21,280
life is easy
 

4473
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,750
life is easy
and there's plenty of conscious

4474
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,760
and there's plenty of conscious
 

4475
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,790
and there's plenty of conscious
intelligent civilizations out there and

4476
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:26,800
intelligent civilizations out there and
 

4477
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,470
intelligent civilizations out there and
we have not

4478
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:28,480
we have not
 

4479
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,750
we have not
obviously made contact which means with

4480
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:31,760
obviously made contact which means with
 

4481
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,390
obviously made contact which means with
intelligence and consciousness comes

4482
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:34,400
intelligence and consciousness comes
 

4483
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,110
intelligence and consciousness comes
responsibility and

4484
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:37,120
responsibility and
 

4485
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,550
responsibility and
ultimately

4486
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:38,560
ultimately
 

4487
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,910
ultimately
destruction

4488
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:39,920
destruction
 

4489
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,870
destruction
so with power comes great responsibility

4490
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:42,880
so with power comes great responsibility
 

4491
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,709
so with power comes great responsibility
and then we end up destroying ourselves

4492
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:44,719
and then we end up destroying ourselves
 

4493
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,709
and then we end up destroying ourselves
that's the

4494
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
that's the
 

4495
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,950
that's the
uh the scariest the the positive i guess

4496
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:48,960
uh the scariest the the positive i guess
 

4497
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,189
uh the scariest the the positive i guess
version is that

4498
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:51,199
version is that
 

4499
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,830
version is that
maybe we're being watched

4500
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:53,840
maybe we're being watched
 

4501
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,270
maybe we're being watched
uh sort of like

4502
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:55,280
uh sort of like
 

4503
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,030
uh sort of like
there's a transition

4504
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,040
there's a transition
 

4505
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,270
there's a transition
to where you don't want to ruin

4506
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
to where you don't want to ruin
 

4507
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,430
to where you don't want to ruin
uh the primitive villages out there and

4508
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:01,440
uh the primitive villages out there and
 

4509
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,070
uh the primitive villages out there and
so there's a protective layer around us

4510
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:04,080
so there's a protective layer around us
 

4511
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,470
so there's a protective layer around us
yeah they're they're watching

4512
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:06,480
yeah they're they're watching
 

4513
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,870
yeah they're they're watching
so where where do you and these possible

4514
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:08,880
so where where do you and these possible
 

4515
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,550
so where where do you and these possible
explanations to the fermi paradox why

4516
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
explanations to the fermi paradox why
 

4517
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,629
explanations to the fermi paradox why
haven't we contacted aliens

4518
01:22:12,629 --> 01:22:12,639
haven't we contacted aliens
 

4519
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,870
haven't we contacted aliens
do you land on well

4520
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:14,880
do you land on well
 

4521
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,550
do you land on well
i think the most straightforward

4522
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:16,560
i think the most straightforward
 

4523
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,229
i think the most straightforward
explanation is that there aren't any

4524
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:20,239
explanation is that there aren't any
 

4525
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:21,110
explanation is that there aren't any
now

4526
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,120
now
 

4527
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,189
now
there are many other explanations too so

4528
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:23,199
there are many other explanations too so
 

4529
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,430
there are many other explanations too so
i you can't be dogmatic about things

4530
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:25,440
i you can't be dogmatic about things
 

4531

i you can't be dogmatic about things
that are just sort of gut feel

this other alien planet and they're all
 

4557
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,310
this other alien planet and they're all
sending back postcards how wonderful it

is and so forth and they they finally
 

4561
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,310
is and so forth and they they finally
decipher the title it's to serve man and

01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,000
to service it all makes sense and then
 

4567
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,149
to service it all makes sense and then

possibility sure you know and and so
 

4583
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,229
possibility sure you know and and so
could they be watching us and just sort

4584
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:24,239
could they be watching us and just sort
 

4585
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:27,270
could they be watching us and just sort
of waiting for us to uh get to a mature

4587
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,470

i think it'd be better to have this

telescope i mean i do think that

4598
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:36,719
telescope i mean i do think that
 

4599
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,910
telescope i mean i do think that
um if we look at the atmospheres

4600
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:39,920
um if we look at the atmospheres
 

4601
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,830
um if we look at the atmospheres
of many planets i mean there's now an

4602
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:41,840
of many planets i mean there's now an
 

4603
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,030
of many planets i mean there's now an
estimate now that there's on order of

4604
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:45,040
estimate now that there's on order of
 

4605
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,310
estimate now that there's on order of
one planet per star on average so we've

4606
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:48,320
one planet per star on average so we've
 

4607
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,629
one planet per star on average so we've
long known that you know the galaxy

4608
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:50,639
long known that you know the galaxy
 

4609
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,110

01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:56,159
galaxies so we're talking about hundreds
 

4615
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:57,430

of billions of hundreds of billions of

01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,350
of billions of hundreds of billions of
planets i'm like you know and if we

4618
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,360
planets i'm like you know and if we
 

4619
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,149
planets i'm like you know and if we
start to survey some of these planets

4620
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:02,159
start to survey some of these planets
 

4621
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,669
start to survey some of these planets
and one after the other after the other

4622
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
and one after the other after the other
 

4623
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,189
and one after the other after the other
we just sort of find

4624
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:05,199
we just sort of find
 

4625
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,510
we just sort of find
no evidence for

01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:07,520
no evidence for
 

4627
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,550
no evidence for
any of the biological markers it could

4628
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
any of the biological markers it could
 

4629
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,390
any of the biological markers it could
be of course maybe life takes a

4630
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:12,400
be of course maybe life takes a
 

4631
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,390
be of course maybe life takes a
radically different form it'd be hard to

4632
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
radically different form it'd be hard to
 

4633
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,790
radically different form it'd be hard to
know that but i think you know that

4634
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:16,800
know that but i think you know that
 

4635
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,310
know that but i think you know that
would at least give us some insight on

4636
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,320
would at least give us some insight on
 

4637
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,870
would at least give us some insight on
the life question but i just don't see

4638
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:20,880
the life question but i just don't see
 

4639
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,270
the life question but i just don't see
how we get insight on the civilization

4640
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,280
how we get insight on the civilization
 

4641
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,430
how we get insight on the civilization
or consciousness question without you

4642
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:25,440
or consciousness question without you
 

4643
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,990
or consciousness question without you
know the direct connection and and it

4644
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:28,000
know the direct connection and and it
 

4645
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,550
know the direct connection and and it
strikes me that if consciousness is

4646
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560
strikes me that if consciousness is
 

4647
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,390
strikes me that if consciousness is
ubiquitous

4648
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:32,400
ubiquitous
 

4649
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,550
ubiquitous
let's say life is i'm willing to grant

4650
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:34,560
let's say life is i'm willing to grant
 

4651
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,270
let's say life is i'm willing to grant
that if consciousness is also ubiquitous

4652
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:37,280
that if consciousness is also ubiquitous
 

4653
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,470
that if consciousness is also ubiquitous
then i don't understand why

4654
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:40,480
then i don't understand why
 

4655
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,149
then i don't understand why
they haven't been here or why there

4656
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
they haven't been here or why there
 

4657
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,430
they haven't been here or why there
hasn't been separate because presumably

4658
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:45,440
hasn't been separate because presumably
 

4659
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,830
hasn't been separate because presumably
they should be much further ahead of us

4660
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:47,840
they should be much further ahead of us
 

4661
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,070
they should be much further ahead of us
how unlikely would it be that we're like

4662
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
how unlikely would it be that we're like
 

4663
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,910
how unlikely would it be that we're like
of all consciousness in the universe

4664
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:51,920
of all consciousness in the universe
 

4665
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,830
of all consciousness in the universe
we're the most advanced that would be

4666
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:53,840
we're the most advanced that would be
 

4667
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,669
we're the most advanced that would be
such a special

4668
01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:55,679
such a special
 

4669
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,430
such a special
place for human beings that it's hard

4670
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:57,440
place for human beings that it's hard
 

4671
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,350
place for human beings that it's hard
for me to grant that as a likely

4672
01:24:59,350 --> 01:24:59,360
for me to grant that as a likely
 

4673
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,270
for me to grant that as a likely
possibility rather i think we're kind of

4674
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,280
possibility rather i think we're kind of
 

4675
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,550
possibility rather i think we're kind of
running the mill

4676
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:02,560
running the mill
 

4677
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,070
running the mill
and there are many who are far more

4678
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:04,080
and there are many who are far more
 

4679
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,629
and there are many who are far more
advanced than us and i don't think that

4680
01:25:06,629 --> 01:25:06,639
advanced than us and i don't think that
 

4681
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:07,510
advanced than us and i don't think that
they

4682
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:07,520
they
 

4683
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,510
they
would expend the energy to hide

4684
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:09,520
would expend the energy to hide
 

4685
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,189
would expend the energy to hide

01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,510
themselves
so i don't think they care enough and so

4688
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:13,520
so i don't think they care enough and so
 

4689
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,750
so i don't think they care enough and so
i see that's actually what i i believe

4690
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:15,760
i see that's actually what i i believe
 

4691
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,390
i see that's actually what i i believe
that there's uh a very large number of

4692
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:18,400
that there's uh a very large number of
 

4693
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,990
that there's uh a very large number of
civilizations that are far more advanced

4694
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,000
civilizations that are far more advanced
 

4695
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,430
civilizations that are far more advanced
than us

4696
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:21,440
than us
 

4697
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,750
than us
but my sense is the humans are

4698
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
but my sense is the humans are
 

4699
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,390
but my sense is the humans are
exceptionally limited both in our direct

4700
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:26,400
exceptionally limited both in our direct
 

4701
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,189
exceptionally limited both in our direct
sensory capabilities and our physics

4702
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:29,199
sensory capabilities and our physics
 

4703
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:30,310
sensory capabilities and our physics
our tools

4704
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:30,320
our tools
 

4705
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,629
our tools
of sensing that just like with the

4706
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:32,639
of sensing that just like with the
 

4707
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:33,590
of sensing that just like with the
string theory and the multiple

4708
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:33,600
string theory and the multiple
 

4709
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,990
string theory and the multiple
dimensions we're just not

4710
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:36,000
dimensions we're just not
 

4711
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,390
dimensions we're just not
like it's like i honestly believe there

4712
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,400
like it's like i honestly believe there
 

4713
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,550
like it's like i honestly believe there
could be stuff in front of our nose that

4714
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
could be stuff in front of our nose that
 

4715
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,270
could be stuff in front of our nose that
we're just not seeing

4716
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:43,280
we're just not seeing
 

4717
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,310
we're just not seeing
what because we're too dumb too

4718
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:46,320
what because we're too dumb too
 

4719
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,870
what because we're too dumb too
uh too much hubris

4720
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
uh too much hubris
 

4721
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,189
uh too much hubris
and i mean it's a bunch of stuff and too

4722
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
and i mean it's a bunch of stuff and too
 

4723
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,709
and i mean it's a bunch of stuff and too
ignorant as a

4724
01:25:52,709 --> 01:25:52,719
ignorant as a
 

4725
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:53,830
ignorant as a
to the

4726
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:53,840
to the
 

4727
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,750
to the
fabric of reality all of those things

4728
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,760
fabric of reality all of those things
 

4729
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,149
fabric of reality all of those things
yeah we're young

4730
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
yeah we're young
 

4731
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,830
yeah we're young
yeah in terms of intelligence but i

4732
01:25:59,830 --> 01:25:59,840
yeah in terms of intelligence but i
 

4733
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,750
yeah in terms of intelligence but i
guess what i'd say is like i'm on board

4734
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:01,760
guess what i'd say is like i'm on board
 

4735
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,990
guess what i'd say is like i'm on board
with all of that as a real possibility

4736
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,000
with all of that as a real possibility
 

4737
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,510
with all of that as a real possibility
but then

4738
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:05,520
but then
 

4739
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,350
but then
it does strike me that

4740
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,360
it does strike me that
 

4741
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,350
it does strike me that
we are sufficiently

4742
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
we are sufficiently
 

4743
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,110
we are sufficiently
able to observe

4744
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
able to observe
 

4745
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,669
able to observe
the unit look we can look back to

4746
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
the unit look we can look back to
 

4747
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:14,709
the unit look we can look back to
you know

4748
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:14,719
you know
 

4749
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,590
you know
a fraction of the duration

4750
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:17,600
a fraction of the duration
 

4751
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,910
a fraction of the duration
from here to just a fraction is left

4752
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:19,920
from here to just a fraction is left
 

4753
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,229
from here to just a fraction is left
that we are unable to see um so however

4754
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
that we are unable to see um so however
 

4755
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,229
that we are unable to see um so however
young we are

4756
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:26,239
young we are
 

4757
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,550
young we are
we have been able to sort of pierce the

4758
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:28,560
we have been able to sort of pierce the
 

4759
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,030
we have been able to sort of pierce the
universe and it just strikes me that

4760
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:31,040
universe and it just strikes me that
 

4761
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,830
universe and it just strikes me that
there would be some signature but maybe

4762
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:33,840
there would be some signature but maybe
 

4763
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,910
there would be some signature but maybe
maybe that that's coming but but look

4764
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:35,920
maybe that that's coming but but look
 

4765
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,750
maybe that that's coming but but look
having said that i do

4766
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:37,760
having said that i do
 

4767
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,229
having said that i do
look i i i certainly note the fact that

4768
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:40,239
look i i i certainly note the fact that
 

4769
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:43,910
look i i i certainly note the fact that
it's rare that i stoop down

4770
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:43,920
it's rare that i stoop down
 

4771
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,470
it's rare that i stoop down
while walking in manhattan and sort of

4772
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:46,480
while walking in manhattan and sort of
 

4773
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,030
while walking in manhattan and sort of
dig up some ants in the bushes on the

4774
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:49,040
dig up some ants in the bushes on the
 

4775
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,030
dig up some ants in the bushes on the
side of the street and talk to the ants

4776
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:51,040
side of the street and talk to the ants
 

4777
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,629
side of the street and talk to the ants
right because it's just not interesting

4778
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:52,639
right because it's just not interesting
 

4779
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,229
right because it's just not interesting
to me so if we're like the ants on the

4780
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
to me so if we're like the ants on the
 

4781
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,550
to me so if we're like the ants on the
cosmological landscape then yeah i can

4782
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:56,560
cosmological landscape then yeah i can
 

4783
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,550
cosmological landscape then yeah i can
imagine that the super advanced aliens

4784
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:58,560
imagine that the super advanced aliens
 

4785
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,750
imagine that the super advanced aliens
would be like

4786
01:26:59,750 --> 01:26:59,760
would be like
 

4787
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,709
would be like
like whoever you know but but i feel

4788
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
like whoever you know but but i feel
 

4789
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,310
like whoever you know but but i feel
like we're sufficiently advanced that

4790
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:04,320
like we're sufficiently advanced that
 

4791
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,550
like we're sufficiently advanced that
there should be some signal signature of

4792
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:06,560
there should be some signal signature of
 

4793
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,709
there should be some signal signature of
that but maybe it's coming i think the

4794
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719
that but maybe it's coming i think the
 

4795
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,550
that but maybe it's coming i think the
deeper fundamental problem between us

4796
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
deeper fundamental problem between us
 

4797
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,830
deeper fundamental problem between us
and the ants is that we don't have a

4798
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:11,840
and the ants is that we don't have a
 

4799
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,590
and the ants is that we don't have a
common language it's not it's not the

4800
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:13,600
common language it's not it's not the
 

4801
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,750
common language it's not it's not the
interest it's that we don't even have a

4802
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:15,760
interest it's that we don't even have a
 

4803
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,189
interest it's that we don't even have a
common language

4804
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
common language
 

4805
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:20,629
common language
and so the the alien civilizations don't

4806
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:20,639
and so the the alien civilizations don't
 

4807
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:22,149
and so the the alien civilizations don't
even know how to communicate like we

4808
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:22,159
even know how to communicate like we
 

4809
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:23,270
even know how to communicate like we
humans have

4810
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:23,280
humans have
 

4811
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,629
humans have
convinced ourselves we're special

4812
01:27:24,629 --> 01:27:24,639
convinced ourselves we're special
 

4813
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,229
convinced ourselves we're special
because we developed the language you

4814
01:27:26,229 --> 01:27:26,239
because we developed the language you
 

4815
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:27,590
because we developed the language you
talked about you talk about the

4816
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:27,600
talked about you talk about the
 

4817
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,990
talked about you talk about the
importance of language to intelligence

4818
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
importance of language to intelligence
 

4819
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,870
importance of language to intelligence
but it makes you wonder like how very

4820
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:32,880
but it makes you wonder like how very
 

4821
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,470
but it makes you wonder like how very
niche is that

4822
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:34,480
niche is that
 

4823
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,229
niche is that
like club that we've

4824
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,239
like club that we've
 

4825
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,709
like club that we've
like tried we've created of language and

4826
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:38,719
like tried we've created of language and
 

4827
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,870
like tried we've created of language and
linguistic type of systems that are very

4828
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:40,880
linguistic type of systems that are very
 

4829
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,390
linguistic type of systems that are very
specific to our particular kinds of

4830
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:42,400
specific to our particular kinds of
 

4831
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,229
specific to our particular kinds of
brains and we share ideas together are

4832
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:44,239
brains and we share ideas together are
 

4833
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,830
brains and we share ideas together are
all super excited that we can understand

4834
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:45,840
all super excited that we can understand
 

4835
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,110
all super excited that we can understand
the universe because we came up with

4836
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,120
the universe because we came up with
 

4837
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,750
the universe because we came up with
some notation yeah and math i wonder if

4838
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,760
some notation yeah and math i wonder if
 

4839
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,790
some notation yeah and math i wonder if
there's some

4840
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:50,800
there's some
 

4841
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,470
there's some
totally other kinds of language that

4842
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:52,480
totally other kinds of language that
 

4843
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,310
totally other kinds of language that
communicates on a different time scale

4844
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,320
communicates on a different time scale
 

4845
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,709
communicates on a different time scale
with different very different mechanisms

4846
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:56,719

is there's a certain kind of romantic

4863
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,750

to looking out in the cosmos and it's
 

4865
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,390
to looking out in the cosmos and it's
just quiet and it's just eternal silence

01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:22,400
just quiet and it's just eternal silence
 

4867
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,229
just quiet and it's just eternal silence
there's some there's something that

there's some there's something that

01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:27,189
there's some there's something that
appeals to me at an emotional level that

appeals to me at an emotional level that
 

4871
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:30,550
appeals to me at an emotional level that
way but yeah i mean um nobody

nobody knows and uh it's certainly um

permeate the universe in a manner that
 

4889
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,790
permeate the universe in a manner that
simply we're unable to detect well if we

01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:50,800
simply we're unable to detect well if we
 

4891
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,550
simply we're unable to detect well if we

that is exciting in

4894
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:54,960
that is exciting in
 

4895
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,550
that is exciting in
one of the ways it's exciting is um

one of the ways it's exciting is um
 

4897
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,709
one of the ways it's exciting is um
that it's up to us to become to expand

4898
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:00,719
that it's up to us to become to expand
 

4899
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:02,709
that it's up to us to become to expand

so that's where space exploration comes

4906
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:09,280
so that's where space exploration comes
 

4907
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,590
so that's where space exploration comes
in let me ask you as somebody who's a

4908
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:11,600
in let me ask you as somebody who's a
 

4909
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,709
in let me ask you as somebody who's a
screen theorist a physicist

4910
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:14,719
screen theorist a physicist
 

4911
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,110
screen theorist a physicist
do you think space exploration a

4912
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:17,120
do you think space exploration a
 

4913
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,990
do you think space exploration a
colonizing space is a physics or an

4914
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:20,000
colonizing space is a physics or an
 

4915
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,149
colonizing space is a physics or an
engineering problem what would you say

4916
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:22,159
engineering problem what would you say
 

4917
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:23,990
engineering problem what would you say
yeah i think it's fundamentally an

4918
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
yeah i think it's fundamentally an
 

4919
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,390
yeah i think it's fundamentally an
engineering problem if

4920
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:26,400
engineering problem if
 

4921
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,149
engineering problem if
we're not trying to do

4922
01:29:28,149 --> 01:29:28,159
we're not trying to do
 

4923
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:30,390
we're not trying to do
things like

4924
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
things like
 

4925
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,030
things like
build wormholes the way they did say an

4926
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:33,040
build wormholes the way they did say an
 

4927
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,030
build wormholes the way they did say an
interstellar to get to a different place

4928
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
interstellar to get to a different place
 

4929
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,430
interstellar to get to a different place
or trying to travel near the speed of

4930
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:37,440
or trying to travel near the speed of
 

4931
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,270
or trying to travel near the speed of
light so that we would actually be able

4932
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:39,280
light so that we would actually be able
 

4933
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,030
light so that we would actually be able
to traverse interstellar distances i

4934
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,040
to traverse interstellar distances i
 

4935
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,709
to traverse interstellar distances i
mean without that

4936
01:29:42,709 --> 01:29:42,719
mean without that
 

4937
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,510
mean without that
our colonization will happen in a very

4938
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:45,520
our colonization will happen in a very
 

4939
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,110
our colonization will happen in a very
very slow

4940
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,120
very slow
 

4941
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,870
very slow
rate right um

4942
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:48,880
rate right um
 

4943
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,430
rate right um
but one of the beauties of relativity is

4944
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
but one of the beauties of relativity is
 

4945
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,790
but one of the beauties of relativity is
if you do travel near the speed of light

4946
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:52,800
if you do travel near the speed of light
 

4947
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,830
if you do travel near the speed of light
you you can actually go arbitrarily far

4948
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:55,840
you you can actually go arbitrarily far
 

4949
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,430
you you can actually go arbitrarily far
in a human lifetime people say how's

4950
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:57,440
in a human lifetime people say how's
 

4951
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,510
in a human lifetime people say how's
that possible you can't go billions of

4952
01:29:59,510 --> 01:29:59,520
that possible you can't go billions of
 

4953
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,590
that possible you can't go billions of
light years well you can actually

4954
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,600
light years well you can actually
 

4955
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,870
light years well you can actually
because as you can do this bleed of

4956
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:02,880
because as you can do this bleed of
 

4957
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,110
because as you can do this bleed of
light the way in which space and time

4958
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:05,120
light the way in which space and time
 

4959
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,430
light the way in which space and time
change allows you to go in principle

4960
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:07,440
change allows you to go in principle
 

4961
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,350
change allows you to go in principle
arbitrarily far that's that's very

4962
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,360
arbitrarily far that's that's very
 

4963
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,990
arbitrarily far that's that's very
exciting but if we put that physics side

4964
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,000
exciting but if we put that physics side
 

4965
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,430
exciting but if we put that physics side
of the issue

4966
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,440
of the issue
 

4967
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,030
of the issue
in the manipulation space and time to

4968
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,040
in the manipulation space and time to
 

4969
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,709
in the manipulation space and time to
the side yeah i think it's a deep

4970
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:16,719
the side yeah i think it's a deep
 

4971
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,189
the side yeah i think it's a deep
engineering problem you know how

4972
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:19,199
engineering problem you know how
 

4973
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:22,629
engineering problem you know how
do you terraform other planets i mean uh

4974
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:22,639
do you terraform other planets i mean uh
 

4975
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,229
do you terraform other planets i mean uh
how do you

4976
01:30:24,229 --> 01:30:24,239
how do you
 

4977
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:27,270
how do you
go beyond our local neighborhood say

4978
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,280
go beyond our local neighborhood say
 

4979
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,270
go beyond our local neighborhood say
without you know using the ideas of

4980
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:29,280
without you know using the ideas of
 

4981
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,510
without you know using the ideas of
relativity so i think it's all quite

4982
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:31,520
relativity so i think it's all quite
 

4983
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,030
relativity so i think it's all quite
exciting and i think the idea is you

4984
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,040
exciting and i think the idea is you
 

4985
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,270
exciting and i think the idea is you
know using solar sails that you know

4986
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,280
know using solar sails that you know
 

4987
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,270
know using solar sails that you know
people have developed and

4988
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
people have developed and
 

4989
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,750
people have developed and
uh you know trying to take that first

4990
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:39,760
uh you know trying to take that first
 

4991
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,310
uh you know trying to take that first
step to mars i think that's a vital and

4992
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:42,320
step to mars i think that's a vital and
 

4993
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,310
step to mars i think that's a vital and
valuable step to take but yeah i think

4994
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,320
valuable step to take but yeah i think
 

4995
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,669
valuable step to take but yeah i think
these are fundamentally engineering

4996
01:30:45,669 --> 01:30:45,679
these are fundamentally engineering
 

4997
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:47,590
these are fundamentally engineering

uploading certain parts of it maybe not
 

5007
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,709
uploading certain parts of it maybe not
all the full resolution of a human life

5008
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:00,719
all the full resolution of a human life
 

5009
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,950
all the full resolution of a human life
but maybe the essential things

5010
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:02,960
but maybe the essential things
 

5011
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,870
but maybe the essential things
like the dna and be able to reconstruct

5012
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
like the dna and be able to reconstruct
 

5013
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,750
like the dna and be able to reconstruct
that human being

5014
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:07,760

 

5015
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,110

but

5016
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:09,120
but
 

5017
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,430
but
you know i have to ask about mars

5018
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:11,440
you know i have to ask about mars
 

5019
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,390
you know i have to ask about mars
you know

5020
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:12,400
you know
 

5021
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,990
you know
do you find

5022
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
do you find
 

5023
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:14,790
do you find
the

5024
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:14,800
the
 

5025
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,430
the
the dream of humans stepping on mars

5026
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,440
the dream of humans stepping on mars
 

5027
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,070
the dream of humans stepping on mars
stepping foot first but also colonizing

5028
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:20,080
stepping foot first but also colonizing
 

5029
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,430
stepping foot first but also colonizing
mars

5030
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:21,440
mars
 

5031
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,550
mars
um

5032
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:22,560
um
 

5033
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,110
um
one that's worth us fighting for yeah

5034
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:25,120
one that's worth us fighting for yeah
 

5035
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,950
one that's worth us fighting for yeah
usually so i mean i think what we have

5036
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960
usually so i mean i think what we have
 

5037
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,910
usually so i mean i think what we have
long

5038
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:27,920
long
 

5039
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,790
long
been not always in the best way

5040
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:30,800
been not always in the best way
 

5041
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,830
been not always in the best way
is a species of explorers

5042
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:33,840
is a species of explorers
 

5043
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,390
is a species of explorers
in the literal sense of

5044
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:36,400
in the literal sense of
 

5045
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,750
in the literal sense of
traveling from

5046
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:37,760
traveling from
 

5047
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,669
traveling from
one part of the world to another or in

5048
01:31:39,669 --> 01:31:39,679
one part of the world to another or in
 

5049
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,310
one part of the world to another or in
the more metaphorical sense of trying to

5050
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:42,320
the more metaphorical sense of trying to
 

5051
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,550
the more metaphorical sense of trying to
travel through our minds to the quantum

5052
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:44,560
travel through our minds to the quantum
 

5053
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,390
travel through our minds to the quantum
realm or back to the big bang or to the

5054
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:46,400
realm or back to the big bang or to the
 

5055
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,709
realm or back to the big bang or to the
center of black holes so i think that's

5056
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:48,719
center of black holes so i think that's
 

5057
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,790
center of black holes so i think that's
fundamentally part of of the human

5058
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:50,800
fundamentally part of of the human
 

5059
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,790
fundamentally part of of the human
spirit so i do think that's a vital part

5060
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:54,800
spirit so i do think that's a vital part
 

5061
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,669
spirit so i do think that's a vital part
of

5062
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:55,679
of
 

5063
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:59,270
of
our heritage brought forward into its

5064
01:31:59,270 --> 01:31:59,280
our heritage brought forward into its
 

5065
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:03,590
our heritage brought forward into its
next incarnation that's who we are

5066
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:03,600
next incarnation that's who we are
 

5067
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,910
next incarnation that's who we are
do you think there'll be a day

5068
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:05,920
do you think there'll be a day
 

5069
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,310
do you think there'll be a day
in the future where

5070
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:08,320
in the future where
 

5071
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,110
in the future where
a human being is born on mars

5072
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:11,120
a human being is born on mars
 

5073
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,629
a human being is born on mars
and has to

5074
01:32:12,629 --> 01:32:12,639
and has to
 

5075
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:15,830
and has to
learn about his or her

5076
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:15,840
learn about his or her
 

5077
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,990
learn about his or her
human origins on earth like they'll have

5078
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
human origins on earth like they'll have
 

5079
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,149
human origins on earth like they'll have
to read in the book

5080
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
to read in the book
 

5081
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,270
to read in the book
yeah i don't think it'll be a book at

5082
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:21,280
yeah i don't think it'll be a book at
 

5083
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,470
yeah i don't think it'll be a book at
that stage it'll probably just be

5084
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:22,480
that stage it'll probably just be
 

5085
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,629
that stage it'll probably just be
uploaded into the head or something or

5086
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:24,639
uploaded into the head or something or
 

5087
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,790
uploaded into the head or something or
you know imprinted into the dna and then

5088
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:26,800
you know imprinted into the dna and then
 

5089
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,870
you know imprinted into the dna and then
they just sort of sense it but yeah i

5090
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:28,880
they just sort of sense it but yeah i
 

5091
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,430
they just sort of sense it but yeah i
think there's there's well look the the

5092
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:31,440
think there's there's well look the the
 

5093
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,750
think there's there's well look the the
issue you raised before is the vital one

5094
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:33,760
issue you raised before is the vital one
 

5095
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,990
issue you raised before is the vital one
is it the case that any sufficiently

5096
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:36,000
is it the case that any sufficiently
 

5097
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,790
is it the case that any sufficiently
advanced civilization destroys itself

5098
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:38,800
advanced civilization destroys itself
 

5099
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,189
advanced civilization destroys itself
is that sort of a a commonplace quality

5100
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:41,199
is that sort of a a commonplace quality
 

5101
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:42,790
is that sort of a a commonplace quality
i mean that's the other potential answer

5102
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:42,800
i mean that's the other potential answer
 

5103
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,270
i mean that's the other potential answer
to the fermi paradox uh why aren't they

5104
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:45,280
to the fermi paradox uh why aren't they
 

5105
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,430
to the fermi paradox uh why aren't they
here because by the time they got to the

5106
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:47,440
here because by the time they got to the
 

5107
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,790
here because by the time they got to the
technological development where they

5108
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:48,800
technological development where they
 

5109
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,310
technological development where they
could travel here they blew themselves

5110
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:50,320
could travel here they blew themselves
 

5111
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,229
could travel here they blew themselves
up they destroyed themselves and that's

5112
01:32:52,229 --> 01:32:52,239
up they destroyed themselves and that's
 

5113
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,870
up they destroyed themselves and that's
a you know you know an unfortunate but

5114
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:54,880
a you know you know an unfortunate but
 

5115
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,830
a you know you know an unfortunate but
you know

5116
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:55,840
you know
 

5117
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,950
you know
not a hard to imagine possibility based

5118
01:32:58,950 --> 01:32:58,960
not a hard to imagine possibility based
 

5119
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,110
not a hard to imagine possibility based
on things that have happened here

5120
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,120
on things that have happened here
 

5121
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,750
on things that have happened here
on planet earth but but putting that to

5122
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,760
on planet earth but but putting that to
 

5123
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,070
on planet earth but but putting that to
the side i think it um you know that's

5124
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:06,080
the side i think it um you know that's
 

5125
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,669
the side i think it um you know that's
the big obstacle but putting it to the

5126
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:07,679
the big obstacle but putting it to the
 

5127
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:09,990
the big obstacle but putting it to the
side we will resolve the engineering

5128
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
side we will resolve the engineering
 

5129
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,229
side we will resolve the engineering
challenges and and you know i should

5130
01:33:12,229 --> 01:33:12,239
challenges and and you know i should
 

5131
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:14,790
challenges and and you know i should
probably um modify my answer from before

5132
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:14,800
probably um modify my answer from before
 

5133
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,149
probably um modify my answer from before
when you said is it engineering or

5134
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:16,159
when you said is it engineering or
 

5135
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:19,189
when you said is it engineering or
physics it's really both right so so we

5136
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:19,199
physics it's really both right so so we
 

5137
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,430
physics it's really both right so so we
will surmount the engineering challenges

5138
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:21,440
will surmount the engineering challenges
 

5139
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,030
will surmount the engineering challenges
and that will then make the physics

5140
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,040
and that will then make the physics
 

5141
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,110
and that will then make the physics
challenges relevant it'll make it

5142
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:25,120
challenges relevant it'll make it
 

5143
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,709
challenges relevant it'll make it
relevant to figure out how to travel

5144
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
relevant to figure out how to travel
 

5145
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,310
relevant to figure out how to travel
near the speed of light it'll make it

5146
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320
near the speed of light it'll make it
 

5147
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,550
near the speed of light it'll make it
relevant to learn how to manipulate the

5148
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:30,560
relevant to learn how to manipulate the
 

5149
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,990
relevant to learn how to manipulate the
shape of space-time and so forth so

5150
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:34,000
shape of space-time and so forth so
 

5151
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,709
shape of space-time and so forth so
so i think it's a multi-stage process

5152
01:33:36,709 --> 01:33:36,719
so i think it's a multi-stage process
 

5153
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,709
so i think it's a multi-stage process
where it is engineering and ultimately

5154
01:33:38,709 --> 01:33:38,719
where it is engineering and ultimately
 

5155
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,629
where it is engineering and ultimately
physics and if we stick around long

5156
01:33:40,629 --> 01:33:40,639
physics and if we stick around long
 

5157
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,550
physics and if we stick around long
enough those are the kinds of challenges

5158
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:42,560
enough those are the kinds of challenges
 

5159
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,750
enough those are the kinds of challenges
i think that we're ultimately going to

5160
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:43,760
i think that we're ultimately going to
 

5161
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,830
i think that we're ultimately going to
surmount and then the physics side is

5162
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:45,840
surmount and then the physics side is
 

5163
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,510
surmount and then the physics side is
figuring out how to harness energy

5164
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:47,520
figuring out how to harness energy
 

5165
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,030
figuring out how to harness energy
enough to travel outside the solar

01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,120
system which seems like a heck of a
 

5169
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,990
system which seems like a heck of a
difficult journey but even mars itself

and sort of look up and be able to see
 

5241
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,189
and sort of look up and be able to see
with the telescope earth and say that's

5242
01:35:17,189 --> 01:35:17,199
with the telescope earth and say that's
 

5243
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,189
with the telescope earth and say that's
where i came from

i don't know that
that idea scale to other planets to

5248
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:23,600
that idea scale to other planets to
 

5249
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,990
that idea scale to other planets to
other solar systems yeah that's really

5250
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:26,000
other solar systems yeah that's really
 

5251
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,470
other solar systems yeah that's really
exciting hugely exciting i i think

that are seemingly impossible i mean
that's what makes them possible and this

5272
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:47,520
that's what makes them possible and this
 

5273
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,149
that's what makes them possible and this
is one which is concrete enough

5274
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:50,159
is one which is concrete enough
 

5275
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,189
is one which is concrete enough
i mean this is something that's going to

5276
01:35:51,189 --> 01:35:51,199
i mean this is something that's going to
 

5277
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,430
i mean this is something that's going to
happen soon in terms of actually going

5278
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:53,440
happen soon in terms of actually going
 

5279
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,709
happen soon in terms of actually going
to mars

5280
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:54,719
to mars
 

5281
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,310
to mars
and then the next step of establishing

5282
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,320
and then the next step of establishing
 

5283
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,189
and then the next step of establishing
some

5284
01:35:59,189 --> 01:35:59,199
some
 

5285
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,590
some
presence some semi-permanent or

5286
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:01,600
presence some semi-permanent or
 

5287
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,830
presence some semi-permanent or
permanent presence this is this is not

5288
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:03,840
permanent presence this is this is not
 

5289
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,990
permanent presence this is this is not
something that's gonna wait to the 25th

5290
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
something that's gonna wait to the 25th
 

5291
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,189
something that's gonna wait to the 25th
century i mean this is something that's

5292
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:07,199
century i mean this is something that's
 

5293
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,109
century i mean this is something that's
going to happen relatively soon

5294
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:09,119
going to happen relatively soon
 

5295
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:10,629
going to happen relatively soon
so i mean it could well be in your

5296
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:10,639
so i mean it could well be in your
 

5297
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,709
so i mean it could well be in your
lifetime unlikely mind but possibly in

5298
01:36:12,709 --> 01:36:12,719
lifetime unlikely mind but possibly in
 

5299
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:15,350
lifetime unlikely mind but possibly in
your lifetime that that kid will be born

5300
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:15,360
your lifetime that that kid will be born
 

5301
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,270
your lifetime that that kid will be born
and and and have the experience that

5486
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:29,679
fundamental to my experience but it
 

5487
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:31,189
fundamental to my experience but it
seems like an awfully in terms of we

5488
01:39:31,189 --> 01:39:31,199
seems like an awfully in terms of we
 

5489
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,270
seems like an awfully in terms of we
talk about models and strength theory

5490
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:33,280
talk about models and strength theory
 

5491
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,910
talk about models and strength theory
and theories in terms of theories of

5492
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
and theories in terms of theories of
 

5493
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,550
and theories in terms of theories of
this macro experience of human life it

01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:38,560
this macro experience of human life it
 

5495
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,870
this macro experience of human life it
seems like a heck of a good theory

5496
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:40,880
seems like a heck of a good theory
 

5497
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,870
seems like a heck of a good theory
that the fear of death is that the kind

that the fear of death is that the kind

and the only difference between the two
 

5531
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,550

reminded them in some subtle way of

01:40:17,109 --> 01:40:17,119
reminded them in some subtle way of
 

5535
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:18,550
reminded them in some subtle way of
their own mortality sometimes it's

their own mortality sometimes it's
 

5537
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,109
their own mortality sometimes it's
nothing more than interviewing them

you know an influence is there but it's
 

5543
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:26,390
you know an influence is there but it's
but it's subtle you don't even think you

01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:26,400
but it's subtle you don't even think you

and how they respond to certain

that shows a direct influence of the

01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:43,360
that shows a direct influence of the

that shows a direct influence of the
reminder

5562
01:40:44,629 --> 01:40:44,639
reminder
 

5563
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:47,189
reminder
of their own mortality and i've read a

5564
01:40:47,189 --> 01:40:47,199
of their own mortality and i've read a
 

5565
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:50,149
of their own mortality and i've read a
number of these studies and they are

5566
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,159
number of these studies and they are
 

5567
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:52,790
number of these studies and they are
really convincing and so yeah i would

5568
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:52,800
really convincing and so yeah i would
 

5569
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,030
really convincing and so yeah i would
say that the reason why so many people

5570
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:55,040
say that the reason why so many people
 

5571
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,390
say that the reason why so many people
would say that

5572
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:56,400
would say that
 

5573
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,629
would say that
yeah fear of mortality it's not front

5574
01:40:58,629 --> 01:40:58,639
yeah fear of mortality it's not front
 

5575
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:01,030
yeah fear of mortality it's not front
and center in my world view

5576
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:01,040
and center in my world view
 

5577
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,310
and center in my world view
yeah i don't really think about it much

5578
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:02,320
yeah i don't really think about it much
 

5579
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,350
yeah i don't really think about it much
doesn't really matter too much the

5580
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:03,360
doesn't really matter too much the
 

5581
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,189
doesn't really matter too much the
reason why they're able to say that is

5582
01:41:05,189 --> 01:41:05,199
reason why they're able to say that is
 

5583
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:07,350
reason why they're able to say that is
because this thing called culture

5584
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:07,360
because this thing called culture
 

5585
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,350
because this thing called culture
has emerged over the course of the last

5586
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:09,360
has emerged over the course of the last
 

5587
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,990
has emerged over the course of the last
10 000 years and part of the role of

5588
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:12,000
10 000 years and part of the role of
 

5589
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,709
10 000 years and part of the role of
culture is to give us a means of not

5590
01:41:14,709 --> 01:41:14,719
culture is to give us a means of not
 

5591
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:16,709
culture is to give us a means of not
thinking about our mortality all the

5592
01:41:16,709 --> 01:41:16,719
thinking about our mortality all the
 

5593
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,629
thinking about our mortality all the
time of not living in terror of the

5594
01:41:18,629 --> 01:41:18,639
time of not living in terror of the
 

5595
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,830
time of not living in terror of the
inevitable end which faces us all so

5596
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:21,840
inevitable end which faces us all so
 

5597
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,510
inevitable end which faces us all so
it's completely understandable that

5598
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:23,520
it's completely understandable that
 

5599
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,590
it's completely understandable that
that's the response because that's what

5600
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:25,600
that's the response because that's what
 

5601
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,229
that's the response because that's what
culture is at least in part four it's at

5602
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:28,239
culture is at least in part four it's at
 

5603
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:30,149
culture is at least in part four it's at
least possible

5604
01:41:30,149 --> 01:41:30,159
least possible
 

5605
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:33,430
least possible
that uh the fear of death the terror of

5606
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:33,440
that uh the fear of death the terror of
 

5607
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:36,229
that uh the fear of death the terror of
your mortality is the creative force

5608
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:36,239
your mortality is the creative force
 

5609
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,950
your mortality is the creative force
that created all of the things around us

5610
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:38,960
that created all of the things around us
 

5611
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,430
that created all of the things around us
at this human civilization

5612
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,440
at this human civilization
 

5613
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,350
at this human civilization
and i think about from an engineering

5614
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:43,360
and i think about from an engineering
 

5615
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,270
and i think about from an engineering
perspective

5616
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:45,280
perspective
 

5617
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,149
perspective
this is where i lose all of my robotics

5618
01:41:48,149 --> 01:41:48,159
this is where i lose all of my robotics
 

5619
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:50,790
this is where i lose all of my robotics
colleagues is i feel like

5620
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:50,800
colleagues is i feel like
 

5621
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,709
colleagues is i feel like
if you want to create intelligence you

5622
01:41:52,709 --> 01:41:52,719
if you want to create intelligence you
 

5623
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:54,470
if you want to create intelligence you
have to also

5624
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:54,480
have to also
 

5625
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,510
have to also
engineer in some kind of

5626
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:57,520
engineer in some kind of
 

5627
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,790
engineer in some kind of
echoes of this kind of fear of uh and

5628
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:00,800
echoes of this kind of fear of uh and
 

5629
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,030
echoes of this kind of fear of uh and
not you know fear is such a complicated

5630
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:03,040
not you know fear is such a complicated
 

5631
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,229
not you know fear is such a complicated
word but

5632
01:42:04,229 --> 01:42:04,239
word but
 

5633
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,709
word but
it's kind of like a scarcity

5634
01:42:06,709 --> 01:42:06,719
it's kind of like a scarcity
 

5635
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:09,109
it's kind of like a scarcity
a scarcity of time a scarcity of

5636
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:09,119
a scarcity of time a scarcity of
 

5637
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:10,470
a scarcity of time a scarcity of
resources

5638
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:10,480
resources
 

5639
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,830
resources
that creates a kind of anxiety like

5640
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:12,840
that creates a kind of anxiety like
 

5641
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,669
that creates a kind of anxiety like
deadlines get you to do stuff yeah and

5642
01:42:15,669 --> 01:42:15,679
deadlines get you to do stuff yeah and
 

5643
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:18,149
deadlines get you to do stuff yeah and
there's something almost fundamental to

5644
01:42:18,149 --> 01:42:18,159
there's something almost fundamental to
 

5645
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:20,149
there's something almost fundamental to
that in terms of uh

5646
01:42:20,149 --> 01:42:20,159
that in terms of uh
 

5647
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:21,910
that in terms of uh
human experience yeah well that's an

5648
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:21,920
human experience yeah well that's an
 

5649
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,070
human experience yeah well that's an
interesting thought so you're basically

5650
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:24,080
interesting thought so you're basically
 

5651
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,229
interesting thought so you're basically
in order to

5652
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:26,239
in order to
 

5653
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:27,669
in order to
create

5654
01:42:27,669 --> 01:42:27,679
create
 

5655
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,070
create
a kind of

5656
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:30,080
a kind of
 

5657
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:33,109
a kind of
structure that mirrors what we call

5658
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:33,119
structure that mirrors what we call
 

5659
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,350
structure that mirrors what we call
consciousness yes you'd better have that

5660
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:35,360
consciousness yes you'd better have that
 

5661
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,950
consciousness yes you'd better have that
structure

5662
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:36,960
structure
 

5663
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,990
structure
confront the same kinds of issues and

5664
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:40,000
confront the same kinds of issues and
 

5665
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,109
confront the same kinds of issues and
terrorism

5666
01:42:41,109 --> 01:42:41,119
terrorism
 

5667
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:43,270
terrorism
that we do consciousness and suffering

5668
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:43,280
that we do consciousness and suffering
 

5669
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,510
that we do consciousness and suffering
only makes sense in the context of death

5670
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:45,520
only makes sense in the context of death
 

5671
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,990
only makes sense in the context of death
if you want to i feel like

5672
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,000
if you want to i feel like
 

5673
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,629
if you want to i feel like
if you want to fit into human society

5674
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:50,639
if you want to fit into human society
 

5675
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,709
if you want to fit into human society
if you if you're a robot if you want to

5676
01:42:52,709 --> 01:42:52,719
if you if you're a robot if you want to
 

5677
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:56,149
if you if you're a robot if you want to
fit into human society you better have

5678
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
fit into human society you better have
 

5679
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:59,030
fit into human society you better have
the same kind of existential dread

5680
01:42:59,030 --> 01:42:59,040
the same kind of existential dread
 

5681
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,629
the same kind of existential dread
the same kind of fear of mortality

5682
01:43:00,629 --> 01:43:00,639
the same kind of fear of mortality
 

5683
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:02,790
the same kind of fear of mortality
otherwise you're not going to fit in

5684
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:02,800
otherwise you're not going to fit in
 

5685
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:06,070
otherwise you're not going to fit in
[Laughter]

5686
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:06,080
[Laughter]
 

5687
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,709
[Laughter]
it might be it might be wild but it's at

5688
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
it might be it might be wild but it's at
 

5689
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,790
it might be it might be wild but it's at
least like we're talking about all the

5690
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:10,800
least like we're talking about all the
 

5691
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,070
least like we're talking about all the
theories that

5692
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:12,080
theories that
 

5693
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,910
theories that
are at least worth consideration i think

5694
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:13,920
are at least worth consideration i think
 

5695
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,070
are at least worth consideration i think
that's a really powerful one and

5696
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:16,080
that's a really powerful one and
 

5697
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,430
that's a really powerful one and
definitely one has uh resonated with me

5698
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
definitely one has uh resonated with me
 

5699
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,270
definitely one has uh resonated with me
and um

5700
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:21,280
and um
 

5701
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:25,590
and um
definitely seems to capture something

5702
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:25,600
definitely seems to capture something
 

5703
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,990
definitely seems to capture something
beautifully

5704
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:28,000
beautifully
 

5705
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,189
beautifully
like real about the human condition

5706
01:43:31,189 --> 01:43:31,199
like real about the human condition
 

5707
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:34,709
like real about the human condition
and i i wonder it's of course sucks to

5708
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:34,719
and i i wonder it's of course sucks to
 

5709
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:36,709
and i i wonder it's of course sucks to
think that we need death

5710
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:36,719
think that we need death
 

5711
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,229
think that we need death
to appreciate life

5712
01:43:40,229 --> 01:43:40,239

 

5713
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:41,270

but

5714
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,280
but
 

5715
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,270
but
that just may be the way it is well it's

5716
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:43,280
that just may be the way it is well it's
 

5717
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,550
that just may be the way it is well it's
interesting if this robotic or

5718
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560
interesting if this robotic or
 

5719
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,149
interesting if this robotic or
artificially intelligent system

5720
01:43:48,149 --> 01:43:48,159
artificially intelligent system
 

5721
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,149
artificially intelligent system
understands the world and understands

5722
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:50,159
understands the world and understands
 

5723
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,750
understands the world and understands
the second law of thermodynamics and

5724
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:51,760
the second law of thermodynamics and
 

5725
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,350
the second law of thermodynamics and
entropy

5726
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:53,360
entropy
 

5727
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,870
entropy
even in artificial intelligence will

5728
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:54,880
even in artificial intelligence will
 

5729
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,310
even in artificial intelligence will
realize that

5730
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,320
realize that
 

5731
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,109
realize that
even if its parts are really robust

5732
01:43:59,109 --> 01:43:59,119
even if its parts are really robust
 

5733
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:01,270
even if its parts are really robust
ultimately it will

5734
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:01,280
ultimately it will
 

5735
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,350
ultimately it will
disintegrate yeah i mean so the time

5736
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,360
disintegrate yeah i mean so the time
 

5737
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,510
disintegrate yeah i mean so the time
scales may be different but in a way

5738
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:05,520
scales may be different but in a way
 

5739
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,870
scales may be different but in a way
when you think about it doesn't matter

5740
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:06,880
when you think about it doesn't matter
 

5741
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,350
when you think about it doesn't matter
once you know that you are mortal in the

5742
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:09,360
once you know that you are mortal in the
 

5743
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,750
once you know that you are mortal in the
sense that you are not eternal the time

5744
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:11,760
sense that you are not eternal the time
 

5745
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,590
sense that you are not eternal the time
scale hardly matters

5746
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:13,600
scale hardly matters
 

5747
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:14,790
scale hardly matters
because

5748
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
because
 

5749
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,750
because
it's it's either the whole thing or not

5750
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:17,760
it's it's either the whole thing or not
 

5751
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,910
it's it's either the whole thing or not
because on the scales of eternity any

5752
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:19,920
because on the scales of eternity any
 

5753
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,990
because on the scales of eternity any
finite duration however large is

5754
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:22,000
finite duration however large is
 

5755
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,590
finite duration however large is
effectively zero

5756
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:23,600
effectively zero
 

5757
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,390
effectively zero
on the scales of eternity and so maybe

5758
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:26,400
on the scales of eternity and so maybe
 

5759
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,310
on the scales of eternity and so maybe
it won't be so hard for an artificial

5760
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:28,320
it won't be so hard for an artificial
 

5761
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:31,910
it won't be so hard for an artificial
system to feel that sense of mortality

5762
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:31,920
system to feel that sense of mortality
 

5763
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,310
system to feel that sense of mortality
because it will recognize the underlying

5764
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:34,320
because it will recognize the underlying
 

5765
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,109
because it will recognize the underlying
physical laws and recognize its own

5766
01:44:37,109 --> 01:44:37,119
physical laws and recognize its own
 

5767
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:38,550
physical laws and recognize its own
finitude

5768
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:38,560
finitude
 

5769
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,790
finitude
and then it'll be us and robots drinking

5770
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:40,800
and then it'll be us and robots drinking
 

5771
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,270
and then it'll be us and robots drinking
beers looking up at the stars and just

5772
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,280
beers looking up at the stars and just
 

5773
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,910
beers looking up at the stars and just
uh

5774
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:45,920

 

5775
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,830

you

5776
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:46,840
you
 

5777
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,229
you
know uh having a good laugh in awe of

5778
01:44:50,229 --> 01:44:50,239
know uh having a good laugh in awe of
 

5779
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:52,950
know uh having a good laugh in awe of
the whole thing yeah

5780
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:52,960
the whole thing yeah
 

5781
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,189
the whole thing yeah
i think that's a pretty good way to end

5782
01:44:55,189 --> 01:44:55,199
i think that's a pretty good way to end
 

5783
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,430
i think that's a pretty good way to end
it talking about the fear of death we

5784
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:57,440
it talking about the fear of death we
 

5785
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,310
it talking about the fear of death we
started

5786
01:44:58,310 --> 01:44:58,320
started
 

5787
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,830
started
talking about the meaning of life and

5788
01:44:59,830 --> 01:44:59,840
talking about the meaning of life and
 

5789
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,350
talking about the meaning of life and
ended on the fear of death brian it's

5790
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,360
ended on the fear of death brian it's
 

5791
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,109
ended on the fear of death brian it's
