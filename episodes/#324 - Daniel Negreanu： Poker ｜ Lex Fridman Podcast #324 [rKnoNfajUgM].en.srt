446
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,360
to you know jump ship like what happens
 

447
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,969
to you know jump ship like what happens

to a hand let's say you have pocket aces

450
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,020
to a hand let's say you have pocket aces
 

451
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,510
to a hand let's say you have pocket aces

which is the best possible hand right
 

453
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,089
which is the best possible hand right
but the board runs out where it's seven

454
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:32,099
but the board runs out where it's seven
 

455
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,010
but the board runs out where it's seven
eight nine and then there's a Jack and

456
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,020
eight nine and then there's a Jack and
 

457
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,350
eight nine and then there's a Jack and
then there's a six it's like you have a

458
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,360
then there's a six it's like you have a
 

459
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,430
then there's a six it's like you have a

losses and saying okay let's move on to
 

469
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,629
losses and saying okay let's move on to
the next hand it's very very difficult

00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:49,259
thing for a lot of people at every stage
 

473
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,210
thing for a lot of people at every stage
of like pre-flop all the way through be

474
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:53,220
of like pre-flop all the way through be
 

475
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,430
of like pre-flop all the way through be
able to just make a decision on at that

476
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
able to just make a decision on at that
 

477
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,050
able to just make a decision on at that
point so yeah essentially not being

478
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,060
point so yeah essentially not being
 

479
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,029
point so yeah essentially not being
attached okay I've already put in forty

480
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
attached okay I've already put in forty
 

481
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,830
attached okay I've already put in forty
thousand dollars in this pot and this

482
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:00,840
thousand dollars in this pot and this
 

483
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,290
thousand dollars in this pot and this
guy's bet another 20. well I mean I got

484
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,300
guy's bet another 20. well I mean I got
 

485
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,570
guy's bet another 20. well I mean I got
to get my 40 back right except you know

486
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:05,580
to get my 40 back right except you know
 

487
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,330
to get my 40 back right except you know
in some cases you have to reassess

488
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:07,340
in some cases you have to reassess
 

489
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,770
in some cases you have to reassess
individually this situation and realize

490
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:09,780
individually this situation and realize
 

491
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,029
individually this situation and realize
all right well this is a bad investment

492
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
all right well this is a bad investment
 

493
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,010
all right well this is a bad investment
so I got to cut my losses by the way I

494
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,020
so I got to cut my losses by the way I
 

495
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,230
so I got to cut my losses by the way I
should I should mention that you have

496
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,240
should I should mention that you have
 

497
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,909
should I should mention that you have

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,220
stuff my probably favorite thing that
 

505
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,270
stuff my probably favorite thing that
you've done is your master class uh that

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,730
people should definitely check out
masterclass.com Lux there you go uh no

masterclass.com Lux there you go uh no
 

511
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,409
masterclass.com Lux there you go uh no
but it really is

512
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:33,419
but it really is
 

513
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,630
but it really is
one of my favorite Master Class courses

514
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,640
one of my favorite Master Class courses
 

515
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,190
one of my favorite Master Class courses
but also just a great introduction

516
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
but also just a great introduction
 

517
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,829
but also just a great introduction
overview of Poker it's great for people

00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
overview of Poker it's great for people
 

519
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,810
overview of Poker it's great for people
that like me who are beginners

520
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:41,820
that like me who are beginners
 

521
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,370
that like me who are beginners
essentially but it's probably really

522
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:43,380
essentially but it's probably really
 

523
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,750
essentially but it's probably really
good for intermediate people too I mean

524
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:44,760
good for intermediate people too I mean
 

525
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,070
good for intermediate people too I mean
there's a lot of really good detail

526
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
there's a lot of really good detail
 

527
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,370
there's a lot of really good detail
there anyway what are hand ranges and uh

528
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:49,380
there anyway what are hand ranges and uh
 

529
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,750
there anyway what are hand ranges and uh
how do you begin to estimate the range

530
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,760
how do you begin to estimate the range
 

531
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,610
how do you begin to estimate the range
of hands that your opponents have yeah

532
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:52,620
of hands that your opponents have yeah
 

533
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,530
of hands that your opponents have yeah
so I actually speaking to YouTube I did

534
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:54,540
so I actually speaking to YouTube I did
 

535
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,730
so I actually speaking to YouTube I did
a video on specifically this yeah

536
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:55,740
a video on specifically this yeah
 

537
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,110
a video on specifically this yeah
familiar with Rangers and essentially

538
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
familiar with Rangers and essentially
 

539
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,030
familiar with Rangers and essentially
you know back in my day the old days we

540
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
you know back in my day the old days we
 

541
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,530
you know back in my day the old days we
didn't talk about poker that way we're

542
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:00,540
didn't talk about poker that way we're
 

543
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,910
didn't talk about poker that way we're
like I think he's got this or I think

544
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
like I think he's got this or I think
 

545
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,790
like I think he's got this or I think
he's got that right uh nobody thought of

546
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
he's got that right uh nobody thought of
 

547
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,650
he's got that right uh nobody thought of
like the range of hands a player can

548
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:06,660
like the range of hands a player can
 

549
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,210
like the range of hands a player can
have so I guess the best example is

550
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,220
have so I guess the best example is
 

551
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,009
have so I guess the best example is
Imagine like all the potential hands as

552
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:10,019
Imagine like all the potential hands as
 

553
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,829
Imagine like all the potential hands as
being a part of a grid right so the

554
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:12,839
being a part of a grid right so the
 

555
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,449
being a part of a grid right so the
first player to act they could have any

556
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:14,459
first player to act they could have any
 

557
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,269
first player to act they could have any
one of those hands right anyone randomly

558
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
one of those hands right anyone randomly
 

559
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,490
one of those hands right anyone randomly
dealt right but let's say now that that

560
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,500
dealt right but let's say now that that
 

561
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,130
dealt right but let's say now that that
player raised to three thousand dollars

562
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,140
player raised to three thousand dollars
 

563
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,870
player raised to three thousand dollars
okay well you can eliminate now from

564
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:23,880
okay well you can eliminate now from
 

565
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,790
okay well you can eliminate now from
this grid a whole bunch of hands that

566
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:25,800
this grid a whole bunch of hands that
 

567
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,410
this grid a whole bunch of hands that
this player can no longer have because

568
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:27,420
this player can no longer have because
 

569
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,850
this player can no longer have because
if they had a two and a three they

570
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:28,860
if they had a two and a three they
 

571
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,949
if they had a two and a three they
wouldn't do that so you can say okay he

572
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
wouldn't do that so you can say okay he
 

573
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,350
wouldn't do that so you can say okay he
probably has a big pair he has Ace King

574
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
probably has a big pair he has Ace King
 

575
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,329
probably has a big pair he has Ace King
you know you've you've narrowed the

576
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:35,339
you know you've you've narrowed the
 

577
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,490
you know you've you've narrowed the
range of hands down right now through

578
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,500
range of hands down right now through
 

579
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,769
range of hands down right now through
every action on the Flop on the turn and

580
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:39,779
every action on the Flop on the turn and
 

581
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,449
every action on the Flop on the turn and
on the river based on the decisions they

582
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:41,459
on the river based on the decisions they
 

583
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,150
on the river based on the decisions they
make you narrow it down even further so

584
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
make you narrow it down even further so
 

585
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,970
make you narrow it down even further so
the range of hands is the whole uh the

586
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:46,980
the range of hands is the whole uh the
 

587
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,949
the range of hands is the whole uh the
entirety of all the possibilities that

588
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
entirety of all the possibilities that
 

589
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,389
entirety of all the possibilities that
this player you believe could have and

590
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
this player you believe could have and
 

591
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,009
this player you believe could have and
sometimes they fool you or they have a

592
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,019
sometimes they fool you or they have a
 

593
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,509
sometimes they fool you or they have a
hand that you don't expect them to have

594
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
hand that you don't expect them to have
 

595
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,130
hand that you don't expect them to have
in their range and you know maybe a

596
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,140
in their range and you know maybe a
 

597
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,410
in their range and you know maybe a
little bit uh unorthodox doing some

598
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:57,420
little bit uh unorthodox doing some
 

599
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,970
little bit uh unorthodox doing some
things you don't expect to throw you off

600
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:58,980
things you don't expect to throw you off
 

601
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,370
things you don't expect to throw you off
but a range is essentially all the

602
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,380
but a range is essentially all the
 

603
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,230
but a range is essentially all the
possibilities and it Narrows as by the

604
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,240
possibilities and it Narrows as by the
 

605
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,570
possibilities and it Narrows as by the
time before the Flop it's endless player

606
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:05,580
time before the Flop it's endless player
 

607
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,670
time before the Flop it's endless player
raises okay it's minimized and now a

608
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
raises okay it's minimized and now a
 

609
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,230
raises okay it's minimized and now a
player bets the Flop okay it's minimized

610
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,240
player bets the Flop okay it's minimized
 

611
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,090
player bets the Flop okay it's minimized
further and then by the river you know

612
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,100
further and then by the river you know
 

613
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,670
further and then by the river you know
you can narrow down the entire range to

614
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
you can narrow down the entire range to
 

615
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,410
you can narrow down the entire range to
you know just maybe even a few hands is

616
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:15,420
you know just maybe even a few hands is
 

617
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,810
you know just maybe even a few hands is
it always shrinking or is there sort of

618
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:17,820
it always shrinking or is there sort of
 

619
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,329
it always shrinking or is there sort of
as you get surprised I mean it's always

620
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:20,339
as you get surprised I mean it's always
 

621
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,030
as you get surprised I mean it's always
just an estimate so is does it ever

622
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
just an estimate so is does it ever
 

623
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,810
just an estimate so is does it ever
expand based on sort of chaotic

624
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:25,820
expand based on sort of chaotic
 

625
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,550
expand based on sort of chaotic
unpredicted surprising behavior of the

626
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
unpredicted surprising behavior of the
 

627
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,470
unpredicted surprising behavior of the
players it really should never expand

628
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
players it really should never expand
 

629
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,090
players it really should never expand
the range of hands should always get

630
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,100
the range of hands should always get
 

631
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,290
the range of hands should always get
smaller right like again we start with

632
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,300
smaller right like again we start with
 

633
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,449
smaller right like again we start with
with the the full the full scope and

634
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:35,459
with the the full the full scope and
 

635
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,889
with the the full the full scope and
then you should factor in like okay

636
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:36,899
then you should factor in like okay
 

637
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,329
then you should factor in like okay
these are all the possible hands you can

638
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:38,339
these are all the possible hands you can
 

639
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,610
these are all the possible hands you can
have on the Flop now right we can't have

640
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:40,620
have on the Flop now right we can't have
 

641
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,130
have on the Flop now right we can't have
new hands on the turn and if you if you

642
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,140
new hands on the turn and if you if you
 

643
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,569
new hands on the turn and if you if you
get to that point where you think oh

644
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:44,579
get to that point where you think oh
 

645
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,310
get to that point where you think oh
well maybe he has this hand then you

646
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
well maybe he has this hand then you
 

647
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,590
well maybe he has this hand then you
then you sort of misjudged his range

648
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:48,600
then you sort of misjudged his range
 

649
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,690
then you sort of misjudged his range
prior so you're not thinking clearly it

650
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:50,700
prior so you're not thinking clearly it
 

651
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,569
prior so you're not thinking clearly it
should always shrink from the full scope

652
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:53,579
should always shrink from the full scope
 

653
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,850
should always shrink from the full scope
to you know hopefully just a couple well

654
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:55,860
to you know hopefully just a couple well
 

655
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,949
to you know hopefully just a couple well
in that video you'll also talk about it

656
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:57,959
in that video you'll also talk about it
 

657
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,509
in that video you'll also talk about it
used to be that you would play your hand

658
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
used to be that you would play your hand
 

659
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,389
used to be that you would play your hand
but now you're playing a range that

660
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
but now you're playing a range that
 

661
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,949
but now you're playing a range that
you're representing a range you're not

662
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:03,959
you're representing a range you're not
 

663
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,949
you're representing a range you're not
even just playing your hand so what does

664
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
even just playing your hand so what does
 

665
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,509
even just playing your hand so what does
it mean to represent a certain range

666
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,519
it mean to represent a certain range
 

667
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,190
it mean to represent a certain range
yeah so that's another big thing that's

668
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,200
yeah so that's another big thing that's
 

669
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,810
yeah so that's another big thing that's
different about poker from you know my

670
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:11,820
different about poker from you know my
 

671
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,150
different about poker from you know my
day to today is that back in our day we

672
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
day to today is that back in our day we
 

673
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,829
day to today is that back in our day we
would like put people on one hand like

674
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
would like put people on one hand like
 

675
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,810
would like put people on one hand like
you probably have King nine or you have

676
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:17,820
you probably have King nine or you have
 

677
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,150
you probably have King nine or you have
jax or something like that now people

678
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
jax or something like that now people
 

679
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,590
jax or something like that now people
are cognizant of the idea that you could

680
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
are cognizant of the idea that you could
 

681
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,449
are cognizant of the idea that you could
have an entire range of hands so then

682
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:23,459
have an entire range of hands so then
 

683
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,190
have an entire range of hands so then
you ask yourself in situations all right

684
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
you ask yourself in situations all right
 

685
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,250
you ask yourself in situations all right
I know what I have but what I could have

686
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,260
I know what I have but what I could have
 

687
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,590
I know what I have but what I could have
in his mind or my opponent's mind is any

688
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:30,600
in his mind or my opponent's mind is any
 

689
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,690
in his mind or my opponent's mind is any
one of these hands what would I do with

690
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:32,700
one of these hands what would I do with
 

691
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,670
one of these hands what would I do with
the entirety of the these hands and so a

692
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:34,680
the entirety of the these hands and so a
 

693
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,750
the entirety of the these hands and so a
lot of people that are trying to play

694
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
lot of people that are trying to play
 

695
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,490
lot of people that are trying to play
optimally you know game three optimal

696
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:37,500
optimally you know game three optimal
 

697
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,670
optimally you know game three optimal
they think in terms of what their range

698
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:40,680
they think in terms of what their range
 

699
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,530
they think in terms of what their range
of hands would do rather than their very

700
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:42,540
of hands would do rather than their very
 

701
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,730
of hands would do rather than their very
specific hand

702
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:43,740
specific hand
 

703
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,069
specific hand
so as is bluffing in that context

704
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
so as is bluffing in that context
 

705
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,410
so as is bluffing in that context
essentially misrepresenting the range of

706
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,420
essentially misrepresenting the range of
 

707
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,690
essentially misrepresenting the range of
hands that you have no is that how you

708
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:50,700
hands that you have no is that how you
 

709
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,490
hands that you have no is that how you
think about it not exactly because so an

710
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:52,500
think about it not exactly because so an
 

711
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,889
think about it not exactly because so an
optimal range like if I bet the river if

712
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:54,899
optimal range like if I bet the river if
 

713
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,170
optimal range like if I bet the river if
I'm playing game three optimal a portion

714
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,180
I'm playing game three optimal a portion
 

715
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,269
I'm playing game three optimal a portion
of my range is going to be I have it I

716
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
of my range is going to be I have it I
 

717
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,829
of my range is going to be I have it I
got I got the best hand and a portion of

718
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:00,839
got I got the best hand and a portion of
 

719
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,210
got I got the best hand and a portion of
my range is going to be Bluffs and

720
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,220
my range is going to be Bluffs and
 

721
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,490
my range is going to be Bluffs and
they'll be balanced so in theory no

722
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:04,500
they'll be balanced so in theory no
 

723
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,410
they'll be balanced so in theory no
matter what you do okay no matter what

724
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:06,420
matter what you do okay no matter what
 

725
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,009
matter what you do okay no matter what
you do if you call or you fold in theory

726
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:09,019
you do if you call or you fold in theory
 

727
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,569
you do if you call or you fold in theory
it's just you're printing a zero as we

728
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:11,579
it's just you're printing a zero as we
 

729
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:12,769
it's just you're printing a zero as we
say you're not you're not getting

730
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:12,779
say you're not you're not getting
 

731
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,050
say you're not you're not getting
gaining or losing any EV if you were to

732
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,060
gaining or losing any EV if you were to
 

733
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,850
gaining or losing any EV if you were to
do it that way what's EV Eevee is

734
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:16,860
do it that way what's EV Eevee is
 

735
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,130
do it that way what's EV Eevee is
expected value right so every play that

736
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,140
expected value right so every play that
 

737
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,930
expected value right so every play that
you make you know it either is going to

738
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:20,940
you make you know it either is going to
 

739
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,790
you make you know it either is going to
in the long run you know make you some

740
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
in the long run you know make you some
 

741
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,410
in the long run you know make you some
money or it's it's just a losing play

742
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,420
money or it's it's just a losing play
 

743
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,449
money or it's it's just a losing play
and as a professional you try to make

744
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:26,459
and as a professional you try to make
 

745
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,730
and as a professional you try to make
the fewest amount of minor CV plays you

746
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:28,740
the fewest amount of minor CV plays you
 

747
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,470
the fewest amount of minor CV plays you
can and the only reason you would make

748
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
can and the only reason you would make
 

749
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,870
can and the only reason you would make
these minor CV plays is potentially if

750
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
these minor CV plays is potentially if
 

751
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,190
these minor CV plays is potentially if
you're trying to set up your opponent

752
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,200
you're trying to set up your opponent
 

753
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,410
you're trying to set up your opponent
for something later right so I might

754
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:36,420
for something later right so I might
 

755
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,170
for something later right so I might
make some minor CV plays right so that I

756
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:39,180
make some minor CV plays right so that I
 

757
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,790
make some minor CV plays right so that I
can exploit you later right so you're

758
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
can exploit you later right so you're
 

759
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,009
can exploit you later right so you're
building up building up an image a

760
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:43,019
building up building up an image a
 

761
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,350
building up building up an image a
player profile that's false in some way

762
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
player profile that's false in some way
 

763
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,790
player profile that's false in some way
something that I'm gonna I'm gonna plant

764
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
something that I'm gonna I'm gonna plant
 

765
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,009
something that I'm gonna I'm gonna plant
seeds in your mind so that I can exploit

766
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:49,019
seeds in your mind so that I can exploit
 

767
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,050
seeds in your mind so that I can exploit
them later so for example why would

768
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,060
them later so for example why would
 

769
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,210
them later so for example why would
players like show a big Bluff yeah like

770
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,220
players like show a big Bluff yeah like
 

771
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,949
players like show a big Bluff yeah like
what would be the reason for that they

772
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
what would be the reason for that they
 

773
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,150
what would be the reason for that they
show a big Bluff so that you know

774
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
show a big Bluff so that you know
 

775
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,129
show a big Bluff so that you know
they're capable of it but maybe in their

776
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:58,139
they're capable of it but maybe in their
 

777
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,150
they're capable of it but maybe in their
mind they're never going to do that

778
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,160
mind they're never going to do that
 

779
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,730
mind they're never going to do that
again but now they think you know he

780
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:01,740
again but now they think you know he
 

781
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,170
again but now they think you know he
bluffed me last time maybe he's doing it

782
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,180
bluffed me last time maybe he's doing it
 

783
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,090
bluffed me last time maybe he's doing it
again but that's a what we call like a

784
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,100
again but that's a what we call like a
 

785
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,030
again but that's a what we call like a
level a leveling War because it you know

786
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,040
level a leveling War because it you know
 

787
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,829
level a leveling War because it you know
you can go back and forth with whether

788
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
you can go back and forth with whether
 

789
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,449
you can go back and forth with whether
or not okay this guy might know that

790
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:11,459
or not okay this guy might know that
 

791
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:12,889
or not okay this guy might know that
like he showed a bluff because he's

792
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:12,899
like he showed a bluff because he's
 

793
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,750
like he showed a bluff because he's
never going to Bluff me again so that

794
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:14,760
never going to Bluff me again so that
 

795
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,670
never going to Bluff me again so that
that's where it gets a little so that's

796
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:16,680
that's where it gets a little so that's
 

797
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,590
that's where it gets a little so that's
a little bit different though when we're

798
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:18,600
a little bit different though when we're
 

799
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,910
a little bit different though when we're
talking about hand Rangers that's

800
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
talking about hand Rangers that's
 

801
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,470
talking about hand Rangers that's
different than

802
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:21,480
different than
 

803
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,690
different than
building up a mental model of what your

804
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:23,700
building up a mental model of what your
 

805
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,329
building up a mental model of what your
opponents what your opponents think of

806
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:26,339
opponents what your opponents think of
 

807
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,769
opponents what your opponents think of
you

808
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:27,779
you
 

809
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,750
you
and what your opponents think that you

810
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
and what your opponents think that you
 

811
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,629
and what your opponents think that you
think of them and and so on so forth are

812
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
think of them and and so on so forth are
 

813
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,150
think of them and and so on so forth are
you trying to construct those kinds of

814
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,160
you trying to construct those kinds of
 

815
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,769
you trying to construct those kinds of
method models and is that separate from

816
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:36,779
method models and is that separate from
 

817
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,269
method models and is that separate from
the hand ranges they go hand in hand

818
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:38,279
the hand ranges they go hand in hand
 

819
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,250
the hand ranges they go hand in hand
right so if any given in a given

820
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,260
right so if any given in a given
 

821
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,190
right so if any given in a given
situation right my range has this many

822
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,200
situation right my range has this many
 

823
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,129
situation right my range has this many
value hands and this many Bluffs okay so

824
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:46,139
value hands and this many Bluffs okay so
 

825
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,230
value hands and this many Bluffs okay so
in theory if I want to be balanced you

826
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
in theory if I want to be balanced you
 

827
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,370
in theory if I want to be balanced you
know this is my range and this is what

828
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:49,380
know this is my range and this is what
 

829
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,410
know this is my range and this is what
it looks like I'll bet this 50 of the

830
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:51,420
it looks like I'll bet this 50 of the
 

831
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,230
it looks like I'll bet this 50 of the
time bet this 50 time however if I know

832
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
time bet this 50 time however if I know
 

833
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,490
time bet this 50 time however if I know
that you

834
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:55,500
that you
 

835
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,129
that you
think that I Bluff too much right then

836
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:58,139
think that I Bluff too much right then
 

837
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,449
think that I Bluff too much right then
I'm not going to Bluff as much I'm going

838
00:13:59,449 --> 00:13:59,459
I'm not going to Bluff as much I'm going
 

839
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,829
I'm not going to Bluff as much I'm going
to start instead of betting these hands

840
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
to start instead of betting these hands
 

841
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,050
to start instead of betting these hands
that I would 50 50. now what I'll do is

842
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,060
that I would 50 50. now what I'll do is
 

843
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,569
that I would 50 50. now what I'll do is
I'll do like 70 30 where I'm basically

844
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:05,579
I'll do like 70 30 where I'm basically
 

845
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,069
I'll do like 70 30 where I'm basically
value betting most of the time against

846
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:07,079
value betting most of the time against
 

847
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,170
value betting most of the time against
you you know or vice versa if I know you

848
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:09,180
you you know or vice versa if I know you
 

849
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,850
you you know or vice versa if I know you
always fold because you think I have it

850
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:10,860
always fold because you think I have it
 

851
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,590
always fold because you think I have it
I'm going to Veer the other way and

852
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:12,600
I'm going to Veer the other way and
 

853
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,030
I'm going to Veer the other way and
instead of bluffing fifty percent I left

854
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,040
instead of bluffing fifty percent I left
 

855
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,889
instead of bluffing fifty percent I left
70 80 percent of the time to take

856
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:15,899
70 80 percent of the time to take
 

857
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,290
70 80 percent of the time to take
advantage of your perception of me so to

858
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:18,300
advantage of your perception of me so to
 

859
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,350
advantage of your perception of me so to
be successful do you have to construct a

860
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
be successful do you have to construct a
 

861
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,870
be successful do you have to construct a
solid model of all the players in the

862
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:23,880
solid model of all the players in the
 

863
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,350
solid model of all the players in the
game or can you ignore them I think it's

864
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
game or can you ignore them I think it's
 

865
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,269
game or can you ignore them I think it's
really important like when I play I have

866
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
really important like when I play I have
 

867
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,129
really important like when I play I have
in my phone I have a player profile of

868
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:31,139
in my phone I have a player profile of
 

869
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,750
in my phone I have a player profile of
everyone that I play with whenever I

870
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:32,760
everyone that I play with whenever I
 

871
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,430
everyone that I play with whenever I
pick up whether it's physical tells or

872
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:34,440
pick up whether it's physical tells or
 

873
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,009
pick up whether it's physical tells or
Tendencies they like to you know that

874
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:37,019
Tendencies they like to you know that
 

875
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,690
Tendencies they like to you know that
they have

876
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:38,700
they have
 

877
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,790
they have
um and overall that's just gonna you

878
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
um and overall that's just gonna you
 

879
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,069
um and overall that's just gonna you
know that's gonna allow you to exploit

880
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:43,079
know that's gonna allow you to exploit
 

881
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,050
know that's gonna allow you to exploit
more right so like if I played with

882
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,060
more right so like if I played with
 

883
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,910
more right so like if I played with
somebody I've never played before I'm

884
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:46,920
somebody I've never played before I'm
 

885
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,949
somebody I've never played before I'm
probably just going to play optimally or

886
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
probably just going to play optimally or
 

887
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,870
probably just going to play optimally or
at least as optimal as I know how until

888
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
at least as optimal as I know how until
 

889
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,370
at least as optimal as I know how until
I start to you know gain some

890
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:52,380
I start to you know gain some
 

891
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,350
I start to you know gain some
information on that player so that I can

892
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,360
information on that player so that I can
 

893
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,810
information on that player so that I can
start to exploit them so what's the when

894
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:56,820
start to exploit them so what's the when
 

895
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,490
start to exploit them so what's the when
you say optimally what does optimally

896
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:58,500
you say optimally what does optimally
 

897
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,189
you say optimally what does optimally
mean versus so Game Theory optimal

898
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199

00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:05,699
um exploitative yeah so that's like sort
 

903
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,310

of the big debate in poker we call it

904
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:07,320
of the big debate in poker we call it
 

905
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,829

for short GTO Game Theory optimal versus
 

907
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,310
for short GTO Game Theory optimal versus
exploitative play so GTO Game Theory

908
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,320
exploitative play so GTO Game Theory
 

909
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,650
exploitative play so GTO Game Theory
optimal is the idea that no it like I'm

910
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:15,660
optimal is the idea that no it like I'm
 

911
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,930
optimal is the idea that no it like I'm
gonna set up my play so that no matter

912
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:17,940
gonna set up my play so that no matter
 

913
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,810
gonna set up my play so that no matter
what you do you cannot exploit me so

914
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:20,820
what you do you cannot exploit me so
 

915
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,670
what you do you cannot exploit me so
essentially that's playing rock paper

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:28,860
every time right nothing you do can beat
 

921
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,949
every time right nothing you do can beat
that nothing you'll never be able to

00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
that nothing you'll never be able to
 

923
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,230
that nothing you'll never be able to
beat that right exploitative play is

924
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
beat that right exploitative play is
 

925
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,790
beat that right exploitative play is
starting to notice that okay well you

926
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
starting to notice that okay well you
 

927
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,769
starting to notice that okay well you
know what this guy loves Rock he loves

928
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:36,779
know what this guy loves Rock he loves
 

929
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,930
know what this guy loves Rock he loves
playing Rock so I'm gonna go pay for a

930
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:38,940
playing Rock so I'm gonna go pay for a
 

931
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,069
playing Rock so I'm gonna go pay for a
little more so I'm going to take

932
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
little more so I'm going to take
 

933
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,509
little more so I'm going to take
advantage of them so I won't be through

934
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
advantage of them so I won't be through
 

935
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,889
advantage of them so I won't be through
but now all of a sudden when I do that

936
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:42,899
but now all of a sudden when I do that
 

937
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,930
but now all of a sudden when I do that
I'm no longer playing optimal because if

938
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:44,940
I'm no longer playing optimal because if
 

939
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,949
I'm no longer playing optimal because if
you knew that I was making that

940
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:45,959
you knew that I was making that
 

941
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,230
you knew that I was making that
adjustment now you can exploit me so

942
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
adjustment now you can exploit me so
 

943
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,310
adjustment now you can exploit me so
that's where the sort of what we call

944
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,320
that's where the sort of what we call
 

945
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,170
that's where the sort of what we call
the leveling War happens where people

946
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,180
the leveling War happens where people
 

947
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,870
the leveling War happens where people
Veer from you know the optimal line of

948
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:53,880
Veer from you know the optimal line of
 

949
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,990
Veer from you know the optimal line of
okay 33 each for each one you can't beat

950
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
okay 33 each for each one you can't beat
 

951
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,170
okay 33 each for each one you can't beat
that but you also can't win with that

952
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:00,180
that but you also can't win with that
 

953
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,509
that but you also can't win with that
either so you're always trying to be at

954
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:02,519
either so you're always trying to be at
 

955
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,069
either so you're always trying to be at
the at the cutting at the Leading Edge

956
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
the at the cutting at the Leading Edge
 

957
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,590
the at the cutting at the Leading Edge
of sub-optimal play You're yeah you're

958
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:06,600
of sub-optimal play You're yeah you're
 

959
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,090
of sub-optimal play You're yeah you're
going back and forth and listen at the

960
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,100
going back and forth and listen at the
 

961
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,550
going back and forth and listen at the
highest levels like online that these

962
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
highest levels like online that these
 

963
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,110
highest levels like online that these
guys play like they're trying to play

964
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,120
guys play like they're trying to play
 

965
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,750
guys play like they're trying to play
pretty close to like Game Theory optimal

966
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:14,760
pretty close to like Game Theory optimal
 

967
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,310
pretty close to like Game Theory optimal
because it's very difficult to do first

968
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
because it's very difficult to do first
 

969
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,530
because it's very difficult to do first
of all no human being will ever be able

970
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:18,540
of all no human being will ever be able
 

971
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,410
of all no human being will ever be able
to compute at the level that computers

972
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:21,420
to compute at the level that computers
 

973
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,930

can it's just never going to happen so

974
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:23,940
can it's just never going to happen so
 

975
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,210
can it's just never going to happen so
that's where like the human mind has to

976
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,220
that's where like the human mind has to
 

977
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,530
that's where like the human mind has to
come into play and say all right well

978
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:27,540
come into play and say all right well
 

979
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,389
come into play and say all right well
you know if I was playing against the

980
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:29,399
you know if I was playing against the
 

981
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,069
you know if I was playing against the
robot I would do X but I'm not I'm

982
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:31,079
robot I would do X but I'm not I'm
 

983
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,110
robot I would do X but I'm not I'm
playing against U so I have to adjust so

984
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120

this game theory optimal only look at

986
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:34,920
this game theory optimal only look at
 

987
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,210
this game theory optimal only look at
the the betting and the hands in the

or does it look at the history so if you

994
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:43,019
or does it look at the history so if you
 

995
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,990
or does it look at the history so if you
were to play optimally optimally would

996
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,000
were to play optimally optimally would
 

997
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,550
were to play optimally optimally would
you need to look at the history of the

998
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
you need to look at the history of the
 

999
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,530
you need to look at the history of the
individual players or just every hand is

1000
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:48,540
individual players or just every hand is
 

1001
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,509
individual players or just every hand is
taken afresh see that's why I love

1002
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:50,519
taken afresh see that's why I love
 

1003
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,610

playing exploitatively for the most part

1004
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:52,620
playing exploitatively for the most part
 

1005
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,430
playing exploitatively for the most part
because with GTO it anything that's

1006
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
because with GTO it anything that's
 

1007
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,530
because with GTO it anything that's
happened in the past has no bearing on

1008
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:57,540
happened in the past has no bearing on
 

1009
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,749
happened in the past has no bearing on
this situation it's simply based on what

1010
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
this situation it's simply based on what
 

1011
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,790
this situation it's simply based on what
is the optimal play in a vacuum in this

1012
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:01,800
is the optimal play in a vacuum in this
 

1013
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,069
is the optimal play in a vacuum in this
spot whereas exploitatively okay this

1014
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
spot whereas exploitatively okay this
 

1015
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,990
spot whereas exploitatively okay this
guy Bluffs way too much in these spots

1016
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
guy Bluffs way too much in these spots
 

1017
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,090
guy Bluffs way too much in these spots
so now I can make an adjustment and call

1018
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:08,100
so now I can make an adjustment and call
 

1019
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,569
so now I can make an adjustment and call
more you know based on past information

1020
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:10,579
more you know based on past information
 

1021
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,669

all so like in a tournament how quickly

1024
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:15,780
all so like in a tournament how quickly
 

1025
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,870
all so like in a tournament how quickly
can you construct a player profile that

1026
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:17,880
can you construct a player profile that
 

1027
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,909
can you construct a player profile that
you've never played before depends on

1028
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
you've never played before depends on
 

1029
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,909
you've never played before depends on
the level of the buy-in really right so

1030
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:22,919
the level of the buy-in really right so
 

1031
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,549
the level of the buy-in really right so
the higher the buy-in generally speaking

1032
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:25,559
the higher the buy-in generally speaking
 

1033
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,409
the higher the buy-in generally speaking
you can assume if they're professionals

1034
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:27,419
you can assume if they're professionals
 

1035
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,490
you can assume if they're professionals
that they're going to have pretty

1036
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:28,500
that they're going to have pretty
 

1037
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,169
that they're going to have pretty
similar profiles because you know

1038
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:30,179
similar profiles because you know
 

1039
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,430
similar profiles because you know
everyone's playing you know if you're

1040
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
everyone's playing you know if you're
 

1041
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,890
everyone's playing you know if you're
playing this game well it looks similar

1042
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:33,900
playing this game well it looks similar
 

1043
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,870
playing this game well it looks similar
right at the lower levels you know

1044
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:35,880
right at the lower levels you know
 

1045
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,330
right at the lower levels you know
playing say in a 1 000 or 1500 buying or

1046
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,340
playing say in a 1 000 or 1500 buying or
 

1047
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,630
playing say in a 1 000 or 1500 buying or
less you know within a half an hour an

1048
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:41,640
less you know within a half an hour an
 

1049
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,549
less you know within a half an hour an
hour I have an idea of all right just by

1050
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:43,559
hour I have an idea of all right just by
 

1051
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,650
hour I have an idea of all right just by
seeing how some players played a few

1052
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:45,660
seeing how some players played a few
 

1053
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,630
seeing how some players played a few
hands that you know so here's the thing

1054
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:47,640
hands that you know so here's the thing
 

1055
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,250
hands that you know so here's the thing
with pokers like I can see one clue of

1056
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,260
with pokers like I can see one clue of
 

1057
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,990
with pokers like I can see one clue of
what he did and it tells me so much

1058
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,000
what he did and it tells me so much
 

1059
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,909
what he did and it tells me so much
about what he'll do in a vast number of

1060
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:52,919
about what he'll do in a vast number of
 

1061
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,770
about what he'll do in a vast number of
scenarios and you're saying at the high

1062
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:54,780
scenarios and you're saying at the high
 

1063
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,630
scenarios and you're saying at the high
level people don't give too many Clues I

1064
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
level people don't give too many Clues I
 

1065
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,390
level people don't give too many Clues I
mean well at the highest level is people

1066
00:17:59,390 --> 00:17:59,400
mean well at the highest level is people
 

1067
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,950
mean well at the highest level is people
are so much more similar in terms of

1068
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
are so much more similar in terms of
 

1069
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,049
are so much more similar in terms of
their style of play they try to find

1070
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:03,059
their style of play they try to find
 

1071
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,450
their style of play they try to find
some kind of balance between the GTO and

1072
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,460
some kind of balance between the GTO and
 

1073
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,190
some kind of balance between the GTO and
now with all that we've seen on TV right

1074
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
now with all that we've seen on TV right
 

1075
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,690
now with all that we've seen on TV right
like people get to watch streams and

1076
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:08,700
like people get to watch streams and
 

1077
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,010
like people get to watch streams and
whatever so you get to watch all the top

1078
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,020
whatever so you get to watch all the top
 

1079
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,570
whatever so you get to watch all the top
players play so if you want to learn how

1080
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:11,580
players play so if you want to learn how
 

1081
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,310
players play so if you want to learn how
to play better guess what you do you

1082
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:13,320
to play better guess what you do you
 

1083
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,110
to play better guess what you do you
copy what they're doing essentially like

1084
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
copy what they're doing essentially like
 

1085
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,789
copy what they're doing essentially like
oh he's only raising this much I'm gonna

1086
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
oh he's only raising this much I'm gonna
 

1087
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,350
oh he's only raising this much I'm gonna
do the same they're betting this much

1088
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,360
do the same they're betting this much
 

1089
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,990
do the same they're betting this much
I'm gonna do the same so as a result

1090
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm gonna do the same so as a result
 

1091
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,950
I'm gonna do the same so as a result
what you end up having is sort of uh

1092
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
what you end up having is sort of uh
 

1093
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,110
what you end up having is sort of uh
you know every everyone deciding like I

1094
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
you know every everyone deciding like I
 

1095
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,130
you know every everyone deciding like I
guess it's similar in chess with

1096
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,140
guess it's similar in chess with
 

1097
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,330
guess it's similar in chess with
openings right people figure out okay

1098
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:29,340
openings right people figure out okay
 

1099
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,590
openings right people figure out okay
this is an opening this is what you do

1100
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:30,600
this is an opening this is what you do
 

1101
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,390
this is an opening this is what you do
and that's it you know and then

1102
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
and that's it you know and then
 

1103
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,950
and that's it you know and then
everyone's similar to that and then you

1104
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:33,960
everyone's similar to that and then you
 

1105
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,570
everyone's similar to that and then you
have of course the outliers who try to

1106
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:35,580
have of course the outliers who try to
 

1107
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,010
have of course the outliers who try to
do things a little differently and

1108
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,020
do things a little differently and
 

1109
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,210
do things a little differently and
confuse people

1110
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,220
confuse people
 

1111
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,950
confuse people
it seems like the outliers like we

1112
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:39,960
it seems like the outliers like we
 

1113
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,990
it seems like the outliers like we

just both short and deep calculations
 

1127
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,770
just both short and deep calculations

storm and his name is Michael Adamo and

1146
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:21,419
storm and his name is Michael Adamo and
 

1147
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,150
storm and his name is Michael Adamo and
he was doing things like I said you know

1148
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,160
he was doing things like I said you know
 

1149
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,010
he was doing things like I said you know
most of the top pros play very similarly

1150
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,020
most of the top pros play very similarly
 

1151
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,390
most of the top pros play very similarly
with the way that they you know

1152
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
with the way that they you know
 

1153
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,130
with the way that they you know
construct ranges and their bet sizing

1154
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,140
construct ranges and their bet sizing
 

1155
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,270
construct ranges and their bet sizing
and all these kind of things he was

1156
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
and all these kind of things he was
 

1157
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,789
and all these kind of things he was
doing some crazy things that nobody else

1158
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:31,799
doing some crazy things that nobody else
 

1159
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,909
doing some crazy things that nobody else
was doing so he studied you know sort of

1160
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:34,919
was doing so he studied you know sort of
 

1161
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,950
was doing so he studied you know sort of
a different form of Poker and it it was

1162
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
a different form of Poker and it it was
 

1163
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,650
a different form of Poker and it it was
unorthodox and it you know it throws

1164
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:39,660
unorthodox and it you know it throws
 

1165
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,270
unorthodox and it you know it throws
people off because he's in his comfort

1166
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
people off because he's in his comfort
 

1167
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,070
people off because he's in his comfort
zone with these bet sizes and different

1168
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,080
zone with these bet sizes and different
 

1169
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,870
zone with these bet sizes and different
things whereas everyone else they're

1170
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
things whereas everyone else they're
 

1171
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,730
things whereas everyone else they're
they're not well studied in those spots

1172
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:46,740
they're not well studied in those spots
 

1173
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,130
they're not well studied in those spots
so as a result of him being unorthodox

1174
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,140
so as a result of him being unorthodox
 

1175
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,930
so as a result of him being unorthodox
he became like a monster and very

1176
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:50,940
he became like a monster and very
 

1177
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,950
he became like a monster and very
difficult to play against because he

1178
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:51,960
difficult to play against because he
 

1179
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,450
difficult to play against because he
really knew what he was doing with it in

1180
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:53,460
really knew what he was doing with it in
 

1181
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,130
really knew what he was doing with it in
tournament or cash games it was

1182
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,140
tournament or cash games it was
 

1183
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,330
tournament or cash games it was
tournaments yeah he was crushing

1184
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:56,340
tournaments yeah he was crushing
 

1185
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,310
tournaments yeah he was crushing
tournaments he was going against the

1186
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
tournaments he was going against the
 

1187
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,529
tournaments he was going against the
norm in terms of what is like you know

1188
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:00,539
norm in terms of what is like you know
 

1189
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,330
norm in terms of what is like you know
this is what you should do as a poker

1190
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:02,340
this is what you should do as a poker
 

1191
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,770
this is what you should do as a poker
player in the spot he wasn't doing that

1192
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:03,780
player in the spot he wasn't doing that
 

1193
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,750
player in the spot he wasn't doing that
he was doing what he thought was best

1194
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
he was doing what he thought was best
 

1195
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,130
he was doing what he thought was best
and he was doing things outside the norm

1196
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,140
and he was doing things outside the norm
 

1197
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,930
and he was doing things outside the norm
that again in a vacuum you could look at

1198
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:08,940
that again in a vacuum you could look at
 

1199
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,490
that again in a vacuum you could look at
that and you go that that's incorrect

1200
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:10,500
that and you go that that's incorrect
 

1201
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,830
that and you go that that's incorrect
that he should not do that is a

1202
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:12,840
that he should not do that is a
 

1203
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,990
that he should not do that is a
clear-cut mistake even you know the

1204
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,000
clear-cut mistake even you know the
 

1205
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,789
clear-cut mistake even you know the
solvers or the computers or Game Theory

1206
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
solvers or the computers or Game Theory
 

1207
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,169
solvers or the computers or Game Theory
would say this is wrong what he's doing

1208
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:18,179
would say this is wrong what he's doing
 

1209
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,350
would say this is wrong what he's doing
but it's not wrong if he's doing it in a

1210
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
but it's not wrong if he's doing it in a
 

1211
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,029
but it's not wrong if he's doing it in a
way that he's exploiting other players

1212
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,039
way that he's exploiting other players
 

1213
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,510
way that he's exploiting other players
tendencies so for example with him say

1214
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:26,520
tendencies so for example with him say
 

1215
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,370
tendencies so for example with him say
he's playing far too aggressively okay

1216
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:28,380
he's playing far too aggressively okay
 

1217
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,370
he's playing far too aggressively okay
that's not good unless your opponents

1218
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:31,380
that's not good unless your opponents
 

1219
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,350
that's not good unless your opponents
are playing way too passively so if your

1220
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
are playing way too passively so if your
 

1221
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,970
are playing way too passively so if your
opponents are playing passively the

1222
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:34,980
opponents are playing passively the
 

1223
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,230
opponents are playing passively the
answer is to be more aggressive with

1224
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
answer is to be more aggressive with
 

1225
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,970
answer is to be more aggressive with
them and that's I think one of the you

1226
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:37,980
them and that's I think one of the you
 

1227
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,470
them and that's I think one of the you
know biggest advantages he had was he

1228
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:39,480
know biggest advantages he had was he
 

1229
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,169
know biggest advantages he had was he
was willing to do that

1230
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:44,179

 

1231
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:46,730

so in a spot where somebody would make

1232
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:46,740
so in a spot where somebody would make
 

1233
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,010
so in a spot where somebody would make
it a thousand he's he's making it twenty

1234
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,020
it a thousand he's he's making it twenty
 

1235
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,470
it a thousand he's he's making it twenty
two thousand like what what is this this

1236
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:51,480
two thousand like what what is this this
 

1237
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,909
two thousand like what what is this this
makes no sense and then people kind of

1238
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:52,919
makes no sense and then people kind of
 

1239
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,590
makes no sense and then people kind of
know he has nothing but they they're too

1240
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:54,600
know he has nothing but they they're too
 

1241
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,750
know he has nothing but they they're too
afraid to uh call him on it well and

1242
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:56,760
afraid to uh call him on it well and
 

1243
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,490
afraid to uh call him on it well and
then sometimes what happens is this is

1244
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:58,500
then sometimes what happens is this is
 

1245
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,630

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,649
225 000. there's only 75 000 now right
and in theory he should never ever have

1396
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:36,659
and in theory he should never ever have
 

1397
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,990
and in theory he should never ever have
a hand that can do that right so he

1398
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,000
a hand that can do that right so he
 

1399
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,909
a hand that can do that right so he
confused me and I was like okay well

1400
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:40,919
confused me and I was like okay well
 

1401
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,649
confused me and I was like okay well
this guy's aggressive he likes to Bluff

1402

this guy's aggressive he likes to Bluff
 

1403
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:43,850
this guy's aggressive he likes to Bluff
and all this kind of stuff so I made the

1404
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:43,860
and all this kind of stuff so I made the
 

1405
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,890
and all this kind of stuff so I made the
call with the Ace King and he turned

1406
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:45,900
call with the Ace King and he turned
 

1407
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,649
call with the Ace King and he turned
over six eight so we had a straight

1408
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:48,659
over six eight so we had a straight
 

1409
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,350
over six eight so we had a straight
but here's the thing in theory that

1410
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
but here's the thing in theory that
 

1411
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,510
but here's the thing in theory that
River card is bad for him when I call

1415
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,950
the turn I have a lot of the time three
of a kind two pair that just made a full

of a kind two pair that just made a full
 

1417
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,049
of a kind two pair that just made a full
house so he was risking that and the

1418
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:00,059
house so he was risking that and the
 

1419
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,850
house so he was risking that and the
reason he did it was because he thought

1420
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:01,860
reason he did it was because he thought
 

1421
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,909
reason he did it was because he thought
I would perceive him to be bluffing a

I would perceive him to be bluffing a
 

1423
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,430
I would perceive him to be bluffing a
lot so he just went for it and it worked

1424
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
lot so he just went for it and it worked

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
know leads your opponent to think maybe
 

1549
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,890
know leads your opponent to think maybe
you do this more often than you're

1550
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:15,900
you do this more often than you're
 

1551
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,029
you do this more often than you're
supposed to or whatever the case may be

1552
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:17,039
supposed to or whatever the case may be
 

1553
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,269
supposed to or whatever the case may be
but in terms of like controlling

1554
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:20,279
but in terms of like controlling
 

1555
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,430
but in terms of like controlling
um you know

1556
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:22,440
um you know
 

1557
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,409
um you know
what your opponent can think about your

1558
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:24,419
what your opponent can think about your
 

1559
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:25,490
what your opponent can think about your
hands in certain spots I don't really

1560
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:25,500
hands in certain spots I don't really
 

1561
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,690
hands in certain spots I don't really
think it equates that way it doesn't

1562
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:26,700
think it equates that way it doesn't
 

1563
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,250
think it equates that way it doesn't
really you know I think what people do

1564
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:28,260
really you know I think what people do
 

1565
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,330
really you know I think what people do
when they're playing a hand is they

1566
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:29,340
when they're playing a hand is they
 

1567
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,950
when they're playing a hand is they
think in terms of all right

1568
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
think in terms of all right
 

1569
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,409
think in terms of all right
what does my range look like here okay

1570
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:33,419
what does my range look like here okay
 

1571
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,350
what does my range look like here okay
so my range has value so you you look at

1572
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:36,360
so my range has value so you you look at
 

1573
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,730
so my range has value so you you look at
what you know the actual hand you have

1574
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:37,740
what you know the actual hand you have
 

1575
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,310
what you know the actual hand you have
secondarily so you say okay well I could

1576
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
secondarily so you say okay well I could
 

1577
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,470
secondarily so you say okay well I could
have this I could have this I actually

1578
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
have this I could have this I actually
 

1579
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,450
have this I could have this I actually
have this right but I could have all

1580
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:44,460
have this right but I could have all
 

1581
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,649
have this right but I could have all
these hands so my opponent if he's

1582
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:45,659
these hands so my opponent if he's
 

1583
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,330
these hands so my opponent if he's
thinking on a high level he knows I

1584
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:47,340
thinking on a high level he knows I
 

1585
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,830
thinking on a high level he knows I
could have all these hands and I have

1586
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:48,840
could have all these hands and I have
 

1587
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,149
could have all these hands and I have
this one so what do I do with this one

1588
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
this one so what do I do with this one
 

1589
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,310
this one so what do I do with this one
right in the bigger scope of things I

1590
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
right in the bigger scope of things I
 

1591
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,110
right in the bigger scope of things I
guess I'm trying to understand

1592
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,120
guess I'm trying to understand
 

1593
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,590
guess I'm trying to understand
if you're betting isn't a bet pre-flop

1594
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
if you're betting isn't a bet pre-flop
 

1595
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,350
if you're betting isn't a bet pre-flop
your bet doesn't that narrow the hand

1596
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,360
your bet doesn't that narrow the hand
 

1597
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,570
your bet doesn't that narrow the hand
ranges doesn't matter what you have

1598
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:02,580
ranges doesn't matter what you have
 

1599
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,669
ranges doesn't matter what you have
absolutely Narrows the the end

1600
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:04,679
absolutely Narrows the the end
 

1601
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,350
absolutely Narrows the the end
absolutely and if you bet big

1602
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,360
absolutely and if you bet big
 

1603
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,049
absolutely and if you bet big
combined with the perception of you at

1604
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:12,059
combined with the perception of you at
 

1605
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,850
combined with the perception of you at
the table doesn't that represent the

1606
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:13,860
the table doesn't that represent the
 

1607
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,610
the table doesn't that represent the
hand range uh-huh absolutely so like you

1608
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:16,620
hand range uh-huh absolutely so like you
 

1609
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,169
hand range uh-huh absolutely so like you
can with betting essentially control

1610
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:18,179
can with betting essentially control
 

1611
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,870
can with betting essentially control
what people estimate you to have sure so

1612
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
what people estimate you to have sure so
 

1613
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,370
what people estimate you to have sure so
that makes it easy so yeah so that's

1614
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:22,380
that makes it easy so yeah so that's
 

1615
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,710
that makes it easy so yeah so that's
that's true so for example one of the

1616
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
that's true so for example one of the
 

1617
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,649
that's true so for example one of the
most extreme examples is we have uh we

1618
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:27,659
most extreme examples is we have uh we
 

1619
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:28,909
most extreme examples is we have uh we
do there's like there's there's spots

1620
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:28,919
do there's like there's there's spots
 

1621
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,289
do there's like there's there's spots
where there's a bit that's considered

1622
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:30,299
where there's a bit that's considered
 

1623
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,990
where there's a bit that's considered
polarizing right so

1624
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,000
polarizing right so
 

1625
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,490
polarizing right so
let's say there's a thousand in the pot

1626
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,500
let's say there's a thousand in the pot
 

1627
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,470
let's say there's a thousand in the pot
and you bet ten thousand which is crazy

1628
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
and you bet ten thousand which is crazy
 

1629
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,269
and you bet ten thousand which is crazy
big right that's saying one of two

1630
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:38,279
big right that's saying one of two
 

1631
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,190
big right that's saying one of two
things I either have the absolute best

1632
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,200
things I either have the absolute best
 

1633
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,230
things I either have the absolute best
possible hand or absolutely nothing

1634
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,240
possible hand or absolutely nothing
 

1635
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,210
possible hand or absolutely nothing
because any of the hands in the middle I

1636
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:44,220
because any of the hands in the middle I
 

1637
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,409
because any of the hands in the middle I
wouldn't do that with

1638
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:45,419
wouldn't do that with
 

1639
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,630
wouldn't do that with
so I'm essentially telling you when I

1640
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:47,640
so I'm essentially telling you when I
 

1641
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,750
so I'm essentially telling you when I
bet that I'm like I either got it or you

1642
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:50,760
bet that I'm like I either got it or you
 

1643
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,430
bet that I'm like I either got it or you
know I got I don't have a mediocre hand

1644
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,440
know I got I don't have a mediocre hand
 

1645
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,409
know I got I don't have a mediocre hand
like just a pair of nines or a pair of

1646
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:54,419
like just a pair of nines or a pair of
 

1647
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,230
like just a pair of nines or a pair of
tens I have a royal flush or I have nine

1648
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,240
tens I have a royal flush or I have nine
 

1649
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,370
tens I have a royal flush or I have nine
high so with my bet sizing I can control

1650
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:00,380
high so with my bet sizing I can control
 

1651
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,870
high so with my bet sizing I can control
how my opponent is perceiving what my

1652
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
how my opponent is perceiving what my
 

1653
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,490
how my opponent is perceiving what my
range is going to be so for example you

1654
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:04,500
range is going to be so for example you
 

1655
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,370
range is going to be so for example you
know similarly if I bet small right well

1656
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:07,380
know similarly if I bet small right well
 

1657
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,890
know similarly if I bet small right well
that could be a lot of hands right that

1658
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:09,900
that could be a lot of hands right that
 

1659
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,930
that could be a lot of hands right that
can represent a big part of my range

1660
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:11,940
can represent a big part of my range
 

1661
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,149
can represent a big part of my range
the bigger the bet the more uh the

1662
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
the bigger the bet the more uh the
 

1663
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,529
the bigger the bet the more uh the
narrower the range apparently the more

1664
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:15,539
narrower the range apparently the more
 

1665
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,409
narrower the range apparently the more
polarized it is yeah yeah uh

1666
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:18,419
polarized it is yeah yeah uh
 

1667
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,090
polarized it is yeah yeah uh
how far could you get without looking at

1668
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,100
how far could you get without looking at
 

1669
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,529
how far could you get without looking at
your cards do you think how well could

1670
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:21,539
your cards do you think how well could
 

1671
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:22,490
your cards do you think how well could
you do

1672
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:22,500
you do
 

1673
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,470
you do
it depends on who I'm playing with right

1674
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
it depends on who I'm playing with right
 

1675
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,690
it depends on who I'm playing with right
so if I was playing in a tournament with

1676
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:26,700
so if I was playing in a tournament with
 

1677
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,029
so if I was playing in a tournament with
mediocre or weak players I think I could

1678
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
mediocre or weak players I think I could
 

1679
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,310
mediocre or weak players I think I could
probably do pretty well but even like

1680
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:31,320
probably do pretty well but even like
 

1681
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,409
probably do pretty well but even like
world class world class I don't think

1682
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:33,419
world class world class I don't think
 

1683
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:34,909
world class world class I don't think
you'd have much of a chance really I

1684
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:34,919
you'd have much of a chance really I
 

1685
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:36,350
you'd have much of a chance really I
mean the question is trying to get at

1686
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,360
mean the question is trying to get at
 

1687
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,269
mean the question is trying to get at
like how important is it the actual

1688
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:38,279
like how important is it the actual
 

1689
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,390
like how important is it the actual
hands you have versus the the the hands

1690
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:41,400
hands you have versus the the the hands
 

1691
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,769
hands you have versus the the the hands
you're representing right so that's the

1692
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:42,779
you're representing right so that's the
 

1693
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:43,789
you're representing right so that's the
question of essentially if you're not

1694
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:43,799
question of essentially if you're not
 

1695
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,409
question of essentially if you're not
looking at your hand pre-flop you're

1696
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:45,419
looking at your hand pre-flop you're
 

1697
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,149
looking at your hand pre-flop you're
basically giving up in a fundamental

1698
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:47,159
basically giving up in a fundamental
 

1699
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,130
basically giving up in a fundamental
Advantage right where you're you're

1700
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,140
Advantage right where you're you're
 

1701
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,870
Advantage right where you're you're
going to be playing way sub-optimally in

1702
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
going to be playing way sub-optimally in
 

1703
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,010
going to be playing way sub-optimally in
terms of your hand selection right

1704
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,020
terms of your hand selection right
 

1705
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,630
terms of your hand selection right
because you don't look at your hand you

1706
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:53,640
because you don't look at your hand you
 

1707
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,430
because you don't look at your hand you
might have a two and a three that's not

1708
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
might have a two and a three that's not
 

1709
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,470
might have a two and a three that's not
good but now you're playing it so you've

1710
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:57,480
good but now you're playing it so you've
 

1711
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,450
good but now you're playing it so you've
invested whatever two three thousand

1712
00:28:59,450 --> 00:28:59,460
invested whatever two three thousand
 

1713
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,549
invested whatever two three thousand
bucks with absolute garbage and it's

1714
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:01,559
bucks with absolute garbage and it's
 

1715
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,470
bucks with absolute garbage and it's
very difficult to climb that hill right

1716
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:03,480
very difficult to climb that hill right
 

1717
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,269
very difficult to climb that hill right
so it's much better to actually look at

1718
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
so it's much better to actually look at
 

1719
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,470

1723
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,090
the two and three and I'll play the ace

so here's the thing it's you know poker
 

1759
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,190
so here's the thing it's you know poker
players some have said it's unlucky to

1760
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:52,200
players some have said it's unlucky to
 

1761
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,049
players some have said it's unlucky to
be superstitious but we're all a little

1762
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:54,059
be superstitious but we're all a little
 

1763
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,269
be superstitious but we're all a little
bit superstitious a little bit you know

1764
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:56,279
bit superstitious a little bit you know
 

1765
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,190
bit superstitious a little bit you know
and so I don't know maybe it is a case

1766
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,200
and so I don't know maybe it is a case
 

1767
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,649
and so I don't know maybe it is a case
where when I have 10-7 I feel somehow

1768
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:00,659
where when I have 10-7 I feel somehow
 

1769
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,330
where when I have 10-7 I feel somehow
energetically that you know I'm more

1770
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:02,340
energetically that you know I'm more
 

1771
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,769
energetically that you know I'm more
likely to catch something which may

1772
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:03,779
likely to catch something which may
 

1773
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,510
likely to catch something which may
actually make me more apt to be

1774
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
actually make me more apt to be
 

1775
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,610
actually make me more apt to be
aggressive and confident in the hand but

1776
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:07,620
aggressive and confident in the hand but
 

1777
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,830
aggressive and confident in the hand but
but you really shouldn't let yourself do

1778
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
but you really shouldn't let yourself do
 

1779
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,029
but you really shouldn't let yourself do
that like you're not supposed to fall in

1780
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:11,039
that like you're not supposed to fall in
 

1781
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,789
that like you're not supposed to fall in
love with any specific hands yeah but

1782
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:13,799
love with any specific hands yeah but
 

1783
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,190
love with any specific hands yeah but
you know uncertainty

1784
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,200
you know uncertainty
 

1785
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,049
you know uncertainty
is ruthless

1786
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:18,059
is ruthless
 

1787
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,510
is ruthless
and so you know the the fact that it's

1788
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:20,520
and so you know the the fact that it's
 

1789
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,649
and so you know the the fact that it's
uh

1790
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:21,659
uh
 

1791
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,350
uh
um a game of Statistics it

1792
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,360
um a game of Statistics it
 

1793
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,269
um a game of Statistics it
it can be too painful for the human

1794
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:26,279
it can be too painful for the human
 

1795
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,010
it can be too painful for the human
psychology so maybe you have to hold on

1796
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:28,020
psychology so maybe you have to hold on
 

1797
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,649
psychology so maybe you have to hold on
to certain superstitions

1798
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:30,659
to certain superstitions
 

1799
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,289
to certain superstitions
because you know I mean there's there's

1800
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:33,299
because you know I mean there's there's
 

1801
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,330
because you know I mean there's there's
a cold absurdity to the fact that you

1802
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:35,340
a cold absurdity to the fact that you
 

1803
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,130
a cold absurdity to the fact that you
can play up you can play extremely well

1804
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,140
can play up you can play extremely well
 

1805
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,630
can play up you can play extremely well
and still lose

1806
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
and still lose
 

1807
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,769
and still lose

1813
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,470
World Series of Poker and it seems like
at least from the perspective of me

1814
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:51,480
at least from the perspective of me
 

1815
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,210
at least from the perspective of me
looking at it through the internet it

1816
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,220
looking at it through the internet it
 

1817
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,830
looking at it through the internet it
seems like there's a lot of hands that

1818
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:54,840
seems like there's a lot of hands that
 

1819
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,789
seems like there's a lot of hands that
you were like 70 30 80 20 uh all in

1820
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:58,799
you were like 70 30 80 20 uh all in
 

1821
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,250
you were like 70 30 80 20 uh all in
hands that you just did not we're not

1822
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,260
hands that you just did not we're not
 

1823
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,590
hands that you just did not we're not
going your way that can sort of break

1824
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
going your way that can sort of break
 

1825
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,269
going your way that can sort of break
you mentally absolutely

1826
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
you mentally absolutely
 

1827
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,710
you mentally absolutely
yeah one of the hardest things

1828
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
yeah one of the hardest things
 

1829
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,029
yeah one of the hardest things
especially about playing because cash

1830
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:08,039
especially about playing because cash
 

1831
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,889
especially about playing because cash
games and tournaments are different one

1832
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:09,899
games and tournaments are different one
 

1833
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,149
games and tournaments are different one
of the most difficult things about you

1834
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:11,159
of the most difficult things about you
 

1835
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,590
of the most difficult things about you
know being a tournament player is

1836
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:12,600
know being a tournament player is
 

1837
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,630
know being a tournament player is
resilience because more often than not

1838
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
resilience because more often than not
 

1839
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,250
resilience because more often than not
like so if there's a tournament with a

1840
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:16,260
like so if there's a tournament with a
 

1841
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,049
like so if there's a tournament with a
thousand people to win the tournament

1842
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:18,059
thousand people to win the tournament
 

1843
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,610
thousand people to win the tournament
you have to get all of the chips that

1844
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:19,620
you have to get all of the chips that
 

1845
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,010
you have to get all of the chips that
means there's one winner and 999 losers

1846
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,020
means there's one winner and 999 losers
 

1847
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,590
means there's one winner and 999 losers
so it's very rare that you actually like

1848
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:24,600
so it's very rare that you actually like
 

1849
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,210
so it's very rare that you actually like
win all the chips so you're essentially

1850
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,220
win all the chips so you're essentially
 

1851
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,070
win all the chips so you're essentially
at some point in every tournament you

1852

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:14,460
as well you don't if you get screwed
 

1899
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,310
as well you don't if you get screwed
over over and over it's hard to know if

1900
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,320
over over and over it's hard to know if
 

1901
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,810

they did a study I remember there was

1906
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:21,600
they did a study I remember there was
 

1907
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,970
they did a study I remember there was
like a study it was supposed to be

1908
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:22,980
like a study it was supposed to be
 

1909
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,769
like a study it was supposed to be
related to gambling but it was mice and

1910
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:24,779
related to gambling but it was mice and
 

1911
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,389
related to gambling but it was mice and
they put them in a little maze and

1912
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
they put them in a little maze and
 

1913
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,130
they put them in a little maze and
they'd go down these three tubes and

1914
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,140
they'd go down these three tubes and
 

1915
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,630
they'd go down these three tubes and
they go down this one tube and there'd

1916
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:29,640
they go down this one tube and there'd
 

1917
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,669
they go down this one tube and there'd
be cheese right and then they'd go down

1918
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:31,679
be cheese right and then they'd go down
 

1919
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,830
be cheese right and then they'd go down
again cheese three times in a row there

1920
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
again cheese three times in a row there
 

1921
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,690
again cheese three times in a row there
was cheese there right the next time

1922
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:35,700
was cheese there right the next time
 

1923
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,669
was cheese there right the next time
there was an electric shock there not

1924
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
there was an electric shock there not
 

1925
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,350
there was an electric shock there not
cheese

1926
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360

you're playing so many days is are you
 

2427
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,990
you're playing so many days is are you
trying to ignore the results and stick

2428
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:15,000
trying to ignore the results and stick
 

2429
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,870
trying to ignore the results and stick
to a particular strategy yes for the

2430
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:17,880
to a particular strategy yes for the
 

2431
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,450
to a particular strategy yes for the
most part you know what I'm trying to do

2432
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:20,460
most part you know what I'm trying to do
 

2433
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,670
most part you know what I'm trying to do
is like if I formulate a strategy for

2434
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:22,680
is like if I formulate a strategy for
 

2435
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,810
is like if I formulate a strategy for
the whole seven weeks because there's a

2436
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:23,820
the whole seven weeks because there's a
 

2437
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,550
the whole seven weeks because there's a
very there's a varying degree of buy-ins

2438
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:25,560
very there's a varying degree of buy-ins
 

2439
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,010
very there's a varying degree of buy-ins
too like you have small ones like 1500

2440
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:28,020
too like you have small ones like 1500
 

2441
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,130
too like you have small ones like 1500
then you got like 250 000 buy-in so I

2442
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:31,140
then you got like 250 000 buy-in so I
 

2443
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,089
then you got like 250 000 buy-in so I
map out

2444
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:32,099
map out
 

2445
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,190
map out
the seven weeks and right I'll give a

2446
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,200
the seven weeks and right I'll give a
 

2447
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,870
the seven weeks and right I'll give a
little bit of mental energy to the 1500

2448
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:35,880
little bit of mental energy to the 1500
 

2449
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,910
little bit of mental energy to the 1500
which means I'll be on my phone I'm not

2450
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
which means I'll be on my phone I'm not

yeah I realized like surprising because

3044
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:03,960
yeah I realized like surprising because
 

3045
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,750
yeah I realized like surprising because
like you're so regimented yeah outside

3046
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:05,760
like you're so regimented yeah outside
 

3047
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,210
like you're so regimented yeah outside
of that it's really difficult like I've

3048
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:08,220
of that it's really difficult like I've
 

3049
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,470
of that it's really difficult like I've
done it before where I played the World

3050
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:09,480
done it before where I played the World
 

3051
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,530
done it before where I played the World
Series of Poker and I made it a point to

3052
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:12,540
Series of Poker and I made it a point to
 

3053
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,970
Series of Poker and I made it a point to
work out every day but what that did was

3054
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:13,980
work out every day but what that did was
 

3055
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,490
work out every day but what that did was
it sacrificed sleep yeah so then I found

3056
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:16,500
it sacrificed sleep yeah so then I found
 

3057
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,950
it sacrificed sleep yeah so then I found
like at 1am I would be more tired you

3058
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:18,960
like at 1am I would be more tired you
 

3059
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,329
like at 1am I would be more tired you
know because I've spending more energy

3060
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:20,339
know because I've spending more energy
 

3061
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:22,370
know because I've spending more energy
than I would otherwise so I essentially

3062
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:22,380
than I would otherwise so I essentially
 

3063
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,109
than I would otherwise so I essentially
like look at the World Series the six

3064
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:24,119

in that regard can make you like a
 

3531
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:02,930
in that regard can make you like a
really good player even if you aren't

01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,670
all that talented or gifted part having
a good work ethic is a talent right not

a good work ethic is a talent right not
 

3537
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,990
a good work ethic is a talent right not
necessarily card sense but if you're

01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:09,000
necessarily card sense but if you're

3542
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:12,540
and and study from these solvers you
 

3543
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,450
and and study from these solvers you
essentially have the perfect study tool

3544

now that you know that we didn't have in
my day so what do the solvers give you

3548
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:19,079
my day so what do the solvers give you
 

3549
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:22,069
my day so what do the solvers give you
the do you start to memorize the optimal

3550
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:22,079
the do you start to memorize the optimal

the solvers are imperfect as well in

3556
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,040
the solvers are imperfect as well in
 

3557
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,730
the solvers are imperfect as well in
terms of the way the humans uh utilize

3558
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:31,740
terms of the way the humans uh utilize
 

3559
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,270
terms of the way the humans uh utilize
them right because you can give solvers

3560
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:34,280
them right because you can give solvers
 

3561
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,309
them right because you can give solvers
a certain number of inputs in terms of

01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:37,319
a certain number of inputs in terms of
 

3563
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:39,349
a certain number of inputs in terms of
what you want to solve but a solver can

01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:39,359
what you want to solve but a solver can
 

3565
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,630
what you want to solve but a solver can
think on many many levels so for example

3566
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:41,640
think on many many levels so for example
 

3567
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,970
think on many many levels so for example
the way that a typical player would do a

best 10 of the pot but but when you're

best 10 of the pot but but when you're
 

3595

best 10 of the pot but but when you're
putting in a solve you can only put in

putting in a solve you can only put in
you know specific parameters so that's

3639
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:00,950
a solver but you also have to
incorporate

3640
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:00,960
incorporate
 

3641
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,930

01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,890
you have the ability or a desire to buy
in all those kinds of things so you have

3654
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:15,900
in all those kinds of things so you have
 

3655
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,049
in all those kinds of things so you have
to calculate all of that right so the

3656
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:18,059
to calculate all of that right so the
 

3657
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:19,490
to calculate all of that right so the
you know so the solver will do that

3658
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:19,500
you know so the solver will do that
 

3659
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,710
you know so the solver will do that
right and essentially you don't input

3660
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:21,720
right and essentially you don't input
 

3661
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,910
right and essentially you don't input
your hand

3662
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:22,920
your hand
 

3663
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,010
your hand
it tells you you'll look at you'll look

3664
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:25,020
it tells you you'll look at you'll look
 

3665
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,809
it tells you you'll look at you'll look
at the grade and be like oh this is my

3666
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:26,819
at the grade and be like oh this is my
 

3667
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:28,309
at the grade and be like oh this is my
hand and it tells you what it is but it

3668
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
hand and it tells you what it is but it
 

3669
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,329
hand and it tells you what it is but it
tells you what you what you would do

3670
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:29,339
tells you what you what you would do
 

3671
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:31,549
tells you what you what you would do
with any hand right it gives you the

3672
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:31,559
with any hand right it gives you the
 

3673
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:33,170
with any hand right it gives you the
full output and that actually gives you

3674
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:33,180
full output and that actually gives you
 

3675
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,329
full output and that actually gives you
a better idea because you're ultimately

3676

they're like this has to be wrong but

3698
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:55,920
they're like this has to be wrong but
 

3699
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,730
they're like this has to be wrong but
really it wasn't so for example a solver

3700
01:02:58,730 --> 01:02:58,740
really it wasn't so for example a solver
 

3701
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,349
really it wasn't so for example a solver
may say this right

01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:00,359
may say this right

you let's say you bet on the end

3704
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:02,520
you let's say you bet on the end
 

3705
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,230
you let's say you bet on the end
and you bet a lot and a solver may say

3706
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,240
and you bet a lot and a solver may say
 

3707
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,030
and you bet a lot and a solver may say
you should fold here with a pair of

3708
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:08,040
you should fold here with a pair of
 

3709
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,950
you should fold here with a pair of
kings and a queen kicker

3710
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:09,960
kings and a queen kicker
 

3711
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,230
kings and a queen kicker
which is you know a pair of kings but

3712
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:12,240
which is you know a pair of kings but
 

3713
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,210
which is you know a pair of kings but
call with a pair of fours and an a

call with a pair of fours and an a
 

3715
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,370
call with a pair of fours and an a
squared so it's essentially telling you

3716
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:16,380
squared so it's essentially telling you
 

3717
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,010
squared so it's essentially telling you
that you should fold this pan that is

3718
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:19,020
that you should fold this pan that is
 

3719
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,589
that you should fold this pan that is
much better than this so it it begs the

01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:21,599
much better than this so it it begs the
 

3721
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,030
much better than this so it it begs the
question why

3722
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:23,040
question why
 

3723
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,609
question why
because what the solvers do is they use

3724
01:03:25,609 --> 01:03:25,619
because what the solvers do is they use
 

3725
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,609
because what the solvers do is they use
the information of your own cards to

3726
01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:28,619
the information of your own cards to
 

3727
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:30,530
the information of your own cards to
formulate all the possible hands your

3728
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:30,540
formulate all the possible hands your
 

3729
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,970
formulate all the possible hands your
opponent can have

3730
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:31,980
opponent can have
 

3731
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,910
opponent can have
so if your opponent is so basically if

3732
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:34,920
so if your opponent is so basically if
 

3733
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,470
so if your opponent is so basically if
you had the king queen

3734
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,480
you had the king queen
 

3735
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,930
you had the king queen
you know it may say

3736
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:38,940
you know it may say
 

3737
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,710
you know it may say
um

3738
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:39,720
um
 

3739
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,410
um
for lack of better nerdy term it blocks

3740
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:42,420
for lack of better nerdy term it blocks
 

3741
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,730
for lack of better nerdy term it blocks
potential bluffing hands that your

3742
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:43,740
potential bluffing hands that your
 

3743
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,010
potential bluffing hands that your
opponent can have so let's say if your

3744
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:46,020
opponent can have so let's say if your
 

3745
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,870
opponent can have so let's say if your
opponent would Bluff with Queen Jack but

3746
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:47,880
opponent would Bluff with Queen Jack but
 

3747
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,670
opponent would Bluff with Queen Jack but
you have a queen so there are less

3748
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:49,680
you have a queen so there are less
 

3749
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,829
you have a queen so there are less
combinations of Queen Jack so it will

3750
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:51,839
combinations of Queen Jack so it will
 

3751
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,690
combinations of Queen Jack so it will
find a better Bluff catcher if you will

3752
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:53,700
find a better Bluff catcher if you will
 

3753
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,030
find a better Bluff catcher if you will
so that's what's really not intuitive to

3754
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:56,040
so that's what's really not intuitive to
 

3755
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,410
so that's what's really not intuitive to

01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:14,940
maybe in poker it's a little bit easier
 

3773
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,910
maybe in poker it's a little bit easier
but in the case of go and chess it's not

one of the best ways to learn poker is

one of the best ways to learn poker is
 

3783
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,430
one of the best ways to learn poker is
when you see a solver output and it

3784
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440
when you see a solver output and it
 

3785
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,049
when you see a solver output and it
tells you one of these things try to

01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:27,059
tells you one of these things try to
 

3787
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:29,690
tells you one of these things try to
figure out why why does this solver do

3788
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:29,700
figure out why why does this solver do
 

3789
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,430
figure out why why does this solver do
this why does it want you to call with

01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:31,440
this why does it want you to call with
 

3791
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,109
this why does it want you to call with

01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:13,140
intimidated because I didn't know how to
 

3833
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,870
intimidated because I didn't know how to
use it I don't I don't know how to do an

3834
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:14,880
use it I don't I don't know how to do an
 

3835
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,150
use it I don't I don't know how to do an
input so I had two guys one guy's a data

3836
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:17,160
input so I had two guys one guy's a data
 

3837
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,410
input so I had two guys one guy's a data
scientist and you know and other guys

3838
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:18,420
scientist and you know and other guys
 

3839
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,450
scientist and you know and other guys
like a you know poker Savant if you will

3840
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:20,460
like a you know poker Savant if you will
 

3841
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,910
like a you know poker Savant if you will
and they coached me and they did it so

3842
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:22,920
and they coached me and they did it so
 

3843
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,730
and they coached me and they did it so
today if I was in a tough spot you know

3844
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:25,740
today if I was in a tough spot you know
 

3845
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,690
today if I was in a tough spot you know
and I'm like I don't know what would a

3846
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:26,700
and I'm like I don't know what would a
 

3847
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,210
and I'm like I don't know what would a
solver do I will send them the hand and

3848
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:29,220
solver do I will send them the hand and
 

3849
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,309
solver do I will send them the hand and
they'll run the solve for me and then

3850
01:05:31,309 --> 01:05:31,319
they'll run the solve for me and then
 

3851
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:32,809
they'll run the solve for me and then
sort of give me the parameters of what

3852
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:32,819
sort of give me the parameters of what
 

3853
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:34,670
sort of give me the parameters of what
to do when I was playing you know

3854
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:34,680
to do when I was playing you know
 

3855
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,950
to do when I was playing you know
regularly using solvers with them we

3856
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
regularly using solvers with them we
 

3857
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,270
regularly using solvers with them we
were spending six to eight hours a day

3858
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:38,280
were spending six to eight hours a day
 

3859
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,609
were spending six to eight hours a day
going over all these solves so

3860
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:40,619
going over all these solves so
 

3861
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:42,770
going over all these solves so
intuitively I started to think and learn

3862
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:42,780
intuitively I started to think and learn
 

3863
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,450
intuitively I started to think and learn
about what the solver would want but I

3864
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:44,460
about what the solver would want but I
 

3865
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,829
about what the solver would want but I
sort of understand where Magnus is

3866
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
sort of understand where Magnus is
 

3867
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,390
sort of understand where Magnus is
coming from in that you don't want to

3868
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:47,400
coming from in that you don't want to
 

3869
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,370
coming from in that you don't want to
become a slave to the Sim as I say right

3870
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:49,380
become a slave to the Sim as I say right
 

3871
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,589
become a slave to the Sim as I say right
there's one kid I know I joked with him

3872
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:51,599
there's one kid I know I joked with him
 

3873
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,870
there's one kid I know I joked with him
his name is Landon Tice and uh you know

3874
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:53,880
his name is Landon Tice and uh you know
 

3875
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,270
his name is Landon Tice and uh you know
he made a play that the Sim you know

3876
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:56,280
he made a play that the Sim you know
 

3877
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,250
he made a play that the Sim you know
would say this is is a good play but I'm

3878
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:58,260
would say this is is a good play but I'm
 

3879
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,530
would say this is is a good play but I'm
like it's a good play you know in a

3880
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:00,540
like it's a good play you know in a
 

3881
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,030
like it's a good play you know in a
simulated World against the robot but

3882
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:02,040
simulated World against the robot but
 

3883
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,130
simulated World against the robot but
it's not in practice against the human

3884
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:04,140
it's not in practice against the human
 

3885
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,130
it's not in practice against the human
right you don't need to be doing that so

3886
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:07,140
right you don't need to be doing that so
 

3887
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,990
right you don't need to be doing that so
if you become a slave to the sin and

3888
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:09,000
if you become a slave to the sin and
 

3889
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,390
if you become a slave to the sin and
always do what the Sim says you you're

3890
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:11,400
always do what the Sim says you you're
 

3891
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,490
always do what the Sim says you you're
you're handcuffed to a certain degree is

3892
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:13,500
you're handcuffed to a certain degree is
 

3893
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,190
you're handcuffed to a certain degree is
there some at the highest level plays

3894
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:16,200
there some at the highest level plays
 

3895
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,190
there some at the highest level plays
there's still a role for feel 100 ocean

3896
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,200
there's still a role for feel 100 ocean
 

3897
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,230
there's still a role for feel 100 ocean
absolutely if you're not doing that

3898
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:21,240
absolutely if you're not doing that
 

3899
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,329
absolutely if you're not doing that
because here's the thing right no human

3900
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:23,339
because here's the thing right no human
 

3901
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:25,910
because here's the thing right no human
being plays perfectly balanced in game

3902
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:25,920
being plays perfectly balanced in game
 

3903
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,890
being plays perfectly balanced in game
three optimal like a robot would they're

3904
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:27,900
three optimal like a robot would they're
 

3905
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,750
three optimal like a robot would they're
they're not right so there are

3906
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
they're not right so there are
 

3907
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,130
they're not right so there are
opportunities there to take advantage of

3908
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:31,140
opportunities there to take advantage of
 

3909
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,270
opportunities there to take advantage of
the things that they do that are

3910
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:32,280
the things that they do that are
 

3911
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,029
the things that they do that are
slightly too aggressive or less

3912
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:35,039
slightly too aggressive or less
 

3913
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,789
slightly too aggressive or less
aggressive you know for example say most

3914
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:37,799
aggressive you know for example say most
 

3915
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:40,309
aggressive you know for example say most
human beings don't Bluff enough in a

3916
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
human beings don't Bluff enough in a
 

3917
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,289
human beings don't Bluff enough in a
certain spot so you don't have to call

3918
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:42,299
certain spot so you don't have to call
 

3919
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,930
certain spot so you don't have to call
with the correct range of hands you

3920
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:44,940
with the correct range of hands you
 

3921
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,250
with the correct range of hands you
don't have to because they're not

3922
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:46,260
don't have to because they're not
 

3923
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,349
don't have to because they're not
bluffing at the optimal frequency so you

3924
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:48,359
bluffing at the optimal frequency so you
 

3925
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:50,029
bluffing at the optimal frequency so you
don't have to call the optimal frequency

3926
01:06:50,029 --> 01:06:50,039
don't have to call the optimal frequency
 

3927
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,430
don't have to call the optimal frequency
you'd be making this mistake frankly if

3928
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:52,440
you'd be making this mistake frankly if
 

3929
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,690
you'd be making this mistake frankly if
you did

3930
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:53,700
you did
 

3931
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,870
you did
what's the difference between in-person

3932
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:56,880
what's the difference between in-person
 

3933
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,930
what's the difference between in-person
and online play Given that context yeah

3934
01:06:59,930 --> 01:06:59,940
and online play Given that context yeah
 

3935
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,329
and online play Given that context yeah
well online poker and live poker it's

3936
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:02,339
well online poker and live poker it's
 

3937
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:04,549
well online poker and live poker it's
the same game right same it's poker but

3938
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:04,559
the same game right same it's poker but
 

3939
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,430
the same game right same it's poker but
it's different in so many levels right

3940
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,440
it's different in so many levels right
 

3941
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,230
it's different in so many levels right
um I think playing online you have to

3942
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:09,240
um I think playing online you have to
 

3943
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,329
um I think playing online you have to
focus far more on fundamentals you know

3944
01:07:11,329 --> 01:07:11,339
focus far more on fundamentals you know
 

3945
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:13,250
focus far more on fundamentals you know
on Game Theory you don't have the added

3946
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:13,260
on Game Theory you don't have the added
 

3947
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,230
on Game Theory you don't have the added
bonus of looking across the table and

3948
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:15,240
bonus of looking across the table and
 

3949
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,549
bonus of looking across the table and
getting any sense of whether your

3950
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:16,559
getting any sense of whether your
 

3951
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,770
getting any sense of whether your
opponent is strong or weak they're

3952
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:18,780
opponent is strong or weak they're
 

3953
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,829
opponent is strong or weak they're
bluffing whatever you know and and also

3954
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:21,839
bluffing whatever you know and and also
 

3955
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,529
bluffing whatever you know and and also
because online poker those that play it

3956
01:07:24,529 --> 01:07:24,539
because online poker those that play it
 

3957
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:27,470
because online poker those that play it
you play far more hands like some of

3958
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:27,480
you play far more hands like some of
 

3959
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,210
you play far more hands like some of
these guys are playing 10 20 tables at

3960
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:29,220
these guys are playing 10 20 tables at
 

3961
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,950
these guys are playing 10 20 tables at
the same time yeah right so you're just

3962
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:30,960
the same time yeah right so you're just
 

3963
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,210
the same time yeah right so you're just
you're hitting the long run really

3964
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:32,220
you're hitting the long run really
 

3965
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,650
you're hitting the long run really
quickly and you're creating a database

3966
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:33,660
quickly and you're creating a database
 

3967
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,809
quickly and you're creating a database
on your opponents right so let's have

3968
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:35,819
on your opponents right so let's have
 

3969
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,670
on your opponents right so let's have
you know online I can see your data I'm

3970
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:37,680
you know online I can see your data I'm
 

3971
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,770
you know online I can see your data I'm
like well this guy he's playing 40 of

3972
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:39,780
like well this guy he's playing 40 of
 

3973
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,010
like well this guy he's playing 40 of
hands he's betting the river 80 of the

3974
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:43,020
hands he's betting the river 80 of the
 

3975
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,529
hands he's betting the river 80 of the
time so now I can use that data and you

3976
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:45,539
time so now I can use that data and you
 

3977
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:46,730
time so now I can use that data and you
know explain you that way when you play

3978
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:46,740
know explain you that way when you play
 

3979
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,890
know explain you that way when you play
Live you don't have that

3980
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:48,900
Live you don't have that
 

3981
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:52,130
Live you don't have that
do you enjoy playing online I enjoy so

3982
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:52,140

what's actually happening you know it's
a different mindset required like a lot

4004
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:13,680
a different mindset required like a lot
 

4005
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,170
a different mindset required like a lot
of these young guys they're accustomed

4006
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:15,180
of these young guys they're accustomed
 

4007
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,329
of these young guys they're accustomed
to 20 tables at a time

to 20 tables at a time
 

4009
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:19,849
to 20 tables at a time
it feels like the purity of the game is

4010
01:08:19,849 --> 01:08:19,859
it feels like the purity of the game is
 

4011
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:22,370
it feels like the purity of the game is
gone it's much more robotic right so if

4012
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:22,380
gone it's much more robotic right so if
 

4013
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,349
gone it's much more robotic right so if
you're playing 20 tables you're just

4014
01:08:24,349 --> 01:08:24,359
you're playing 20 tables you're just
 

4015
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:26,090
you're playing 20 tables you're just
making decisions based on like what you

4016
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:26,100
making decisions based on like what you
 

4017
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,910
making decisions based on like what you
know you're not thinking about the the

4018
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:28,920
know you're not thinking about the the
 

4019
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,709
know you're not thinking about the the
depth of the situation and what just

4020
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:30,719
depth of the situation and what just
 

4021
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:31,970
depth of the situation and what just
happened 15 minutes ago you don't even

4022
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:31,980
happened 15 minutes ago you don't even
 

4023
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,229
happened 15 minutes ago you don't even
know what happened because you can't pay

4024
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:33,239
know what happened because you can't pay
 

4025
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:35,150
know what happened because you can't pay
attention to all that at once

4026
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:35,160
attention to all that at once
 

4027
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,950
attention to all that at once
and some of the magic of Poker is the

4028
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:36,960
and some of the magic of Poker is the
 

4029
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,930
and some of the magic of Poker is the
little sample I agree like for example

4030
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:38,940
little sample I agree like for example
 

4031
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,150
little sample I agree like for example
in sorry to be bringing up Magnus so

4032
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:41,160
in sorry to be bringing up Magnus so
 

4033
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,169
in sorry to be bringing up Magnus so
much but there's so much parallel

4034
01:08:42,169 --> 01:08:42,179
much but there's so much parallel
 

4035
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:44,030
much but there's so much parallel
between the two of you and the poker in

4036
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:44,040
between the two of you and the poker in
 

4037
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,470
between the two of you and the poker in
the Chess World

4038
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:45,480
the Chess World
 

4039
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,410
the Chess World
he hates Olympics and World

4040
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:48,420
he hates Olympics and World
 

4041
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,090
he hates Olympics and World
Championships and all that kind of stuff

4042
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:50,100
Championships and all that kind of stuff
 

4043
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,309
Championships and all that kind of stuff
because it's so low sample but to me

4044
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
because it's so low sample but to me
 

4045
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,870
because it's so low sample but to me
that's part of the magic of it there's

4046
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:53,880
that's part of the magic of it there's
 

4047
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,209
that's part of the magic of it there's
the World Series of Poker the main event

4048
01:08:56,209 --> 01:08:56,219
the World Series of Poker the main event
 

4049
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:59,689
the World Series of Poker the main event
there's a magic to it I agree yeah and I

4050
01:08:59,689 --> 01:08:59,699
there's a magic to it I agree yeah and I
 

4051
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:01,189
there's a magic to it I agree yeah and I
don't know what that is exactly because

4052
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
don't know what that is exactly because
 

4053
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,650
don't know what that is exactly because
so much at stake is so rare

4054
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:03,660
so much at stake is so rare
 

4055
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:07,729
so much at stake is so rare
so much drama and heartbreak leading up

4056
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:07,739
so much drama and heartbreak leading up
 

4057
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:09,950
so much drama and heartbreak leading up
to it that all somehow uh

4058
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:09,960
to it that all somehow uh
 

4059
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,189
to it that all somehow uh
yeah it it accumulates to

4060
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:13,199
yeah it it accumulates to
 

4061
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,229
yeah it it accumulates to
that magical moment when somebody wins

4062
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:15,239
that magical moment when somebody wins
 

4063
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:16,910
that magical moment when somebody wins
especially that event the World Series

poker Main Event historically like
 

4067
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,090
poker Main Event historically like
that's it you know that's the Pinnacle

4068
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:20,100
that's it you know that's the Pinnacle
 

4069
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,590
that's it you know that's the Pinnacle
that's where like mainstream watches

4070
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:21,600
that's where like mainstream watches
 

4071
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,570
that's where like mainstream watches
that's where people are tuning in and

4072

that's where people are tuning in and
 

4073
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,910
that's where people are tuning in and
the gravity of the moment you know it's

4074
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920
the gravity of the moment you know it's
 

4075
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,110
the gravity of the moment you know it's
so much bigger than people like everyone

4076
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,120
so much bigger than people like everyone

01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:31,259
quarterback too right oh he should do
 

4081
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:33,169
quarterback too right oh he should do
this you're not there you're not under

4082
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:33,179
this you're not there you're not under
 

4083
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:34,550
this you're not there you're not under
the lights you're not under the pressure

4084
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
the lights you're not under the pressure
 

4085
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,769
the lights you're not under the pressure
you know it might seem easy for you at

4086
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:36,779
you know it might seem easy for you at
 

4087
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:38,450
you know it might seem easy for you at
home to be like well yeah because you

4088
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:38,460
home to be like well yeah because you
 

4089
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:39,890
home to be like well yeah because you
can see the whole cards you know they

4090
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:39,900
can see the whole cards you know they
 

4091
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,070
can see the whole cards you know they
can't certainly the idea of

4092
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:43,080
can't certainly the idea of
 

4093
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,749
can't certainly the idea of
the small sample with tournaments I like

4094
01:09:44,749 --> 01:09:44,759
the small sample with tournaments I like
 

4095
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:46,789
the small sample with tournaments I like
the idea that

4096
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:46,799
the idea that
 

4097
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:50,390
the idea that
you don't have to worry about oh well if

4098
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,400
you don't have to worry about oh well if
 

4099
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,150
you don't have to worry about oh well if
I do this now then in the future you

4100
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:53,160
I do this now then in the future you
 

4101
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,530
I do this now then in the future you
know I won't be balanced I have to be

4102
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:54,540
know I won't be balanced I have to be
 

4103
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,669
know I won't be balanced I have to be
balanced here or anything like that

4104
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:55,679
balanced here or anything like that
 

4105
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,650
balanced here or anything like that
that's like really boring and lame right

4106
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:57,660
that's like really boring and lame right
 

4107
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,050
that's like really boring and lame right
again that is kind of the way the

4108
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:00,060
again that is kind of the way the
 

4109
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,430
again that is kind of the way the
younger generation learns how to play

4110
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:01,440
younger generation learns how to play
 

4111
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,669
younger generation learns how to play
the game being balanced in every spot

4112
01:10:04,669 --> 01:10:04,679
the game being balanced in every spot
 

4113
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:07,970
the game being balanced in every spot
um and then randomizing you know like oh

4114
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:07,980
um and then randomizing you know like oh
 

4115
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,470
um and then randomizing you know like oh
I'm supposed to do this 50 of time okay

4116
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:09,480
I'm supposed to do this 50 of time okay
 

4117
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,470
I'm supposed to do this 50 of time okay
so if my left card is red I'll do it and

4118
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:12,480
so if my left card is red I'll do it and
 

4119
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,790
so if my left card is red I'll do it and
if it's black I don't so you're not even

4120
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:13,800
if it's black I don't so you're not even
 

4121
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,530
if it's black I don't so you're not even
making you're no longer making actual

4122
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:15,540
making you're no longer making actual
 

4123
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,390
making you're no longer making actual
decisions for yourself you're just

4124
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:17,400
decisions for yourself you're just
 

4125
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,330
decisions for yourself you're just
randomizing and that's way less fun for

4126
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:20,340
randomizing and that's way less fun for
 

4127
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,729
randomizing and that's way less fun for
me than tailoring it to the situation

4128
01:10:22,729 --> 01:10:22,739
me than tailoring it to the situation
 

4129
01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:24,709
me than tailoring it to the situation
and the final table at the main event

4130
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
and the final table at the main event
 

4131
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,930
and the final table at the main event
there's none of that you have to I mean

4132
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:26,940
there's none of that you have to I mean
 

4133
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,669
there's none of that you have to I mean
it's It's All or Nothing well you

4134
01:10:28,669 --> 01:10:28,679
it's It's All or Nothing well you

well if I'm gonna make a mistake what's
the point

4608
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:23,400
the point
 

4609
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,149
the point
what's the point right I'm trying like

point in playing at all yeah so he was

4614
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:29,219
point in playing at all yeah so he was
 

4615
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:30,709
point in playing at all yeah so he was
that he was extreme in that regard and

4616
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:30,719
that he was extreme in that regard and
 

4617
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,870
that he was extreme in that regard and
the way that he viewed it and depending

4618
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880
the way that he viewed it and depending
 

4619
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,030
the way that he viewed it and depending
on the sport those folks like in chess

against a guy like that so uh he gets
 

4701
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,370
against a guy like that so uh he gets
great reads and is able to execute on

4708
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:15,060
he he also I think one thing I'm
 

4709
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,209
he he also I think one thing I'm
underselling too is his strategic mind

4710
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:17,219
underselling too is his strategic mind
 

4711
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:19,910
underselling too is his strategic mind
right like I believe that

4712
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:19,920
right like I believe that
 

4713
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,610
right like I believe that
you know like I said the new age player

4714
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:22,620
you know like I said the new age player
 

4715
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,930
you know like I said the new age player
they learn how to play through a very

4716
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:23,940
they learn how to play through a very
 

4717
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,090
they learn how to play through a very
systematic approach okay let's look at

4718
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:26,100
systematic approach okay let's look at
 

4719
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,149
systematic approach okay let's look at
the data the make up a game right now

4720
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:29,159
the data the make up a game right now
 

4721
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:31,070
the data the make up a game right now
three cards we each get three cards

4722
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:31,080
three cards we each get three cards
 

4723
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,490
three cards we each get three cards
Jacks Are Wild sixes are you know six of

4724
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:34,500
Jacks Are Wild sixes are you know six of
 

4725
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,290
Jacks Are Wild sixes are you know six of
Hearts as well right just make up that

4726
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:36,300
Hearts as well right just make up that
 

4727
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,350
Hearts as well right just make up that
game Phil will figure it out intuitively

4728
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
game Phil will figure it out intuitively
 

4729
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,990
game Phil will figure it out intuitively
very very quickly right without having

4730
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:42,000
very very quickly right without having
 

4731
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,390
very very quickly right without having
the answers for him right so that's like

4732
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,400
the answers for him right so that's like
 

4733
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,070
the answers for him right so that's like
the difference between the players in my

4734
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
the difference between the players in my
 

4735
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,750
the difference between the players in my
generation we had to figure this stuff

4736
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:47,760
generation we had to figure this stuff
 

4737
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,450
generation we had to figure this stuff
out on our own today oh I want to know

4738
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:50,460
out on our own today oh I want to know
 

4739
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,130
out on our own today oh I want to know
the answer I go ask the computer and the

4740
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:52,140
the answer I go ask the computer and the
 

4741
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,930
the answer I go ask the computer and the
computer tells me so I really believe

4742
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:53,940
computer tells me so I really believe
 

4743
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,550
computer tells me so I really believe
like if you created a game from scratch

against specific types of players who
 

5011
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:24,290
against specific types of players who
are intimidated by him but whether it's

some people they don't they don't like

5026
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:36,960
some people they don't they don't like
 

5027
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,830
some people they don't they don't like
that so he can use that uh against them

5028
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:39,840
that so he can use that uh against them
 

5029
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,870
that so he can use that uh against them
but I also think too like

cares so much
 

5035
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,689
cares so much
right and that leads to trying really

5036
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:47,699
right and that leads to trying really
 

5037
01:25:47,699 --> 01:25:49,550
right and that leads to trying really
really hard like he sees these moments

5038
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:49,560
really hard like he sees these moments
 

5039
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,169
really hard like he sees these moments
and he doesn't phone him in like

5040
01:25:51,169 --> 01:25:51,179
and he doesn't phone him in like
 

5041
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,689
and he doesn't phone him in like
whatever brand of Poker he plays he

01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:53,699
whatever brand of Poker he plays he
 

5043
01:25:53,699 --> 01:25:56,270
whatever brand of Poker he plays he
tries his best at all times to to

01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:56,280
tries his best at all times to to
 

5045
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,649
tries his best at all times to to
succeed and to win and there's something

5046
01:25:57,649 --> 01:25:57,659
succeed and to win and there's something
 

5047
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:58,970
succeed and to win and there's something
to be even though like he's

5048
01:25:58,970 --> 01:25:58,980
to be even though like he's
 

5049
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,590
to be even though like he's

01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:51,600
with the lights and I think a lot of
 

5509
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,570
with the lights and I think a lot of
people maybe aren't with the knowledge

5510
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:53,580
people maybe aren't with the knowledge
 

5511
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:54,470
people maybe aren't with the knowledge
that other people are going to see what

5512
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:54,480
that other people are going to see what
 

5513
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,149
that other people are going to see what
they're doing every day so it's been so

5514
01:33:56,149 --> 01:33:56,159
they're doing every day so it's been so
 

5515
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:57,649
they're doing every day so it's been so
comfortable and easy for me as far as

5516
01:33:57,649 --> 01:33:57,659
comfortable and easy for me as far as
 

5517
01:33:57,659 --> 01:33:59,510
comfortable and easy for me as far as
the World Series goes and the Vlogs and

5518
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,520
the World Series goes and the Vlogs and
 

5519
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,310
the World Series goes and the Vlogs and
all the shooting it's kind of

5520
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:01,320
all the shooting it's kind of
 

5521
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:02,930
all the shooting it's kind of
therapeutic for me it is essentially

5522
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:02,940
therapeutic for me it is essentially
 

5523
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:05,149
therapeutic for me it is essentially
these essentially my version of

5524
01:34:05,149 --> 01:34:05,159
these essentially my version of
 

5525
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:07,490
these essentially my version of
journaling right so there's a lot of

5526
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:07,500
journaling right so there's a lot of
 

5527
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,110
journaling right so there's a lot of
value I think in like at the end of a

5528
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:09,120
value I think in like at the end of a
 

5529
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,669
value I think in like at the end of a
day doing a brain dump where you just

5530
01:34:10,669 --> 01:34:10,679
day doing a brain dump where you just
 

5531
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:13,250
day doing a brain dump where you just
write out Journal but doing it on camera

5532
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:13,260
write out Journal but doing it on camera
 

5533
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:16,970
write out Journal but doing it on camera
has a similar effect and it also

5534
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:16,980
has a similar effect and it also
 

5535
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,169
has a similar effect and it also
you know when you when you make a

5536
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:18,179
you know when you when you make a
 

5537
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:19,430
you know when you when you make a
mistake on your own

5538
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
mistake on your own
 

5539
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,169
mistake on your own
you're held accountable to you but when

5540
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:21,179
you're held accountable to you but when
 

5541
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:23,450
you're held accountable to you but when
I have to explain it to what others like

01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:14,580
you get 30 40 people you know everybody
 

5593
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:16,790
you get 30 40 people you know everybody

01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,169
like
it's grueling too in your seven eight

5610
01:35:30,169 --> 01:35:30,179
it's grueling too in your seven eight
 

5611
01:35:30,179 --> 01:35:32,390
it's grueling too in your seven eight
days where you're you're in the blender

5612
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
days where you're you're in the blender
 

5613
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,689
days where you're you're in the blender
as you as as you might say so so what's

5614
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:35,699
as you as as you might say so so what's
 

5615
01:35:35,699 --> 01:35:37,070
as you as as you might say so so what's
the structure says ten thousand dollar

5616
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:37,080
the structure says ten thousand dollar
 

5617
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,930
the structure says ten thousand dollar
buy-in or something like that and

5618
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:38,940
buy-in or something like that and
 

5619
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,310
buy-in or something like that and
there's a bunch of tables and you just

5620
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,320
there's a bunch of tables and you just
 

5621
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,070
there's a bunch of tables and you just
keep playing as and you like when is it

5622
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:43,080
keep playing as and you like when is it
 

5623
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,629
keep playing as and you like when is it
over for a single table

5624
01:35:44,629 --> 01:35:44,639
over for a single table
 

5625
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:46,250
over for a single table
so the way that it works is this so

5626
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:46,260
so the way that it works is this so
 

5627
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:48,110
so the way that it works is this so
there's let's say 8 000 players and the

5628
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,120
there's let's say 8 000 players and the
 

5629
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:49,850
there's let's say 8 000 players and the
way the main event Works unique to

5630
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:49,860
way the main event Works unique to
 

5631
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:52,189
way the main event Works unique to
others is there's various day ones you

5632
01:35:52,189 --> 01:35:52,199
others is there's various day ones you
 

5633
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:54,110
others is there's various day ones you
can play right so Day One You're Gonna

5634
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:54,120
can play right so Day One You're Gonna
 

5635
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,530
can play right so Day One You're Gonna
Play from noon to like midnight right if

5636
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:57,540
Play from noon to like midnight right if
 

5637
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,390
Play from noon to like midnight right if
you if you're still in you bag up your

5638
01:35:59,390 --> 01:35:59,400
you if you're still in you bag up your
 

5639
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,250
you if you're still in you bag up your
chips and you'll come back for day two

5640
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:01,260
chips and you'll come back for day two
 

5641
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,590
chips and you'll come back for day two
okay there's four different day ones

5642
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:03,600
okay there's four different day ones
 

5643
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,390
okay there's four different day ones
right now they'll all combine

5644
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:05,400
right now they'll all combine
 

5645
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,490
right now they'll all combine
essentially to plan a day too and at the

5646
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:07,500
essentially to plan a day too and at the
 

5647
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,709
essentially to plan a day too and at the
end of the night they redraw the tables

5648
01:36:09,709 --> 01:36:09,719
end of the night they redraw the tables
 

5649
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:11,390
end of the night they redraw the tables
so you don't just win your table if

5650
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:11,400
so you don't just win your table if
 

5651
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,430
so you don't just win your table if
players get knocked out tables break

5652
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:13,440
players get knocked out tables break
 

5653
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,709
players get knocked out tables break
they continue to be replaced so you

5654
01:36:15,709 --> 01:36:15,719
they continue to be replaced so you
 

5655
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:17,450
they continue to be replaced so you
start with a thousand then you know

5656
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:17,460
start with a thousand then you know
 

5657
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:19,970
start with a thousand then you know
after day one you've got six thousand

5658
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:19,980
after day one you've got six thousand
 

5659
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,310
after day one you've got six thousand
then you do the same you play you know

5660
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
then you do the same you play you know
 

5661
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,709
then you do the same you play you know
it's like 12-hour day and you slowly

5662
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:24,719
it's like 12-hour day and you slowly
 

5663
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:27,110
it's like 12-hour day and you slowly
Whittle down day four day three day four

5664
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:27,120
Whittle down day four day three day four
 

5665
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,970
Whittle down day four day three day four
you're in the money and then you

5666
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:28,980
you're in the money and then you
 

5667
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,470
you're in the money and then you
continue to progress and then what they

5668
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:30,480
continue to progress and then what they
 

5669
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,330
continue to progress and then what they
do now with the final table is they they

5670
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:32,340
do now with the final table is they they
 

5671
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:33,590
do now with the final table is they they
because they were trying to do this for

5672
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:33,600
because they were trying to do this for
 

5673
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,350
because they were trying to do this for
TV these final tables can take

5674
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:36,360
TV these final tables can take
 

5675
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:39,410
TV these final tables can take
you know 12 hours to play and what we

5676
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:39,420
you know 12 hours to play and what we
 

5677
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:41,629
you know 12 hours to play and what we
were finding was you know you start to

5678
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:41,639
were finding was you know you start to
 

5679
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:44,810
were finding was you know you start to
think at 5 pm and it goes till 8 A.M and

5680
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:44,820
think at 5 pm and it goes till 8 A.M and
 

5681
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:46,729
think at 5 pm and it goes till 8 A.M and
like nobody's watching anymore so they

5682
01:36:46,729 --> 01:36:46,739
like nobody's watching anymore so they
 

5683
01:36:46,739 --> 01:36:49,129
like nobody's watching anymore so they
separate separated into three days now

5684
01:36:49,129 --> 01:36:49,139
separate separated into three days now
 

5685
01:36:49,139 --> 01:36:51,229
separate separated into three days now
and so you're talking now

5686
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:51,239
and so you're talking now
 

5687
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:52,790
and so you're talking now
it's like six seven days to get to the

5688
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:52,800
it's like six seven days to get to the
 

5689
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,169
it's like six seven days to get to the
final table another three days to play

5690
01:36:54,169 --> 01:36:54,179
final table another three days to play
 

5691
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:55,669
final table another three days to play
it so you're under you know you're

5692
01:36:55,669 --> 01:36:55,679
it so you're under you know you're
 

5693
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,709
it so you're under you know you're
you're grinding for

5694
01:36:57,709 --> 01:36:57,719
you're grinding for
 

5695
01:36:57,719 --> 01:36:59,750
you're grinding for
you know week and a half but most of the

5696
01:36:59,750 --> 01:36:59,760
you know week and a half but most of the
 

5697
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:00,709
you know week and a half but most of the
time

5698
01:37:00,709 --> 01:37:00,719
time
 

5699
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,390
time
you're playing against people you've

5700
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,400
you're playing against people you've
 

5701
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,310
you're playing against people you've
never played against before especially

5702
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:04,320
never played against before especially
 

5703
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,050
never played against before especially
early on yeah and then by the end like

5704
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:06,060
early on yeah and then by the end like
 

5705
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:09,110
early on yeah and then by the end like
who knows you know rarely do you see

5706
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:09,120
who knows you know rarely do you see
 

5707
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,970
who knows you know rarely do you see
100 you usually see some notable names

5708
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:10,980
100 you usually see some notable names
 

5709
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:13,129
100 you usually see some notable names
then in the last 27 you might see one

5710
01:37:13,129 --> 01:37:13,139
then in the last 27 you might see one
 

5711
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:15,709
then in the last 27 you might see one
maybe two final table maybe one but

5712
01:37:15,709 --> 01:37:15,719
maybe two final table maybe one but
 

5713
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:17,810
maybe two final table maybe one but
often it's gonna be you know some

5714
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:17,820
often it's gonna be you know some
 

5715
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:20,390
often it's gonna be you know some
players you've never heard of before is

5716
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:20,400
players you've never heard of before is
 

5717
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,310
players you've never heard of before is
there strategies that

5718
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:22,320
there strategies that
 

5719
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,770
there strategies that
maximize your likelihood of having a

5720
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:24,780
maximize your likelihood of having a
 

5721
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:26,990
maximize your likelihood of having a
chance yes absolutely like I think the

5722
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:27,000
chance yes absolutely like I think the
 

5723
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,550
chance yes absolutely like I think the
World Series of Poker main event is a

5724
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:28,560
World Series of Poker main event is a
 

5725
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,590
World Series of Poker main event is a
unique animal in that you know like we

5726
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:30,600
unique animal in that you know like we
 

5727
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,790
unique animal in that you know like we
talk about Game Theory and all that kind

5728
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:31,800
talk about Game Theory and all that kind
 

5729
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,950
talk about Game Theory and all that kind
of stuff if you're focused on that when

5730
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:33,960
of stuff if you're focused on that when
 

5731
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,510
of stuff if you're focused on that when
you're playing you're really not playing

5732
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:35,520
you're playing you're really not playing
 

5733
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,970
you're playing you're really not playing
well right you need to just exploit

5734
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:37,980
well right you need to just exploit
 

5735
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:39,470
well right you need to just exploit
because you're going to have a lot of

5736
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:39,480
because you're going to have a lot of
 

5737
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,850
because you're going to have a lot of
people who see this as a bucket list

5738
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:40,860
people who see this as a bucket list
 

5739
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:42,350
people who see this as a bucket list
item you know they just want to play the

5740
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:42,360
item you know they just want to play the
 

5741
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,910
item you know they just want to play the
main event in the World Series and they

5742
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:43,920
main event in the World Series and they
 

5743
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,410
main event in the World Series and they
might be scared they might be nervous or

5744
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:45,420
might be scared they might be nervous or
 

5745
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:46,970
might be scared they might be nervous or
whatever you don't have to worry about

5746
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:46,980
whatever you don't have to worry about
 

5747
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:49,610
whatever you don't have to worry about
being balanced right oh you know I have

5748
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:49,620
being balanced right oh you know I have
 

5749
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,110
being balanced right oh you know I have
to make sure that I'm about no you don't

5750
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:51,120
to make sure that I'm about no you don't
 

5751
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,430
to make sure that I'm about no you don't
you might know you're playing with this

5752
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:52,440
you might know you're playing with this
 

5753
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:53,750
you might know you're playing with this
guy now for three hours you might never

5754
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:53,760
guy now for three hours you might never
 

5755
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,729
guy now for three hours you might never
see him again so just make the play that

5756
01:37:55,729 --> 01:37:55,739
see him again so just make the play that
 

5757
01:37:55,739 --> 01:37:58,910
see him again so just make the play that
makes sense for you right so

5758
01:37:58,910 --> 01:37:58,920
makes sense for you right so
 

5759
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,890
makes sense for you right so
so yeah you're gonna I approach that

5760
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:00,900
so yeah you're gonna I approach that
 

5761
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,050
so yeah you're gonna I approach that
event very differently than I would like

5762
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:03,060
event very differently than I would like
 

5763
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:04,790
event very differently than I would like
playing against the High Roller players

5764
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:04,800
playing against the High Roller players
 

5765
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,110
playing against the High Roller players
that I play with does that mean more

5766
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:06,120
that I play with does that mean more
 

5767
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,689
that I play with does that mean more
aggressive essentially less actually

5768
01:38:08,689 --> 01:38:08,699
aggressive essentially less actually
 

5769
01:38:08,699 --> 01:38:11,209
aggressive essentially less actually
so when you play against really good

5770
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:11,219
so when you play against really good
 

5771
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:13,189
so when you play against really good
players you have to take

5772
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:13,199
players you have to take
 

5773
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:16,310
players you have to take
small plus EV scenarios where you push

5774
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:16,320
small plus EV scenarios where you push
 

5775
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,629
small plus EV scenarios where you push
the envelope and you're playing really

5776
01:38:17,629 --> 01:38:17,639
the envelope and you're playing really
 

5777
01:38:17,639 --> 01:38:19,010
the envelope and you're playing really
aggressive you're bluffing off your

5778
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:19,020
aggressive you're bluffing off your
 

5779
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,110
aggressive you're bluffing off your
stack you got to do this you gotta focus

5780
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:21,120
stack you got to do this you gotta focus
 

5781
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,430
stack you got to do this you gotta focus
a little bit more on being balanced

5782
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:22,440
a little bit more on being balanced
 

5783
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,050
a little bit more on being balanced
because otherwise you know you're not

5784
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:24,060
because otherwise you know you're not
 

5785
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,910
because otherwise you know you're not
going to beat these guys whereas if

5786
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
going to beat these guys whereas if
 

5787
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,410
going to beat these guys whereas if
you're playing with amateurs and you're

5788
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:27,420
you're playing with amateurs and you're
 

5789
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,149
you're playing with amateurs and you're
playing with regular players for the

5790
01:38:29,149 --> 01:38:29,159
playing with regular players for the
 

5791
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:30,229
playing with regular players for the
most part

5792
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:30,239
most part
 

5793
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:33,050
most part
risking all your chips on a bluff

5794
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:33,060
risking all your chips on a bluff
 

5795
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:35,090
risking all your chips on a bluff
probably don't need to do that you don't

5796
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:35,100
probably don't need to do that you don't
 

5797
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,229
probably don't need to do that you don't
need to do that nearly as much you can

5798
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
need to do that nearly as much you can
 

5799
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,430
need to do that nearly as much you can
probably

5800
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:37,440
probably
 

5801
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,290
probably
slowly but surely build your stack

5802
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:39,300
slowly but surely build your stack
 

5803
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,149
slowly but surely build your stack
without taking you know those high risk

5804
01:38:41,149 --> 01:38:41,159
without taking you know those high risk
 

5805
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:42,290
without taking you know those high risk
High variant situations because you'll

5806
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:42,300
High variant situations because you'll
 

5807
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:43,910
High variant situations because you'll
find better situations

5808
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:43,920
find better situations
 

5809
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,070
find better situations
what uh mistakes do amateurs usually

5810
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
what uh mistakes do amateurs usually
 

5811
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,030
what uh mistakes do amateurs usually
make

5812
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
make
 

5813
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,370
make
in tournaments like that are they over

5814
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:49,380
in tournaments like that are they over
 

5815
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,890
in tournaments like that are they over
bluffing well I think amateurs generally

5816
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:51,900
bluffing well I think amateurs generally
 

5817
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,570
bluffing well I think amateurs generally
the biggest mistake they make is they

5818
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:53,580
the biggest mistake they make is they
 

5819
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:54,830
the biggest mistake they make is they
think that Pros are bluffing more than

5820
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:54,840
think that Pros are bluffing more than
 

5821
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,850
think that Pros are bluffing more than
they are

5822
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:55,860
they are
 

5823
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,950
they are
so like a pro will bet all his chips on

5824
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:57,960
so like a pro will bet all his chips on
 

5825
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,689
so like a pro will bet all his chips on
the end like I don't know

5826
01:38:59,689 --> 01:38:59,699
the end like I don't know
 

5827
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:01,010
the end like I don't know
I mean it's Phil Ivey maybe he's doing

5828
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:01,020
I mean it's Phil Ivey maybe he's doing
 

5829
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,390
I mean it's Phil Ivey maybe he's doing
some crazy stuff he's like probably not

5830
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
some crazy stuff he's like probably not
 

5831
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,169
some crazy stuff he's like probably not
yeah he's probably just got it you know

5832
01:39:05,169 --> 01:39:05,179
yeah he's probably just got it you know
 

5833
01:39:05,179 --> 01:39:07,370
yeah he's probably just got it you know
and then they get lose all their money

5834
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:07,380
and then they get lose all their money
 

5835
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:10,790
and then they get lose all their money
by calling or going all in as well

5836
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:10,800
by calling or going all in as well
 

5837
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,590
by calling or going all in as well
um

5838
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:12,600
um
 

5839
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,209
um
and so the right things to be more

5840
01:39:14,209 --> 01:39:14,219
and so the right things to be more
 

5841
01:39:14,219 --> 01:39:17,510
and so the right things to be more
patient for so amateur is too impatient

5842
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:17,520
patient for so amateur is too impatient
 

5843
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,090
patient for so amateur is too impatient
well also bad reads so all the amateurs

5844
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:20,100
well also bad reads so all the amateurs
 

5845
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,010
well also bad reads so all the amateurs
are built different some of the amateurs

5846
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:22,020
are built different some of the amateurs
 

5847
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,570
are built different some of the amateurs
are just too weak and passive they're

5848
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:23,580
are just too weak and passive they're
 

5849
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,310
are just too weak and passive they're
just waiting for the nuts you know yeah

5850
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:25,320
just waiting for the nuts you know yeah
 

5851
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,570
just waiting for the nuts you know yeah
and then you know the pros everyone

5852
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:26,580
and then you know the pros everyone
 

5853
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:27,950
and then you know the pros everyone
notices that and then when they make

5854
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:27,960
notices that and then when they make
 

5855
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,750
notices that and then when they make
their big hand they don't get paid

5856
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:29,760
their big hand they don't get paid
 

5857
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,750
their big hand they don't get paid
anyway so in order to win the main event

5858
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:32,760
anyway so in order to win the main event
 

5859
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,030
anyway so in order to win the main event
I mean you have to have some components

5860
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,040
I mean you have to have some components
 

5861
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,890
I mean you have to have some components
of your game that are aggressive it's

5862
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:36,900
of your game that are aggressive it's
 

5863
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,990
of your game that are aggressive it's
very unlikely to expect to just get the

5864
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:39,000
very unlikely to expect to just get the
 

5865
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,810
very unlikely to expect to just get the
cards the whole way and just always have

5866
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:41,820
cards the whole way and just always have
 

5867
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:43,070
cards the whole way and just always have
the best hand you're gonna have to find

5868
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:43,080
the best hand you're gonna have to find
 

5869
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:46,250
the best hand you're gonna have to find
ways to win pots that you know where you

5870

ways to win pots that you know where you
 

5871
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:47,990
ways to win pots that you know where you
don't have the best hand how do you win

5872
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:48,000
don't have the best hand how do you win
 

5873
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,570
don't have the best hand how do you win
the Final Table the final table is

5874
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:50,580
the Final Table the final table is
 

5875
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,189
the Final Table the final table is
unique now especially because you're

5876
01:39:52,189 --> 01:39:52,199
unique now especially because you're
 

5877
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:54,169

chip model right where it talks about

5896
01:40:14,149 --> 01:40:14,159
chip model right where it talks about
 

5897
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:16,250
chip model right where it talks about
the value of each chip where what

stack is just
 

5915
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,930
stack is just
pounding them because he can afford to

jumps of like moving up a few spots so

5930
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:46,920
jumps of like moving up a few spots so
 

5931
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,350
jumps of like moving up a few spots so
really the question comes down to like

5932
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:48,360
really the question comes down to like
 

5933
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,450
really the question comes down to like
are you the type of guy who just wants

5934
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:50,460
are you the type of guy who just wants
 

5935
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,610
are you the type of guy who just wants
to inch up or are you gonna go for it

5936
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:52,620
to inch up or are you gonna go for it
 

5937
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,350
to inch up or are you gonna go for it
and you're gonna go for the win I think

5938
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:54,360
and you're gonna go for the win I think
 

5939
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,330
and you're gonna go for the win I think
ultimately there's some value in being

5940
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:56,340
ultimately there's some value in being
 

5941
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:57,410
ultimately there's some value in being
the guy who says you know I don't care

5942
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:57,420
the guy who says you know I don't care
 

5943
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,110
the guy who says you know I don't care
if I come seventh I'm not worried about

5944
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:00,120
if I come seventh I'm not worried about
 

5945
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,090
if I come seventh I'm not worried about
going from Seventh to fifth I'm here to

5946
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:02,100
going from Seventh to fifth I'm here to
 

5947

going from Seventh to fifth I'm here to
win and so you're saying like the the

5948
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,080
win and so you're saying like the the
 

5949
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,870
win and so you're saying like the the
guys that win will often be the ones

5950
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:05,880
guys that win will often be the ones
 

5951
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,390
guys that win will often be the ones
that call there so like they're not just

5952
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,400
that call there so like they're not just
 

5953
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,270
that call there so like they're not just
bullying the small Stacks they're well

5954
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:11,280
bullying the small Stacks they're well
 

5955
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,410
bullying the small Stacks they're well

that are willing to willing to risk it
 

5959
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:16,370

right so there are some people who you

5960
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:16,380
right so there are some people who you
 

5961
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:17,930
right so there are some people who you
know if there's

5962
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:17,940
know if there's
 

5963
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:19,370
know if there's
five left

5964
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:19,380
five left
 

5965
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,290
five left
you know and they're third in chips and

5966
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:21,300
you know and they're third in chips and
 

5967

down write it out and then either a you
 

6127
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,510
down write it out and then either a you
know use some of the tools whether it's

6128
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:02,520
know use some of the tools whether it's

talk through the different decisions and
 

6137
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,830
talk through the different decisions and
start to learn that way right because

6138
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:12,840
start to learn that way right because
 

6139
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,270
start to learn that way right because
those mistakes that you make or those

6140
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:14,280
those mistakes that you make or those
 

6141
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,250
those mistakes that you make or those
tough those tough hands that's where the

6142
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:16,260
tough those tough hands that's where the
 

6143
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:18,590
tough those tough hands that's where the
real learning comes from like so that so

6144
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:18,600
real learning comes from like so that so
 

6145
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,149
real learning comes from like so that so
basically if you're because you're going

6146
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:20,159
basically if you're because you're going
 

6147
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,070
basically if you're because you're going
to be in similar scenarios in poker

01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:22,080
to be in similar scenarios in poker

identical situation but you'll have
situations that are similar you know you

6154
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:26,880
situations that are similar you know you
 

6155

you're going to have similar situations
 

6163
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,050
you're going to have similar situations
in the future as well so figuring that

6164
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:36,060
in the future as well so figuring that
 

6165
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:38,750
in the future as well so figuring that
out the more you can do that you chop

6166
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:38,760
out the more you can do that you chop

um which sort of explains Game Theory

6188
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:00,300
um which sort of explains Game Theory
 

6189
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:03,709
um which sort of explains Game Theory
right to the novice right so it's it's a

6190
01:45:03,709 --> 01:45:03,719
right to the novice right so it's it's a
 

6191
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:05,030
right to the novice right so it's it's a
little bit I think if you're new to

6192
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:05,040
little bit I think if you're new to
 

6193

Poker it's probably Above the Rim for

Poker it's probably Above the Rim for
 

6195
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,709
Poker it's probably Above the Rim for
you but once you start to get a little

01:45:09,709 --> 01:45:09,719
you but once you start to get a little
 

6197
01:45:09,719 --> 01:45:11,030
you but once you start to get a little
better and you want to understand how to

6198
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:11,040
better and you want to understand how to
 

6199
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,770
better and you want to understand how to
do it it's probably a good resource for

6200
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:12,780
do it it's probably a good resource for
 

6201
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:14,149
do it it's probably a good resource for
as far as books and there's also like

professional players and then you can
 

6207
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:18,890
professional players and then you can
get in there and you get in on the chat

6208
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:18,900
get in there and you get in on the chat
 

6209
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,629
get in there and you get in on the chat
and you start talking you ask them you

6210
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
and you start talking you ask them you
 

6211
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,370
and you start talking you ask them you
see people you know explaining their

6212
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:22,380
see people you know explaining their
 

6213
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:23,750
see people you know explaining their
thought process and things like that

6214
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:23,760
thought process and things like that
 

6215
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,609
thought process and things like that
there's so many free resources and of

6216
01:45:25,609 --> 01:45:25,619
there's so many free resources and of
 

6217
01:45:25,619 --> 01:45:27,050
there's so many free resources and of
course my masterclass I think does a

6218
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:27,060
course my masterclass I think does a
 

6219
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:28,850
course my masterclass I think does a
good job of sort of compartmentalizing

6220
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:28,860
good job of sort of compartmentalizing
 

6221
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:30,350
good job of sort of compartmentalizing
like you know

6222
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:30,360
like you know
 

6223
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,629
like you know
how to attack it on a deeper level and

6224
01:45:32,629 --> 01:45:32,639
how to attack it on a deeper level and
 

6225
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,129
how to attack it on a deeper level and
you know we get it I try to get into

6226
01:45:34,129 --> 01:45:34,139
you know we get it I try to get into
 

6227
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:36,649
you know we get it I try to get into
what's funny when I did the Master Class

6228
01:45:36,649 --> 01:45:36,659
what's funny when I did the Master Class
 

6229

I asked them I was like well you know
 

6231
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,850
I asked them I was like well you know
how high-end do you want this in terms

6232
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:40,860
how high-end do you want this in terms
 

6233
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:42,410
how high-end do you want this in terms
of Poker and they're like we want really

6234
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:42,420
of Poker and they're like we want really

6237
01:45:43,619 --> 01:45:45,169
really high end and I was like oh are
you sure then I started to explain

6238
01:45:45,169 --> 01:45:45,179
you sure then I started to explain
 

6239
01:45:45,179 --> 01:45:46,669
you sure then I started to explain
really really highly like okay well

6240
01:45:46,669 --> 01:45:46,679
really really highly like okay well
 

6241
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:50,810
really really highly like okay well
maybe the one below that

6242
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:50,820

 

6243
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:53,810

try to explain really complex

6244
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:53,820
try to explain really complex
 

6245
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:54,410
try to explain really complex
um

6246
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:54,420
um
 

6247
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:57,229
um
you know theory in a more palatable way

6248
01:45:57,229 --> 01:45:57,239
you know theory in a more palatable way
 

6249
01:45:57,239 --> 01:45:59,209
you know theory in a more palatable way
in English if you will because some of

6250
01:45:59,209 --> 01:45:59,219
in English if you will because some of
 

6251
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:00,590
in English if you will because some of
these kids you hear them talk and you'll

6252
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:00,600
these kids you hear them talk and you'll
 

6253
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:03,649
these kids you hear them talk and you'll
be like huh but you also which is really

6254
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:03,659
be like huh but you also which is really
 

6255
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:07,729
be like huh but you also which is really
nice give uh example hands that really

6256
01:46:07,729 --> 01:46:07,739
nice give uh example hands that really
 

6257
01:46:07,739 --> 01:46:09,109
nice give uh example hands that really
illustrate the point which is really

6258
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:09,119
illustrate the point which is really
 

6259
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:10,430
illustrate the point which is really
nice

6260
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:10,440
nice
 

6261
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,530
nice
um you also wrote a book I think 10

6262
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:12,540
um you also wrote a book I think 10
 

6263
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:16,129
um you also wrote a book I think 10
years ago power holding strategy

6264
01:46:16,129 --> 01:46:16,139
years ago power holding strategy
 

6265
01:46:16,139 --> 01:46:18,950
years ago power holding strategy
it's interesting to think how much of

6266
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:18,960
it's interesting to think how much of
 

6267
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,689
it's interesting to think how much of
the stuff in that book still applies how

6268
01:46:20,689 --> 01:46:20,699
the stuff in that book still applies how
 

6269
01:46:20,699 --> 01:46:22,310
the stuff in that book still applies how
much doesn't listen I still think the

6270
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:22,320
much doesn't listen I still think the
 

6271
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:23,810
much doesn't listen I still think the
book holds up to a certain degree

6272
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:23,820
book holds up to a certain degree
 

6273
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:26,510
book holds up to a certain degree
obviously like you know it isn't optimal

6274
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:26,520
obviously like you know it isn't optimal
 

6275
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,010
obviously like you know it isn't optimal
because there's like a more advanced

6276

measures in place to catch them you know

6502
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:14,280
measures in place to catch them you know
 

6503
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:16,550
measures in place to catch them you know
and we've caught in like about two years

6504
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:16,560
and we've caught in like about two years
 

6505
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,770
and we've caught in like about two years
ago there was a huge huge undertaking of

6506
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:18,780
ago there was a huge huge undertaking of
 

6507
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:21,950
ago there was a huge huge undertaking of
like 500 accounts that were banned for

6508
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:21,960
like 500 accounts that were banned for
 

6509
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,209
like 500 accounts that were banned for
doing different things and you know

6510
01:50:23,209 --> 01:50:23,219
doing different things and you know
 

6511
01:50:23,219 --> 01:50:25,310
doing different things and you know
there's and again you can't go and they

6512
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:25,320
there's and again you can't go and they
 

6513
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,109
there's and again you can't go and they
can't go into detail in terms of how

6514
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:27,119
can't go into detail in terms of how
 

6515
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:28,910
can't go into detail in terms of how
they're doing it because otherwise you

6516
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:28,920
they're doing it because otherwise you
 

6517
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:30,109
they're doing it because otherwise you
know then you're sort of giving the

6518
01:50:30,109 --> 01:50:30,119
know then you're sort of giving the
 

6519
01:50:30,119 --> 01:50:31,970

take advantage but it's always going to
 

6523
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,570

right
um but it's not something I'm worried

6528
01:50:39,169 --> 01:50:39,179
um but it's not something I'm worried
 

6529
01:50:39,179 --> 01:50:39,830
um but it's not something I'm worried
about

6530
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:39,840
about
 

6531
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,390
about
personally so it's the highest in person

6532
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:41,400
personally so it's the highest in person

and by the way online there is really
 

6535
01:50:43,619 --> 01:50:45,350
and by the way online there is really
interesting algorithms that do some of

6536
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:45,360
interesting algorithms that do some of
 

6537
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,270
interesting algorithms that do some of
the work in an automated way to detect

6538
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:47,280
the work in an automated way to detect
 

6539
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:50,689
the work in an automated way to detect
to flag things that are weird but in

the guy what's often funny about some of
 

6581
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:29,090
the guy what's often funny about some of
these people who cheat is they're so

6582
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:29,100
these people who cheat is they're so
 

6583
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:31,490
these people who cheat is they're so
greedy and blatantly obvious that they

6584
01:51:31,490 --> 01:51:31,500
greedy and blatantly obvious that they
 

6585
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,709
greedy and blatantly obvious that they
get caught where if they use this tool

6586
01:51:33,709 --> 01:51:33,719
get caught where if they use this tool
 

6587
01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:35,629
get caught where if they use this tool
in a more subtle way they could probably

6588
01:51:35,629 --> 01:51:35,639
in a more subtle way they could probably
 

6589
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:37,790
in a more subtle way they could probably
continue to get away with it but again

6590
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:37,800
continue to get away with it but again
 

6591
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:39,950
continue to get away with it but again
that's not something I worry about in a

6592
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:39,960
that's not something I worry about in a
 

6593
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,810
that's not something I worry about in a
casino environment

6594
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:41,820
casino environment

remember you know I lost the big number
 

6629
01:52:13,139 --> 01:52:14,270
remember you know I lost the big number
in that game

6630
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:14,280
in that game
 

6631
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:15,830
in that game
and it was a good Learning lesson in

6632
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:15,840
and it was a good Learning lesson in
 

6633
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:16,669
and it was a good Learning lesson in
terms of

6634
01:52:16,669 --> 01:52:16,679
terms of
 

6635
01:52:16,679 --> 01:52:19,970
terms of
you know being wary of who you trust

6636
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:19,980
you know being wary of who you trust
 

6637
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:22,370
you know being wary of who you trust
yeah so if the dealer is in on it that's

6638
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:22,380
yeah so if the dealer is in on it that's
 

6639
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:24,709
yeah so if the dealer is in on it that's
one way you could cheat it's fascinating

6640
01:52:24,709 --> 01:52:24,719
one way you could cheat it's fascinating
 

6641
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,629
one way you could cheat it's fascinating
uh that's part of the reason that they

6642
01:52:26,629 --> 01:52:26,639
uh that's part of the reason that they
 

6643
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:27,350
uh that's part of the reason that they
cut

6644
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:27,360
cut
 

6645
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,570
cut
so like you'll see like uh there's a

6646
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:29,580
so like you'll see like uh there's a
 

6647
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:32,149
so like you'll see like uh there's a
burn card because what would happen you

6648
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:32,159
burn card because what would happen you
 

6649
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:33,950
burn card because what would happen you
know maybe in the old days is like if

6650
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:33,960
know maybe in the old days is like if
 

6651
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,030
know maybe in the old days is like if
you're sitting in the one seat I could

6652
01:52:35,030 --> 01:52:35,040
you're sitting in the one seat I could
 

6653
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,649
you're sitting in the one seat I could
lift the car and you could see it the

6654
01:52:36,649 --> 01:52:36,659
lift the car and you could see it the
 

6655
01:52:36,659 --> 01:52:38,629
lift the car and you could see it the
next card coming right so what they do

6656
01:52:38,629 --> 01:52:38,639
next card coming right so what they do
 

6657
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,250
next card coming right so what they do
is they have a card on top of it that

6658
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:40,260
is they have a card on top of it that
 

6659
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:41,570
is they have a card on top of it that
you burn that isn't the card and then

6660
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:41,580
you burn that isn't the card and then
 

6661
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:42,770
you burn that isn't the card and then
the next card is the one that comes face

6662
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:42,780
the next card is the one that comes face
 

6663
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:43,850
the next card is the one that comes face
up

6664
01:52:43,850 --> 01:52:43,860
up
 

6665
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:46,189
up
I just learned about the edge

6666
01:52:46,189 --> 01:52:46,199
I just learned about the edge
 

6667
01:52:46,199 --> 01:52:50,030
I just learned about the edge
sorting uh thing that uh Phil Ivey maybe

6668
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:50,040
sorting uh thing that uh Phil Ivey maybe
 

6669
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:51,890
sorting uh thing that uh Phil Ivey maybe
others were involved with

6670
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:51,900
others were involved with
 

6671
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:54,950
others were involved with
I just reading it at first was super

6672
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:54,960
I just reading it at first was super
 

6673
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,350
I just reading it at first was super
interesting to me that you can exploit

6674
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:57,360
interesting to me that you can exploit
 

6675
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:00,410
interesting to me that you can exploit
the imperfections in the printing of

6676
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:00,420
the imperfections in the printing of
 

6677
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:02,930
the imperfections in the printing of
cards yeah that was almost cool to me

6678
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:02,940
cards yeah that was almost cool to me
 

6679
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,609
cards yeah that was almost cool to me
that that was that's almost not cheating

6680
01:53:04,609 --> 01:53:04,619
that that was that's almost not cheating
 

6681
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:06,590
that that was that's almost not cheating
because it's like that needs to be a

6682
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:06,600
because it's like that needs to be a
 

6683
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:07,750
because it's like that needs to be a
movie

6684
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:07,760
movie
 

6685
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,370
movie
yes yes what happened with Phil Ivey in

6686
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:10,380
yes yes what happened with Phil Ivey in
 

6687
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:11,629
yes yes what happened with Phil Ivey in
that whole case is it's it's a

6688
01:53:11,629 --> 01:53:11,639
that whole case is it's it's a
 

6689
01:53:11,639 --> 01:53:13,970
that whole case is it's it's a
catastrophe really yeah it is such a

6690
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:13,980
catastrophe really yeah it is such a
 

6691
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:15,470
catastrophe really yeah it is such a
horrible precedent because here's what

6692
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:15,480
horrible precedent because here's what
 

6693
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,910
horrible precedent because here's what
he did Phil Ivey shows up at the casino

6694
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:16,920
he did Phil Ivey shows up at the casino
 

6695
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,590
he did Phil Ivey shows up at the casino
says I want to play this game they say

6696
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:18,600
says I want to play this game they say
 

6697
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,330
says I want to play this game they say
okay all right I want to play with those

6698
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:20,340
okay all right I want to play with those
 

6699
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:23,030
okay all right I want to play with those
decks they say okay they agree to

6700
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,040
decks they say okay they agree to
 

6701
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,950
decks they say okay they agree to
everything that he says he never touches

6702
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
everything that he says he never touches
 

6703
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,590
everything that he says he never touches
the cards he doesn't do anything outside

6704
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:27,600
the cards he doesn't do anything outside
 

6705
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:29,390
the cards he doesn't do anything outside
of the fact that you cards that you

6706
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:29,400
of the fact that you cards that you
 

6707
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:31,910
of the fact that you cards that you
supplied have imperfections on them and

6708
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:31,920
supplied have imperfections on them and
 

6709
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:34,070
supplied have imperfections on them and
he can see them yeah okay so that

6710
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:34,080
he can see them yeah okay so that
 

6711
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,930
he can see them yeah okay so that
increases his chances of winning he

6712
01:53:35,930 --> 01:53:35,940
increases his chances of winning he
 

6713
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:38,030
increases his chances of winning he
could still lose theoretically right

6714
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:38,040
could still lose theoretically right
 

6715
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,310
could still lose theoretically right
probably not but he can lose in theory

6716
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,320
probably not but he can lose in theory
 

6717
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:41,330
probably not but he can lose in theory
he just gives him a little bit of an

6718
01:53:41,330 --> 01:53:41,340
he just gives him a little bit of an
 

6719
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:43,430
he just gives him a little bit of an
edge and it's all stuff based on what

6720
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:43,440
edge and it's all stuff based on what
 

6721
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,649
edge and it's all stuff based on what
you provided yeah so the idea that you

6722
01:53:45,649 --> 01:53:45,659
you provided yeah so the idea that you
 

6723
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:48,709
you provided yeah so the idea that you
offered a game I accepted I beat you and

6724
01:53:48,709 --> 01:53:48,719
offered a game I accepted I beat you and
 

6725
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:50,689
offered a game I accepted I beat you and
now you want to free roll me that's

6726
01:53:50,689 --> 01:53:50,699
now you want to free roll me that's
 

6727
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,910
now you want to free roll me that's
disgusting so for people who don't know

6728
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:52,920
disgusting so for people who don't know
 

6729
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,410
disgusting so for people who don't know
maybe you can elaborate and it's just

6730
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:54,420
maybe you can elaborate and it's just
 

6731
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:56,450
maybe you can elaborate and it's just
fascinating to me but you're exploiting

6732
01:53:56,450 --> 01:53:56,460
fascinating to me but you're exploiting
 

6733
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:58,850
fascinating to me but you're exploiting
the imperfections and card patterns on

6734

6738
01:54:03,709 --> 01:54:03,719
you rotate it and the the fascinating
 

6739
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:05,450
you rotate it and the the fascinating
thing too when you Shuffle usually you

6740

7303
02:03:30,619 --> 02:03:32,810

they get paid more than they're supposed

7304
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:32,820
they get paid more than they're supposed
 

7305
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:35,510
they get paid more than they're supposed
to and I'd rather them do that and work

7306
02:03:35,510 --> 02:03:35,520
to and I'd rather them do that and work

towards it rather than feel underpaid
 

7309
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:38,330
towards it rather than feel underpaid
because if they're underpaid they'll

feel overpaid then if I need them to do
something special they're not gonna be

because it's too high it's just you know
it just doesn't mathematically add up so

7778
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:19,440
it just doesn't mathematically add up so
 

7779
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,050
