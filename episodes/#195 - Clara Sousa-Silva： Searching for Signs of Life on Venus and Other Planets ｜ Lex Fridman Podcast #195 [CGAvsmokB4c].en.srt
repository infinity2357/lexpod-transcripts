there was some pushback of course
 

143
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,589
there was some pushback of course
from the scientific community that

144
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
from the scientific community that
 

145
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,670
from the scientific community that
followed friendly loving pushback

the finding
 

153
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,390
the finding
so where do we stand in this saga

154
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
so where do we stand in this saga
 

155
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,710
so where do we stand in this saga
in this mystery of what the heck is

156
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
in this mystery of what the heck is
 

157
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,830
in this mystery of what the heck is
going on

158
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
going on
 

159
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,910
going on
on venus in terms of phosphine in terms

160
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
on venus in terms of phosphine in terms
 

161
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,229
on venus in terms of phosphine in terms
of aliens

162

okay let's try to break it down okay the

164
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
okay let's try to break it down okay the
 

165
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,910
okay let's try to break it down okay the
short answer is

166
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
short answer is
 

167
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,270
short answer is
we don't know um i think you

168
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
we don't know um i think you
 

169

00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
witnessing a pretty exciting discovery
 

173
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,509
witnessing a pretty exciting discovery
but

174
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
but
 

175
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,630
but
as it evolves as it unfolds

176
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
as it evolves as it unfolds
 

177
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,550
as it evolves as it unfolds
um we did not wait until we had

178
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
um we did not wait until we had
 

179
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,309
um we did not wait until we had
you know years of data from 10 different

180
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
you know years of data from 10 different
 

181
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,190
you know years of data from 10 different
instruments across several layers the

182
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
instruments across several layers the
 

183
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,509
instruments across several layers the
atmosphere we waited until we had

184
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
atmosphere we waited until we had
 

185
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,790
atmosphere we waited until we had
two telescopes with independent data

186
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
two telescopes with independent data
 

187
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,309
two telescopes with independent data
months apart but still the data is

188
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
months apart but still the data is
 

189
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,190
months apart but still the data is
weak it's noisy it's delicate it's very

190
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
weak it's noisy it's delicate it's very
 

191
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,309
weak it's noisy it's delicate it's very
much at the edge

192
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
much at the edge
 

193
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,270
much at the edge
of instrument sensibility sensitivity

194
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
of instrument sensibility sensitivity
 

195
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,550
of instrument sensibility sensitivity
and so

196
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
and so
 

197
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,990
and so
we still don't even know if it is

198
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
we still don't even know if it is
 

199
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,830
we still don't even know if it is
phosphine we don't even

200
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
phosphine we don't even
 

201
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,670
phosphine we don't even
really know if the signal is real people

202
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
really know if the signal is real people
 

203
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,350
really know if the signal is real people
still disagree about that

204
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
still disagree about that
 

205
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,990
still disagree about that
and i think it at the most more

206
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
and i think it at the most more
 

207
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,070
and i think it at the most more
philosophical end of how this happened

208
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
philosophical end of how this happened
 

209
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,789
philosophical end of how this happened
i think it is a distinction and myself

210
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
i think it is a distinction and myself
 

211
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,990
i think it is a distinction and myself
and other co-authors were talking

212
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
and other co-authors were talking
 

213
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,550
and other co-authors were talking
about this it's a distinction between

214
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
about this it's a distinction between
 

215
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,589
about this it's a distinction between
hypotheses

216
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
hypotheses
 

217
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,350

219
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,229
generation and hypothesis testing now
hypothesis testing is something that i

220
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
hypothesis testing is something that i
 

221
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,710
hypothesis testing is something that i
think is the backbone of

00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
think is the backbone of

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,190
think is the backbone of
you know the scientific method but it

224
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
you know the scientific method but it
 

225
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,869
you know the scientific method but it
has a problem which is

226
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
has a problem which is
 

227
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,070
has a problem which is
if you're looking through very noisy

228
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
if you're looking through very noisy
 

229
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,309
if you're looking through very noisy
data and you want to test the hypotheses

230
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
data and you want to test the hypotheses
 

231
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,789
data and you want to test the hypotheses
you may by mistake create a spurious

232
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
you may by mistake create a spurious
 

233
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,789
you may by mistake create a spurious
signal

234
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
signal
 

235
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,110

the safest more conservative approach is

236
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
the safest more conservative approach is
 

237
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,550
the safest more conservative approach is
hypothesis generation

238
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
hypothesis generation
 

239
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,789
hypothesis generation
you see some data and you go what's in

240
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
you see some data and you go what's in
 

241
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,789
you see some data and you go what's in
there with no bias

242
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
there with no bias
 

243
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,069
there with no bias
now this is much safer much more

244
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
now this is much safer much more
 

245
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,830
now this is much safer much more
conservative and when there's a lot of

246
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
conservative and when there's a lot of
 

247
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,550
conservative and when there's a lot of
data

248
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
data
 

249
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,950
data
that's great when there isn't you can

250
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
that's great when there isn't you can
 

251
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,830
that's great when there isn't you can
clean the noise

252
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
clean the noise
 

253
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,469
clean the noise
and take out the signal with it the

254
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
and take out the signal with it the
 

255
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,270
and take out the signal with it the
signal with the

256
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
signal with the
 

257
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,110
signal with the
bath water whatever the equivalent of

258
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
bath water whatever the equivalent of
 

259
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,110
bath water whatever the equivalent of
the analogy would be

260
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
the analogy would be
 

261
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,270
the analogy would be
and so i think the healthy discourse

262
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
and so i think the healthy discourse
 

263
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,189
and so i think the healthy discourse
that you described is exactly this

264
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
that you described is exactly this
 

265
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,430
that you described is exactly this
there are ways of processing the data

266
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
there are ways of processing the data
 

267
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,030
there are ways of processing the data
completely legitimate ways checked by

268
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
completely legitimate ways checked by
 

269
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,790
completely legitimate ways checked by
multiple people and experts

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
multiple people and experts
 

271
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,110
multiple people and experts
where the signal shows up and then

272
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
where the signal shows up and then
 

273
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,590
where the signal shows up and then
phosphene is in the atmosphere of venus

274
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
phosphene is in the atmosphere of venus
 

275
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,430
phosphene is in the atmosphere of venus
and some where it doesn't and then we

276
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
and some where it doesn't and then we
 

277
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,230
and some where it doesn't and then we
disagree what that signal means

278
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
disagree what that signal means
 

279
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,350
disagree what that signal means
if it's real and it is an ambiguously

280
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
if it's real and it is an ambiguously
 

281
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,390
if it's real and it is an ambiguously
phosphine

282
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
phosphine
 

283
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,310
phosphine
it is very exciting because we don't

284
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
it is very exciting because we don't
 

285
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,590
it is very exciting because we don't
know how to explain it

286
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
know how to explain it
 

287
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,870
know how to explain it
without life but going from there to

288
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
without life but going from there to
 

289
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,909
without life but going from there to
the nutrients is still a huge jump and

290
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
the nutrients is still a huge jump and
 

291
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,029
the nutrients is still a huge jump and
so

292
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
so
 

293
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,950
so
so that would be the the title for the

294
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
so that would be the the title for the
 

295
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,710
so that would be the the title for the
civilization if it is

296
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
civilization if it is
 

297
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,950
civilization if it is
a living and thriving and venus is

298
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
a living and thriving and venus is
 

299
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,150
a living and thriving and venus is
venusians

300
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
venusians
 

301
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,070
venusians
until we know what they call themselves

302
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
until we know what they call themselves
 

303
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,390
until we know what they call themselves
and that that's the name yes

304
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
and that that's the name yes
 

305
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,029
and that that's the name yes
so this is the early analysis of data or

306
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
so this is the early analysis of data or
 

307
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:21,590
so this is the early analysis of data or
a data

308
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
a data
 

309
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,870
a data
analysis of early data

310
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
analysis of early data
 

311
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,670
analysis of early data
it was nevertheless you waited until the

312
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
it was nevertheless you waited until the
 

313
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,590
it was nevertheless you waited until the
actual peer-reviewed publication

314
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
actual peer-reviewed publication
 

315
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,510
actual peer-reviewed publication
of course and analysis of the two

316
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
of course and analysis of the two
 

317
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,270
of course and analysis of the two
different instruments months apart so

318
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
different instruments months apart so
 

319
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,670
different instruments months apart so
that's

320
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
that's
 

321
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,710
that's
alma and jcmt the two telescopes

322
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
alma and jcmt the two telescopes
 

323
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,550
alma and jcmt the two telescopes
and it's still i mean it's really

324
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
and it's still i mean it's really
 

325
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,390
and it's still i mean it's really
exciting what what did it feel like sort

326
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
exciting what what did it feel like sort
 

327
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,310
exciting what what did it feel like sort
of sitting on this data

328
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
of sitting on this data
 

329
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,550
of sitting on this data
like kind of anticipating the

330
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
like kind of anticipating the
 

331
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,870
like kind of anticipating the
publication and wondering

332
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
publication and wondering
 

333
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,310
publication and wondering
and still wondering is it um is it true

334
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
and still wondering is it um is it true
 

335
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,870
and still wondering is it um is it true
like

336
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
like
 

337
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,430
like
how does it make you feel that a planet

338
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
how does it make you feel that a planet
 

339
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,430
how does it make you feel that a planet
in our solar system might have phosphine

340
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
in our solar system might have phosphine
 

341
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,710
in our solar system might have phosphine
in the atmosphere

342
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
in the atmosphere
 

343
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,350
in the atmosphere
it's nuts it's absolutely nuts

344
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360

 

345
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,390

i mean in the best possible way

346
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
i mean in the best possible way
 

347
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,029
i mean in the best possible way
i've been working on phosphine for over

348
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
i've been working on phosphine for over
 

349
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,870
i've been working on phosphine for over
a decade

350
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
a decade
 

351
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,189
a decade
before it was cool way before it was

352
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
before it was cool way before it was
 

353
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,150
before it was cool way before it was
cool

354
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
cool
 

355
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,150
cool
um before anyone could spell it or heard

356
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
um before anyone could spell it or heard
 

357
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,990
um before anyone could spell it or heard
of it and

358
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
of it and
 

359
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,590
of it and
at the time people either didn't know

360
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
at the time people either didn't know
 

361
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,670
at the time people either didn't know
what phosphine was or only knew it

362
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
what phosphine was or only knew it
 

363
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,550
what phosphine was or only knew it
for being just possibly the most

364
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
for being just possibly the most
 

365
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,230
for being just possibly the most
horrendous molecule that

366
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
horrendous molecule that
 

367
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,070
horrendous molecule that
ever graced the earth and so

368
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
ever graced the earth and so
 

369
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,189
ever graced the earth and so
no one was a fan um and i'd been

370
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
no one was a fan um and i'd been
 

371
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,270
no one was a fan um and i'd been
considering looking for it because i did

372
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
considering looking for it because i did
 

373
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,350
considering looking for it because i did
think it was an unusual and disgusting

374
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
think it was an unusual and disgusting
 

375
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,790
think it was an unusual and disgusting
but very promising sound

376
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
but very promising sound
 

377
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,629
but very promising sound
sign of life i've been looking for it

378
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
sign of life i've been looking for it
 

379
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,990
sign of life i've been looking for it
everywhere

380
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
everywhere
 

381
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,270
everywhere
i really didn't think to look in the

382
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
i really didn't think to look in the
 

383
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,150
i really didn't think to look in the
solar system i

384
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
solar system i
 

385
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,110
solar system i
thought it was all pretty rough around

386
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
thought it was all pretty rough around
 

387
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,830
thought it was all pretty rough around
here

388
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
here
 

389
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,230
here
for for life and so i wasn't even

390
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
for for life and so i wasn't even
 

391
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,510
for for life and so i wasn't even
considering

392
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
considering
 

393
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,950
considering
the solar system at all never mind next

394
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
the solar system at all never mind next
 

395

door venus it was only the lead author

396
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
door venus it was only the lead author
 

397
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,430
door venus it was only the lead author
of the study jane greaves who

398
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
of the study jane greaves who
 

399
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,350
of the study jane greaves who
thought to look in the clouds of venus

400
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
thought to look in the clouds of venus
 

401
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,029
thought to look in the clouds of venus
and then reached out to me

402
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
and then reached out to me
 

403
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,909
and then reached out to me
to say i don't know phosphene but i know

404
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
to say i don't know phosphene but i know
 

405
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,790
to say i don't know phosphene but i know
it's weird

406
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
it's weird
 

407
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,909
it's weird
um how weird is it and the answer is

408
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
um how weird is it and the answer is
 

409
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,870
um how weird is it and the answer is
very weird

410
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
very weird
 

411
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,710
very weird
and so the telescopes were looking at

412
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
and so the telescopes were looking at
 

413
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,029
and so the telescopes were looking at
this is visual data

414
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
this is visual data
 

415
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,870
this is visual data
what do you mean by visual you wouldn't

416
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
what do you mean by visual you wouldn't
 

417
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,070
what do you mean by visual you wouldn't
see the phosphene well

418
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
see the phosphene well
 

419
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,790
see the phosphene well
but i mean it's uh well it's a telescope

420
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
but i mean it's uh well it's a telescope
 

421
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,589
but i mean it's uh well it's a telescope
it's remote

422
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
it's remote
 

423
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,029
it's remote
it's remote you're observing

424
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
it's remote you're observing
 

425
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,629
it's remote you're observing
you're what's zooming in on this

what does the sensor actually look like

430
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
what does the sensor actually look like
 

431
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,990
what does the sensor actually look like
how many pixels are

432
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
how many pixels are
 

433
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,830
how many pixels are
there what does the data kind of look

434
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
there what does the data kind of look
 

435
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,390
there what does the data kind of look
like it'd be nice to kind of

436
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
like it'd be nice to kind of
 

437
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,990
like it'd be nice to kind of
build up intuition of how little data we

438
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
build up intuition of how little data we
 

439
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,629
build up intuition of how little data we
have

440
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
have
 

441
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,870
have
based on which i mean if you look at

442
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
based on which i mean if you look at
 

443
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,749
based on which i mean if you look at
like

i've just been reading a lot about
 

447
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,029
i've just been reading a lot about
gravitational waves and it's kind of

448
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
gravitational waves and it's kind of
 

449
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,230
gravitational waves and it's kind of
incredible

450
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
incredible
 

451
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,510
incredible

and in that same way it's kind of
 

463
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,629
and in that same way it's kind of
incredible how much data how much

vibrates in
 

487
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,189
vibrates in
special ways i calculated how many of

488
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
special ways i calculated how many of
 

489
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,909
special ways i calculated how many of
those ways

490
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
those ways
 

491
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,350
those ways
it can rotate vibrate it is 16.8 billion

492
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
it can rotate vibrate it is 16.8 billion
 

493
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,150
it can rotate vibrate it is 16.8 billion
ways what this means is that if you look

494
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
ways what this means is that if you look
 

495
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,230
ways what this means is that if you look
at the spectrum of light

496
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
at the spectrum of light
 

497
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,670
at the spectrum of light
and that light has gone through

498
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
and that light has gone through
 

499
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,070

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
left indentations left in that spectrum
 

505
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,630
left indentations left in that spectrum
we found one of those on venus one of

506
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
we found one of those on venus one of
 

507
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,710
we found one of those on venus one of
those 16.8 billion

508
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
those 16.8 billion
 

509
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,750
those 16.8 billion
so now the game is can we find any of

510
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
so now the game is can we find any of
 

511
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,190
so now the game is can we find any of
the other ones

512
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
the other ones
 

513
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,949
the other ones
yeah but they're really hard to spot

514
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
yeah but they're really hard to spot
 

515
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,110
yeah but they're really hard to spot
they're all in terrible places in the

516
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
they're all in terrible places in the
 

517
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,430
they're all in terrible places in the
electromagnetic spectrum

518
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
electromagnetic spectrum
 

519
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,430
electromagnetic spectrum
and the instruments we use to find this

520
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
and the instruments we use to find this
 

521
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,350
and the instruments we use to find this
one can't really

522
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
one can't really
 

523
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,030
one can't really
find any other one there's another one

524
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
find any other one there's another one
 

525
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,269
find any other one there's another one
of the 16.8 billion we could find but

526
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
of the 16.8 billion we could find but
 

527
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,030
of the 16.8 billion we could find but
it would take many many days of

528
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
it would take many many days of
 

529
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,110
it would take many many days of
continuous observations and that's not

530
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
continuous observations and that's not
 

531
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,030
continuous observations and that's not
really in the cards right now

532
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
really in the cards right now
 

533
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,110
really in the cards right now
i mean how do you there's all kinds of

534
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
i mean how do you there's all kinds of
 

535
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,230
i mean how do you there's all kinds of
noise first of all

536
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
noise first of all
 

537
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,430
noise first of all
yes there's uh all kinds of other

538
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
yes there's uh all kinds of other
 

539
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,030
yes there's uh all kinds of other
signal so how do you

540
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
signal so how do you
 

541
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,269
signal so how do you
separate all of that out to pull out

542
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
separate all of that out to pull out
 

543
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,790
separate all of that out to pull out
just this particular

544
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
just this particular
 

545
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,430
just this particular
signature that's associated with

546
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
signature that's associated with
 

547
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,949
signature that's associated with
phosphine

548
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
phosphine
 

549
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,590
phosphine
so the data kind of looks somewhat like

550
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
so the data kind of looks somewhat like
 

551
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,710
so the data kind of looks somewhat like
a wave

552
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
a wave
 

553
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,710
a wave
and a lot of that is noise and it's a

554
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
and a lot of that is noise and it's a
 

555
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,630
and a lot of that is noise and it's a
bass line and so if you can

556
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
bass line and so if you can
 

557
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,310
bass line and so if you can
figure out the exact shape of the wave

558
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
figure out the exact shape of the wave
 

559
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,230
figure out the exact shape of the wave
you can cancel that shape out and you

560
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
you can cancel that shape out and you
 

561
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,230
you can cancel that shape out and you
should be left with a straight line

562
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
should be left with a straight line
 

563
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,070
should be left with a straight line
and if there's something there an

564
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
and if there's something there an
 

565
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,550
and if there's something there an
absorption so a signal

566
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
absorption so a signal
 

567
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,070
absorption so a signal
so that's what we did we tried to find

568
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
so that's what we did we tried to find
 

569
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,630
so that's what we did we tried to find
out what was this baseline shape

570
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
out what was this baseline shape
 

571
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,790
out what was this baseline shape
cleaned it out and got the signal that's

572
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
cleaned it out and got the signal that's
 

573
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,550
cleaned it out and got the signal that's
part of the problem if you do this wrong

574
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
part of the problem if you do this wrong
 

575
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,230
part of the problem if you do this wrong
you can create a signal but that signal

576
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
you can create a signal but that signal
 

577
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,590
you can create a signal but that signal
is at 8.904 wavenumbers

578
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
is at 8.904 wavenumbers
 

579
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,150
is at 8.904 wavenumbers
and we actually have more digits than

580
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
and we actually have more digits than
 

581
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,790
and we actually have more digits than
that

582
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
that
 

583
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,110
that
but i don't remember by heart and an

584
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
but i don't remember by heart and an

alma in particular is a very very good

586
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
alma in particular is a very very good
 

587
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,630
alma in particular is a very very good
telescope array of telescopes and it can

588
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
telescope array of telescopes and it can
 

589
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,710
telescope array of telescopes and it can
focus on exactly that frequency

590
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
focus on exactly that frequency
 

591
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,870
focus on exactly that frequency
and in that frequency there are only two

592
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
and in that frequency there are only two
 

593
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,470
and in that frequency there are only two
known molecules

594
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
known molecules
 

595
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,870
known molecules
um that absorb at all so that's how we

596
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
um that absorb at all so that's how we
 

597
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,030
um that absorb at all so that's how we
do it we look at that exact spot where

598
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
do it we look at that exact spot where
 

599
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,030
do it we look at that exact spot where
we know fasting absorbs

600
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
we know fasting absorbs
 

601
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,069
we know fasting absorbs
the other molecule is so2

uh i you don't feel i feel those things

uh i you don't feel i feel those things
 

641
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,910
uh i you don't feel i feel those things
i just don't know if those are the right

i don't certainly don't feel scared i
think it's rather silly to feel scared

think it's rather silly to feel scared
definitely don't touch them um you know

definitely don't touch them um you know

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,910
definitely don't touch them um you know

i think one of the things with venus is

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,230
i think one of the things with venus is
because of phosphine now there is a

because of phosphine now there is a

chance
that venus is inhabited and in that case

that venus is inhabited and in that case

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,069
that venus is inhabited and in that case
we shouldn't go there we should be very

666
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
we shouldn't go there we should be very
 

667
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,949
we shouldn't go there we should be very
careful with messing with them

668
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
careful with messing with them
 

669
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,670
careful with messing with them
and bringing our own stuff there that

670
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
and bringing our own stuff there that
 

671
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,910
and bringing our own stuff there that
contaminates it

672
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
contaminates it
 

673
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,990
contaminates it
and venus has suffered enough if there's

674
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
and venus has suffered enough if there's
 

675
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,829
and venus has suffered enough if there's
life there it's probably the

676
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
life there it's probably the
 

677
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,509
life there it's probably the
remains of a living planet the very last

678
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
remains of a living planet the very last
 

679
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,990
remains of a living planet the very last
survivors of

680
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
survivors of
 

681
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,230
survivors of
what once was potentially a thriving

682
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
what once was potentially a thriving
 

683
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,750
what once was potentially a thriving
world and so

684
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
world and so
 

685
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,190
world and so
i don't want our first interaction with

686
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
i don't want our first interaction with
 

687
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,190
i don't want our first interaction with
alien life to be

688
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
alien life to be
 

689
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,590
alien life to be
massacre so i definitely wouldn't want

690
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
massacre so i definitely wouldn't want
 

691
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,430
massacre so i definitely wouldn't want
to go near out of a

692
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
to go near out of a
 

693
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,990
to go near out of a
let's say galactic responsibility

694
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
let's say galactic responsibility
 

695
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,150
let's say galactic responsibility
galactic ethics

696
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
galactic ethics
 

697
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,910
galactic ethics
and i often think of you know alien

698
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
and i often think of you know alien
 

699
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,150
and i often think of you know alien
astronomers watching us and

700
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
astronomers watching us and
 

701
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,670
astronomers watching us and
how disappointed they would be if we

702
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
how disappointed they would be if we
 

703
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,670
how disappointed they would be if we
mess this up so i really

704
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
mess this up so i really
 

705
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,509
mess this up so i really
i really want to be very careful with

706
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
i really want to be very careful with
 

707
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,670
i really want to be very careful with
anything that could be life

anything that could be life
 

709
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,910
anything that could be life
but certainly i wouldn't be scared

710
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
but certainly i wouldn't be scared
 

711
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,910
but certainly i wouldn't be scared
humans are plenty capable of killing one

help to destroy ourselves
 

719
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,470

survived
 

735
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,949

through some very difficult conditions

through some very difficult conditions
 

737
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,829
through some very difficult conditions
that doesn't mean

738
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
that doesn't mean
 

739
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,829
that doesn't mean
it would handle us you know it could be

740
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
it would handle us you know it could be
 

741
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,990
it would handle us you know it could be
like war of the worlds

you come just because you're resilient
 

745
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,829
you come just because you're resilient
in your own planet doesn't mean you can

746
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
in your own planet doesn't mean you can
 

747
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,790
in your own planet doesn't mean you can
survive another

748
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
survive another
 

749
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,430
survive another
even our extremophiles which are very

750
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
even our extremophiles which are very
 

751
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,790
even our extremophiles which are very
impressive we should all be very proud

752
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
impressive we should all be very proud
 

753
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,389
impressive we should all be very proud
of our extremophiles

754
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
of our extremophiles
 

755
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,150
of our extremophiles
they wouldn't really make it in the

756
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
they wouldn't really make it in the
 

757
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,829
they wouldn't really make it in the
venusian clouds

758
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
venusian clouds
 

759
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,150
venusian clouds
so i wouldn't expect because you're

760
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
so i wouldn't expect because you're
 

761
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,790
so i wouldn't expect because you're
tough even chuck norris stuff

762
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
tough even chuck norris stuff
 

763
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,870
tough even chuck norris stuff
that you would survive on an alien

764
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
that you would survive on an alien
 

765
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,389
that you would survive on an alien
planet uh

766
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
planet uh
 

767
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,670
planet uh
and and then from the scientific

768
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
and and then from the scientific
 

769
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,990
and and then from the scientific
perspective you don't want to pollute

770
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
perspective you don't want to pollute
 

771
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,790
perspective you don't want to pollute
the the data gathering process but we're

772
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
the the data gathering process but we're
 

773
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,829
the the data gathering process but we're
showing up there

774
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
showing up there
 

775
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,750
showing up there
the observer can can affect the observed

776
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
the observer can can affect the observed
 

777
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,030
the observer can can affect the observed
how heartbreaking would it be if we

778
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
how heartbreaking would it be if we
 

779
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,310
how heartbreaking would it be if we
found life on another planet and then

780
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
found life on another planet and then
 

781
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,870
found life on another planet and then
we're like

782
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
we're like
 

783
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,509
we're like
oh we we brought it with us it was my

784
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
oh we we brought it with us it was my
 

785
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,150
oh we we brought it with us it was my
sandwich

786
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
sandwich
 

787
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,550
sandwich
but that's always the problem right and

788
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
but that's always the problem right and
 

789
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,069
but that's always the problem right and
it's certainly a problem with mars

790
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
it's certainly a problem with mars
 

791
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,110
it's certainly a problem with mars
because we visited the that

792
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
because we visited the that
 

793
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,990
because we visited the that
that if there is life on mars or like

794
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
that if there is life on mars or like
 

795
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,750
that if there is life on mars or like
remains of life on ours

796
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
remains of life on ours
 

797
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,350
remains of life on ours
it's always going to be a question of

798
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
it's always going to be a question of
 

799
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,430
it's always going to be a question of
like well maybe we planted it there

800
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
like well maybe we planted it there
 

801
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,870
like well maybe we planted it there
let's not do the same with venus

802
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
let's not do the same with venus
 

803
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,470
let's not do the same with venus
it's harder because when we try to go to

804
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
it's harder because when we try to go to
 

805
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,230
it's harder because when we try to go to
venus and things melt

806
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
venus and things melt
 

807
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,470
venus and things melt
very quickly yeah and so it's pretty

808
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
very quickly yeah and so it's pretty
 

809
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,150
very quickly yeah and so it's pretty
it's a little harder to

810
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
it's a little harder to
 

811
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,110
it's a little harder to
pollute venus um it's very good at

812
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
pollute venus um it's very good at
 

813
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,710
pollute venus um it's very good at
destroying

814
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
destroying
 

815
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,430
destroying
foreigners yeah well in terms of elon

816
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,440
foreigners yeah well in terms of elon
 

817
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,230
foreigners yeah well in terms of elon
musk and

818
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
musk and
 

819
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,470
musk and
terraforming planets mars is stopped

820
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
terraforming planets mars is stopped
 

821
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,509
terraforming planets mars is stopped
number one then

822
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
number one then
 

823
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,790
number one then
venus may be after that so

824
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
venus may be after that so
 

825
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,629
venus may be after that so
uh can we talk about phosphine a little

826
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
uh can we talk about phosphine a little
 

827
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,949
uh can we talk about phosphine a little
bit um so you mentioned it's a pretty

828
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
bit um so you mentioned it's a pretty
 

829
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,670
bit um so you mentioned it's a pretty
i love fossee what's your twitter handle

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
i love fossee what's your twitter handle
 

831
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,750
i love fossee what's your twitter handle
that's like dr phosphene it's dr faustin

832
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
that's like dr phosphene it's dr faustin
 

833
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,230
that's like dr phosphene it's dr faustin
yes

834
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
yes
 

835
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,590
yes
you will be surprised here it wasn't

836
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
you will be surprised here it wasn't
 

837
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,189
you will be surprised here it wasn't
taken already i could just i just

838
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
taken already i could just i just
 

839
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,230
taken already i could just i just
grabbed it

840
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
grabbed it
 

841
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,350
grabbed it
didn't have to buy it off anyone yeah

842
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
didn't have to buy it off anyone yeah
 

843
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,230
didn't have to buy it off anyone yeah
so what uh what is it what's phosphine

844
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
so what uh what is it what's phosphine
 

845
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,069
so what uh what is it what's phosphine
you already mentioned it's pretty toxic

846
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
you already mentioned it's pretty toxic
 

847
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,030
you already mentioned it's pretty toxic
and

848
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
and
 

849
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,710
and
um troublesome and what and

850
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
um troublesome and what and
 

851
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,629
um troublesome and what and
outside

852
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639

 

853
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,750

so maybe what are some things that uh

854
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
so maybe what are some things that uh
 

855
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,870
so maybe what are some things that uh
make it interesting

856
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
make it interesting
 

857
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,150
make it interesting
chemically and why is it

858
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
chemically and why is it
 

859
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,110
chemically and why is it
a good sign of life uh one is present in

860
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
a good sign of life uh one is present in
 

861
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,230
a good sign of life uh one is present in
the atmosphere

862
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
the atmosphere
 

863
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,110
the atmosphere
like you've described in your paper uh

864
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
like you've described in your paper uh
 

865
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,030
like you've described in your paper uh
aptly titled the phosphine as a

866
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
aptly titled the phosphine as a
 

867
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,030
aptly titled the phosphine as a
biosignature gas in exoplanet

868
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
biosignature gas in exoplanet
 

869
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,230

i suppose you wrote that paper before

872
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
i suppose you wrote that paper before
 

873
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,990
i suppose you wrote that paper before
venus i did yes

874
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
venus i did yes
 

875
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,949
venus i did yes
it did and no one cared you know in that

876
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
it did and no one cared you know in that
 

877
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,470
it did and no one cared you know in that
paper i said something like

878
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
paper i said something like
 

879
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,710
paper i said something like
if we find phosphine on any terrestrial

880
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
if we find phosphine on any terrestrial
 

881
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,470
if we find phosphine on any terrestrial
planet can only mean life and everyone's

882
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
planet can only mean life and everyone's
 

883
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,670
planet can only mean life and everyone's
like yeah that sounds about right let's

884
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
like yeah that sounds about right let's
 

885
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,150
like yeah that sounds about right let's
go

886
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
go
 

887
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,590
go
and then venus shows up and i was like

888
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
and then venus shows up and i was like
 

889
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,189
and then venus shows up and i was like
are you sure i'm like

890
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
are you sure i'm like
 

891
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,710
are you sure i'm like
i was sure before i was sure now

892
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
i was sure before i was sure now
 

893
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,550
i was sure before i was sure now
that it's right here um i'm less sure

894
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
that it's right here um i'm less sure
 

895
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,670
that it's right here um i'm less sure
now that my claims are being tested

896
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
now that my claims are being tested
 

897
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,269
now that my claims are being tested
so phosphine fascinating is a

these are all molecules people have
 

933
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,590
these are all molecules people have
heard of but you do it to phosphorus

934
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
heard of but you do it to phosphorus
 

935
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,990
heard of but you do it to phosphorus
you get phosphine people haven't heard

936
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
you get phosphine people haven't heard
 

937
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,829
you get phosphine people haven't heard
of phosphene because

938
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
of phosphene because
 

939
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,470
of phosphene because
it's not really popular on earth um we

940
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
it's not really popular on earth um we
 

941
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,150
it's not really popular on earth um we
really shouldn't find it anywhere on

942
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
really shouldn't find it anywhere on
 

943
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,110
really shouldn't find it anywhere on

macabre ways
so it was used as a chemical warfare

960
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
so it was used as a chemical warfare
 

961
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,230
so it was used as a chemical warfare
agent in the first world war and

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,749
agent in the first world war and
most recently by isis so really bad

964
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
most recently by isis so really bad
 

965
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,790
most recently by isis so really bad
most life avoids it even life that might

966
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
most life avoids it even life that might
 

967
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,389
most life avoids it even life that might
not avoid it so life that doesn't use

still has to put crazy amounts of effort

972
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
still has to put crazy amounts of effort
 

973
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,110
still has to put crazy amounts of effort
into making it it's a really difficult

974
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
into making it it's a really difficult
 

975
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,990
into making it it's a really difficult
molecule to make

976
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
molecule to make
 

977
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,990
molecule to make
thermodynamically speaking it's really

978
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
thermodynamically speaking it's really
 

979
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,749
thermodynamically speaking it's really
difficult to make that phosphorus want

980
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
difficult to make that phosphorus want
 

981
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,069
difficult to make that phosphorus want
to be together with that hydrogen

982
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
to be together with that hydrogen
 

983
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,669
to be together with that hydrogen
so it's horrible everyone avoids it when

984
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
so it's horrible everyone avoids it when
 

985
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,510
so it's horrible everyone avoids it when
they're not avoiding it is extremely

986
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
they're not avoiding it is extremely
 

987
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,110
they're not avoiding it is extremely
difficult to make you would have to put

988
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
difficult to make you would have to put
 

989
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,669

991
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,230

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
in sacrifice energy to make it and if
 

993
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,750
in sacrifice energy to make it and if
you did go through all that trouble

994
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
you did go through all that trouble
 

995
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,189
you did go through all that trouble
and made it it gets um reacted with the

996
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
and made it it gets um reacted with the
 

997
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,789
and made it it gets um reacted with the
radicals in the atmosphere and gets

998
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
radicals in the atmosphere and gets
 

999
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,150
radicals in the atmosphere and gets
destroyed

1000
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
destroyed
 

1001
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,669

so we shouldn't find it anywhere and yet

1002
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
so we shouldn't find it anywhere and yet
 

1003
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,429
so we shouldn't find it anywhere and yet
we do it's kind of

1004
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
we do it's kind of
 

1005
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,630
we do it's kind of
weird molecule that seems to

1006
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
weird molecule that seems to
 

1007
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,630
weird molecule that seems to
be made by life and we don't even know

1008
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
be made by life and we don't even know
 

1009
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,430
be made by life and we don't even know
why life clearly finds a use for it

1010
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
why life clearly finds a use for it
 

1011
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,950
why life clearly finds a use for it
it's not the only molecule the life is

1012
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
it's not the only molecule the life is
 

1013
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,190
it's not the only molecule the life is
willing to sacrifice energy to make but

1014
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
willing to sacrifice energy to make but
 

1015
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,110
willing to sacrifice energy to make but
we don't know how or why life is even

1016
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
we don't know how or why life is even
 

1017
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,310
we don't know how or why life is even
making it so absolutely mysterious

1018
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
making it so absolutely mysterious
 

1019
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,150
making it so absolutely mysterious
absolutely deadly smells horrifically

1020
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
absolutely deadly smells horrifically
 

1021
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,830
absolutely deadly smells horrifically
when it's made it produces other kind of

1022
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
when it's made it produces other kind of
 

1023
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,350
when it's made it produces other kind of
diphosphines and

1024
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
diphosphines and
 

1025
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,270
diphosphines and
it's been reported as smelling like

1026
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
it's been reported as smelling like
 

1027
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,430
it's been reported as smelling like
garlicky fishy death

1028
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
garlicky fishy death
 

1029
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,029
garlicky fishy death
uh once someone referred to it as

1030
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039
uh once someone referred to it as
 

1031
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,789
uh once someone referred to it as
smelling like the let me see if i

1032
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
smelling like the let me see if i
 

1033
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,510
smelling like the let me see if i
remember the

1034
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
remember the
 

1035
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,470
remember the
the rancid diapers of the spawn of satan

1036
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
the rancid diapers of the spawn of satan
 

1037
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,950
the rancid diapers of the spawn of satan
oh

1038
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
oh
 

1039
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,070
oh
very nice yeah very very vivid and so

1040
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
very nice yeah very very vivid and so
 

1041
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,310
very nice yeah very very vivid and so
you're a poet after all i didn't i

1042
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
you're a poet after all i didn't i
 

1043
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,990
you're a poet after all i didn't i
didn't call it that someone else did

1044
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
didn't call it that someone else did
 

1045
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,549
didn't call it that someone else did
and so it's just this horrific molecule

1046
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
and so it's just this horrific molecule
 

1047
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,549
and so it's just this horrific molecule
but it is produced by life

1048
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
but it is produced by life
 

1049
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,870
but it is produced by life
we don't know why and when it is

1050
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
we don't know why and when it is
 

1051
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,549
we don't know why and when it is
produced by life is done with enormous

1052
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
produced by life is done with enormous
 

1053
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,590
produced by life is done with enormous
sacrifice

1054
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
sacrifice
 

1055
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,950
sacrifice
and the universe does not sacrifice life

1056
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
and the universe does not sacrifice life
 

1057
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,070
and the universe does not sacrifice life
sacrifices and so it's this strange

1058
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
sacrifices and so it's this strange
 

1059
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,909
sacrifices and so it's this strange
contradictory molecule that we should

1060
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
contradictory molecule that we should
 

1061
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,590
contradictory molecule that we should
all be avoiding and yet

1062
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
all be avoiding and yet
 

1063
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,590
all be avoiding and yet
seems to be an almost unambiguous sign

1064
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
seems to be an almost unambiguous sign
 

1065
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,470
seems to be an almost unambiguous sign
of life on rocky planets

1066
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
of life on rocky planets
 

1067
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,549
of life on rocky planets
okay can we dig into that a little bit

1068
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
okay can we dig into that a little bit
 

1069
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,630
okay can we dig into that a little bit
so what on rocky planets

1070
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
so what on rocky planets
 

1071
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,669
so what on rocky planets
what uh is there biological mechanisms

1072
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
what uh is there biological mechanisms
 

1073
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,710
what uh is there biological mechanisms
that can produce it

1074
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
that can produce it
 

1075
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,750
that can produce it
and is there is there

1076
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
and is there is there
 

1077
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,789
and is there is there
you said the why is unclear why

1078
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
you said the why is unclear why
 

1079
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,830
you said the why is unclear why
life might produce it but is there an

1080
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
life might produce it but is there an
 

1081
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,669
life might produce it but is there an
understanding of what kind of mechanisms

1082
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
understanding of what kind of mechanisms
 

1083
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,430
understanding of what kind of mechanisms
might be able to produce it this very

1084
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,440
might be able to produce it this very
 

1085
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,830
might be able to produce it this very
difficult to produce

1086
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840
difficult to produce
 

1087
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,990
difficult to produce

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
this is not actually as surprising as it
 

1095
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,070
this is not actually as surprising as it
might sound i think something like 80

1096
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
might sound i think something like 80
 

1097
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,029
might sound i think something like 80

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,029
we don't know how it is much easier to
know life produces something because you

1104
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
know life produces something because you
 

1105
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,710
know life produces something because you
can put you know bacteria in a petri

is there an urgency now like if you were
 

1141
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,430
is there an urgency now like if you were

1179
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,870

because we know that faucino is really

it's extremely difficult for even these

1192
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
it's extremely difficult for even these
 

1193
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,549
it's extremely difficult for even these
extreme processes to make it

extreme processes to make it
 

1195
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,470
extreme processes to make it
so it's not really surprising that only

1196
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
so it's not really surprising that only
 

1197
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,070
so it's not really surprising that only
life can do it because life

1198
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
life can do it because life
 

1199
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,070
life can do it because life
is willing to make things at a cost

is willing to make things at a cost
 

1201
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,430
is willing to make things at a cost
so maybe on the topic of phosphine what

1202
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
so maybe on the topic of phosphine what
 

1203
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,990
so maybe on the topic of phosphine what
uh again you're you've gotten yourself

uh again you're you've gotten yourself
into trouble with that i'm going to ask

1206
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,200
into trouble with that i'm going to ask
 

1207
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,990
into trouble with that i'm going to ask
you all these like

no i would love it
okay what when did you first

1214
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
okay what when did you first
 

1215
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,830
okay what when did you first
fall in love with phosphine

1216
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
fall in love with phosphine
 

1217
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,390
fall in love with phosphine
it wasn't love at first sight it was

1218
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
it wasn't love at first sight it was
 

1219
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,549
it wasn't love at first sight it was
somewhere between

i knew i wanted to learn about molecular

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
i knew i wanted to learn about molecular
 

1231
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,390
i knew i wanted to learn about molecular

i thought it was really outrage

1234
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
i thought it was really outrage
 

1235
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,230
i thought it was really outrage
outrageous that we as a species

1236
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
outrageous that we as a species
 

1237
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,230
outrageous that we as a species
couldn't detect molecules remotely we

phosphine

phosphine
 

1249
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,950
phosphine
the fact that we didn't really know how

1250
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
the fact that we didn't really know how
 

1251
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,230
the fact that we didn't really know how
it interacted with light

1252
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
it interacted with light
 

1253
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,390
it interacted with light
and so we couldn't detect it properly

1254
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
and so we couldn't detect it properly
 

1255
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,149
and so we couldn't detect it properly
you know in the galaxy

1256
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
you know in the galaxy
 

1257
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,029
you know in the galaxy
just i was so indignant and so initially

1258
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
just i was so indignant and so initially
 

1259
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,390
just i was so indignant and so initially
i just

1260
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
i just
 

1261
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,310
i just
started working on phosphine because

1262
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
started working on phosphine because
 

1263
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,669
started working on phosphine because
people hadn't before

1264
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
people hadn't before
 

1265
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,590
people hadn't before
and i thought we should know what

1266
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
and i thought we should know what
 

1267
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,430
and i thought we should know what
phosphine looks like

1268
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
phosphine looks like
 

1269
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,310
phosphine looks like
that was it and then i read every paper

1270
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
that was it and then i read every paper
 

1271
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,430
that was it and then i read every paper
that's ever been published about

1272
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
that's ever been published about
 

1273
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,230
that's ever been published about

1275
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,830

it was quite easy because there aren't

1276
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
it was quite easy because there aren't
 

1277
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,430
it was quite easy because there aren't
that many

1278
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
that many
 

1279
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,870
that many
and that's when i started learning about

1280
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
and that's when i started learning about
 

1281
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,390
and that's when i started learning about
where we had already founded

1282
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
where we had already founded
 

1283
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,430
where we had already founded
in the universe and what it meant um i

1284
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
in the universe and what it meant um i
 

1285
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,950
in the universe and what it meant um i
started finding out quite how little we

1286
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
started finding out quite how little we
 

1287
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,830
started finding out quite how little we
know about it

1288
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
know about it
 

1289
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,270
know about it
and why and it was only when i

1290
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
and why and it was only when i
 

1291
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,190
and why and it was only when i
joined mit and i started talking to

1292
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
joined mit and i started talking to
 

1293
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,029
joined mit and i started talking to
biochemists

1294
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
biochemists
 

1295
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,830
biochemists
that the that have been became clear

1296
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
that the that have been became clear
 

1297
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,750
that the that have been became clear
that fossen wasn't just

1298
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
that fossen wasn't just
 

1299
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,830
that fossen wasn't just
weird and special and understudied and

1300
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
weird and special and understudied and
 

1301
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,350
weird and special and understudied and
disgusting

1302
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
disgusting
 

1303
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,590
disgusting
it was all these things for oxygen

1304
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
it was all these things for oxygen
 

1305
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,710

and it was the anaerobic world that

1308
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
and it was the anaerobic world that
 

1309
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,230
and it was the anaerobic world that
would welcome phosphine and that's when

1310
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
would welcome phosphine and that's when
 

1311
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,230
would welcome phosphine and that's when
the idea of looking for it on other

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,240
the idea of looking for it on other
 

1313
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,230
the idea of looking for it on other
planets became crystallized

1314
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240
planets became crystallized
 

1315
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,110
planets became crystallized
because oxygen is very powerful and very

1316
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120
because oxygen is very powerful and very

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,110
because oxygen is very powerful and very
important on earth but

1318
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
important on earth but
 

1319
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,630
important on earth but
that's not necessarily going to be the

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
that's not necessarily going to be the
 

1321
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,789
that's not necessarily going to be the
case on other exoplanets most planets

00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
case on other exoplanets most planets
 

1323
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,470
case on other exoplanets most planets
are oxygen pole

1324
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
are oxygen pole
 

1325
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,870
are oxygen pole
overwhelmingly most planets are oxygen

and so finding the sign of life that

1330
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:01,840
and so finding the sign of life that
 

1331
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,510
and so finding the sign of life that
would be welcomed by

would be welcomed by
 

1333
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,710
would be welcomed by
everything that would live without

oxygen
 

1337
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,149
oxygen
on earth seemed so cool

1338
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159

 

1339
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,390

and but ultimately the project the first

1340
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
and but ultimately the project the first
 

1341
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,909
and but ultimately the project the first
is born of the idea that you want to

1342
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
is born of the idea that you want to
 

1343
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,190
is born of the idea that you want to
find that molecular

1344
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
find that molecular
 

1345
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,470
find that molecular
fingerprint of any of a

1346
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
fingerprint of any of a
 

1347
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,350
fingerprint of any of a
molecule so and that this is just one

1348
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
molecule so and that this is just one
 

1349
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,470
molecule so and that this is just one
example

1350
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
example
 

1351
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,070
example
and that's connected

1352
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
and that's connected
 

1353
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,789
and that's connected
to then looking at for looking for that

1354
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
to then looking at for looking for that
 

1355
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,070
to then looking at for looking for that
fingerprint elsewhere in

1356
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
fingerprint elsewhere in
 

1357
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,029
fingerprint elsewhere in
in a remote way and obviously that then

1358
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
in a remote way and obviously that then
 

1359
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,950
in a remote way and obviously that then
at that time were exoplanets already

1360
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
at that time were exoplanets already
 

1361
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,549
at that time were exoplanets already
when you were doing your phd and you

1362
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
when you were doing your phd and you
 

1363
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,710
when you were doing your phd and you
by those should say your phd thesis was

1364
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
by those should say your phd thesis was
 

1365
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,630
by those should say your phd thesis was
on it wasn't it's all on phosphine 100

1366
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
on it wasn't it's all on phosphine 100
 

1367
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,070
on it wasn't it's all on phosphine 100
with a little bit of pneumonia i have a

1368
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
with a little bit of pneumonia i have a
 

1369
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,310
with a little bit of pneumonia i have a
chapter that i i did

1370
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
chapter that i i did
 

1371
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,549
chapter that i i did
where i talked about phosphine and

1372
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
where i talked about phosphine and
 

1373
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,750
where i talked about phosphine and
ammonia so i

1374
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
ammonia so i
 

1375
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,710
ammonia so i
got it but no phosphine is very much my

1376
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
got it but no phosphine is very much my
 

1377
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,990
got it but no phosphine is very much my
thesis um but at that

1378
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
thesis um but at that
 

1379
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,990
thesis um but at that
that at that time when you're writing it

1380
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
that at that time when you're writing it
 

1381
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,149
that at that time when you're writing it
there's already a sense that exoplanets

1382
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159
there's already a sense that exoplanets
 

1383
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,029
there's already a sense that exoplanets
are out there

1384
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
are out there
 

1385
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,510
are out there
and uh we might be able to be looking

1386
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
and uh we might be able to be looking
 

1387
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,750
and uh we might be able to be looking
for bio signatures for

1388
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
for bio signatures for
 

1389
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,870
for bio signatures for
um on those exoplanets pretty much so i

1390
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:08,880
um on those exoplanets pretty much so i
 

1391
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,430
um on those exoplanets pretty much so i
finished my phd in 2015

1392
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
finished my phd in 2015
 

1393
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,590
finished my phd in 2015
we found the first exoplanets in the

1394
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
we found the first exoplanets in the
 

1395
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,549
we found the first exoplanets in the
kind of mid to late

1396
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
kind of mid to late
 

1397
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,750
kind of mid to late
90s so exoplanets were known it was

1398
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
90s so exoplanets were known it was
 

1399
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:17,990
90s so exoplanets were known it was
known

1400
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
known
 

1401
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,630
known
that some had atmospheres and from there

1402
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
that some had atmospheres and from there
 

1403
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,390
that some had atmospheres and from there
it's not a big jump to think well if

1404
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
it's not a big jump to think well if
 

1405
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,510
it's not a big jump to think well if
some have atmospheres

1406
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
some have atmospheres
 

1407
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,830
some have atmospheres
some of those might be habitable and

1408
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
some of those might be habitable and
 

1409
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,029
some of those might be habitable and
some of those may be

1410
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
some of those may be
 

1411
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,190
some of those may be
inhabited so how do you

1412
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
inhabited so how do you
 

1413
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,070
inhabited so how do you
detect you started to talk about it but

1414
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
detect you started to talk about it but
 

1415
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,070
detect you started to talk about it but
can we linger on it how do you detect

1416
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
can we linger on it how do you detect
 

1417
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,350
can we linger on it how do you detect

what does it look like you've kind of
 

1429
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,710
what does it look like you've kind of
mentioned the wave

1430
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
mentioned the wave
 

1431
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,070
mentioned the wave
but what are we what are we supposed to

think about what are the tools

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,990
think about what are the tools
what are the uncertainties all those

what are the uncertainties all those
 

1437
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,750
what are the uncertainties all those
kinds of things so the

1438
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
kinds of things so the
 

1439
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,230
kinds of things so the
the path can go this way you've got

1440
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,240
the path can go this way you've got
 

1441
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,510
the path can go this way you've got

kind of pure light you can crack that
 

1445
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,350
kind of pure light you can crack that

could consider that rainbow to just
cover continuously all of these colors

cover continuously all of these colors
but if that light goes through a gas

absorbs only very specific colors of
that rainbow

1480
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
that rainbow
 

1481
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,470
that rainbow
and so if you know for example that

1482
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:44,480
and so if you know for example that
 

1483
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,830
and so if you know for example that
shade of green

1484
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
shade of green
 

1485
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,470
shade of green
can only be absorbed by methane then you

1486
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
can only be absorbed by methane then you
 

1487
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,669
can only be absorbed by methane then you
can watch

1488
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:49,679
can watch
 

1489
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,909
can watch
as a planet passes in front of a star

1490
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
as a planet passes in front of a star
 

1491
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,430
as a planet passes in front of a star
the planet is too far away you can't see

1492
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
the planet is too far away you can't see
 

1493
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,149
the planet is too far away you can't see
it

1494
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
it
 

1495
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,149
it
and it has an atmosphere that atmosphere

1496
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
and it has an atmosphere that atmosphere
 

1497
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,590
and it has an atmosphere that atmosphere
is far too small you definitely can't

1498
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
is far too small you definitely can't
 

1499
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,630
is far too small you definitely can't
see it

1500
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
see it
 

1501
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,390
see it
but the sunlight will go through that

1502
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
but the sunlight will go through that
 

1503
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,990
but the sunlight will go through that
atmosphere and if that atmosphere is

1504
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
atmosphere and if that atmosphere is
 

1505
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,950
atmosphere and if that atmosphere is
methane

1506
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
methane
 

1507
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,669
methane
then on the other side that shade of

1508
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
then on the other side that shade of
 

1509
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,950
then on the other side that shade of
blue i can't remember if i said blue

1510
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960
blue i can't remember if i said blue
 

1511
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,669
blue i can't remember if i said blue
green but that color will be missing

1512
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
green but that color will be missing
 

1513
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,870
green but that color will be missing
because methane took it and so with

1514
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
because methane took it and so with
 

1515
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,310
because methane took it and so with
phosphene it's the same thing

1516
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
phosphene it's the same thing
 

1517
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,990
phosphene it's the same thing
it has specific colors 16.8 billion

1518
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
it has specific colors 16.8 billion
 

1519
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,710
it has specific colors 16.8 billion
colors that it absorbs it and nothing

1520
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:20,720
colors that it absorbs it and nothing
 

1521
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,830
colors that it absorbs it and nothing
else does

1522
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
else does
 

1523
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,750
else does
and so if you can find them and notice

1524
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
and so if you can find them and notice
 

1525
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,029
and so if you can find them and notice
them missing

1526
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
them missing
 

1527
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,990
them missing
from the light of a star that went

1528
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
from the light of a star that went
 

1529
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,830
from the light of a star that went
through a planet's atmosphere

1530
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
through a planet's atmosphere
 

1531
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,269
through a planet's atmosphere
then you'll know that atmosphere

1532
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
then you'll know that atmosphere
 

1533
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,029
then you'll know that atmosphere
contains the molecule

1534
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
contains the molecule
 

1535
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,110
contains the molecule
how cool is that that's incredible so

how cool is that that's incredible so
 

1537
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,510
how cool is that that's incredible so
you can have this

1538
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
you can have this
 

1539
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,350
you can have this

also vibrating and rotating and so it's
 

1595
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,110

i got it okay we can go back to venus
actually and and show that

1642
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
actually and and show that
 

1643
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,750
actually and and show that
so with this i mentioned those two

1644
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
so with this i mentioned those two
 

1645
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,590
so with this i mentioned those two
molecules that could be responsible for

1646
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:35,600
molecules that could be responsible for
 

1647
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,190
molecules that could be responsible for
that signal at the resolution that we

1648
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
that signal at the resolution that we
 

1649
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,590
that signal at the resolution that we
have

1650
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
have
 

1651
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,630
have
it was phosphine and so2 um

1652
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:40,640
it was phosphine and so2 um
 

1653
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,149
it was phosphine and so2 um
sulfur dioxide and at that resolution

1654
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:44,159
sulfur dioxide and at that resolution
 

1655
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,230
sulfur dioxide and at that resolution
could really be one of the other but in

1656
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
could really be one of the other but in
 

1657
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,149
could really be one of the other but in
that same bandwidth so in the kind of

1658
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
that same bandwidth so in the kind of
 

1659
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,510
that same bandwidth so in the kind of
the same observations

1660
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,520
the same observations
 

1661
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,510
the same observations
there was another region where phosphine

1662
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
there was another region where phosphine
 

1663
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,269
there was another region where phosphine
does not absorb we know that

1664
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:53,279
does not absorb we know that
 

1665
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,710
does not absorb we know that
but so2 does so we just went unchecked

1666
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
but so2 does so we just went unchecked
 

1667
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,909
but so2 does so we just went unchecked
and there was no signal so we thought oh

1668
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
and there was no signal so we thought oh
 

1669
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,149
and there was no signal so we thought oh
then it must be phosphene and then we

1670
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:02,159
then it must be phosphene and then we
 

1671
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,510
then it must be phosphene and then we
submit to the paper

1672
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520

 

1673
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,190

the rest is history i got it uh well

1674
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
the rest is history i got it uh well
 

1675
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,909
the rest is history i got it uh well
yeah

1676
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
yeah
 

1677
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,029
yeah
that's beautifully told

1678
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
that's beautifully told
 

1679
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,190
that's beautifully told
is there so the telescopes we're talking

1680
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
is there so the telescopes we're talking
 

1681
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,909
is there so the telescopes we're talking
about are sitting on earth

1682
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
about are sitting on earth
 

1683
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,430
about are sitting on earth
what can it help solving this

1684
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,440
what can it help solving this
 

1685
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,789
what can it help solving this
fingerprint molecular

1686
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
fingerprint molecular
 

1687
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,990
fingerprint molecular
fingerprint problem if we do a flyby

1688
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
fingerprint problem if we do a flyby
 

1689
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,310
fingerprint problem if we do a flyby
does it help if we get closer and closer

1690
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
does it help if we get closer and closer
 

1691
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,350
does it help if we get closer and closer
or are telescopes pretty damn good

1692
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
or are telescopes pretty damn good
 

1693
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,830
or are telescopes pretty damn good
for this kind of uh puzzle solving

1694
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,840
for this kind of uh puzzle solving
 

1695
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,350
for this kind of uh puzzle solving
subscripts are pretty good but the

1696
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
subscripts are pretty good but the
 

1697
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,029
subscripts are pretty good but the
earth's atmosphere

1698
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,039
earth's atmosphere
 

1699
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,029
earth's atmosphere
is a pain i mean i'm very thankful for

1700
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
is a pain i mean i'm very thankful for
 

1701
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,789
is a pain i mean i'm very thankful for
it but

1702
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:40,799
it but
 

1703
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,190
it but
it does interrupt a lot of measurements

1704
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
it does interrupt a lot of measurements
 

1705
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,830
it does interrupt a lot of measurements
and a lot of

1706
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
and a lot of
 

1707
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,990
and a lot of
regions where phosphine would be active

1708
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,000
regions where phosphine would be active
 

1709
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,110
regions where phosphine would be active
they are not available

1710
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
they are not available
 

1711
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,230
they are not available
the earth is not transparent

1712
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
the earth is not transparent
 

1713
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,110
the earth is not transparent
in those wavelengths so being above the

1714
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
in those wavelengths so being above the
 

1715
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,110
in those wavelengths so being above the
atmosphere would make a huge difference

1716
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,120
atmosphere would make a huge difference
 

1717
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,590
atmosphere would make a huge difference
then proximity matters a lot less but

1718
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
then proximity matters a lot less but
 

1719
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,230
then proximity matters a lot less but
just

1720
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
just
 

1721
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,990
just
escaping the earth's atmosphere would be

1722
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,000
escaping the earth's atmosphere would be
 

1723
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,909
escaping the earth's atmosphere would be
wonderful but then it's really hard to

1724
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
wonderful but then it's really hard to
 

1725
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,110
wonderful but then it's really hard to
stay very stable

1726
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
stay very stable
 

1727
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,909
stay very stable
and if there is phosphate on venus

1728
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:05,919
and if there is phosphate on venus
 

1729
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,350
and if there is phosphate on venus
there's very little of it

1730
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
there's very little of it
 

1731
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,549
there's very little of it
in the clouds and so the signal is very

1732
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:10,559
in the clouds and so the signal is very
 

1733
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,190
in the clouds and so the signal is very
weak

1734
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
weak
 

1735
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,389
weak
and the telescopes we can use on earth

1736
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
and the telescopes we can use on earth
 

1737
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:14,789
and the telescopes we can use on earth
are

1738
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
are
 

1739
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,870
are
much bigger and much more stable so it's

1740
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:16,880
much bigger and much more stable so it's
 

1741
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,310
much bigger and much more stable so it's
a bit of a trade-off

1742
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
a bit of a trade-off
 

1743
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,350
a bit of a trade-off
so is it

1744
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
so is it
 

1745
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,269
so is it
are you um with this kind of remote

1746
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
are you um with this kind of remote
 

1747
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,389
are you um with this kind of remote
observation

1748
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:24,399
observation
 

1749
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,669
observation
is it at all helpful to uh

1750
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:27,679
is it at all helpful to uh
 

1751
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,950
is it at all helpful to uh
strive for going over to venus and like

1752
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
strive for going over to venus and like
 

1753
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,070
strive for going over to venus and like
grabbing a scoop of the atmosphere

1754
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
grabbing a scoop of the atmosphere
 

1755
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,470
grabbing a scoop of the atmosphere
or is remote observation really a a

1756
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
or is remote observation really a a
 

1757
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,149
or is remote observation really a a
powerful tool

1758
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
powerful tool
 

1759
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,830
powerful tool
for this kind of job like the scoop is

1760
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
for this kind of job like the scoop is
 

1761
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,590
for this kind of job like the scoop is
not necessary

1762
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
not necessary
 

1763
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,669
not necessary
well a lot of people want to scoop i get

1764
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:43,679
well a lot of people want to scoop i get
 

1765
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,789
well a lot of people want to scoop i get
it

1766
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
it
 

1767
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,990
it
i get it inclination yeah i don't want

1768
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
i get it inclination yeah i don't want
 

1769
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,070
i get it inclination yeah i don't want
to scoop specifically because if it is

1770
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080
to scoop specifically because if it is
 

1771
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,470
to scoop specifically because if it is
life

1772
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
life
 

1773
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,350
life
i want to know everything i can remotely

1774
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,360
i want to know everything i can remotely
 

1775
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,029
i want to know everything i can remotely
before i interfere

1776
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
before i interfere
 

1777
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,190
before i interfere
um so that's my i've got ethical reasons

1778
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
um so that's my i've got ethical reasons
 

1779
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,029
um so that's my i've got ethical reasons
against the scoop more than engineering

1780
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
against the scoop more than engineering
 

1781
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,549
against the scoop more than engineering
reasons against the scoop

1782
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:00,559
reasons against the scoop
 

1783
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,149
reasons against the scoop
but i have some engineering reasons

1784
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
but i have some engineering reasons
 

1785
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,750
but i have some engineering reasons
against the scoop scoop is not a

1786
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
against the scoop scoop is not a
 

1787
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,269
against the scoop scoop is not a
technical term but i feel like now it's

1788
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
technical term but i feel like now it's
 

1789
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:05,909
technical term but i feel like now it's
too late

1790
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
too late
 

1791
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,590
too late
thank you for going along with this it's

1792
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,600
thank you for going along with this it's
 

1793
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,830
thank you for going along with this it's
too late to take it back i appreciate it

1794
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
too late to take it back i appreciate it
 

1795
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,350
too late to take it back i appreciate it
we don't understand the clouds well

1796
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
we don't understand the clouds well
 

1797
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,430
we don't understand the clouds well
enough to plan the scoop

1798
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440
enough to plan the scoop
 

1799
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,830
enough to plan the scoop
very well because it's not that uh

1800
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:15,840
very well because it's not that uh
 

1801
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,070
very well because it's not that uh
saturated like there's not that much of

1802
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
saturated like there's not that much of
 

1803
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,029
saturated like there's not that much of
it present

1804
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
it present
 

1805
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,389
it present
no and the place is nasty you know it's

1806
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
no and the place is nasty you know it's

no and the place is nasty you know it's
not

not
it's not going to be easy to build

1810
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
it's not going to be easy to build
 

1811
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,149
it's not going to be easy to build
something that can do

1812
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
something that can do
 

1813
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,190
something that can do
the task reliably and can be trusted

the task reliably and can be trusted
 

1815
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,909
the task reliably and can be trusted
the measurements can be trusted and then

1816
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:31,919
the measurements can be trusted and then
 

1817
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,029
the measurements can be trusted and then
passed that message on

1818
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
passed that message on
 

1819
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,669
passed that message on
so actually i'm for an orbiter i think

1820
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
so actually i'm for an orbiter i think
 

1821
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,350
so actually i'm for an orbiter i think
we should have orbiters around

1822
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
we should have orbiters around
 

1823
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,830
we should have orbiters around
every solar system body whose job is

1824
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
every solar system body whose job is
 

1825
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,149
every solar system body whose job is
just to learn about these places

1826
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
just to learn about these places
 

1827
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,389
just to learn about these places
i'm disappointed we haven't already got

1828
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
i'm disappointed we haven't already got
 

1829
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,190
i'm disappointed we haven't already got
an orbiter

1830
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,200
an orbiter
 

1831
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,750
an orbiter
around every single one of them a small

1832
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
around every single one of them a small
 

1833
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,110
around every single one of them a small
it can be a small satellite

1834
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,120
it can be a small satellite
 

1835
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,789
it can be a small satellite
schlotting data figuring out you know

schlotting data figuring out you know
 

1837
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,190
schlotting data figuring out you know
how do the clouds move what's in them

1838
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,200
how do the clouds move what's in them
 

1839
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,710
how do the clouds move what's in them
how often is there lightning and

1840
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
how often is there lightning and
 

1841
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,029
how often is there lightning and
volcanic activity where's the topography

things we should be
 

1849
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,909
things we should be
monitoring this from afar and so i'm for

venus
 

1857
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,630
venus
that would be that would be my choice

1858
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:12,640
that would be that would be my choice
 

1859
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,470
that would be that would be my choice
okay so now

1860
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,480
okay so now
 

1861
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,710
okay so now
recently venus is all exciting about

1862
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:16,720
recently venus is all exciting about
 

1863
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,110
recently venus is all exciting about
phosphine and everything is there

1864
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,120
phosphine and everything is there
 

1865
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,269
phosphine and everything is there
is there other stuff maybe before we

1866
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:21,279
is there other stuff maybe before we
 

1867
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,029
is there other stuff maybe before we
were looking at venus or now

1868
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:23,039
were looking at venus or now
 

1869
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,789
were looking at venus or now
looking out into other solar systems

1870
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
looking out into other solar systems
 

1871
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,269
looking out into other solar systems
is there other promising exoplanets or

1872
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
is there other promising exoplanets or
 

1873
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,990
is there other promising exoplanets or
other planets within the solar system

1874
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000
other planets within the solar system
 

1875
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,789
other planets within the solar system
that might have phosphine or might have

1876
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
that might have phosphine or might have
 

1877
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,990
that might have phosphine or might have
other

1878
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
other
 

1879
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,950
other
strong biosignatures that we should be

1880
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
strong biosignatures that we should be
 

1881
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,549
strong biosignatures that we should be
looking for

1882
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:40,559
looking for
 

1883
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,149
looking for
like phosphine there's a few but

1884
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
like phosphine there's a few but
 

1885
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,549
like phosphine there's a few but
outside the solar system all are kind of

1886
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:46,559
outside the solar system all are kind of
 

1887
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,230
outside the solar system all are kind of
promising candidates

1888
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,240
promising candidates
 

1889
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,230
promising candidates
we know so little about them for most of

1890
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,240
we know so little about them for most of
 

1891
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,470
we know so little about them for most of
them we barely know their density

1892
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,480
them we barely know their density
 

1893
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,950
them we barely know their density
um most of them we don't even know if

1894
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
um most of them we don't even know if
 

1895
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,070
um most of them we don't even know if
they have an atmosphere

1896
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
they have an atmosphere
 

1897
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,070
they have an atmosphere
never mind what that atmosphere might

1898
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
never mind what that atmosphere might
 

1899
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,230
never mind what that atmosphere might
contain so we're still very much the

1900
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
contain so we're still very much the
 

1901
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,430
contain so we're still very much the
stage where

1902
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:01,440
stage where
 

1903
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,830
stage where
we have detected promising planets but

1904
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
we have detected promising planets but
 

1905
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,190
we have detected promising planets but
they're promising in that

1906
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,200
they're promising in that
 

1907
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,430
they're promising in that
they're about the right size about the

1908
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
they're about the right size about the
 

1909
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,549
they're about the right size about the
right density

1910
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559
right density
 

1911
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,630
right density
they could have an atmosphere and

1912
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
they could have an atmosphere and
 

1913
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,590
they could have an atmosphere and
they're about the right

1914
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
they're about the right
 

1915
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,669
they're about the right
distance from their host star but that's

1916
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
distance from their host star but that's
 

1917
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,950
distance from their host star but that's
really all we know

1918
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
really all we know
 

1919
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,029
really all we know
near future telescopes will tell us much

1920
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
near future telescopes will tell us much
 

1921
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,630
near future telescopes will tell us much
more but

1922
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:18,640
more but
 

1923
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,509
more but
for now we're just guessing so you said

1924
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:21,519
for now we're just guessing so you said
 

1925
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,470
for now we're just guessing so you said
near future so

1926
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
near future so
 

1927
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,830
near future so
there's hope that there will be

1928
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:23,840
there's hope that there will be
 

1929
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,669
there's hope that there will be
telescopes that can see that far

1930
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:25,679
telescopes that can see that far
 

1931
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,669
telescopes that can see that far
enough to to determine if there's an

1932
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:27,679
enough to to determine if there's an
 

1933
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,950
enough to to determine if there's an
atmosphere and

1934
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
atmosphere and
 

1935
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,470
atmosphere and
perhaps even the contents of the

1936
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
perhaps even the contents of the

later this year
will be able to get a very rough sense

1942
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
will be able to get a very rough sense
 

1943
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,950
will be able to get a very rough sense
of the main atmospheric constituents of

00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:40,960
of the main atmospheric constituents of
 

1945

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
the james webb space telescope okay and
 

1955
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,070
the james webb space telescope okay and
that's going to be out in space past the

00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
yes is there something interesting to be
 

1961
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,789
yes is there something interesting to be
said about the engineering aspect of the

telescope
 

1965
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,909
telescope
i mean it's an incredible beast but it's

1966
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
i mean it's an incredible beast but it's
 

1967
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,110
i mean it's an incredible beast but it's
a beast of many

1968
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,120
a beast of many
 

1969
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,950
a beast of many
burdens so it's going to do

1970
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
burdens so it's going to do
 

1971
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,990
burdens so it's going to do
it's good see you are a poet

1972
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
it's good see you are a poet
 

1973
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,710
it's good see you are a poet
yeah i love it this is very eloquent i

1974
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:10,720
yeah i love it this is very eloquent i
 

1975
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,030
yeah i love it this is very eloquent i
love

1976
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
love
 

1977
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,470
love
you're speaking to the audience which i

1978
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
you're speaking to the audience which i
 

1979
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,629
you're speaking to the audience which i
appreciate

1980
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
appreciate
 

1981
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,030
appreciate
uh so so yes it's a giant engineering

1982
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
uh so so yes it's a giant engineering
 

1983
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,750
uh so so yes it's a giant engineering
project

1984
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
project
 

1985
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,990
project
and uh is it orbiting something do you

1986
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
and uh is it orbiting something do you
 

1987
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,589
and uh is it orbiting something do you
know so it's going to be above the

1988
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
know so it's going to be above the
 

1989
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,550
know so it's going to be above the
atmosphere

1990
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,560
atmosphere
 

1991
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,790
atmosphere
um and it will be doing lots of

1992
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
um and it will be doing lots of
 

1993
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,550
um and it will be doing lots of
different astrophysics and so

1994
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
different astrophysics and so
 

1995
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,829
different astrophysics and so
some of its time will be dedicated to

1996
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839
some of its time will be dedicated to
 

1997
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,710
some of its time will be dedicated to
exoplanets but there's an entire

1998
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
exoplanets but there's an entire
 

1999
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,510
exoplanets but there's an entire
astronomy field fighting for time

2000
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
astronomy field fighting for time
 

2001
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,950
astronomy field fighting for time
before the cryogenic lifetime of the

2002
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:38,960
before the cryogenic lifetime of the
 

2003
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,149
before the cryogenic lifetime of the
um instrument and so when i was looking

2004
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:42,159
um instrument and so when i was looking
 

2005
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,710
um instrument and so when i was looking
for

2006
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
for
 

2007
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,790
for
the possibility of finding phosphine on

2008
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,800
the possibility of finding phosphine on
 

2009
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,589
the possibility of finding phosphine on
distant exoplanets i used jwst

2010
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:47,599
distant exoplanets i used jwst
 

2011
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,550
distant exoplanets i used jwst
as a way of checking with this

2012
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:50,560
as a way of checking with this
 

2013
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,069
as a way of checking with this
instrument that we will launch

2014
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,079
instrument that we will launch
 

2015
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,909
instrument that we will launch
later this year could we detect

2016
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
later this year could we detect
 

2017
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,470
later this year could we detect
phosphine on an oxygen poor planet

2018
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,480
phosphine on an oxygen poor planet
 

2019
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,349
phosphine on an oxygen poor planet
and there i put very much a hard stop

2020
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
and there i put very much a hard stop
 

2021
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,310
and there i put very much a hard stop
where

2022
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,320
where
 

2023
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,910
where
some of my simulations said yes you can

2024
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
some of my simulations said yes you can
 

2025
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,349
some of my simulations said yes you can
totally do it but it will take

2026
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
totally do it but it will take
 

2027
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,069
totally do it but it will take
a little under the cryogenic lifetime of

2028
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:06,079
a little under the cryogenic lifetime of
 

2029
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:06,870
a little under the cryogenic lifetime of
this machine

2030
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
this machine
 

2031
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,030
this machine
so then i had to go well that that's not

2032
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
so then i had to go well that that's not
 

2033
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,870
so then i had to go well that that's not
going to no one's going to dedicate all

2034
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
going to no one's going to dedicate all
 

2035
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,109
going to no one's going to dedicate all
of jwst to look for my

2036
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
of jwst to look for my
 

2037
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,310
of jwst to look for my
molecule that no one cared about so

2038
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:16,320
molecule that no one cared about so
 

2039
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,910
molecule that no one cared about so
we're very much at that edge but

2040
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:17,920
we're very much at that edge but
 

2041
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,270
we're very much at that edge but
there'll be many other telescopes in the

2042
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,280
there'll be many other telescopes in the
 

2043
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,950
there'll be many other telescopes in the
coming decades

2044
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
coming decades
 

2045
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,430
coming decades
that will be able to tell us quite a lot

2046
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:23,440
that will be able to tell us quite a lot
 

2047
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,030
that will be able to tell us quite a lot
about the atmospheres of potentially

2048
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
about the atmospheres of potentially
 

2049
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,550
about the atmospheres of potentially
habitable planets

2050
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
habitable planets
 

2051
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,550
habitable planets
so you mentioned simulation this is

2052
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
so you mentioned simulation this is
 

2053
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,990
so you mentioned simulation this is
super interesting to me and

2054
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
super interesting to me and
 

2055
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,710
super interesting to me and
and this perhaps could be a super dumb

2056
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:32,720
and this perhaps could be a super dumb
 

2057
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,390
and this perhaps could be a super dumb
question but

2058
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,400
question but
 

2059
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,510
question but
no i just think i'm gonna prove you

2060
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,520
no i just think i'm gonna prove you
 

2061
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,710
no i just think i'm gonna prove you
wrong in that one

2062
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:38,720
wrong in that one
 

2063
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,349
wrong in that one
you simulate molecules to understand how

2064
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
you simulate molecules to understand how
 

2065
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,630
you simulate molecules to understand how
they look from a distance

2066
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
they look from a distance
 

2067
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,150
they look from a distance
is what i understand like what does that

2068
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
is what i understand like what does that
 

2069
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,670
is what i understand like what does that
simulation

2070
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
simulation
 

2071
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,030
simulation
look like so it's uh it's talking about

2072
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
look like so it's uh it's talking about
 

2073
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,349
look like so it's uh it's talking about
the the which colors of the rainbow will

2074
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
the the which colors of the rainbow will
 

2075
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,790
the the which colors of the rainbow will
be missing is that

2076
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:52,800
be missing is that
 

2077
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,790
be missing is that
the goal of the simulation that's the

2078
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:54,800
the goal of the simulation that's the
 

2079
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,790
the goal of the simulation that's the
goal but it's really just a very

2080
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:56,800
goal but it's really just a very
 

2081
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,589
goal but it's really just a very
very nasty schrodinger's equation so

2082
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
very nasty schrodinger's equation so
 

2083
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,710
very nasty schrodinger's equation so
it's a quantum

2084
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
it's a quantum
 

2085
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,950
it's a quantum
simulation it's simulating at the

2086
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:02,960
simulation it's simulating at the
 

2087
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,790
simulation it's simulating at the
quantum level yes so i'm a quantum

2088
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
quantum level yes so i'm a quantum
 

2089
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,310
quantum level yes so i'm a quantum
astrochemist

2090
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
astrochemist
 

2091
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,550
astrochemist
hi i'm clara i'm a quantum astrochemist

2092
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:08,560
hi i'm clara i'm a quantum astrochemist
 

2093
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,510
hi i'm clara i'm a quantum astrochemist
how we should have started this

2094
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:09,520
how we should have started this
 

2095
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,710
how we should have started this
conversation

2096
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,720
conversation
 

2097
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,109
conversation
can you describe the three components of

2098
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
can you describe the three components of
 

2099
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,150
can you describe the three components of
that

2100
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,160
that
 

2101
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,950
that
quantum astro and chemist and how they

2102
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:16,960
quantum astro and chemist and how they
 

2103
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,710
quantum astro and chemist and how they
interplay together

2104
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
interplay together
 

2105
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,750
interplay together
so i study the quantum behavior of

2106
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
so i study the quantum behavior of
 

2107
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,630
so i study the quantum behavior of
molecules

2108
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:22,640
molecules
 

2109
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,510
molecules
hence the quantum and the chemist

2110
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,520
hence the quantum and the chemist
 

2111
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,270
hence the quantum and the chemist
specifically so i can detect them

2112
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:27,280
specifically so i can detect them
 

2113
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,950
specifically so i can detect them
in space and see astro

2114
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:30,960
in space and see astro
 

2115
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,069
in space and see astro
so what i what i do is i figure out the

2116
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
so what i what i do is i figure out the
 

2117
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,790
so what i what i do is i figure out the
probability of a molecule being in a

2118
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
probability of a molecule being in a
 

2119
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,390
probability of a molecule being in a
particular state

2120
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
particular state
 

2121
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,710
particular state
there's no deterministic nature to the

2122
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:40,720
there's no deterministic nature to the
 

2123
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,230
there's no deterministic nature to the
work i do it so it's

2124
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,240
work i do it so it's
 

2125
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,670
work i do it so it's
every transition is just a likelihood

2126
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
every transition is just a likelihood
 

2127
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,510
every transition is just a likelihood
but if you get a population of that

2128
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,520
but if you get a population of that
 

2129
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,390
but if you get a population of that
molecule it will always happen

2130
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,400
molecule it will always happen
 

2131
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,230
molecule it will always happen
and so this is all at the quantum level

2132
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,240
and so this is all at the quantum level
 

2133
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,310
and so this is all at the quantum level
it's a stronger equation on

2134
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:54,320
it's a stronger equation on
 

2135
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,310
it's a stronger equation on
i think 27 dimensions i don't remember

2136
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,320
i think 27 dimensions i don't remember
 

2137
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,670
i think 27 dimensions i don't remember
it by hard

2138
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
it by hard
 

2139
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,910
it by hard
and what this means is i'm solving these

2140
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,920
and what this means is i'm solving these
 

2141
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,190
and what this means is i'm solving these
giant

2143
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,390
giant
quantum matrices and that's why you need

2144
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,400
quantum matrices and that's why you need
 

2145
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,910
quantum matrices and that's why you need
a lot of computer power

2146
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:05,920
a lot of computer power
 

2147
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,109
a lot of computer power
giant computers to diagonalize these

2148
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:09,119
giant computers to diagonalize these
 

2149
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,710
giant computers to diagonalize these
enormous matrices

2150
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
enormous matrices
 

2151
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,990
enormous matrices
each of whom describes a single

2152
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,000
each of whom describes a single
 

2153
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,270
each of whom describes a single
vibrational behavior of a molecule

2154
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
vibrational behavior of a molecule
 

2155
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,310
vibrational behavior of a molecule
so i think phosphine has 17.5 million

2156
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,320
so i think phosphine has 17.5 million
 

2157
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,829
so i think phosphine has 17.5 million
possible states it can exist in

2158
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
possible states it can exist in
 

2159
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,150
possible states it can exist in
and transitions can occur between pairs

2160
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,160
and transitions can occur between pairs
 

2161
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,829
and transitions can occur between pairs
of these states

2162
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:29,839
of these states
 

2163
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,270
of these states
and there's a certain likelihood that

2164
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280
and there's a certain likelihood that
 

2165
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,790
and there's a certain likelihood that
they'll happen this is the quantum world

2166
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:32,800
they'll happen this is the quantum world
 

2167
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,589
they'll happen this is the quantum world
nothing is

2168
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:33,599
nothing is
 

2169
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,670
nothing is
deterministic there's just a likelihood

2170
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680
deterministic there's just a likelihood
 

2171
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,109
deterministic there's just a likelihood
that it will jump from one state to

2172
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:37,119
that it will jump from one state to
 

2173
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,310
that it will jump from one state to
another

2174
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:38,320
another
 

2175
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,430
another
and these jumps they're transitions and

2176
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,440
and these jumps they're transitions and
 

2177
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,990
and these jumps they're transitions and
there's 16.8 billion of them

2178
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,000
there's 16.8 billion of them
 

2179
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,310
there's 16.8 billion of them
when energy is absorbed that corresponds

2180
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,320
when energy is absorbed that corresponds
 

2181
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,349
when energy is absorbed that corresponds
to this transition

2182
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
to this transition
 

2183
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,190
to this transition
we see it in the spectrum this is more

2184
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
we see it in the spectrum this is more
 

2185
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,630
we see it in the spectrum this is more
quantum chemistry than you had asked for

2186
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
quantum chemistry than you had asked for
 

2187
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,430
quantum chemistry than you had asked for
i'm sorry no

2188
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:51,440
i'm sorry no
 

2189
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,710
i'm sorry no
no i'm sorry brain is broken so when the

2190
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:54,720
no i'm sorry brain is broken so when the
 

2191
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,390
no i'm sorry brain is broken so when the
when the transitions happen between the

2192
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
when the transitions happen between the
 

2193
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,150
when the transitions happen between the
different states

2194
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,160
different states
 

2195
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,870
different states
uh somehow the energy maps the spectrum

2196
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
uh somehow the energy maps the spectrum
 

2197
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,510
uh somehow the energy maps the spectrum
exactly

2198
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,520
exactly
 

2199
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,310
exactly
energy corresponds to a frequency and a

2200
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
energy corresponds to a frequency and a
 

2201
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,990
energy corresponds to a frequency and a
frequency corresponds to a wavelength

2202
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
frequency corresponds to a wavelength
 

2203
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,990
frequency corresponds to a wavelength
which corresponds to a color

2204
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
which corresponds to a color
 

2205
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,710
which corresponds to a color
so there's some probability assigned to

2206
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:10,720
so there's some probability assigned to
 

2207
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,829
so there's some probability assigned to
each color then

2208
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:11,839
each color then
 

2209
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,589
each color then
exactly and that probability determines

2210
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599
exactly and that probability determines
 

2211
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,430
exactly and that probability determines
how intense that transition will be

2212
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:15,440
how intense that transition will be
 

2213
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,310
how intense that transition will be
how strong and so you run this kind of

2214
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,320
how strong and so you run this kind of
 

2215
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,870
how strong and so you run this kind of
simulation for a particular

2216
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
simulation for a particular
 

2217
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,109
simulation for a particular
so that's 17.5 squared or something like

2218
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:23,119
so that's 17.5 squared or something like
 

2219
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,109
so that's 17.5 squared or something like
that exactly

2220
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:24,119
that exactly
 

2221
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,910
that exactly
17.5 million energies each one of whom

2222
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:27,920
17.5 million energies each one of whom
 

2223
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,390
17.5 million energies each one of whom
involves diagonalizing a giant matrix

2224
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,400
involves diagonalizing a giant matrix
 

2225
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,550
involves diagonalizing a giant matrix
with a supercomputer which i wonder what

2226
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,560
with a supercomputer which i wonder what
 

2227
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,470
with a supercomputer which i wonder what
the most efficient algorithm for the

2228
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,480
the most efficient algorithm for the
 

2229
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,470
the most efficient algorithm for the
diagonalization is but there there's

2230
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
diagonalization is but there there's
 

2231
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,470
diagonalization is but there there's
something there's many

2232
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:38,480
something there's many
 

2233
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,190
something there's many
depends on kind of the shape of the

2234
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
depends on kind of the shape of the
 

2235
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,390
depends on kind of the shape of the
matrix so they're not

2236
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
matrix so they're not
 

2237
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,069
matrix so they're not
random matrixes so some are more

2238
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,079
random matrixes so some are more
 

2239
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,750
random matrixes so some are more
diagonal than others and

2240
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:45,760
diagonal than others and
 

2241
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,230
diagonal than others and
so some need more treatment than others

2242
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,240
so some need more treatment than others
 

2243
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,150
so some need more treatment than others
most of the work ends up going in

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,160
most of the work ends up going in
 

2245
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,069
most of the work ends up going in

a matrix that is
 

2251
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,109
a matrix that is
close to being diagonal and then it's

2252
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
close to being diagonal and then it's
 

2253
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,470
close to being diagonal and then it's
much easier to

much easier to
 

2255
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,630

but you uh you write that there are
 

2287
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,430
but you uh you write that there are
about 16 000 molecules we care about

2288
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
about 16 000 molecules we care about
 

2289
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,910
about 16 000 molecules we care about
when looking for a new earth or when we

2290
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
when looking for a new earth or when we
 

2291
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,870
when looking for a new earth or when we
try to detect alien biosignatures

2292
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:42,880
try to detect alien biosignatures
 

2293
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,870
try to detect alien biosignatures
if we want to detect any molecules from

2294
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:44,880
if we want to detect any molecules from
 

2295
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,589
if we want to detect any molecules from
here we need to know their spectra

2296
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
here we need to know their spectra
 

2297
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,750
here we need to know their spectra
and we currently don't solving this

2298
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
and we currently don't solving this
 

2299
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,910
and we currently don't solving this
particular problem

2300
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
particular problem
 

2301
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,470
particular problem
that's my job what was that that i mean

2302
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:54,480
that's my job what was that that i mean
 

2303
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,589
that's my job what was that that i mean
that's absolutely correct

2304
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:55,599
that's absolutely correct
 

2305
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,349
that's absolutely correct
yeah i could have could have not said it

2306
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:57,359
yeah i could have could have not said it
 

2307
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,790
yeah i could have could have not said it
better myself did you take that from my

2308
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800
better myself did you take that from my
 

2309
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,829
better myself did you take that from my
website yeah i think i

2310
00:39:59,829 --> 00:39:59,839
website yeah i think i
 

2311
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,150
website yeah i think i
stole it and your website is excellent

2312
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,160
stole it and your website is excellent
 

2313
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,870
stole it and your website is excellent
so it's

2314
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:02,880
so it's
 

2315
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,349
so it's
worthy place to steal stuff from how do

2316
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,359
worthy place to steal stuff from how do
 

2317
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,870
worthy place to steal stuff from how do
you solve this problem

2318
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:06,880
you solve this problem
 

2319
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,750
you solve this problem
uh of for the 16 000 molecules we care

2320
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:09,760
uh of for the 16 000 molecules we care
 

2321
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,109
uh of for the 16 000 molecules we care
about

2322
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:11,119
about
 

2323
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,870
about
of which phosphine is one yes and so

2324
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:14,880
of which phosphine is one yes and so
 

2325
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,069
of which phosphine is one yes and so
um so taking a step a little bit out of

2326
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,079
um so taking a step a little bit out of
 

2327
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,230
um so taking a step a little bit out of
fossil

2328
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
fossil
 

2329
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,270
fossil
is there uh but we were having so much

2330
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
is there uh but we were having so much
 

2331
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,030
is there uh but we were having so much
fun it was having so much fun no we're

2332
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
fun it was having so much fun no we're
 

2333
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,309
fun it was having so much fun no we're
not saying no no no

2334
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:26,319
not saying no no no
 

2335
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,910
not saying no no no
it's sticking around i'm just saying

2336
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:27,920
it's sticking around i'm just saying
 

2337
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,589
it's sticking around i'm just saying
we're joining more friends coming to the

2338
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
we're joining more friends coming to the
 

2339
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,550
we're joining more friends coming to the
party

2340
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
party
 

2341
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,390
party
how do you choose other friends to come

2342
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,400
how do you choose other friends to come
 

2343
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,230
how do you choose other friends to come
to the party that are interesting to

2344
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,240
to the party that are interesting to
 

2345
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,109
to the party that are interesting to
study

2346
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:35,119
study
 

2347
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,829
study
as we solve one puzzle at a time through

2348
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
as we solve one puzzle at a time through
 

2349
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,109
as we solve one puzzle at a time through
the space of 16

2350
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:39,119
the space of 16
 

2351
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,670
the space of 16
000. so we've already started out of

2352
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
000. so we've already started out of
 

2353
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,710
000. so we've already started out of
those 16 000

2354
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:42,720
those 16 000
 

2355
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,550
those 16 000
we understand water quite well methane

2356
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:44,560
we understand water quite well methane
 

2357
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,550
we understand water quite well methane
quite well ammonia quite well

2358
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:46,560
quite well ammonia quite well
 

2359
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,510
quite well ammonia quite well
carbon dioxide i could keep going and

2360
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520
carbon dioxide i could keep going and
 

2361
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,190
carbon dioxide i could keep going and
then we understand molecules like

2362
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,200
then we understand molecules like
 

2363
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,150
then we understand molecules like
acetylene

2364
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,160
acetylene
 

2365
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,670
acetylene
hydrogen cyanide more or less

2366
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
hydrogen cyanide more or less
 

2367
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,670
hydrogen cyanide more or less
and that takes us to about four percent

2368
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
and that takes us to about four percent
 

2369
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,030
and that takes us to about four percent
of those sixteen thousand

2370
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
of those sixteen thousand
 

2371
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,109
of those sixteen thousand
we understand about four percent of them

2372
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
we understand about four percent of them
 

2373
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,990
we understand about four percent of them
more or less phosphine is one of them

2374
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,000
more or less phosphine is one of them
 

2375
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,109
more or less phosphine is one of them
but the other 96 we just really have

2376
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:07,119
but the other 96 we just really have
 

2377
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,829
but the other 96 we just really have
barely any idea at all of where

2378
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:09,839
barely any idea at all of where
 

2379
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,910
barely any idea at all of where
in the spectrum of light they would

2380
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
in the spectrum of light they would
 

2381
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,630
in the spectrum of light they would
leave a a mark

2382
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
leave a a mark
 

2383
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,109
leave a a mark
i can't spend the next 62 000 years

2384
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
i can't spend the next 62 000 years
 

2385
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,230
i can't spend the next 62 000 years
doing this work

2386
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
doing this work
 

2387
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,030
doing this work
um and i don't want to even if you know

2388
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
um and i don't want to even if you know
 

2389
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,510
um and i don't want to even if you know
somehow

2390
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520
somehow
 

2391
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,630
somehow
i was able that that's not that that

2392
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
i was able that that's not that that
 

2393
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,230
i was able that that's not that that
wouldn't feel good

2394
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,240
wouldn't feel good
 

2395
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,470
wouldn't feel good
so one of the things that i try to do

2396
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:28,480
so one of the things that i try to do
 

2397
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,349
so one of the things that i try to do
now

2398
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
now
 

2399
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,550
now
is move away from how i did phosphene so

2400
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
is move away from how i did phosphene so
 

2401
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,750
is move away from how i did phosphene so
i did phosphine

2402
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:33,760
i did phosphine
 

2403
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,150
i did phosphine
really the best that i could the best

2404
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
really the best that i could the best
 

2405
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,430
really the best that i could the best
that could be done with the computer

2406
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
that could be done with the computer
 

2407
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,470
that could be done with the computer
power that we have

2408
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:38,480
power that we have
 

2409
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,109
power that we have
you know trying to get each one of those

2410
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:40,119
you know trying to get each one of those
 

2411
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:42,390
you know trying to get each one of those
16.8 billion transitions

2412
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
16.8 billion transitions
 

2413
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,309
16.8 billion transitions
mapped accurately calculated

2414
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319
mapped accurately calculated
 

2415
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,270
mapped accurately calculated
and then i thought what if i do a worse

2416
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
and then i thought what if i do a worse
 

2417
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,750
and then i thought what if i do a worse
job

2418
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:49,760
job
 

2419
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,870
job
what if i just do a much worse job um

2420
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:52,880
what if i just do a much worse job um
 

2421
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,670
what if i just do a much worse job um
can i just make it much faster and then

2422
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
can i just make it much faster and then
 

2423
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,030
can i just make it much faster and then
it's still worth it

2424
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,040
it's still worth it
 

2425
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,829
it's still worth it
like how bad can i get before it's

2426
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:00,839
like how bad can i get before it's
 

2427
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,630
like how bad can i get before it's
worthless and then

2428
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,640
worthless and then
 

2429
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,069
worthless and then
could i do this for all the other

2430
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,079
could i do this for all the other
 

2431
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,870
could i do this for all the other
molecules so i created exactly this

2432
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:06,880
molecules so i created exactly this
 

2433
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,589
molecules so i created exactly this
terrible

2434
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:07,599
terrible
 

2435
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,550
terrible
terrible it's a system how about it so

2436
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:10,560
terrible it's a system how about it so
 

2437
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,030
terrible it's a system how about it so
how

2438
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,040
how
 

2439
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,550
how
what's the answer to that question that

2440
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
what's the answer to that question that
 

2441
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,230
what's the answer to that question that
fundamental question asks myself all the

2442
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,240
fundamental question asks myself all the
 

2443
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,550
fundamental question asks myself all the
time

2444
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:14,560
time
 

2445
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,309
time
in other domains how crappy can i be

2446
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
in other domains how crappy can i be
 

2447
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,750
in other domains how crappy can i be

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,910
should look like
and it kind of works so this creates a

2614
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,920
and it kind of works so this creates a
 

2615
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,030
and it kind of works so this creates a
whole uh

2616
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,040
whole uh
 

2617
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,470
whole uh
portfolio of just kind of uh signatures

2618
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
portfolio of just kind of uh signatures
 

2619
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,990
portfolio of just kind of uh signatures
that we can look for

2620
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,000
that we can look for
 

2621
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,910
that we can look for
very rough pictures but still useful

2622
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
very rough pictures but still useful
 

2623
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,870
very rough pictures but still useful
enough to analyze the atmospheres

2624
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:08,880
enough to analyze the atmospheres
 

2625
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,630
enough to analyze the atmospheres
the the telescope generated images of

2626
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:12,640
the the telescope generated images of
 

2627
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,309
the the telescope generated images of
other planets close right now

2628

it is so complete so it has all of these

2630
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
it is so complete so it has all of these
 

2631
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,710
it is so complete so it has all of these
molecules

2632
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:20,720
molecules
 

2633
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,950
molecules
that it can tell you say you look at an

2634
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:22,960
that it can tell you say you look at an
 

2635
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,349
that it can tell you say you look at an
alien atmosphere and there's a feature

2636
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:25,359
alien atmosphere and there's a feature
 

2637
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,150
alien atmosphere and there's a feature
there it can tell you oh that feature

2638
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,160
there it can tell you oh that feature
 

2639
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,349
there it can tell you oh that feature
that's familiar it could be one of these

2640
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:30,359
that's familiar it could be one of these
 

2641
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:33,990
that's familiar it could be one of these
816 molecules best of luck yes

2642
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
816 molecules best of luck yes
 

2643
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,589
816 molecules best of luck yes
so i think the next step which is what

2644
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:35,599
so i think the next step which is what
 

2645
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,910
so i think the next step which is what
i'm working on is telling you something

2646
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
i'm working on is telling you something
 

2647
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,589
i'm working on is telling you something
more useful than it could be one of

2648
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
more useful than it could be one of
 

2649
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,670
more useful than it could be one of
those 816 molecules that's still

2650
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680
those 816 molecules that's still
 

2651
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,990
those 816 molecules that's still
true i wouldn't say it's useful so i can

2652
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,000
true i wouldn't say it's useful so i can
 

2653
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,870
true i wouldn't say it's useful so i can
tell you

2654
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880
tell you
 

2655
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,510
tell you
but only 12 percent of them also have a

2656
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:47,520
but only 12 percent of them also have a
 

2657
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,430
but only 12 percent of them also have a
feature in this region so go look there

2658
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
feature in this region so go look there
 

2659
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,270
feature in this region so go look there
and if there's nothing there it can't be

2660
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280
and if there's nothing there it can't be
 

2661
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,190
and if there's nothing there it can't be
those and so on

2662
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
those and so on
 

2663
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,349
those and so on
it can also tell you things like you

2664
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
it can also tell you things like you
 

2665
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,109
it can also tell you things like you
will need this much accuracy to

2666
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:57,119
will need this much accuracy to
 

2667
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,069
will need this much accuracy to
distinguish between those 816

2668
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:00,079
distinguish between those 816
 

2669
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,270
distinguish between those 816
so that's what i'm working on but it's a

2670
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:03,280
so that's what i'm working on but it's a
 

2671
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,309
so that's what i'm working on but it's a
lot of work

2672
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319
lot of work
 

2673
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,030
lot of work
so this is really interesting the like

2674
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,040
so this is really interesting the like
 

2675
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,550
so this is really interesting the like
the role of computing in this whole

2676
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
the role of computing in this whole
 

2677
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,069
the role of computing in this whole
picture you mentioned code

2678
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:10,079
picture you mentioned code
 

2679
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,349
picture you mentioned code
so like you as a quantum

2680
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:13,359
so like you as a quantum
 

2681
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,390
so like you as a quantum
astro chemist there is some role

2682
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
astro chemist there is some role
 

2683
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,870
astro chemist there is some role
of for programming in your life in your

2684
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:18,880
of for programming in your life in your
 

2685
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,470
of for programming in your life in your
past life in your current life

2686
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:20,480
past life in your current life
 

2687
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,150
past life in your current life
oh yeah almost entirely i'm a

2688
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,160
oh yeah almost entirely i'm a
 

2689
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,910
oh yeah almost entirely i'm a
computational quantum astrochemist

2690
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:23,920
computational quantum astrochemist
 

2691
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,270
computational quantum astrochemist
but that doesn't roll off the tongue

2692
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
but that doesn't roll off the tongue
 

2693
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,190
but that doesn't roll off the tongue
very easily so this is fundamentally

2694
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
very easily so this is fundamentally
 

2695
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,309
very easily so this is fundamentally
computational

2696
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
computational
 

2697
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,750
computational
like if you want to be successful in the

2698
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
like if you want to be successful in the
 

2699
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,829
like if you want to be successful in the
21st century and doing quantum master

2700
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:31,839
21st century and doing quantum master
 

2701
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,670
21st century and doing quantum master
chemistry you want to be computational

2702
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:33,680
chemistry you want to be computational
 

2703
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,950
chemistry you want to be computational
absolutely all quantum chemistry is

2704
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
absolutely all quantum chemistry is
 

2705
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,829
absolutely all quantum chemistry is
computational at this point okay

2706
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:37,839
computational at this point okay
 

2707
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,390
computational at this point okay
does machine learning play a role at all

2708
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,400
does machine learning play a role at all
 

2709
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,430
does machine learning play a role at all
is there some

2710
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,440
is there some
 

2711
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,589
is there some
extra shortcuts that could be discovered

2712
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
extra shortcuts that could be discovered
 

2713
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,950
extra shortcuts that could be discovered
through uh

2714
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:44,960
through uh
 

2715
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,790
through uh
like you see all that success with

2716
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,800
like you see all that success with
 

2717
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,230
like you see all that success with
protein folding right

2718

a problem that thought to be extremely

2720
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:51,440
a problem that thought to be extremely
 

2721
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,510
a problem that thought to be extremely
difficult to apply machine learning to

2722
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,520
difficult to apply machine learning to
 

2723
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,550
difficult to apply machine learning to
because

2724
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:54,560
because
 

2725
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,710
because
it's um

00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:58,720

 

2727
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,270

i mean mostly because there's not a lot

2728
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
i mean mostly because there's not a lot
 

2729
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,550
i mean mostly because there's not a lot

absolutely currently you've laid out
 

2743
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,349
absolutely currently you've laid out
exactly the problem the

exactly the problem the
 

2745
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,790
exactly the problem the
training set is awful and because

2746
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
training set is awful and because
 

2747
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,390
training set is awful and because
there's so

2748
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
there's so
 

2749
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,990
there's so
a lot of this data that i'm basing it on

2750
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,000
a lot of this data that i'm basing it on
 

2751
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,309
a lot of this data that i'm basing it on
is literally many decades old the people

2752
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:24,319
is literally many decades old the people
 

2753
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,390
is literally many decades old the people
who worked on it and data that i get

2754
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
who worked on it and data that i get
 

2755
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,510
who worked on it and data that i get
often they're dead and the files that

2756
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,520
often they're dead and the files that
 

2757
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,630
often they're dead and the files that
i've used they

2758
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:30,640
i've used they
 

2759
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,870
i've used they
some of them were hand drawn by someone

2760
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:32,880
some of them were hand drawn by someone
 

2761
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,390
some of them were hand drawn by someone
tired in the 70s

2762
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
tired in the 70s
 

2763
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,950
tired in the 70s
yes so i could of course have yeah have

2764
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:36,960
yes so i could of course have yeah have
 

2765
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,390
yes so i could of course have yeah have
a program

2766
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400
a program
 

2767
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,910
a program
training on these but i'll just be

2768
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:39,920
training on these but i'll just be
 

2769
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,910
training on these but i'll just be
perpetuating these mistakes without hope

2770
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:41,920
perpetuating these mistakes without hope
 

2771
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,309
perpetuating these mistakes without hope
of actually verifying them so my next

2772
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
of actually verifying them so my next
 

2773
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,750
of actually verifying them so my next
step is to

2774
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:45,760
step is to
 

2775
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,510
step is to
improve this training set um by hand

2776
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,520
improve this training set um by hand
 

2777
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,430
improve this training set um by hand
and then try to see if i can apply

2778
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440
and then try to see if i can apply
 

2779
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,109
and then try to see if i can apply
machine learning on the full code of the

2780
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:53,119
machine learning on the full code of the
 

2781
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,870
machine learning on the full code of the
full 16 000 molecules

2782
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
full 16 000 molecules
 

2783
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,750
full 16 000 molecules
and improve them all but really i need

2784
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:57,760
and improve them all but really i need
 

2785
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,349
and improve them all but really i need
to be able to test the outcomes

2786
00:47:59,349 --> 00:47:59,359
to be able to test the outcomes
 

2787
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,030
to be able to test the outcomes
with experimental data which means

2788
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,040
with experimental data which means
 

2789
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,430
with experimental data which means
convincing someone in a lab to spend a

2790
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:03,440
convincing someone in a lab to spend a
 

2791
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,790
convincing someone in a lab to spend a
lot of money

2792
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
lot of money
 

2793
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,910
lot of money
putting very dangerous gases in chambers

2794
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:07,920
putting very dangerous gases in chambers
 

2795
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,950
putting very dangerous gases in chambers
and measuring them

2796
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:08,960
and measuring them
 

2797
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,990
and measuring them
at outrageous temperatures so it's a

2798
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
at outrageous temperatures so it's a
 

2799
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,270
at outrageous temperatures so it's a
work in progress

2800
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:13,280
work in progress
 

2801
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,030
work in progress
and so collecting huge amounts of data

2802
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,040
and so collecting huge amounts of data
 

2803
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,790
and so collecting huge amounts of data
about the actual gases

2804
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
about the actual gases
 

2805
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,069
about the actual gases
uh so you see you so you

2806
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:20,079
uh so you see you so you
 

2807
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,910
uh so you see you so you
you are up for doing that kind of thing

2808
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:21,920
you are up for doing that kind of thing
 

2809
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,270
you are up for doing that kind of thing
too so

2810
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:23,280
too so
 

2811
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,549
too so
actually like doing the full

2812
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:26,559
actually like doing the full
 

2813
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,870
actually like doing the full
end to end thing which is like having a

2814
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:28,880
end to end thing which is like having a
 

2815
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,430
end to end thing which is like having a
gas collecting data about it

2816
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:31,440
gas collecting data about it
 

2817
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,750
gas collecting data about it
and and then doing the kind of analysis

2818
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:33,760
and and then doing the kind of analysis
 

2819
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,510
and and then doing the kind of analysis
that creates the fingerprint

2820
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:35,520
that creates the fingerprint
 

2821
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,990
that creates the fingerprint
and then also analyzing using that

2822
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,000
and then also analyzing using that
 

2823
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,589
and then also analyzing using that
library the data that comes from other

2824
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
library the data that comes from other
 

2825
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,309
library the data that comes from other
planets

2826
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:40,319
planets
 

2827
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,589
planets
so you do the full fall from birth to

2828
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
so you do the full fall from birth to
 

2829
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,990
so you do the full fall from birth to
death interesting um yes i worked in an

2830
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,000
death interesting um yes i worked in an
 

2831
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,670
death interesting um yes i worked in an
industrial chemistry laboratory when i

2832
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:47,680
industrial chemistry laboratory when i
 

2833
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,150
industrial chemistry laboratory when i
was

2834
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:48,160
was
 

2835
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,030
was
much younger in slovenia and there i

2836
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
much younger in slovenia and there i
 

2837
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,990
much younger in slovenia and there i
worked in the lab

2838
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:52,000
worked in the lab
 

2839
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,150
worked in the lab
actually collecting spectrum and and

2840
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:54,160
actually collecting spectrum and and
 

2841
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,390
actually collecting spectrum and and
predicting spectrum

2842
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
predicting spectrum
 

2843
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,829
predicting spectrum
what's it like to work with a bunch of

2844
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
what's it like to work with a bunch of
 

2845
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,069
what's it like to work with a bunch of
gases that are like not so human

2846
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
gases that are like not so human
 

2847
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:00,630
gases that are like not so human
friendly

2848

friendly
 

2849
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,349
friendly
it's terrifying it's horrific it's so

2850
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:03,359
it's terrifying it's horrific it's so
 

2851
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,710
it's terrifying it's horrific it's so
scary and

2852

scary and
 

2853
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,030
scary and
i love my job i'm willing to clearly

you know job stability money

2858
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:12,400
you know job stability money
 

2859
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,510
you know job stability money
yes sanity but

2860
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:15,520
yes sanity but
 

2861
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,390
yes sanity but
i only worked there for a few months it

2862
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:18,400
i only worked there for a few months it
 

2863
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,230
i only worked there for a few months it
it was really terrifying

2864
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:20,240
it was really terrifying
 

2865
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,710
it was really terrifying
there's just so many ways to die you

2866
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:22,720
there's just so many ways to die you
 

2867
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,230
there's just so many ways to die you
know usually you only have a handful of

2868
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:24,240
know usually you only have a handful of
 

2869
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,510
know usually you only have a handful of
ways to die every day

2870
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,520
ways to die every day
 

2871
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,349
ways to die every day
you know but if you work in a lab

2872
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
you know but if you work in a lab
 

2873
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,790
you know but if you work in a lab
there's so many more

2874
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:28,800
there's so many more
 

2875
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,589
there's so many more
orders of magnitude more and i i was

2876
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:31,599
orders of magnitude more and i i was
 

2877
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,390
orders of magnitude more and i i was
very bad

2878
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
very bad
 

2879
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,750
very bad
at it i'm not a good hands-on scientist

2880
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:35,760
at it i'm not a good hands-on scientist
 

2881
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,950
at it i'm not a good hands-on scientist
i want a laptop connected to a remote

i don't
 

2889
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,710
i don't
i don't need to be there to believe it

2890
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:46,720
i don't need to be there to believe it
 

2891
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,589
i don't need to be there to believe it
and i am not good in the lab

2892
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:49,599
and i am not good in the lab
 

2893
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,109
and i am not good in the lab
yeah when there's a bunch of things that

2894
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
yeah when there's a bunch of things that
 

2895
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,470
yeah when there's a bunch of things that
can poison you a bunch of things that

2896
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
can poison you a bunch of things that
 

2897
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,150
can poison you a bunch of things that
could explode and they're gaseous and

2898
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:54,160
could explode and they're gaseous and
 

2899
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,190
could explode and they're gaseous and
they're often

2900
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,200
they're often
 

2901
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,190
they're often
maybe they might not even have a smell

2902
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,200
maybe they might not even have a smell
 

2903
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,589
maybe they might not even have a smell
or they might not be visible

2904
00:49:59,589 --> 00:49:59,599
or they might not be visible
 

2905
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,349
or they might not be visible
it's like so many of them give you

2906
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:01,359
it's like so many of them give you
 

2907
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,510
it's like so many of them give you
cancer it's just so cruel

2908
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,520
cancer it's just so cruel
 

2909
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,870
cancer it's just so cruel
and some people love this work but i've

2910
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:06,880
and some people love this work but i've
 

2911
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,870
and some people love this work but i've
i've never enjoyed experimental work

2912
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
i've never enjoyed experimental work
 

2913
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,790
i've never enjoyed experimental work
it's so ungrateful

2914
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800
it's so ungrateful
 

2915
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,549
it's so ungrateful
it's so lonely well most i mean so much

2916
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
it's so lonely well most i mean so much
 

2917
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:15,910
it's so lonely well most i mean so much
work is lonely

2918
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:15,920
work is lonely
 

2919
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,990
work is lonely
if you find the joy in it but you you

2920
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:18,000
if you find the joy in it but you you
 

2921
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,829
if you find the joy in it but you you
enjoy the results of it

2922
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:19,839
enjoy the results of it
 

2923
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,910
enjoy the results of it
yes i'm very thankful for all the

2924
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:21,920
yes i'm very thankful for all the
 

2925
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,150
yes i'm very thankful for all the
experimentalists in my life

2926
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,160
experimentalists in my life
 

2927
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,390
experimentalists in my life
but i i'll do the theory they do the

2928
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
but i i'll do the theory they do the
 

2929
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,670
but i i'll do the theory they do the
experiment and then we talk to one

2930
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,680
experiment and then we talk to one
 

2931
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,990
experiment and then we talk to one
another and make sure it matches

2932
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,000
another and make sure it matches
 

2933
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,589
another and make sure it matches
uh okay beautiful what are uh

2934
00:50:32,589 --> 00:50:32,599
uh okay beautiful what are uh
 

2935
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,549
uh okay beautiful what are uh
spectroscopic networks those

2936
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:34,559
spectroscopic networks those
 

2937
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,309
spectroscopic networks those
look super cool are they related to what

2938
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:36,319
look super cool are they related to what
 

2939
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,069
look super cool are they related to what
we were talking about the picture look

2940
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:38,079
we were talking about the picture look
 

2941
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:38,790
we were talking about the picture look
pretty

2942
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,800
pretty
 

2943
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,349
pretty
oh and yes slightly so remember when i

2944
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:41,359
oh and yes slightly so remember when i
 

2945
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,309
oh and yes slightly so remember when i
mentioned the 17.5 million energy levels

2946
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:44,319
mentioned the 17.5 million energy levels
 

2947
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,750
mentioned the 17.5 million energy levels
yes there are rules for each molecule on

2948
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:47,760
yes there are rules for each molecule on
 

2949
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,309
yes there are rules for each molecule on
which

2950
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:48,319
which
 

2951
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,430
which
energy levels they can jump from and to

2952
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:51,440
energy levels they can jump from and to
 

2953
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,670
energy levels they can jump from and to
and how likely it is to make that jump

2954
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
and how likely it is to make that jump
 

2955
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,109
and how likely it is to make that jump
and so if you

2956
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
and so if you
 

2957
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,829
and so if you
plot all the roots it can take you get

2958
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
plot all the roots it can take you get
 

2959
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:58,470
plot all the roots it can take you get
this

2960
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:58,480
this
 

2961
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,230
this
energy network for which is like a ball

2962
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:02,240
energy network for which is like a ball
 

2963
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,230
energy network for which is like a ball
so these are the constraints of the the

2964
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
so these are the constraints of the the
 

2965
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,829
so these are the constraints of the the
transitions that could be taken

2966
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
transitions that could be taken
 

2967
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,470
transitions that could be taken
exactly for each molecule interesting

2968
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:08,480
exactly for each molecule interesting
 

2969
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,390
exactly for each molecule interesting
and no they're not so it's not a fully

2970
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:10,400
and no they're not so it's not a fully
 

2971
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,270
and no they're not so it's not a fully
connected

2972
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:11,280
connected
 

2973
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,390
connected
it's like it's it's sparse somehow yes

2974
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
it's like it's it's sparse somehow yes
 

2975
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,710
it's like it's it's sparse somehow yes
you get island sometimes you get

2976
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:16,720
you get island sometimes you get
 

2977
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,270
you get island sometimes you get
a molecule can only jump from one set of

2978
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
a molecule can only jump from one set of
 

2979
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,190
a molecule can only jump from one set of
states to another and it's trapped now

2980
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:21,200
states to another and it's trapped now
 

2981
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:21,990
states to another and it's trapped now
in this network

2982
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:22,000
in this network
 

2983
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,390
in this network
it can never go to another network that

2984
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:24,400
it can never go to another network that
 

2985
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,990
it can never go to another network that
could have been available to

2986
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,000
could have been available to
 

2987
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,390
could have been available to
other siblings is there some insights to

2988
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:28,400
other siblings is there some insights to
 

2989
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,910
other siblings is there some insights to
be drawn from these networks

2990
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:29,920
be drawn from these networks
 

2991
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,270
be drawn from these networks
like something cool that you can

2992
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,280
like something cool that you can
 

2993
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,790
like something cool that you can
understand about a particular molecule

2994
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:32,800
understand about a particular molecule
 

2995
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,829
understand about a particular molecule
because of it

2996
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
because of it
 

2997
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,069
because of it
yes some molecules have what we call

2998
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079
yes some molecules have what we call
 

2999
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,589
yes some molecules have what we call
forbidden transitions

3000
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:37,599
forbidden transitions
 

3001
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,870
forbidden transitions
and which aren't really forbidden

3002
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:38,880
and which aren't really forbidden
 

3003
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,470
and which aren't really forbidden
because it's quantum there are no rules

3004
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:40,480
because it's quantum there are no rules
 

3005
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,270
because it's quantum there are no rules
no

3006
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:41,280
no
 

3007
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,750
no
there are rules it's just the rules are

3008
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:43,760
there are rules it's just the rules are
 

3009
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,750
there are rules it's just the rules are
very often broken in the quantum world

3010
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:45,760
very often broken in the quantum world
 

3011
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,589
very often broken in the quantum world
and so forbidden transitions doesn't

3012
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:47,599
and so forbidden transitions doesn't
 

3013
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,030
and so forbidden transitions doesn't
actually mean they're forbidden

3014
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:49,040
actually mean they're forbidden
 

3015
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,430
actually mean they're forbidden
low probability exactly they just become

3016
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
low probability exactly they just become
 

3017
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,549
low probability exactly they just become
deeply unlikely

3018
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:52,559
deeply unlikely
 

3019
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,630
deeply unlikely
yeah cool and so you could do all the

3020
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
yeah cool and so you could do all the
 

3021
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,069
yeah cool and so you could do all the
same like i'm

3022
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:56,079
same like i'm
 

3023
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,670
same like i'm
coming from a computer science world you

3024
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
coming from a computer science world you
 

3025
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,750
coming from a computer science world you
know i love graph theory

3026
00:51:59,750 --> 00:51:59,760
know i love graph theory
 

3027
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,069
know i love graph theory
so you can do all the same like craft

3028
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
so you can do all the same like craft
 

3029
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,390
so you can do all the same like craft
theoretic kind of analysis of like

3030
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:04,400
theoretic kind of analysis of like
 

3031
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,750
theoretic kind of analysis of like
clusters or something like that

3032
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:05,760
clusters or something like that
 

3033
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,069
clusters or something like that
or all those kinds of things and draw

3034
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:08,079
or all those kinds of things and draw
 

3035
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,270
or all those kinds of things and draw
insights from me

3036
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:09,280
insights from me
 

3037
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,950
insights from me
they're unique for each molecule so

3038
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:10,960
they're unique for each molecule so
 

3039
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,910
they're unique for each molecule so
these the networks that you mentioned

3040
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
these the networks that you mentioned
 

3041
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,150
these the networks that you mentioned
that's actually not too difficult a

3042
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,160
that's actually not too difficult a
 

3043
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,549
that's actually not too difficult a
layer of quantum physics by then all the

3044
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:18,559
layer of quantum physics by then all the
 

3045
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,030
layer of quantum physics by then all the
energies are mapped so we've had high

3046
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:21,040
energies are mapped so we've had high
 

3047
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,109
energies are mapped so we've had high
school children work on those networks

3048
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:23,119
school children work on those networks
 

3049
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,470
school children work on those networks
and the trick is to not tell them

3050
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:24,480
and the trick is to not tell them
 

3051
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,910
and the trick is to not tell them
they're doing quantum physics until like

3052
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:25,920
they're doing quantum physics until like
 

3053
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,430
they're doing quantum physics until like
three months in when it's too late for

3054
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:27,440
three months in when it's too late for
 

3055
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,950
three months in when it's too late for
them to back out

3056
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:28,960
them to back out
 

3057
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,990
them to back out
and then you're like you're a quantum

3058
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
and then you're like you're a quantum
 

3059
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,150
and then you're like you're a quantum
physicist now and it's really nice

3060
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,160
physicist now and it's really nice
 

3061
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,710
physicist now and it's really nice
yeah okay but like the promise of this

3062
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:34,720
yeah okay but like the promise of this
 

3063
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,190
yeah okay but like the promise of this
even though

3064
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
even though
 

3065
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,430
even though
16 000 even just a subset of them that's

3066
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
16 000 even just a subset of them that's
 

3067
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,349
16 000 even just a subset of them that's
really exciting because then you can do

3068
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
really exciting because then you can do
 

3069
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,349
really exciting because then you can do
as the telescope data get better and

3070
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:41,359
as the telescope data get better and
 

3071
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,430
as the telescope data get better and
better especially for exoplanets

3072
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:43,440
better especially for exoplanets
 

3073
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,870
better especially for exoplanets
but also for venus you can then

3074
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:46,880
but also for venus you can then
 

3075
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,430
but also for venus you can then
start like getting your full like you

3076
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,440
start like getting your full like you
 

3077
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,950
start like getting your full like you
know how you get like blood work done or

3078
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:50,960
know how you get like blood work done or
 

3079
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,790
know how you get like blood work done or
like you get your genetic testing to see

3080
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,800
like you get your genetic testing to see
 

3081
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,549
like you get your genetic testing to see
what your ancestors are

3082
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
what your ancestors are
 

3083
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,030
what your ancestors are
you can get the same kind of like high

3084
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,040
you can get the same kind of like high
 

3085
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,549
you can get the same kind of like high
resolution information about

00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:58,559
resolution information about
 

3087
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,069

00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
interesting things going on on a
 

3089
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,750
interesting things going on on a
particular planet based in the

3090
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
particular planet based in the
 

3091
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,109
particular planet based in the
atmosphere right exactly

3092
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:03,119
atmosphere right exactly
 

3093
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,630
atmosphere right exactly
how cool would that be if we could you

3094
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:04,640
how cool would that be if we could you
 

3095
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,349
how cool would that be if we could you
know scan an alien planet and go

3096
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:07,359
know scan an alien planet and go
 

3097
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,790
know scan an alien planet and go
oh this is what the clouds are made of

3098
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:08,800
oh this is what the clouds are made of
 

3099
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,390
oh this is what the clouds are made of
this is what's in the surface

3100
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,400
this is what's in the surface
 

3101
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,390
this is what's in the surface
these are the molecules that are mixing

3102
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
these are the molecules that are mixing
 

3103
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,790
these are the molecules that are mixing
here are probably oceans because you can

3104
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
here are probably oceans because you can
 

3105
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,549
here are probably oceans because you can
see these types of molecules above it

3106
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:16,559
see these types of molecules above it
 

3107
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,309
see these types of molecules above it
and here are the hadley cells here are

3108
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:20,319
and here are the hadley cells here are
 

3109
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,190
and here are the hadley cells here are
how the biosphere works we could map

3110
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
how the biosphere works we could map
 

3111
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,230
how the biosphere works we could map
this whole thing

3112
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
this whole thing
 

3113
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,829
this whole thing
wouldn't it be cool if the aliens like

3114
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
wouldn't it be cool if the aliens like
 

3115
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,670
wouldn't it be cool if the aliens like
are aware of these techniques and like

3116
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:27,680
are aware of these techniques and like
 

3117
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,710
are aware of these techniques and like
would spoof like

3118
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:28,720
would spoof like
 

3119
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,510
would spoof like
the wrong gases just like pretend that's

3120
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:31,520
the wrong gases just like pretend that's
 

3121
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,470
the wrong gases just like pretend that's
how they can be

3122
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:32,480
how they can be
 

3123
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,790
how they can be
it's like an invisibility cloak they can

3124
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:34,800
it's like an invisibility cloak they can
 

3125
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,349
it's like an invisibility cloak they can
generate gases that would throw you off

3126
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
generate gases that would throw you off
 

3127
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,910
generate gases that would throw you off
or like or do the opposite they pretend

3128
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:39,920
or like or do the opposite they pretend
 

3129
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,549
or like or do the opposite they pretend
they will

3130
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:40,559
they will
 

3131
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,230
they will
artificially generate phosphate and so

3132
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:42,240
artificially generate phosphate and so
 

3133
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,710
artificially generate phosphate and so
they like the dumb

3134
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:44,720
they like the dumb
 

3135
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,870
they like the dumb
the dumb apes on earth again like go out

3136
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:46,880
the dumb apes on earth again like go out
 

3137
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,630
the dumb apes on earth again like go out
like flying in different places

3138
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
like flying in different places
 

3139
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,069
like flying in different places
because it's just fun it's like some

3140
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:50,079
because it's just fun it's like some
 

3141
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,069
because it's just fun it's like some
teenager alien

3142
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079
teenager alien
 

3143
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,790
teenager alien
somewhere just pranking yeah uh but i

3144
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:54,800
somewhere just pranking yeah uh but i
 

3145
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,990
somewhere just pranking yeah uh but i
was asked that exact question

3146
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,000
was asked that exact question
 

3147
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,990
was asked that exact question
this saturday by uh by a

3148
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
this saturday by uh by a
 

3149

seventy-year-old boy in
canada old seven seven years yes

3152
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:01,790
canada old seven seven years yes
 

3153
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,750
canada old seven seven years yes
[Laughter]

3154
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:03,760
[Laughter]
 

3155
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,270
[Laughter]
but it was the first time i'd been asked

3156
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:05,280
but it was the first time i'd been asked
 

3157
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,870
but it was the first time i'd been asked
that question this is the second in a

3158
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:06,880
that question this is the second in a
 

3159
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,829
that question this is the second in a
week

3160
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:08,839
week
 

3161
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:12,390
week
um we're kindred spirits him and i

3162
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:12,400
um we're kindred spirits him and i
 

3163
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,670
um we're kindred spirits him and i
we can um they can prank us to some

3164
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
we can um they can prank us to some
 

3165
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,630
we can um they can prank us to some
extent

3166
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:16,640
extent
 

3167
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,270
extent
but the this work of interpreting an

3168
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,280
but the this work of interpreting an
 

3169
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,470
but the this work of interpreting an
alien atmosphere

3170
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
alien atmosphere
 

3171
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,549
alien atmosphere
means you're reading the atmosphere as a

3172
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:22,559
means you're reading the atmosphere as a
 

3173
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,990
means you're reading the atmosphere as a
message and it's very

3174
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000
message and it's very
 

3175
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,710
message and it's very
hard to hide signs of life in an

3176
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:26,720
hard to hide signs of life in an
 

3177
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,030
hard to hide signs of life in an
atmosphere because

3178
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
atmosphere because
 

3179
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,950
atmosphere because
you can try to prank us but you're still

3180
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
you can try to prank us but you're still
 

3181
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,150
you can try to prank us but you're still
going to fart

3182
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
going to fart
 

3183
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,870
going to fart
and breathe and somehow metabolize the

3184
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
and breathe and somehow metabolize the
 

3185
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,150
and breathe and somehow metabolize the
environment around you

3186
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:36,160
environment around you
 

3187
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,990
environment around you
yeah and call that whatever you call

3188
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:38,000
yeah and call that whatever you call
 

3189
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,190
yeah and call that whatever you call
that uh

3190
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,200
that uh
 

3191
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,510
that uh
and release molecules and so that's

3192
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,520
and release molecules and so that's
 

3193
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,870
and release molecules and so that's
really hard to hide

3194
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:42,880
really hard to hide
 

3195
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,910
really hard to hide
you know you can go very quiet you can

3196
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:45,920
you know you can go very quiet you can
 

3197
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,230
you know you can go very quiet you can
throw out some weird molecule to confuse

3198
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,240
throw out some weird molecule to confuse
 

3199
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:48,950
throw out some weird molecule to confuse
us further

3200
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
us further
 

3201
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,829
us further
but we can still see all your other

3202
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:50,839
but we can still see all your other
 

3203
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,950
but we can still see all your other
metabolites it's hard to fake

3204
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:52,960
metabolites it's hard to fake
 

3205
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,270
metabolites it's hard to fake
uh is there so you kind of mentioned

3206
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:55,280
uh is there so you kind of mentioned
 

3207
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,549
uh is there so you kind of mentioned
like water

3208
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:56,559
like water
 

3209
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,470
like water
what um what other gases are there

3210
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:00,480
what um what other gases are there
 

3211
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,030
what um what other gases are there
that we know about that are like high

3212
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:03,040
that we know about that are like high
 

3213
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,230
that we know about that are like high
likelihood

3214
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240

mean what are your other favorites

3218
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:10,400
mean what are your other favorites
 

3219
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,109
mean what are your other favorites
inter so so we got phosphine but like

3220
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,119
inter so so we got phosphine but like
 

3221
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:13,430
inter so so we got phosphine but like
what

3222
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
what
 

3223
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,710
what
uh what else is a damn good signal to be

3224
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
uh what else is a damn good signal to be
 

3225
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,109
uh what else is a damn good signal to be
uh

3226

uh
 

3227
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,710
uh
that you think about that we should be

3228
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
that you think about that we should be
 

3229
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,150
that you think about that we should be
looking for if we look at another

00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:20,160
looking for if we look at another
 

3231

is there gases that come to mind or are
 

3235
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,710
is there gases that come to mind or are
there all sort of

3236
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
there all sort of
 

3237
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,030
there all sort of
possible bio signatures that we should

3238
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,040
possible bio signatures that we should
 

3239
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,789
possible bio signatures that we should
love equally

3240
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:28,799
love equally

00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,670
love equally
there's many so there's water we know

3242
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:31,680
there's many so there's water we know
 

3243
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,190
there's many so there's water we know
that's important for life as we know it

3244
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:33,200
that's important for life as we know it
 

3245
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:33,990
that's important for life as we know it
there's molecular

3246
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,000
there's molecular
 

3247
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,069
there's molecular
oxygen on earth that's probably the most

3248
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:36,079
oxygen on earth that's probably the most
 

3249
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,670
oxygen on earth that's probably the most
robust sign of life particularly

3250
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:37,680
robust sign of life particularly
 

3251

00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:43,280
oxygen in our atmosphere is
 

3257
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,990
oxygen in our atmosphere is
a product of life and so if i was an

3258
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
a product of life and so if i was an
 

3259
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,190
a product of life and so if i was an
alien astronomer

3260
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
alien astronomer
 

3261
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,230
alien astronomer
and i saw earth's atmosphere i'm

3262
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:50,240
and i saw earth's atmosphere i'm
 

3263
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,549
and i saw earth's atmosphere i'm
i would get a nobel i think on you know

3264
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:52,559
i would get a nobel i think on you know
 

3265
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,910
i would get a nobel i think on you know
what would you notice i mean this is

3266
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:53,920
what would you notice i mean this is
 

3267
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,109
what would you notice i mean this is
really

3268
00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:55,119
really
 

3269
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,510
really
i would be very excited about this about

3270
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
i would be very excited about this about
 

3271
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,309
i would be very excited about this about
the oxygen

3272
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:58,319
the oxygen
 

3273
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,510
the oxygen
about fighting 20 21 of oxygen

3274
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
about fighting 20 21 of oxygen
 

3275
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,069
about fighting 20 21 of oxygen
atmosphere

3276
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:02,079
atmosphere
 

3277
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,069
atmosphere
that's very unusual so would that be the

3278
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,079
that's very unusual so would that be the
 

3279
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,990
that's very unusual so would that be the
most exciting thing to you from an alien

3280
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,000
most exciting thing to you from an alien
 

3281
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,109
most exciting thing to you from an alien
perspective about earth

3282
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:07,119
perspective about earth
 

3283
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,349
perspective about earth
in terms of detect like analyzing the

3284
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:09,359
in terms of detect like analyzing the
 

3285
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,710
in terms of detect like analyzing the
atmosphere like what are the

3286
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:10,720
atmosphere like what are the
 

3287
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,950
atmosphere like what are the
biosignatures of life on earth would you

3288
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
biosignatures of life on earth would you
 

3289
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,349
biosignatures of life on earth would you
say

3290
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:13,359
say
 

3291
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,630
say
in terms of the contents of the

3292
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:14,640
in terms of the contents of the
 

3293
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,109
in terms of the contents of the
atmosphere is oxygen high amount of

3294
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:17,119
atmosphere is oxygen high amount of
 

3295
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:17,910
atmosphere is oxygen high amount of
oxygen

3296
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:17,920
oxygen
 

3297
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,230
oxygen
pretty damn good sign i mean it's not as

3298
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
pretty damn good sign i mean it's not as
 

3299
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,990
pretty damn good sign i mean it's not as
good as the tv signals we've been

3300
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,000
good as the tv signals we've been
 

3301
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,870
good as the tv signals we've been
sending out

3302
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:22,880
sending out
 

3303
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,069
sending out
those those are slightly more robust

3304
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:26,079
those those are slightly more robust
 

3305
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,109
those those are slightly more robust
than oxygen oxygen on its own has false

3306
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:29,119
than oxygen oxygen on its own has false
 

3307
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:29,990
than oxygen oxygen on its own has false
positives for life

3308
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:30,000
positives for life
 

3309
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,230
positives for life
so there's still ways of making it but

3310
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,240
so there's still ways of making it but
 

3311
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,430
so there's still ways of making it but
it's it's

3312
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:33,440
it's it's
 

3313
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,990
it's it's
a pretty robust sign of life in the

3314
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:36,000
a pretty robust sign of life in the
 

3315
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,589
a pretty robust sign of life in the
context or atmosphere with the

3316
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:37,599
context or atmosphere with the
 

3317
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,309
context or atmosphere with the
radiation that the sun produces our

3318
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:40,319
radiation that the sun produces our
 

3319
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,230
radiation that the sun produces our
position in relation to the sun

3320
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
position in relation to the sun
 

3321
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,470
position in relation to the sun
the other components of our atmosphere

3322
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:44,480
the other components of our atmosphere
 

3323
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,549
the other components of our atmosphere
the volcanic activity we have

3324
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
the volcanic activity we have
 

3325
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,270
the volcanic activity we have
all of that together makes the 20 of

3326
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
all of that together makes the 20 of
 

3327
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:49,829
all of that together makes the 20 of
oxygen

3328
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:49,839
oxygen
 

3329
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,670
oxygen
extremely um robust sign of life

3330
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:53,680
extremely um robust sign of life
 

3331
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,750
extremely um robust sign of life
but outside that context you could still

3332
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:55,760
but outside that context you could still
 

3333
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,190
but outside that context you could still
produce

3334
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:57,200
produce
 

3335
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,990
produce
oxygen without life but phosphine

3336
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000
oxygen without life but phosphine
 

3337
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,589
oxygen without life but phosphine
although better in the sense of

3338
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:01,599
although better in the sense of
 

3339
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,510
although better in the sense of
it is much harder to make it has lower

3340
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
it is much harder to make it has lower
 

3341
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,789
it is much harder to make it has lower
false positives

3342
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
false positives
 

3343
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,589
false positives
still has some so i'm actually against

3344
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:07,599
still has some so i'm actually against
 

3345
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,950
still has some so i'm actually against
looking for

3346
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960
looking for
 

3347
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,270
looking for
specific molecules unless we're looking

3348
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:11,280
specific molecules unless we're looking
 

3349
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,589
specific molecules unless we're looking
for like cfcs if we find cfcs that's

3350
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
for like cfcs if we find cfcs that's
 

3351
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,549
for like cfcs if we find cfcs that's
definitely aliens i feel confident

3352
00:57:15,549 --> 00:57:15,559
definitely aliens i feel confident
 

3353
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:16,710
definitely aliens i feel confident
chlorofluorocarbons

3354
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
chlorofluorocarbons
 

3355
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,710
chlorofluorocarbons
and so you know if aliens had been

3356
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
and so you know if aliens had been
 

3357
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,710
and so you know if aliens had been
watching us they would be going oh

3358
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:20,720
watching us they would be going oh
 

3359
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,829
watching us they would be going oh
no cfcs i mean yeah

3360
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:23,839
no cfcs i mean yeah
 

3361
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,510
no cfcs i mean yeah
they're not gonna last long let's you

3362
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:25,520
they're not gonna last long let's you
 

3363
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,349
they're not gonna last long let's you
know everyone's writing their thesis on

3364
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:27,359
know everyone's writing their thesis on
 

3365
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,630
know everyone's writing their thesis on
the end of

3366
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:28,640
the end of
 

3367
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,670
the end of
the end of the earth and then we got

3368
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:31,680
the end of the earth and then we got
 

3369
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,190
the end of the earth and then we got
together we stopped using them

3370
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:33,200
together we stopped using them
 

3371
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,470
together we stopped using them
i like to think they're really proud of

3372
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:34,480
i like to think they're really proud of
 

3373
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,710
i like to think they're really proud of
us um you know they literally saw our

3374
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:36,720
us um you know they literally saw our
 

3375
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,069
us um you know they literally saw our
ozone hole shrinking

3376
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:38,079
ozone hole shrinking
 

3377
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,750
ozone hole shrinking
they've been watching it and they saw it

3378
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:39,760
they've been watching it and they saw it
 

3379
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,430
they've been watching it and they saw it
happen i think they'll be honest they're

3380
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
happen i think they'll be honest they're
 

3381
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,710
happen i think they'll be honest they're
more paying attention to the whole

3382
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,720
more paying attention to the whole
 

3383
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,589
more paying attention to the whole
nuclear thing

3384
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:43,599
nuclear thing
 

3385
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,190
nuclear thing
that's just i think they care it's not

3386
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,200
that's just i think they care it's not
 

3387
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,950
that's just i think they care it's not
gonna bother them oh i mean worried

3388
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:46,960
gonna bother them oh i mean worried
 

3389
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,030
gonna bother them oh i mean worried
about us oh yes oh no worried about us

3390
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:49,040
about us oh yes oh no worried about us
 

3391
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,710
about us oh yes oh no worried about us
they i mean this is why the aliens have

3392
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:50,720
they i mean this is why the aliens have
 

3393
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,710
they i mean this is why the aliens have
been showing up recently uh

3394
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
been showing up recently uh
 

3395
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,630
been showing up recently uh
it's like if you if you look at i mean

3396
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:54,640
it's like if you if you look at i mean
 

3397
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,549
it's like if you if you look at i mean
there is i mean it's probably

3398
00:57:56,549 --> 00:57:56,559
there is i mean it's probably
 

3399
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,910
there is i mean it's probably
there's a correlation with a lot of

3400
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:57,920
there's a correlation with a lot of
 

3401
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,549
there's a correlation with a lot of
things but what the ufologists quote

3402
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:00,559
things but what the ufologists quote
 

3403
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,069
things but what the ufologists quote
unquote often talk about

3404
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:02,079
unquote often talk about
 

3405
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,190
unquote often talk about
is that there seems to be a much

3406
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
is that there seems to be a much
 

3407
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,670
is that there seems to be a much
higher level of ufo sighting since like

3408
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:07,680
higher level of ufo sighting since like
 

3409
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,510
higher level of ufo sighting since like
in the nuclear age

3410
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:09,520
in the nuclear age
 

3411
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,270
in the nuclear age
so like if aliens were indeed worried

3412
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:11,280
so like if aliens were indeed worried
 

3413
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,589
so like if aliens were indeed worried
about us like if you were aliens you

3414
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:13,599
about us like if you were aliens you
 

3415
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,710
about us like if you were aliens you
would start showing up

3416
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:14,720
would start showing up
 

3417
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,349
would start showing up
when the the living organisms have first

3418
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:17,359
when the the living organisms have first
 

3419
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,150
when the the living organisms have first
discovered a way to destroy the entire

3420
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
discovered a way to destroy the entire
 

3421
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,589
discovered a way to destroy the entire
the uh the entire colony can um

3422
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:23,599
the uh the entire colony can um
 

3423
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,470
the uh the entire colony can um
the uh increase in sightings not have to

3424
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,480
the uh increase in sightings not have to
 

3425
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,150
the uh increase in sightings not have to
do with the fact that people now have

3426
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:28,160
do with the fact that people now have
 

3427
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,589
do with the fact that people now have
more cameras

3428
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:29,599
more cameras
 

3429
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,430
more cameras
it's an interesting thing about science

3430
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:31,440
it's an interesting thing about science
 

3431
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,430
it's an interesting thing about science
like with ufo sightings

3432
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
like with ufo sightings
 

3433
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,789
like with ufo sightings
it's it's like either 99

3434
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:36,799
it's it's like either 99
 

3435
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,270
it's it's like either 99
of percent of them are false or 100 of

3436
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:39,280
of percent of them are false or 100 of
 

3437
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,069
of percent of them are false or 100 of
them are false

3438
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:40,079
them are false
 

3439
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,069
them are false
the interesting thing to me is in that

3440
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:42,079
the interesting thing to me is in that
 

3441
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,309
the interesting thing to me is in that
point zero one percent

3442
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:44,319
point zero one percent
 

3443
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:47,990
point zero one percent
there's a lot of things in science that

3444
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,000
there's a lot of things in science that
 

3445
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,470
there's a lot of things in science that
are like these weird outliers they're

3446
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:50,480
are like these weird outliers they're
 

3447
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,829
are like these weird outliers they're
difficult to replicate

3448
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:51,839
difficult to replicate
 

3449
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,430
difficult to replicate
you have like there's even physical

3450
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:53,440
you have like there's even physical
 

3451
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,870
you have like there's even physical
phenomena ball lightning

3452
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
phenomena ball lightning
 

3453
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,190
phenomena ball lightning
there's difficult things to artificially

3454
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,200
there's difficult things to artificially
 

3455
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,829
there's difficult things to artificially
create in large amounts or observe

3456
00:58:59,829 --> 00:58:59,839
create in large amounts or observe
 

3457
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,230
create in large amounts or observe
in nature in large amounts in such a way

3458
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:02,240
in nature in large amounts in such a way
 

3459
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,270
in nature in large amounts in such a way
that you can do to

3460
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:03,280
that you can do to
 

3461
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,510
that you can do to
apply the scientific method that could

3462
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:05,520
apply the scientific method that could
 

3463
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,710
apply the scientific method that could
be just things that like

3464
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:06,720
be just things that like
 

3465
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,069
be just things that like
what happened like a few times like or

3466
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:10,079
what happened like a few times like or
 

3467
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:10,870
what happened like a few times like or
once

3468
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:10,880
once
 

3469
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,190
once
and you're like what the hell is that

3470
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:13,200
and you're like what the hell is that
 

3471
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,870
and you're like what the hell is that
and that that's very difficult

3472
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880
and that that's very difficult
 

3473
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,390
and that that's very difficult
for science to know what to do it i'm a

3474
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,400
for science to know what to do it i'm a
 

3475
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,309
for science to know what to do it i'm a
huge proponent of just being open-minded

3476
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:18,319
huge proponent of just being open-minded
 

3477
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:19,109
huge proponent of just being open-minded
because

3478
00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:19,119
because
 

3479
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,950
because
when you're open-minded about aliens for

3480
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:20,960
when you're open-minded about aliens for
 

3481
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,190
when you're open-minded about aliens for
example is

3482
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:23,200
example is
 

3483
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,430
example is
it allows you to think outside the box

3484
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:25,440
it allows you to think outside the box
 

3485
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,349
it allows you to think outside the box
in other domains as well

3486
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
in other domains as well
 

3487
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,270
in other domains as well
and somehow that will result like if you

3488
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
and somehow that will result like if you
 

3489
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,430
and somehow that will result like if you
open mind about aliens

3490
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
open mind about aliens
 

3491
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,270
open mind about aliens
and you don't comp you know don't laugh

3492
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:33,280
and you don't comp you know don't laugh
 

3493
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,470
and you don't comp you know don't laugh
it off immediately

3494
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
it off immediately
 

3495
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,069
it off immediately
what happens is somehow that that's

3496
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:36,079
what happens is somehow that that's
 

3497
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,829
what happens is somehow that that's
going to lead to a solution to p equals

3498
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:37,839
going to lead to a solution to p equals
 

3499
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,510
going to lead to a solution to p equals
np or p not equals np

np or p not equals np
like in ways that you can't predict the

3502
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:42,319
like in ways that you can't predict the
 

3503
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:43,910
like in ways that you can't predict the
open mindedness has

00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:43,920
open mindedness has
 

3505
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,390
open mindedness has
tertiary effects that will result in

00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
tertiary effects that will result in
 

3507
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,430
tertiary effects that will result in
progress i believe

3508
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
progress i believe
 

3509
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,589
progress i believe
which is why i'm a huge fan of aliens

3510
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:49,599
which is why i'm a huge fan of aliens
 

3511
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,589
which is why i'm a huge fan of aliens
because it's like

3512
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:51,599
because it's like
 

3513
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,750
because it's like
because too many scientists roll their

3514
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,760
because too many scientists roll their
 

3515
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,910
because too many scientists roll their
eyes at the idea of aliens

3516
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
eyes at the idea of aliens
 

3517
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,630
eyes at the idea of aliens
alien life and to me it's one of the

3518
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:58,640
alien life and to me it's one of the
 

3519
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:58,950
alien life and to me it's one of the
most

3520
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:58,960
most
 

3521
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,309
most
exciting possibilities uh in the

01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319
exciting possibilities uh in the
 

3523
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,430
exciting possibilities uh in the
biggest most exciting questions

01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
before all of human civilization so to
 

3527
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,470
before all of human civilization so to
roll your eyes

3528
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:10,480
roll your eyes
 

3529
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,870
roll your eyes
is not the right answer to roll your

3530
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:12,880
is not the right answer to roll your
 

3531
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,309
is not the right answer to roll your
eyes presumes that you know

3532
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:14,319
eyes presumes that you know
 

3533
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,230
eyes presumes that you know
anything about this world as opposed to

anything about this world as opposed to
 

3535
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,069
anything about this world as opposed to
just knowing point zero zero zero one

uh visiting earth is a good idea not
 

3545
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,069
uh visiting earth is a good idea not
everything though

everything though
 

3547
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,150
everything though
i'm not so open-minded to the flat earth

i'm not so open-minded to the flat earth

uh hypothesis
 

3551
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,309
uh hypothesis
is there's a growing number of people uh

3552

is there's a growing number of people uh
 

3553

is there's a growing number of people uh
believing in

believing in
 

3555
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,430
believing in
but even then or the inner earth i've

3556
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
but even then or the inner earth i've
 

3557
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,190
but even then or the inner earth i've
got shouted out in a public talk about

3558
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:41,200
got shouted out in a public talk about
 

3559
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:41,990
got shouted out in a public talk about
it

3560
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,000
it
 

3561
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,549
it
so like the earth is hollow yeah my

3562
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:44,559
so like the earth is hollow yeah my
 

3563
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,870
so like the earth is hollow yeah my
understanding is that there's an

3564
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:46,880
understanding is that there's an
 

3565
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,829
understanding is that there's an
this conspiracy theory that as far as i

3566
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:49,839
this conspiracy theory that as far as i
 

3567
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:50,789
this conspiracy theory that as far as i
can tell has

3568
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:50,799
can tell has
 

3569
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,710
can tell has
no grounding in reality is that there's

3570
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:52,720
no grounding in reality is that there's
 

3571
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,309
no grounding in reality is that there's
a slightly smaller earth

3572
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:54,319
a slightly smaller earth
 

3573
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,230
a slightly smaller earth
inside this one which is just too cute

3574
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:56,240
inside this one which is just too cute
 

3575
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,589
inside this one which is just too cute
as a concept

3576
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
as a concept
 

3577
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,430
as a concept
um and you can access it i think from

3578
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,440
um and you can access it i think from
 

3579
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,950
um and you can access it i think from
antarctica and

3580
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
antarctica and
 

3581
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,030
antarctica and
that's where we keep and i quote the

3582
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,040
that's where we keep and i quote the
 

3583
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,950
that's where we keep and i quote the
mammoths and the nazis

3584
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960

 

3585
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,710

yeah i mean that one is ridiculous but

3586
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:08,720
yeah i mean that one is ridiculous but
 

3587
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,309
yeah i mean that one is ridiculous but
like i do like hey i thought you were

3588
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:10,319
like i do like hey i thought you were
 

3589
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,230
like i do like hey i thought you were
keeping an open mind i am this is this

3590
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
keeping an open mind i am this is this
 

3591
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:12,789
keeping an open mind i am this is this
is

3592
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:12,799
is
 

3593
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,630
is
i genuinely think that's more likely

3594
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:14,640
i genuinely think that's more likely
 

3595
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,309
i genuinely think that's more likely
than aliens visiting the earth and i say

3596
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
than aliens visiting the earth and i say
 

3597
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,390
than aliens visiting the earth and i say
this as someone who has dedicated

3598
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,400
this as someone who has dedicated
 

3599
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,670
this as someone who has dedicated
her life to finding like alien life and

3600
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
her life to finding like alien life and
 

3601
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,870
her life to finding like alien life and
and so that's how improbable

3602
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:24,880
and so that's how improbable
 

3603
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,829
and so that's how improbable
i think the visitations are because

3604
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:27,839
i think the visitations are because
 

3605
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,270
i think the visitations are because
interstellar distances are

3606
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
interstellar distances are
 

3607
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,309
interstellar distances are
so huge that it's just not really worth

3608
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:32,319
so huge that it's just not really worth
 

3609
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:32,630
so huge that it's just not really worth
it

3610
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
it
 

3611
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,150
it
see i i have a different view on this

3612
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:34,160
see i i have a different view on this
 

3613
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,150
see i i have a different view on this
whole thing i think the

3614
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,160
whole thing i think the
 

3615
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,109
whole thing i think the
aliens that look like little green men

3616
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
aliens that look like little green men
 

3617
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,069
aliens that look like little green men
are

3618
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:40,079
are
 

3619
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,950
are
like extremely low probability event

3620
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
like extremely low probability event
 

3621
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,190
like extremely low probability event
like mammoths and nazis

3622
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,200
like mammoths and nazis
 

3623
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,630
like mammoths and nazis
yeah that's similar but

3624
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:48,640
yeah that's similar but
 

3625
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,990
yeah that's similar but
but other kind of ideas like

3626
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
but other kind of ideas like
 

3627
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,870
but other kind of ideas like
the the sad thing to me and i think

3628
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880

 

3629
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,309

in my view if there's other alien

3630
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:58,319
in my view if there's other alien
 

3631
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,910
in my view if there's other alien
civilizations out there

3632
01:01:59,910 --> 01:01:59,920
civilizations out there
 

3633
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,270
civilizations out there
and they visited earth neither them

3634
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,280
and they visited earth neither them
 

3635
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,510
and they visited earth neither them
or perhaps just us would be even able to

3636
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:05,520
or perhaps just us would be even able to
 

3637
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,710
or perhaps just us would be even able to
detect them

3638
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:06,720
detect them
 

3639
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,710
detect them
like we we wouldn't be open-minded

3640
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:08,720
like we we wouldn't be open-minded
 

3641
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,150
like we we wouldn't be open-minded
enough to see it

3642
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:10,160
enough to see it
 

3643
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,349
enough to see it
like if if

3644
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:13,359
like if if
 

3645
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,990
like if if
because our understanding of what is

3646
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,000
because our understanding of what is
 

3647
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,430
because our understanding of what is
life

3648
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:17,440
life
 

3649
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,990
life
and i just talked to sarah walker who's

3650
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
and i just talked to sarah walker who's
 

3651
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,549
and i just talked to sarah walker who's
uh

3652
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
uh
 

3653
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,510
uh
you know sarah yeah we talked for three

3654
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,520
you know sarah yeah we talked for three
 

3655
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,910
you know sarah yeah we talked for three
hours about the question what is life

3656
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:25,920
hours about the question what is life
 

3657
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,910
hours about the question what is life
there's a good person to talk to about

3658
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:27,920
there's a good person to talk to about
 

3659
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,029
there's a good person to talk to about
what is life

3660
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:29,039
what is life
 

3661
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,630
what is life
but like the whole point is we don't

3662
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:30,640
but like the whole point is we don't
 

3663
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,029
but like the whole point is we don't
really we have a very narrow-minded view

3664
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:33,039
really we have a very narrow-minded view
 

3665
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:33,510
really we have a very narrow-minded view
of what

3666
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:33,520
of what
 

3667
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,910
of what
is life and when it shows up and it

3668
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:35,920
is life and when it shows up and it
 

3669
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,430
is life and when it shows up and it
might be already here

3670
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,440
might be already here
 

3671
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,789
might be already here
um trees and dolphins and so on

3672
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:42,799

 

3673
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,390

and or or mountains or i don't know or

3674
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
and or or mountains or i don't know or
 

3675
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:46,870
and or or mountains or i don't know or
the

3676
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:46,880
the
 

3677
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,109
the
or the molecules in the atmosphere or um

3678
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
or the molecules in the atmosphere or um
 

3679
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,750
or the molecules in the atmosphere or um
or like i people make fun of me but i do

3680
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:53,760
or like i people make fun of me but i do
 

3681
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,390
or like i people make fun of me but i do
think that

3682
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
think that
 

3683
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,630
think that
ideas are kind of aliens themselves or

3684
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,640
ideas are kind of aliens themselves or
 

3685
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,309
ideas are kind of aliens themselves or
consciousness could be the aliens

3686
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
consciousness could be the aliens
 

3687
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,750
consciousness could be the aliens
or it could be the method by which they

3688
01:02:59,750 --> 01:02:59,760
or it could be the method by which they
 

3689
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,750
or it could be the method by which they
communicate we don't know about the

3690
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
communicate we don't know about the
 

3691
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,349
communicate we don't know about the
way our human mind works

3692
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:03,359
way our human mind works
 

3693
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,349
way our human mind works
and the fact that this thing is a

3694
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:05,359
and the fact that this thing is a
 

3695
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:06,950
and the fact that this thing is a
quantum process

3696
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:06,960
quantum process
 

3697
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,589
quantum process
please don't i i understand this it's

3698
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
please don't i i understand this it's
 

3699
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,309
please don't i i understand this it's
not woo

3700
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
not woo
 

3701
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,630
not woo
i'm not i could but it very well could

3702
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:12,640
i'm not i could but it very well could
 

3703
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,309
i'm not i could but it very well could
be there could be something at the

3704
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:14,319
be there could be something at the
 

3705
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,309
be there could be something at the
at the physics level right it could be

3706
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:16,319
at the physics level right it could be
 

3707
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,069
at the physics level right it could be
at the chemical or the biological level

3708
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:18,079
at the chemical or the biological level
 

3709
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,349
at the chemical or the biological level
things that are happening that we're

3710
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:19,359
things that are happening that we're
 

3711
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,270
things that are happening that we're
just close too close-minded

3712
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:21,280
just close too close-minded
 

3713
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,670
just close too close-minded
because our conception of life is at the

3714
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:23,680
because our conception of life is at the
 

3715
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,950
because our conception of life is at the
level of

3716
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
level of
 

3717
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,069
level of
like us like at the jungle level

3718
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:28,079
like us like at the jungle level
 

3719
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,270
like us like at the jungle level
of mammals and on the time scale that's

3720
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280
of mammals and on the time scale that's
 

3721
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,029
of mammals and on the time scale that's
the human time scale we may not be able

3722
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:33,039
the human time scale we may not be able
 

3723
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,390
the human time scale we may not be able
to perceive

3724
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
to perceive
 

3725
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,910
to perceive
what alien life is actually like

3726
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
what alien life is actually like
 

3727
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,789
what alien life is actually like
what on the scale at which their

3728
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
what on the scale at which their
 

3729
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,109
what on the scale at which their
intelligence realizes itself we may not

3730
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
intelligence realizes itself we may not
 

3731
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,710
intelligence realizes itself we may not
be able to perceive

3732
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
be able to perceive
 

3733
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,230
be able to perceive
and the other thing that's really

3734
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
and the other thing that's really
 

3735
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,710
and the other thing that's really
important about alien visitations

3736
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:48,720
important about alien visitations
 

3737
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,670
important about alien visitations
whether it happened or not is especially

3738
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:51,680
whether it happened or not is especially
 

3739
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,910
whether it happened or not is especially
after covet in 2020

01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:53,920
after covet in 2020

after covet in 2020
i'm losing a little bit of faith of our

i'm losing a little bit of faith of our
 

3743
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,829
i'm losing a little bit of faith of our
government being able to handle that

3744
01:03:57,829 --> 01:03:57,839
government being able to handle that
 

3745
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:01,029
government being able to handle that
that well not our government but us as

3746
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:01,039
that well not our government but us as
 

3747
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,430
that well not our government but us as
a society as a collective being able to

a society as a collective being able to
 

3749

a society as a collective being able to
deal with new things in an effective way

3750
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:08,640
deal with new things in an effective way
 

3751
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,910
deal with new things in an effective way
that's inspiring that's efficient that

that's inspiring that's efficient that
 

3753

uh
 

3755
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,549
uh
like whether it's if it's a dangerous

3756
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:16,559
like whether it's if it's a dangerous
 

3757
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,750
like whether it's if it's a dangerous
thing to deal with it

3758
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760
thing to deal with it
 

3759
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,910
thing to deal with it
to alleviate the danger whether it's the

3760
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:19,920
to alleviate the danger whether it's the
 

3761
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,029
to alleviate the danger whether it's the
possibility of

3762
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:21,039
possibility of
 

3763
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,589
possibility of
new discoveries and something inspiring

3764
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:23,599
new discoveries and something inspiring
 

3765
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,910
new discoveries and something inspiring
to ride that wave and make it inspiring

3766
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920
to ride that wave and make it inspiring
 

3767
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,029
to ride that wave and make it inspiring
all those kinds of things

3768
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:27,039
all those kinds of things
 

3769
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,029
all those kinds of things
i honestly think if aliens showed up

3770
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:29,039
i honestly think if aliens showed up
 

3771
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,230
i honestly think if aliens showed up
they would look around

3772
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:30,240
they would look around
 

3773
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,910
they would look around
everybody would ignore them and the

3774
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
everybody would ignore them and the
 

3775
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,910
everybody would ignore them and the
government might like hide it

3776
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:33,920
government might like hide it
 

3777
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,069
government might like hide it
try to like see to keep it from the

3778
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:36,079
try to like see to keep it from the
 

3779
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:37,510
try to like see to keep it from the
chinese and the russians if it's the

01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
chinese and the russians if it's the

call it a military secret in a very
 

3785

close-minded way
and then the bureaucracy would drawn it

3788
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:44,480
and then the bureaucracy would drawn it
 

3789
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,910
and then the bureaucracy would drawn it
away to where uh

away to where uh

01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,230
away to where uh
through paperwork the poor aliens would

01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,240
through paperwork the poor aliens would
 

3793
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,470
through paperwork the poor aliens would
just like waste away in a cell somewhere

3794
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:50,480
just like waste away in a cell somewhere
 

3795
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,870
just like waste away in a cell somewhere
like there's a certain that would never

confident that aliens have not visited

3800
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:57,280
confident that aliens have not visited
 

3801
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,630
confident that aliens have not visited
because they would have had to visit

3802
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:58,640
because they would have had to visit
 

3803
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,390
because they would have had to visit
just to have a look remotely

3804
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:00,400
just to have a look remotely
 

3805

just to have a look remotely
you know from neptune or something which

01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:02,720
you know from neptune or something which
 

3807
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,230
you know from neptune or something which
makes no sense because interstellar

3808
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
makes no sense because interstellar
 

3809
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:04,789
makes no sense because interstellar

travel
 

3811
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:09,430
travel
is so difficult that it would be

3812
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
is so difficult that it would be
 

3813
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,789
is so difficult that it would be
quite a ridiculous proposition but

3814
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
quite a ridiculous proposition but
 

3815
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,069
quite a ridiculous proposition but
that's the bit that i think is

3816
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:12,079
that's the bit that i think is
 

3817
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,349
that's the bit that i think is
technically possible

3818
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
technically possible
 

3819
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:14,950
technically possible
if they did come here and they were

01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
if they did come here and they were
 

3821
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,990
if they did come here and they were
visible by anyone detectable by anyone

01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,589
are capable of traveling interstellar

the moon these things be way way way
 

3837
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:35,430
the moon these things be way way way
way and the fact that we think our puny

01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:35,440
way and the fact that we think our puny
 

3839

in the world got together
 

3843
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,349
in the world got together
and the fact that they could somehow

3844
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:41,359
and the fact that they could somehow
 

3845
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:42,309
and the fact that they could somehow
contain this

01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:42,319
contain this
 

3847
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:45,670
contain this
it's that it's trying to contain a human

3848
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:45,680
it's that it's trying to contain a human
 

3849
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,630
it's that it's trying to contain a human
that visited them

3850
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:46,640
that visited them
 

3851
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,870
that visited them
exactly but and scientists you would

3852
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:48,880
exactly but and scientists you would
 

3853
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,309
exactly but and scientists you would
have to bring scientists on board

3854
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:50,319
have to bring scientists on board
 

3855
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:52,549
have to bring scientists on board
you've met a lot of scientists how good

3856
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:52,559
you've met a lot of scientists how good
 

3857
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:53,829
you've met a lot of scientists how good
are they keeping secrets

3858
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:53,839
are they keeping secrets
 

3859
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,950
are they keeping secrets
because in my experience they're

3860
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:55,960
because in my experience they're
 

3861
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,630
because in my experience they're
absolutely appalling at keeping secrets

3862
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:58,640
absolutely appalling at keeping secrets
 

3863
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,510
absolutely appalling at keeping secrets
yeah that's terrible

3864
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
yeah that's terrible
 

3865
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,270
yeah that's terrible
even the phospho-non-venus thing which

3866
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:01,280
even the phospho-non-venus thing which
 

3867
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,190
even the phospho-non-venus thing which
was a pretty well-kept secret

3868
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
was a pretty well-kept secret
 

3869
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,789
was a pretty well-kept secret
this is true you had a bunch of people

3870
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:04,799
this is true you had a bunch of people
 

3871
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,470
this is true you had a bunch of people
that were i told my dad

3872
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:06,480
that were i told my dad
 

3873
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,750
that were i told my dad
yeah you know my dad knew and

3874
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:09,760
yeah you know my dad knew and
 

3875
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,430
yeah you know my dad knew and
hopefully didn't tell anyone but if it

3876
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:11,440
hopefully didn't tell anyone but if it
 

3877
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,109
hopefully didn't tell anyone but if it
had been an alien visiting he probably

3878
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:13,119
had been an alien visiting he probably
 

3879
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,190
had been an alien visiting he probably
would have told them mate you know

3880
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:15,200
would have told them mate you know
 

3881
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,549
would have told them mate you know
and so these secrets could not be kept

3882
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:18,559
and so these secrets could not be kept
 

3883
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:18,950
and so these secrets could not be kept
by

3884
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:18,960
by
 

3885
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,710
by
any scientist that i know and certainly

3886
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:20,720
any scientist that i know and certainly
 

3887
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,390
any scientist that i know and certainly
not collaborative scientists which would

3888
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:22,400
not collaborative scientists which would
 

3889
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,309
not collaborative scientists which would
be needed you need all sorts of

3890
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:24,319
be needed you need all sorts of
 

3891
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:27,349
be needed you need all sorts of
um scientific teams so between the

3892
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:27,359
um scientific teams so between the
 

3893
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,789
um scientific teams so between the
pathetic power of any world's

3894
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:30,799
pathetic power of any world's
 

3895
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,990
pathetic power of any world's
military compared to any civilization uh

3896
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,000
military compared to any civilization uh
 

3897
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,109
military compared to any civilization uh
capable of traveling

3898
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
capable of traveling
 

3899
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,230
capable of traveling
and our absolute inability to keep

3900
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:38,240
and our absolute inability to keep
 

3901
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,589
and our absolute inability to keep
secrets uh uh absolutely not

3902
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:41,599
secrets uh uh absolutely not
 

3903
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,430
secrets uh uh absolutely not
i will bet everything that we have not

3904
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:43,440
i will bet everything that we have not
 

3905
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,829
i will bet everything that we have not
been visited because we are too pathetic

3906
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
been visited because we are too pathetic
 

3907
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:46,870
been visited because we are too pathetic
to hold that

3908
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:46,880
to hold that
 

3909
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,190
to hold that
well let me hold that truth if we're

3910
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
well let me hold that truth if we're
 

3911
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,549
well let me hold that truth if we're
making it like a 10

3912
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:50,559
making it like a 10
 

3913
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:53,670
making it like a 10
bet there's a possibility here

3914
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:53,680
bet there's a possibility here
 

3915
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,029
bet there's a possibility here
that the main say there exists one alien

3916
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
that the main say there exists one alien
 

3917
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,430
that the main say there exists one alien
other intelligent alien civilization in

3918
01:06:59,430 --> 01:06:59,440
other intelligent alien civilization in
 

3919
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,670
other intelligent alien civilization in
the galaxy

3920
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:01,680
the galaxy
 

3921
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,349
the galaxy
the pa to me the if they visit earth

3922
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
the pa to me the if they visit earth
 

3923
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,190
the pa to me the if they visit earth
was going to visit earth is like the

3924
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
was going to visit earth is like the
 

3925
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,029
was going to visit earth is like the
crappy

3926
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,039
crappy
 

3927
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,750
crappy
like the really crappy short straw yeah

3928
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:11,760
like the really crappy short straw yeah
 

3929
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,549
like the really crappy short straw yeah
yeah like

3930
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:12,559
yeah like
 

3931
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,589
yeah like
like this this like really dumb

3932
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:15,599
like this this like really dumb
 

3933
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,829
like this this like really dumb
thing that's uh i don't know like the

3934
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:17,839
thing that's uh i don't know like the
 

3935
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,270
thing that's uh i don't know like the
early game boys or something

3936
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:19,280
early game boys or something
 

3937
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,630
early game boys or something
and there's a cartoon about this there's

3938
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
and there's a cartoon about this there's
 

3939
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,430
and there's a cartoon about this there's
an alien that gets sent to earth

3940
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:23,440
an alien that gets sent to earth
 

3941
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,309
an alien that gets sent to earth
a commander spiff or something and it's

3942
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:26,319
a commander spiff or something and it's
 

3943
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,309
a commander spiff or something and it's
kind of a punishment or something uh

3944
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
kind of a punishment or something uh
 

3945
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,910
kind of a punishment or something uh
but that's not possible that's the thing

3946
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:29,920
but that's not possible that's the thing
 

3947
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,990
but that's not possible that's the thing
because interstellar distances are so

3948
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,000
because interstellar distances are so
 

3949
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,950
because interstellar distances are so
hard to

3950
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
hard to
 

3951
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,029
hard to
to cross you have to do it on purpose

3952
01:07:35,029 --> 01:07:35,039
to cross you have to do it on purpose
 

3953
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,390
to cross you have to do it on purpose
you have to do on purpose it has to be a

3954
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:36,400
you have to do on purpose it has to be a
 

3955
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:36,870
you have to do on purpose it has to be a
big

3956
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:36,880
big
 

3957
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,349
big
big deal and we know this because yes

3958
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
big deal and we know this because yes
 

3959
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,870
big deal and we know this because yes
you're right we don't know

3960
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
you're right we don't know
 

3961
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,829
you're right we don't know
enough about galactic biology we don't

3962
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:43,839
enough about galactic biology we don't
 

3963
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,109
enough about galactic biology we don't
know what the universal

3964
01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:45,119
know what the universal
 

3965
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,349
know what the universal
rules of biology or biochemistry are

3966
01:07:47,349 --> 01:07:47,359
rules of biology or biochemistry are
 

3967
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,670
rules of biology or biochemistry are
because we only have the earth

3968
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:49,680
because we only have the earth
 

3969
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,390
because we only have the earth
but we do know that the laws of physics

3970
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:52,400
but we do know that the laws of physics
 

3971
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,430
but we do know that the laws of physics
are universal

3972
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
are universal
 

3973
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,829
are universal
we can predict behavior in the universe

3974
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:55,839
we can predict behavior in the universe
 

3975
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,109
we can predict behavior in the universe
and then see it happen

3976
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:57,119
and then see it happen
 

3977
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,589
and then see it happen
based on these autophysics we know the

3978
01:07:59,589 --> 01:07:59,599
based on these autophysics we know the
 

3979
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:00,630
based on these autophysics we know the
laws of chemistry

3980
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:00,640
laws of chemistry
 

3981
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,190
laws of chemistry
are universal we know the periodic table

3982
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:03,200
are universal we know the periodic table
 

3983
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,029
are universal we know the periodic table
is all they have to choose from

3984
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:05,039
is all they have to choose from
 

3985
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,190
is all they have to choose from
so yes there may be some sort of

3986
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:07,200
so yes there may be some sort of
 

3987
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,150
so yes there may be some sort of
unimaginable

3988
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:08,160
unimaginable
 

3989
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,870
unimaginable
intelligence but they still have to use

3990
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:10,880
intelligence but they still have to use
 

3991
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,190
intelligence but they still have to use
the same periodic table that we have

3992
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
the same periodic table that we have
 

3993
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:13,990
the same periodic table that we have
access to

3994
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:14,000
access to
 

3995
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,670
access to
they still have a finite number of

3996
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:15,680
they still have a finite number of
 

3997
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,990
they still have a finite number of
molecules they can do things with

3998
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,000
molecules they can do things with
 

3999
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,630
molecules they can do things with
so they still have to use the resources

4000
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:20,640
so they still have to use the resources
 

4001
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,309
so they still have to use the resources
around them the stars around them the

4002
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
around them the stars around them the
 

4003
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,070
around them the stars around them the
universe around them and we know how

4004
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,080
universe around them and we know how
 

4005
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,470
universe around them and we know how
much energy is in these places

4006
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
much energy is in these places
 

4007
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,590
much energy is in these places
and so yes they may be very capable

4008
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:29,600
and so yes they may be very capable
 

4009
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,149
and so yes they may be very capable
capable beyond our wildest dreams but

4010
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
capable beyond our wildest dreams but
 

4011
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,910
capable beyond our wildest dreams but
they're still in the same universe

4012
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:33,920
they're still in the same universe
 

4013
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,349
they're still in the same universe
and we know a lot of those rules we're

4014
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:35,359
and we know a lot of those rules we're
 

4015
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,510
and we know a lot of those rules we're
not completely blind but

4016
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:37,520
not completely blind but
 

4017
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,550
not completely blind but
there's a colleague here at harvard uh

4018
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
there's a colleague here at harvard uh
 

4019
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,789
there's a colleague here at harvard uh
uh cameron vaffa he's a theoretical

4020
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:42,799
uh cameron vaffa he's a theoretical
 

4021
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:45,110
uh cameron vaffa he's a theoretical
physicist i don't know if you know him

4022
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:45,120
physicist i don't know if you know him
 

4023
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,269
physicist i don't know if you know him
i've only joined harvard about six

4024
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:47,279
i've only joined harvard about six
 

4025
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,870
i've only joined harvard about six
months ago okay

4026
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:48,880
months ago okay
 

4027
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,950
months ago okay
it's time to meet all the theoretical

4028
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
it's time to meet all the theoretical
 

4029
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,630
it's time to meet all the theoretical
physicists uh

4030
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
physicists uh
 

4031
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,309
physicists uh
so he's a string theorist but uh

4032
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:56,319
so he's a string theorist but uh
 

4033
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,430
so he's a string theorist but uh
his idea is that uh

4034
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,440
his idea is that uh
 

4035
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,430
his idea is that uh
aliens that are sophisticated enough to

4036
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:01,440
aliens that are sophisticated enough to
 

4037
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,630
aliens that are sophisticated enough to
travel into cells

4038
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:02,640
travel into cells
 

4039
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,709
travel into cells
like those kinds of distances will

4040
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:04,719
like those kinds of distances will
 

4041
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,470
like those kinds of distances will
figure out actually ways to hack

4042
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
figure out actually ways to hack
 

4043
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,950
figure out actually ways to hack
the the fabric of the universe enough to

4044
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:08,960
the the fabric of the universe enough to
 

4045
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,749
the the fabric of the universe enough to
have fun

4046
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:09,759
have fun
 

4047
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,590
have fun
in other ways like this universe is too

4048
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:11,600
in other ways like this universe is too
 

4049
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,149
in other ways like this universe is too
boring like you would figure out ways to

4050
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
boring like you would figure out ways to
 

4051
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:15,510
boring like you would figure out ways to
create other universes or

4052
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:15,520
create other universes or
 

4053
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,910
create other universes or
like you you go outside the physics as

4054
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:17,920
like you you go outside the physics as
 

4055
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,189
like you you go outside the physics as
we know it

4056
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
we know it
 

4057
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:21,349
we know it
so the reason we don't see aliens

4058
01:09:21,349 --> 01:09:21,359
so the reason we don't see aliens
 

4059
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:22,709
so the reason we don't see aliens
visiting us all over the place is

4060
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
visiting us all over the place is
 

4061
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,149
visiting us all over the place is
they're having fun elsewhere

4062
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:24,159
they're having fun elsewhere
 

4063
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:26,390
they're having fun elsewhere
this is like way too boring we humans

4064
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
this is like way too boring we humans
 

4065
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,309
this is like way too boring we humans
think this is fun but it's actually

4066
01:09:28,309 --> 01:09:28,319
think this is fun but it's actually
 

4067
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,950
think this is fun but it's actually
mostly empty space that not no fun is

4068
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:30,960
mostly empty space that not no fun is
 

4069
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,590
mostly empty space that not no fun is
happening

4070
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:31,600
happening
 

4071
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,829
happening
like there's no fun in visiting earth

4072
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:33,839
like there's no fun in visiting earth
 

4073
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,990
like there's no fun in visiting earth
for a super advanced civilization so he

4074
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000
for a super advanced civilization so he
 

4075
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,630
for a super advanced civilization so he
thinks like

4076
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,640
thinks like
 

4077
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,789
thinks like
if alien civilizations are out there

4078
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
if alien civilizations are out there
 

4079
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,309
if alien civilizations are out there
they found

4080
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
they found
 

4081
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,030
they found
outside of our current standard models

4082
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,040
outside of our current standard models
 

4083

outside of our current standard models
of physics ways of having fun

4084
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:44,960
of physics ways of having fun
 

4085
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,669
of physics ways of having fun
that don't involve us but that's

4086
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
that don't involve us but that's
 

4087
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:48,070
that don't involve us but that's
probably

4088
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
probably
 

4089
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,669
probably
true but even the notion of visiting

4090
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
true but even the notion of visiting
 

4091
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,390
true but even the notion of visiting
that's so literally pedestrian you know

4092
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
that's so literally pedestrian you know
 

4093
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,070
that's so literally pedestrian you know
of course we want to go there because

4094
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
of course we want to go there because
 

4095
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,830
of course we want to go there because
going there is the only thing we know we

4096
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
going there is the only thing we know we
 

4097
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,350
going there is the only thing we know we
see a thing we want we want to go there

4098
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:57,360
see a thing we want we want to go there
 

4099
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,310
see a thing we want we want to go there
and get it

4100
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,320
and get it
 

4101
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,430
and get it
but that is probably something they've

4102
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:01,440
but that is probably something they've
 

4103
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,470
but that is probably something they've
no longer got need for i

4104
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:04,480
no longer got need for i
 

4105
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,870
no longer got need for i
specifically don't particularly want to

4106
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:06,880
specifically don't particularly want to
 

4107
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,750
specifically don't particularly want to
go to space

4108
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:07,760
go to space
 

4109
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,149
go to space
it sounds awful you know none of the

4110
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,159
it sounds awful you know none of the
 

4111
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:11,750
it sounds awful you know none of the
things i like are going to be there

4112
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:11,760
things i like are going to be there
 

4113
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,950
things i like are going to be there
and i my whole work

4114
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:14,960
and i my whole work
 

4115
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,870
and i my whole work
is my whole career is finding life and

4116
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
is my whole career is finding life and
 

4117
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,709
is my whole career is finding life and
understanding the universe so i care

4118
01:10:18,709 --> 01:10:18,719
understanding the universe so i care
 

4119
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,910
understanding the universe so i care
a lot but i care about knowing about it

4120
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:21,920
a lot but i care about knowing about it
 

4121
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,310
a lot but i care about knowing about it
and i feel no need to go there to learn

4122
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
and i feel no need to go there to learn
 

4123
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,270
and i feel no need to go there to learn
about it

4124
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
about it
 

4125
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,430
about it
and i think as we develop better tools

4126
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
and i think as we develop better tools
 

4127
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,110
and i think as we develop better tools
hopefully people will feel less and less

4128
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:29,120
hopefully people will feel less and less
 

4129
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,390
hopefully people will feel less and less
a need to go

4130
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:30,400
a need to go
 

4131
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,510
a need to go
everywhere that we know about and i

4132
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:33,520
everywhere that we know about and i
 

4133
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,270
everywhere that we know about and i
would expect any alien civilization

4134
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,280
would expect any alien civilization
 

4135
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,310
would expect any alien civilization
worth their salt

4136
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:36,320
worth their salt
 

4137
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,510
worth their salt
have developed observation tools and and

4138
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:39,520
have developed observation tools and and
 

4139
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,350
have developed observation tools and and
tools that allow them to understand

4140
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,360
tools that allow them to understand
 

4141
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,149
tools that allow them to understand
the universe around them and beyond

the universe around them and beyond

01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
without having to go there this
 

4145
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,350
without having to go there this
this going is so wasteful yeah so more

4146
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,360
this going is so wasteful yeah so more
 

4147
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,950
this going is so wasteful yeah so more

that's benito that i mean that said do
you think there's um

4160
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:01,199
you think there's um
 

4161
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,669
you think there's um
any hopeful search for life through

4165
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,390
phosphate and other
gases do you um do you think there's

4166
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:08,400
gases do you um do you think there's
 

4167
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,709
gases do you um do you think there's
other alien civilizations out there

4168
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:10,719
other alien civilizations out there
 

4169
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,390
other alien civilizations out there
first do you think there's other life

4170
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:12,400
first do you think there's other life
 

4171
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,149
first do you think there's other life
out there first

4172
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159
out there first
 

4173
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,750
out there first
do you think there's life in the solar

4174
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
do you think there's life in the solar
 

4175
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,550
do you think there's life in the solar
system second do you think there's life

4176
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:18,560
system second do you think there's life
 

4177
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,390
system second do you think there's life
in the galaxy and uh

4178
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,400
in the galaxy and uh
 

4179
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,910
in the galaxy and uh
third do you think there's intelligent

4180
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:23,920
third do you think there's intelligent
 

4181
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,229
third do you think there's intelligent
life in the solar system or the galaxy

4182
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
life in the solar system or the galaxy
 

4183
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,750
life in the solar system or the galaxy
outside of earth

4184
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:27,760
outside of earth
 

4185
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,229
outside of earth
so intelligent life i have no idea it

4186
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:30,239
so intelligent life i have no idea it
 

4187
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:31,830
so intelligent life i have no idea it
seems deeply unlikely

4188
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:31,840
seems deeply unlikely
 

4189
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,149
seems deeply unlikely
uh possible but i'm not even sure if

4190
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,159
uh possible but i'm not even sure if
 

4191
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,189
uh possible but i'm not even sure if
it's plausible

4192
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:35,199
it's plausible
 

4193
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,709
it's plausible
so that's the special thing to you about

4194
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:36,719
so that's the special thing to you about
 

4195
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,390
so that's the special thing to you about
earth is somehow intelligent life came

4196
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,400
earth is somehow intelligent life came
 

4197
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:38,870
earth is somehow intelligent life came
yes

4198
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:38,880
yes
 

4199
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,350
yes
and it's only you know very briefly

4200
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:41,360
and it's only you know very briefly
 

4201
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,070
and it's only you know very briefly
probably

4202
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:42,080
probably
 

4203
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,149
probably
extremely briefly uh oh you mean like

4204
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:46,159
extremely briefly uh oh you mean like
 

4205
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,430
extremely briefly uh oh you mean like
it's always going to be like we're going

4206
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
it's always going to be like we're going
 

4207
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,750
it's always going to be like we're going
to destroy ourselves exactly oh boy

4208
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:49,760
to destroy ourselves exactly oh boy
 

4209
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,149
to destroy ourselves exactly oh boy
and life will continue on earth happily

4210
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
and life will continue on earth happily
 

4211
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,229
and life will continue on earth happily
uh probably more happily um

4212
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:54,239
uh probably more happily um
 

4213
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,910
uh probably more happily um
so trees and the dolphins will be here

4214
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:55,920
so trees and the dolphins will be here
 

4215
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,910
so trees and the dolphins will be here
i'm telling you and the cockroaches and

4216
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:57,920
i'm telling you and the cockroaches and
 

4217
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,630
i'm telling you and the cockroaches and

the
 

4219
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,270
the
incredible fungi you know they'll be

4220
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,280
incredible fungi you know they'll be
 

4221
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:01,990
incredible fungi you know they'll be
fine

4222
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:02,000
fine
 

4223
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,870
fine
uh so life on earth will be fine it was

4224
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:04,880
uh so life on earth will be fine it was
 

4225
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,830
uh so life on earth will be fine it was
fine before us and will be fined after

4226
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:06,840
fine before us and will be fined after
 

4227
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,189
fine before us and will be fined after
us so i'm not that worried

4228
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:09,199
us so i'm not that worried
 

4229
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,189
us so i'm not that worried
about intelligent life but i think it is

4230
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:11,199
about intelligent life but i think it is
 

4231
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,709
about intelligent life but i think it is
unlikely even on earth

4232
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:12,719
unlikely even on earth
 

4233
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,870
unlikely even on earth
is unlikely out of what is it five

4234
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
is unlikely out of what is it five
 

4235
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,310
is unlikely out of what is it five
billion species across the history of

4236
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,320
billion species across the history of
 

4237
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,750
billion species across the history of
the earth yes

4238
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:17,760
the earth yes
 

4239
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,830
the earth yes
there's been one an intelligent one and

4240
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:19,840
there's been one an intelligent one and
 

4241
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,430
there's been one an intelligent one and
for a blink of an eye

4242
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:21,440
for a blink of an eye
 

4243
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,790
for a blink of an eye
possibly not much longer than that so i

4244
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
possibly not much longer than that so i
 

4245
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,430
possibly not much longer than that so i
i wouldn't bet on that at all though i

4246
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:27,440
i wouldn't bet on that at all though i
 

4247
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,630
i wouldn't bet on that at all though i
would love it of course

4248
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:28,640
would love it of course
 

4249
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,149
would love it of course
you know i i wanted to

4250
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
you know i i wanted to
 

4251
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,470
you know i i wanted to
find aliens since i was a little girl

4252
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:34,480
find aliens since i was a little girl
 

4253
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,270
find aliens since i was a little girl
and so of course i

4254
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
and so of course i
 

4255
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,870
and so of course i
initially wanted to find ones that i

4256
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
initially wanted to find ones that i
 

4257
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,550
initially wanted to find ones that i
could be friends with

4258
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
could be friends with
 

4259
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,229
could be friends with
and i've had to let go of that dream

4260
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
and i've had to let go of that dream
 

4261
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,070
and i've had to let go of that dream
because it's so deeply implausible

4262
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:44,080
because it's so deeply implausible
 

4263
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,750
because it's so deeply implausible
but see the nice and sorry to interrupt

4264
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:45,760
but see the nice and sorry to interrupt
 

4265
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,350
but see the nice and sorry to interrupt
but the nice thing about intelligent

4266
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
but the nice thing about intelligent
 

4267
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,790
but the nice thing about intelligent
alien civilizations

4268
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:48,800
alien civilizations
 

4269
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,790
alien civilizations
they may have more biosignatures than

4270
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
they may have more biosignatures than
 

4271
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,310
they may have more biosignatures than
non-intelligent ones

4272
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:52,320
non-intelligent ones
 

4273
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,030
non-intelligent ones
so they might be easier to detect that

4274
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:55,040
so they might be easier to detect that
 

4275
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,070
so they might be easier to detect that
would be the hope

4276
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
would be the hope
 

4277
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,510
would be the hope
on earth that's not the case but it

4278
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:57,520
on earth that's not the case but it
 

4279
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,270
on earth that's not the case but it
could be the case elsewhere oh it's not

4280
01:12:59,270 --> 01:12:59,280
could be the case elsewhere oh it's not
 

4281
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,229
could be the case elsewhere oh it's not
the case on earth

4282
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:00,239
the case on earth
 

4283
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:01,750
the case on earth
most of the biosignatures we have on

4284
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:01,760
most of the biosignatures we have on
 

4285
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,830
most of the biosignatures we have on
earth are created by quite simple life

4286
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:05,840
earth are created by quite simple life
 

4287
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,510
earth are created by quite simple life
if you don't count pollution pollution

4288
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
if you don't count pollution pollution
 

4289
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,030
if you don't count pollution pollution
is all well

4290
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:11,040

 

4291
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,070

so you don't see uh polluting gases

4292
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:14,080
so you don't see uh polluting gases
 

4293
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:17,510
so you don't see uh polluting gases
as a as a possible like i look for

4294
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:17,520
as a as a possible like i look for
 

4295
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,470
as a as a possible like i look for
polluting gases

4296
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:18,480
polluting gases
 

4297
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,870
polluting gases
i would love to find polluting gases

4298
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:20,880
i would love to find polluting gases
 

4299
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,830
i would love to find polluting gases
well you know

4300
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
well you know
 

4301
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,910
well you know
i'd be worried for them of course the

4302
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:23,920
i'd be worried for them of course the
 

4303
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,270
i'd be worried for them of course the
same way i

4304
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,280
same way i
 

4305
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,189
same way i
i think about my alien colleagues all

4306
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
i think about my alien colleagues all
 

4307
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,790
i think about my alien colleagues all
the time looking at us and i'm sure they

4308
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:28,800
the time looking at us and i'm sure they
 

4309
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,470
the time looking at us and i'm sure they
worry about our pollutions

4310
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:30,480
worry about our pollutions
 

4311
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,390
worry about our pollutions
but it would be a really good robust

4312
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:34,400
but it would be a really good robust
 

4313
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,630
but it would be a really good robust
unambiguous sign of life if we found

4314
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,640
unambiguous sign of life if we found
 

4315
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,910
unambiguous sign of life if we found
complex pollutants

4316
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
complex pollutants
 

4317
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,830
complex pollutants
so i look for those too i just don't

4318
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:39,840
so i look for those too i just don't
 

4319
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,510
so i look for those too i just don't
have any hope of finding them i think

4320
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
have any hope of finding them i think
 

4321
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,550
have any hope of finding them i think
intelligent life in the galaxy at the

4322
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:44,560
intelligent life in the galaxy at the
 

4323
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,550
intelligent life in the galaxy at the
same time that we're looking

4324
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560
same time that we're looking
 

4325
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,149
same time that we're looking
is deeply implausible but life

4326
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:50,159
is deeply implausible but life
 

4327
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,510
is deeply implausible but life
i think is inevitable and if it is

4328
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:53,520
i think is inevitable and if it is
 

4329
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,390
i think is inevitable and if it is
inevitable

4330
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:54,400
inevitable
 

4331
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,870
inevitable
it is common so i think there will be

4332
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:56,880
it is common so i think there will be
 

4333
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,830
it is common so i think there will be
life

4334
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
life
 

4335
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,870
life
everywhere in the galaxy now how common

4336
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:00,880
everywhere in the galaxy now how common
 

4337
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,990
everywhere in the galaxy now how common
that life is

4338
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
that life is
 

4339
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,070
that life is
i think will depend a lot on whether

4340
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
i think will depend a lot on whether
 

4341
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,830
i think will depend a lot on whether
there's life in the solar system beyond

4342
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
there's life in the solar system beyond
 

4343
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,870
there's life in the solar system beyond
earth

4344
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:06,880
earth
 

4345
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,430
earth
so i'll adjust my expectations very much

4346
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:09,440
so i'll adjust my expectations very much
 

4347
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,149
so i'll adjust my expectations very much
based

4349
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:13,030
based
on there being life in the solar system

01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
on there being life in the solar system
 

4351
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,070
on there being life in the solar system
if there's life in the venusian clouds

4352
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:16,080
if there's life in the venusian clouds

enceladus
 

4359
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,910
enceladus
if there's life on titan oh yeah that's

4360
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:23,920
if there's life on titan oh yeah that's
 

4361
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,990
if there's life on titan oh yeah that's
right and yeah yeah plumes of enceladus

4362
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:26,000
right and yeah yeah plumes of enceladus
 

4363
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,870
right and yeah yeah plumes of enceladus
that's the um

4364
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:26,880
that's the um
 

4365
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,870
that's the um
that's the saturn one it's the moon that

4366
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:28,880
that's the saturn one it's the moon that
 

4367
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,630
that's the saturn one it's the moon that
has the geysers that come out and so you

4368
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:30,640
has the geysers that come out and so you
 

4369
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,510
has the geysers that come out and so you
can't see the

4370
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,520
can't see the
 

4371
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,149
can't see the
under the subterranean oceans but it's

4372
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:34,159
under the subterranean oceans but it's
 

4373
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:34,870
under the subterranean oceans but it's
supposed to

4374
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:34,880
supposed to
 

4375
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,550
supposed to
it's so it would be in the atmosphere i

4376
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,560
it's so it would be in the atmosphere i
 

4377
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,149
it's so it would be in the atmosphere i
was gonna ask you about that one

4378
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
was gonna ask you about that one
 

4379
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,709
was gonna ask you about that one
uh have you looked at that uh have you

4380
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:40,719
uh have you looked at that uh have you
 

4381
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,070
uh have you looked at that uh have you
is is that a hope

4382
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
is is that a hope
 

4383
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,310
is is that a hope
for you to use the tools you're using

4384
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:44,320
for you to use the tools you're using
 

4385
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,229
for you to use the tools you're using
with rascal

4386
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:46,239
with rascal
 

4387
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:50,550
with rascal
uh and other ways for detecting the 16

4388
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:50,560
uh and other ways for detecting the 16
 

4389
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,870
uh and other ways for detecting the 16
000

4390
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:52,880
000
 

4391
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,189
000
molecules that might be biosignatures to

4392
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:55,199
molecules that might be biosignatures to
 

4393
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,630
molecules that might be biosignatures to
look at enceladus

4394
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
look at enceladus
 

4395
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,270
look at enceladus
yes that's absolutely the plan is that

4396
01:14:59,270 --> 01:14:59,280
yes that's absolutely the plan is that
 

4397
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,790
yes that's absolutely the plan is that
what's that what's the limiting factor

4398
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:00,800
what's that what's the limiting factor
 

4399
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,229
what's that what's the limiting factor
in currently is it the

4400
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:02,239
in currently is it the
 

4401
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,550
in currently is it the
the quality of the telescopes is what's

4402
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:04,560
the quality of the telescopes is what's
 

4403
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,350
the quality of the telescopes is what's
the what the the

4404
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
the what the the
 

4405
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,070
the what the the
the quality of the data yeah the quality

4406
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
the quality of the data yeah the quality
 

4407
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,750
the quality of the data yeah the quality
of the data the observational data and

4408
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
of the data the observational data and
 

4409
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:09,990
of the data the observational data and
also

4410
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:10,000
also
 

4411
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,470
also
the quality of rascal and other

4412
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:12,480
the quality of rascal and other
 

4413
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,149
the quality of rascal and other
associated things so we're missing a lot

4414
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:14,159
associated things so we're missing a lot
 

4415
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:15,750
associated things so we're missing a lot
of fundamental data to interpret the

4416
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:15,760
of fundamental data to interpret the
 

4417
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,630
of fundamental data to interpret the
data that we get

4418
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:16,640
data that we get
 

4419
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,189
data that we get
and we don't have good enough data but

4420
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
and we don't have good enough data but
 

4421
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,630
and we don't have good enough data but
hopefully we will

4422
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:20,640
hopefully we will
 

4423
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,510
hopefully we will
in the coming decades we'll get some

4424
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:23,520
in the coming decades we'll get some
 

4425
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:23,990
in the coming decades we'll get some
information

4426
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,000
information
 

4427
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,270
information
on titan we have dragonfly going over

4428
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:27,280
on titan we have dragonfly going over
 

4429
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,189
on titan we have dragonfly going over
uh we'll get the plumes of enceladus

4430
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
uh we'll get the plumes of enceladus
 

4431
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,950
uh we'll get the plumes of enceladus
we will look at the clouds of venus and

4432
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:32,960
we will look at the clouds of venus and
 

4433
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,630
we will look at the clouds of venus and
there's other places and so

4434
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:34,640
there's other places and so
 

4435
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,149
there's other places and so
if we find any life or any sign of life

4436
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:38,159
if we find any life or any sign of life
 

4437
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,830
if we find any life or any sign of life
ever like on mars then i'll adjust my

4438
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:41,840
ever like on mars then i'll adjust my
 

4439
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,870
ever like on mars then i'll adjust my
calculations

4440
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:42,880
calculations
 

4441
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,669
calculations
and i'll say life is not just inevitable

4442
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
and i'll say life is not just inevitable
 

4443
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:46,550
and i'll say life is not just inevitable
and common

4444
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:46,560
and common
 

4445
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,790
and common
but extremely common because all of

4446
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:48,800
but extremely common because all of
 

4447
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,149
but extremely common because all of
these places we've mentioned the

4448
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:50,159
these places we've mentioned the
 

4449
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,709
these places we've mentioned the
subterranean oceans on enceladus the

4450
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:52,719
subterranean oceans on enceladus the
 

4451
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,590
subterranean oceans on enceladus the
methane oceans of titan the clouds of

4452
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
methane oceans of titan the clouds of
 

4453
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,510
methane oceans of titan the clouds of
venus the acidic clouds of venus

4454
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:57,520
venus the acidic clouds of venus
 

4455
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,590
venus the acidic clouds of venus
these are places that are very different

4456
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
these are places that are very different
 

4457
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,430
these are places that are very different
from the places where we find life on

4458
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:01,440
from the places where we find life on
 

4459
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:01,990
from the places where we find life on
earth

4460
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
earth
 

4461
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,390
earth
even the most extreme places and so if

4462
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:04,400
even the most extreme places and so if
 

4463
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,390
even the most extreme places and so if
life can originate in all of these

4464
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:06,400
life can originate in all of these
 

4465
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,510
life can originate in all of these
completely different habitats then life

4466
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:09,520
completely different habitats then life
 

4467
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:09,990
completely different habitats then life
is

4468
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,000
is
 

4469
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,630
is
even more resourceful than we thought

4470
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:12,640
even more resourceful than we thought
 

4471
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,590
even more resourceful than we thought
yeah that's really

4472
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:13,600
yeah that's really
 

4473
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,910
yeah that's really
everywhere that's really exciting if

4474
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:15,920
everywhere that's really exciting if
 

4475
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:16,790
everywhere that's really exciting if
it's everywhere

4476
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:16,800
it's everywhere
 

4477
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,270
it's everywhere
if if there's life on just one one of

4478
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:19,280
if if there's life on just one one of
 

4479
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,149
if if there's life on just one one of
the moons

4480
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
the moons
 

4481
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,229
the moons
if it's on mars anywhere anywhere in the

4482
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
if it's on mars anywhere anywhere in the
 

4483
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,149
if it's on mars anywhere anywhere in the
solar system and i will

4484
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
solar system and i will
 

4485
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,390
solar system and i will
bet everything i own that every solar

4486
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
bet everything i own that every solar
 

4487
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,030
bet everything i own that every solar
system every planetary system has

4488
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:29,040
system every planetary system has
 

4489
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,030
system every planetary system has
a potential for habitability you know

4490
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,040
a potential for habitability you know
 

4491
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,149
a potential for habitability you know
because even if they don't have a

4492
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:32,159
because even if they don't have a
 

4493
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,070
because even if they don't have a
habitable planet they'll have moons

4494
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
habitable planet they'll have moons
 

4495
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,270
habitable planet they'll have moons
around other giant planets and

4496
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
around other giant planets and
 

4497
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,910
around other giant planets and
there'll be so much life so for me

4498
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:39,920
there'll be so much life so for me
 

4499
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,390
there'll be so much life so for me
that's

4500
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:40,400
that's
 

4501
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,270
that's
the only thing to figure out now whether

4502
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:43,280
the only thing to figure out now whether
 

4503
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:43,910
the only thing to figure out now whether
life is

4504
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920
life is
 

4505
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,750
life is
inevitable and quite common throughout

4506
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
inevitable and quite common throughout
 

4507
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,990
inevitable and quite common throughout
the galaxy or

4508
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
the galaxy or
 

4509
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,390
the galaxy or
everywhere but it's somewhere between

4510
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:50,400
everywhere but it's somewhere between
 

4511
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,350
everywhere but it's somewhere between
those two

4512
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,360
those two
 

4513
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,709
those two
intelligent life i make no bets and if i

4514
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:54,719
intelligent life i make no bets and if i
 

4515
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,990
intelligent life i make no bets and if i
had to bet i would be against

4516
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,000
had to bet i would be against
 

4517
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,030
had to bet i would be against
yeah to me like two discoveries in the

4518
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
yeah to me like two discoveries in the
 

4519
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,070
yeah to me like two discoveries in the
21st century

4520
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:02,080
21st century
 

4521
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,910
21st century
would change everything one

4522
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:05,920
would change everything one
 

4523
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,350
would change everything one
is and maybe i'm biased but

4524
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,360
is and maybe i'm biased but
 

4525
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,510
is and maybe i'm biased but
one is a discovery of life in the solar

4526
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:11,520
one is a discovery of life in the solar
 

4527
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,709
one is a discovery of life in the solar
system

4528
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:12,719
system
 

4529
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,870
system
i feel like that would change our whole

4530
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:14,880
i feel like that would change our whole
 

4531
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,390
i feel like that would change our whole
conception of

4532
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:16,400
conception of
 

4533
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,110
conception of
how unique we are in the universe i i

4534
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:19,120
how unique we are in the universe i i
 

4535
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,870
how unique we are in the universe i i
think i'm much more eager than you are

4536
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:20,880
think i'm much more eager than you are
 

4537
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,990
think i'm much more eager than you are
to jump from

4538
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,000
to jump from
 

4539
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,750
to jump from
basic life to intelligent life i feel

4540
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:23,760
basic life to intelligent life i feel
 

4541
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,030
basic life to intelligent life i feel
like if there's life

4542
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,040
like if there's life
 

4543
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,790
like if there's life

would you be disappointed
 

4573
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,430
would you be disappointed
if you found alien giraffes because i

giraffes
 

4601
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,950
giraffes
i think it was like ricky gervais that

4602
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:20,960
i think it was like ricky gervais that
 

4603
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,510
i think it was like ricky gervais that
did a whole like a long thing about

did a whole like a long thing about
 

4605
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,189
did a whole like a long thing about
your face to talk about giraffes that is

4606
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:25,199
your face to talk about giraffes that is
 

4607
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,910
your face to talk about giraffes that is
not its expertise

4608
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:27,920
not its expertise
 

4609
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,830
not its expertise
yeah but it's a stupid necks it doesn't

4610
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:29,840
yeah but it's a stupid necks it doesn't
 

4611
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,510
yeah but it's a stupid necks it doesn't
make any sense

make any sense
 

4613
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,510

i mean giraffes are very resourceful

4614
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:33,520
i mean giraffes are very resourceful
 

4615
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,910

really
 

4639
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,750
really
fascinating and i think the earth but

is where we create yeah

4644
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:04,640
is where we create yeah
 

4645
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,510
is where we create yeah
we create things that are yes there's

4646
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
we create things that are yes there's
 

4647
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,189
we create things that are yes there's
all the ugliness in the world

4648
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:09,199
all the ugliness in the world
 

4649
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,510
all the ugliness in the world
there's all the on the on the biological

4650
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,520
there's all the on the on the biological
 

4651
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,630
there's all the on the on the biological
and the chemical level there's the

4652
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:12,640
and the chemical level there's the
 

4653
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,590
and the chemical level there's the
pollution

4654
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
pollution
 

4655
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,110
pollution
but we create

4656
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:17,120
but we create
 

4657
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,990
but we create
beauty if you if you even from a physics

4658
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:20,000
beauty if you if you even from a physics
 

4659
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,990
beauty if you if you even from a physics
perspective look at symmetry

4660
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:22,000
perspective look at symmetry
 

4661
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,149
perspective look at symmetry
as somehow capturing beauty the breaking

4662
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
as somehow capturing beauty the breaking
 

4663
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,070
as somehow capturing beauty the breaking
of symmetries stuff grounded in all the

4664
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:26,080
of symmetries stuff grounded in all the
 

4665
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,070
of symmetries stuff grounded in all the
different definitions of symmetry

4666
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
different definitions of symmetry
 

4667
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,350
different definitions of symmetry
we're good at like creating things

4668
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:31,360
we're good at like creating things
 

4669
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,790
we're good at like creating things
so as fighters

4670
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:34,800

 

4671
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,110

but not giraffes okay but yes this is a

4672
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,120
but not giraffes okay but yes this is a
 

4673
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,990
but not giraffes okay but yes this is a
spider

4674
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:38,000
spider
 

4675
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,990
spider
yes there are spiders that crystals

4676
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,000
yes there are spiders that crystals
 

4677
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,669
yes there are spiders that crystals
bubbles of air so they can breathe

4678
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:41,679
bubbles of air so they can breathe
 

4679
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:42,950
bubbles of air so they can breathe
underwater they can

4680
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:42,960
underwater they can
 

4681
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,189
underwater they can
literally scuba dive there are spiders

4682
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:45,199
literally scuba dive there are spiders
 

4683
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:45,990
literally scuba dive there are spiders
that can create

4684
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:46,000
that can create
 

4685
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,870
that can create
parachutes so they can glide and talk

4686
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
parachutes so they can glide and talk
 

4687
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,350
parachutes so they can glide and talk
about symmetry look what spiders can do

4688
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:51,360
about symmetry look what spiders can do
 

4689
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,149
about symmetry look what spiders can do
and i just thought of spiders but if i

4690
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:54,159
and i just thought of spiders but if i
 

4691
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,430
and i just thought of spiders but if i
was an alien species

4692
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:55,440
was an alien species
 

4693
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,750
was an alien species
coming to earth there'll be plenty to

4694
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:57,760
coming to earth there'll be plenty to
 

4695
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,830
coming to earth there'll be plenty to
wander and we would just be

4696
01:19:59,830 --> 01:19:59,840
wander and we would just be
 

4697
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,669
wander and we would just be
one one of the things yeah clunky

4698
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:03,679
one one of the things yeah clunky
 

4699
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,310
one one of the things yeah clunky
yeah naked monkey yeah the ants might be

4700
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:06,320
yeah naked monkey yeah the ants might be
 

4701
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,590
yeah naked monkey yeah the ants might be
even more fascinating

4702
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
even more fascinating
 

4703
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,550
even more fascinating
the ants ants can figure out exactly

just from without any of them knowing
how to do this and collectively they've

how to do this and collectively they've
 

4717
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,790
how to do this and collectively they've
learned how to do this

4718
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:24,800
learned how to do this
 

4719
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,310
learned how to do this
if i was an alien species i'll be

4720
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
if i was an alien species i'll be
 

4721
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,149
if i was an alien species i'll be
looking at that well so that was the

4722
01:20:28,149 --> 01:20:28,159
looking at that well so that was the
 

4723
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:29,270
looking at that well so that was the
other thing i was going to mention the

4724
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280
other thing i was going to mention the
 

4725
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,149
other thing i was going to mention the
second thing

4726
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:30,159
second thing
 

4727
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,629
second thing
is i tend to believe we can engineer

4728
01:20:32,629 --> 01:20:32,639
is i tend to believe we can engineer
 

4729
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:33,590
is i tend to believe we can engineer
consciousness

4730
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
consciousness
 

4731
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,910
consciousness
but at the at the basic level understand

4732
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
but at the at the basic level understand
 

4733
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,669
but at the at the basic level understand
the source of consciousness

4734
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:37,679
the source of consciousness
 

4735
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,430
the source of consciousness
because if consciousness is unique to

4736
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:41,440
because if consciousness is unique to
 

4737
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,229
because if consciousness is unique to
humans

4738
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:42,239
humans
 

4739
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,709
humans
and if we can engineer it that gives me

4740
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:44,719
and if we can engineer it that gives me
 

4741
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:45,430
and if we can engineer it that gives me
hope that

4742
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:45,440
hope that
 

4743
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,950
hope that
it could be present elsewhere in the

4744
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:46,960
it could be present elsewhere in the
 

4745
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,390
it could be present elsewhere in the
universe that's the other thing that

4746
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
universe that's the other thing that
 

4747
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,669
universe that's the other thing that
makes

4748
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:49,679
makes
 

4749
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,990
makes
it's an open question that makes humans

4750
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
it's an open question that makes humans
 

4751
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,590
it's an open question that makes humans
perhaps special

4752
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,600
perhaps special
 

4753
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,270
perhaps special
is not maybe the presence of

4754
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:55,280
is not maybe the presence of
 

4755
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,189
is not maybe the presence of
consciousness but some kind

4756
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:57,199
consciousness but some kind
 

4757
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,430
consciousness but some kind
somehow a presence of like elevated

01:20:59,430 --> 01:20:59,440
somehow a presence of like elevated
 

4759
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,030
somehow a presence of like elevated
consciousness it does

01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,040
consciousness it does
 

4761
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,950
consciousness it does
again maybe human-centric but it feels

4762
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:02,960
again maybe human-centric but it feels
 

4763
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,629
again maybe human-centric but it feels
like we're more conscious than giraffes

4764
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:04,639
like we're more conscious than giraffes
 

4765
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,790
like we're more conscious than giraffes
for example in spiders

4766
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:06,800
for example in spiders
 

4767
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,030
for example in spiders
yes i won't deny that i i there is

4768
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,040
yes i won't deny that i i there is
 

4769
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,470
yes i won't deny that i i there is
something special about humans i

4770
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:10,480
something special about humans i
 

4771
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,030
something special about humans i
you know they're my favorite species

4772
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:13,040
you know they're my favorite species
 

4773
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:13,990
you know they're my favorite species
they are

4774
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,000
they are
 

4775
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,030
they are
they are you know some of my best

4776
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
they are you know some of my best
 

4777
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,310
they are you know some of my best
friends are humans

4778
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:18,320
friends are humans
 

4779
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,590
friends are humans
and i

4780
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:21,600
and i
 

4781
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,229
and i
i i think highly of humans it's it's

4782
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:24,239
i i think highly of humans it's it's
 

4783
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:24,790
i i think highly of humans it's it's
great

4784
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:24,800
great
 

4785
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,149
great
i just don't have great hope for our

4786
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:28,159
i just don't have great hope for our
 

4787
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,110
i just don't have great hope for our
longevity

4788
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:29,120
longevity
 

4789
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,870
longevity
and specifically i don't have great hope

4790
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:30,880
and specifically i don't have great hope
 

4791
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,390
and specifically i don't have great hope
given that we're the only species that

4792
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
given that we're the only species that
 

4793
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,990
given that we're the only species that
are five billion that did this cool

4794
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000
are five billion that did this cool
 

4795
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,590
are five billion that did this cool
consciousness trick

4796
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:35,600
consciousness trick
 

4797
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,350
consciousness trick
i just i don't want to bet on finding um

4798
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,360
i just i don't want to bet on finding um
 

4799
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,470
i just i don't want to bet on finding um
a kinship elsewhere that's quite

4800
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:42,480
a kinship elsewhere that's quite
 

4801
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,910
a kinship elsewhere that's quite
interesting to think about

4802
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:43,920
interesting to think about
 

4803
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,910
interesting to think about
i don't think i've even considered that

4804
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:45,920
i don't think i've even considered that
 

4805
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,590
i don't think i've even considered that
possibility

4806
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:47,600
possibility
 

4807
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,750
possibility
that the that there would be life in the

4808
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:49,760
that the that there would be life in the
 

4809
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,510
that the that there would be life in the
solar system

4810
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:51,520
solar system
 

4811
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,709
solar system
so that indicates that very possibly

4812
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:54,719
so that indicates that very possibly
 

4813
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:55,510
so that indicates that very possibly
life is

4814
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
life is
 

4815
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,110
life is
like literally everywhere yeah

4816
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,120
like literally everywhere yeah
 

4817
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,709
like literally everywhere yeah
everywhere it can happen it does

4818
01:21:58,709 --> 01:21:58,719
everywhere it can happen it does
 

4819
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,870
everywhere it can happen it does
yeah you know and like especially what

4820
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:00,880
yeah you know and like especially what
 

4821
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,790
yeah you know and like especially what
we're discovering with the exoplanets

4822
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:02,800
we're discovering with the exoplanets
 

4823
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,669
we're discovering with the exoplanets
now

4824
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
now
 

4825
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:06,229
now
uh they're how numerous they are or

4826
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:06,239
uh they're how numerous they are or
 

4827
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,590
uh they're how numerous they are or
earth-like

4828
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:07,600
earth-like
 

4829
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,870
earth-like
habitable quote-unquote planets there's

4830
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:10,880
habitable quote-unquote planets there's
 

4831
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,709
habitable quote-unquote planets there's
like they're everywhere the most common

4832
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:12,719
like they're everywhere the most common
 

4833
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:13,990
like they're everywhere the most common
type of planet is

01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:14,000
type of planet is
 

4835
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,870
type of planet is
rocky it seems yeah so but i didn't

4836
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
rocky it seems yeah so but i didn't
 

4837
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,950
rocky it seems yeah so but i didn't
consider the possibility that life is

4838
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:18,960
consider the possibility that life is
 

4839
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,350
consider the possibility that life is
like literally everywhere and yet

4840
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:21,360
like literally everywhere and yet

4843
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,990
intelligent life
is nowhere long enough

01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,000
is nowhere long enough
 

4845
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,070
is nowhere long enough
to uh to communicate with each other to

to uh to communicate with each other to
 

4847
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,830
to uh to communicate with each other to
form little clusters

4848

form little clusters
 

4849
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,149

this journey that star takes
and the planets around it well when i

4966
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:43,440
and the planets around it well when i
 

4967
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,110
and the planets around it well when i
was younger and i was told what would

01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:49,199
chance for life
 

5033
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,830
chance for life
but then i thought what if life returns

5034
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:51,840
but then i thought what if life returns
 

5035
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,510
but then i thought what if life returns
you know now it's a white dwarf it's

5036
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:53,520
you know now it's a white dwarf it's
 

5037
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,709
you know now it's a white dwarf it's
calmed down it's not going to go

5038
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:54,719
calmed down it's not going to go
 

5039
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,590
calmed down it's not going to go
anywhere white dwarfs are very stable

5040
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:57,600
anywhere white dwarfs are very stable
 

5041
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,990
anywhere white dwarfs are very stable
across like universal time scales and so

5042
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:00,000
across like universal time scales and so
 

5043
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,950
across like universal time scales and so
could you

5044
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:00,960
could you
 

5045
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,189
could you
have planets around a white dwarf that

5046
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:03,199
have planets around a white dwarf that
 

5047
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,149
have planets around a white dwarf that
could themselves

5048
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:04,159
could themselves
 

5049
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,709
could themselves
get life again you know life doesn't

5050
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:06,719
get life again you know life doesn't
 

5051
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:07,750
get life again you know life doesn't
care

5052
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:07,760
care
 

5053
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:12,229
care
and so my work was basically killing

5054
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:12,239
and so my work was basically killing
 

5055
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,470
and so my work was basically killing
dozens of planets thousands of times i

5056
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:14,480
dozens of planets thousands of times i
 

5057
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,149
dozens of planets thousands of times i
just ran

5058
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:16,159
just ran
 

5059
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,750
just ran
thousands and thousands of n-body

5060
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:17,760
thousands and thousands of n-body
 

5061
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,830
thousands and thousands of n-body
simulations well you simulated this yeah

5062
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:19,840
simulations well you simulated this yeah
 

5063
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,149
simulations well you simulated this yeah
so i

5064
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:20,159
so i
 

5065
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,950
so i
simulated the star wow growing and just

5066
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
simulated the star wow growing and just
 

5067
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:23,430
simulated the star wow growing and just
eating

5068
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:23,440
eating
 

5069
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,590
eating
all these planets up and just absolute

01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:25,600
all these planets up and just absolute
 

5071
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,790
all these planets up and just absolute
chaos and

01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:26,800
chaos and
 

5073
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,629
chaos and
the orbits of the planets would change

5074
01:26:28,629 --> 01:26:28,639
the orbits of the planets would change
 

5075
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,470
the orbits of the planets would change
as the star loses mass so you would have

5076
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:30,480
as the star loses mass so you would have
 

5077
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,510
as the star loses mass so you would have
like

5078
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,520
like
 

5079
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,590
like
jupiter plant like planets just crashing

5080
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
jupiter plant like planets just crashing
 

5081
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,950
jupiter plant like planets just crashing
into the other planets throwing them

5082
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960
into the other planets throwing them
 

5083
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:35,830
into the other planets throwing them
into the sun

5084
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:35,840
into the sun
 

5085
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,669
into the sun
early it was terrifying to watch these

5086
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679
early it was terrifying to watch these
 

5087
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,310
early it was terrifying to watch these
simulations it was

5088
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,320
simulations it was
 

5089
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,590
simulations it was
absolute carnage but if you run

5090
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,600
absolute carnage but if you run
 

5091
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,430
absolute carnage but if you run
thousands of these simulations

5092
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:47,440
thousands of these simulations

01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,910
thousands of these simulations
some systems find new balance ways of

post star death find stable orbits again

5100
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:57,920
post star death find stable orbits again
 

5101
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,669
post star death find stable orbits again
for billions of years more than enough

5102
01:26:59,669 --> 01:26:59,679
for billions of years more than enough
 

5103
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,669
for billions of years more than enough
for life to originate again

5104
01:27:01,669 --> 01:27:01,679
for life to originate again
 

5105
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,870
for life to originate again
and so that was my idea during that time

5106
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:04,880
and so that was my idea during that time
 

5107
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,709
and so that was my idea during that time
that thesis was trying to explore

5108
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719

 

5109
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,830

this notion of life coming back

5110
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:11,840
this notion of life coming back
 

5111
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,510
this notion of life coming back
and this idea of the universe doesn't

5112
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:15,520
and this idea of the universe doesn't
 

5113
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,189
and this idea of the universe doesn't
care if you're here or not

5114
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
care if you're here or not
 

5115
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:18,790
care if you're here or not
and it will go about its business you

5116
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:18,800
and it will go about its business you
 

5117
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,149
and it will go about its business you
know andromeda will crash into us and

5118
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:22,159
know andromeda will crash into us and
 

5119
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,310
know andromeda will crash into us and
doesn't care no one cares if you're

5120
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
doesn't care no one cares if you're
 

5121
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,870
doesn't care no one cares if you're
alive in the universe and so

5122
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
alive in the universe and so
 

5123
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,510
alive in the universe and so
letting go of that preciousness of life

5124
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
letting go of that preciousness of life
 

5125
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,189
letting go of that preciousness of life
i found very useful at that stage in my

5126
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
i found very useful at that stage in my
 

5127
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:31,750
i found very useful at that stage in my
career

5128
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:31,760
career
 

5129
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,709
career
and instead i just thought what if if

5130
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:34,719
and instead i just thought what if if
 

5131
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,149
and instead i just thought what if if
life is inevitable

5132
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:36,159
life is inevitable
 

5133
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,229
life is inevitable
it doesn't matter that it came by four

5134
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:38,239
it doesn't matter that it came by four
 

5135
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:39,669
it doesn't matter that it came by four
billion years ago it can start again

5136
01:27:39,669 --> 01:27:39,679
billion years ago it can start again
 

5137
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,350
billion years ago it can start again
four billion years later

5138

four billion years later
 

5139
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,390
four billion years later
and maybe that is nice maybe that's

5140
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:44,400
and maybe that is nice maybe that's
 

5141
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,229
and maybe that is nice maybe that's
where hope lies the

5149
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,229

so accepting the cycle of death and life

5154
01:27:59,669 --> 01:27:59,679
so accepting the cycle of death and life
 

5155
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:01,430
so accepting the cycle of death and life
and

and
 

5157
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,669

uh yeah i'm not taking it personally i'm

5158
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:03,679
uh yeah i'm not taking it personally i'm

not taking her personally the son
doesn't owe us anything

01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:06,560
doesn't owe us anything

at all
 

5167
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,030
at all
yeah i was looking at the work of

5168
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:13,040
yeah i was looking at the work of
 

5169
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,870
yeah i was looking at the work of
freeman dyson and

5170
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:14,880
freeman dyson and
 

5171
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,910
freeman dyson and
seeing how it how this universe

seeing how it how this universe
 

5173
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,350
seeing how it how this universe
eventually will just be a bunch of

01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:19,360
eventually will just be a bunch of

01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,510
eventually will just be a bunch of

holes too
 

5181
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,350
holes too
yeah absolutely quiet everyone all the

5182
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:27,360
yeah absolutely quiet everyone all the
 

5183
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,790
yeah absolutely quiet everyone all the

until it's just silence forever

01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,910
until it's just silence forever
but until then many many cycles of death

5190
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:37,920
but until then many many cycles of death
 

5191
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:38,950

5195
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,990
and rebirth and rebirth
you kept bringing up sort of coding

5196
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
you kept bringing up sort of coding
 

5197
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,910
you kept bringing up sort of coding
stuff up i just i wanted to ask

5198
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:45,920
stuff up i just i wanted to ask
 

5199
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,390
stuff up i just i wanted to ask
uh two things first of all like what

5200
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:48,400
uh two things first of all like what
 

5201
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,390
uh two things first of all like what
what programming

5202
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:50,400
what programming
 

5203
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,990
what programming
uh language do you like and also

5204
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
uh language do you like and also
 

5205
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,030
uh language do you like and also
what um because you're

5206
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:57,040
what um because you're
 

5207
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,470
what um because you're
as a computational quantum

5208
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:00,480
as a computational quantum
 

5209
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,709
as a computational quantum
astrochemist no yes no that's correct

5210
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:02,719
astrochemist no yes no that's correct
 

5211
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:03,510
astrochemist no yes no that's correct
that's right

5212
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:03,520
that's right
 

5213
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,189
that's right
uh you're kind of um

5214
01:29:07,189 --> 01:29:07,199
uh you're kind of um
 

5215
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,669
uh you're kind of um
you could say you're you're actually

5216
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
you could say you're you're actually
 

5217
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:10,950
you could say you're you're actually
understanding some exceptionally

5218
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
understanding some exceptionally
 

5219
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,629
understanding some exceptionally
complicated things

5220
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:12,639
complicated things
 

5221
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,149
complicated things
with one of the things you're using is

5222
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:14,159
with one of the things you're using is
 

5223
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,910
with one of the things you're using is
the tools of uh

5224
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:15,920
the tools of uh
 

5225
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,310
the tools of uh
computation of programming is there a

5226
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:18,320
computation of programming is there a
 

5227
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,310
computation of programming is there a
device you can give to people

5228
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:20,320
device you can give to people
 

5229
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,430
device you can give to people
because i i know quite a few that have

5230
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:23,440
because i i know quite a few that have
 

5231
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,350
because i i know quite a few that have
not practiced that tool

5232
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:25,360
not practiced that tool
 

5233
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,470
not practiced that tool
and have fallen in love with a

5234
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:26,480
and have fallen in love with a
 

5235
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,750
and have fallen in love with a
particular science or whatever it's

5236
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:27,760
particular science or whatever it's
 

5237
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,510
particular science or whatever it's
biology and chemistry and physics and so

01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
biology and chemistry and physics and so
 

5239
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,390
biology and chemistry and physics and so

5241
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,510
on
and if they were interested in learning

5242
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
and if they were interested in learning
 

5243
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,709
and if they were interested in learning
to program

5244
01:29:34,709 --> 01:29:34,719
to program
 

5245
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,110
to program
and learning to use computation is a

5246
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,120
and learning to use computation is a
 

5247
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:37,750
and learning to use computation is a
tool in there

5248
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:37,760
tool in there
 

5249
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,070
tool in there
particular science is there advice you

5250
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,080
particular science is there advice you
 

5251
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,910
particular science is there advice you
can give on programming and also just

5252
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:41,920
can give on programming and also just
 

5253
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,390
can give on programming and also just
maybe

5254
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:42,400
maybe
 

5255
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,470
maybe
a comment on your own journey and the

5256
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:44,480
a comment on your own journey and the
 

5257
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,990
a comment on your own journey and the
use of

5258
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,000
use of
 

5259
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,430
use of
programming in your own life well i'm a

5260
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:49,440
programming in your own life well i'm a
 

5261
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,870
programming in your own life well i'm a
terrible programmer

5262
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:50,880
terrible programmer
 

5263
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,550
terrible programmer
a lot of scientists their programming is

5264
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:52,560
a lot of scientists their programming is
 

5265
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,070
a lot of scientists their programming is
bad because we never learned formal

5266
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:54,080
bad because we never learned formal
 

5267
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,189
bad because we never learned formal
programming

5268
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:55,199
programming
 

5269
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,990
programming
we learned science physics chemistry and

5270
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:58,000
we learned science physics chemistry and
 

5271
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:58,629
we learned science physics chemistry and
then

5272
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,639
then
 

5273
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,870
then
we were told oh you can you have to get

5274
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:00,880
we were told oh you can you have to get
 

5275
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,149
we were told oh you can you have to get
these equations modeled

5276
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:02,159
these equations modeled
 

5277
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,229
these equations modeled
and run through a simulation and you're

5278
01:30:04,229 --> 01:30:04,239
and run through a simulation and you're
 

5279
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:05,189
and run through a simulation and you're
like okay so

5280
01:30:05,189 --> 01:30:05,199
like okay so
 

5281
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,270
like okay so
i'm gonna learn how to code to do this

5282
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:07,280
i'm gonna learn how to code to do this
 

5283
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,470
i'm gonna learn how to code to do this
and you learn

5284
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:08,480
and you learn
 

5285
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,470
and you learn
just as much as you need to run these

5286
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
just as much as you need to run these
 

5287
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,830
just as much as you need to run these
simulations and no more

5288
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:11,840
simulations and no more
 

5289
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,310
simulations and no more
so they're rarely optimized and they're

5290
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,320
so they're rarely optimized and they're
 

5291
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,910
so they're rarely optimized and they're
really clunky six months later you can't

5292
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:15,920
really clunky six months later you can't
 

5293
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,110
really clunky six months later you can't
read your own code

5294
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:17,120
read your own code
 

5295
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,870
read your own code
my variable names are extremely

5296
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:18,880
my variable names are extremely
 

5297
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,390
my variable names are extremely
embarrassing i still have

5298
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:20,400
embarrassing i still have
 

5299
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,669
embarrassing i still have
error error messages for different

5300
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:23,679
error error messages for different
 

5301
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,629
error error messages for different
compilation errors i say things like

5302
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:26,639
compilation errors i say things like
 

5303
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,510
compilation errors i say things like
at least your dad loves you clara you

5304
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:29,520
at least your dad loves you clara you
 

5305
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:29,830
at least your dad loves you clara you
know

5306
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:29,840
know
 

5307
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,030
know
it doesn't help me at all it's like

5308
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:31,040
it doesn't help me at all it's like
 

5309
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,590
it doesn't help me at all it's like
humor yeah yeah just like you suck at

5310
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:33,600
humor yeah yeah just like you suck at
 

5311
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,070
humor yeah yeah just like you suck at
coding

5312
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:34,080
coding
 

5313
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,629
coding
but there's other things in your life so

5314
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:36,639
but there's other things in your life so
 

5315
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:37,669
but there's other things in your life so
i'm a bad programmer

5316
01:30:37,669 --> 01:30:37,679
i'm a bad programmer
 

5317
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,350
i'm a bad programmer
and so you know if that will give hope

5318
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,360
and so you know if that will give hope
 

5319
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,950
and so you know if that will give hope
to anyone else who's about programmer

5320
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:40,960
to anyone else who's about programmer
 

5321
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,750
to anyone else who's about programmer
i can still do pretty impressive science

5322
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:43,760
i can still do pretty impressive science
 

5323
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,149
i can still do pretty impressive science
yes

5324
01:30:44,149 --> 01:30:44,159
yes
 

5325
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,070
yes
but i learned i think i started learning

5326
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
but i learned i think i started learning
 

5327
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,629
but i learned i think i started learning
matlab and java when i was in college

5328
01:30:48,629 --> 01:30:48,639
matlab and java when i was in college
 

5329
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,350
matlab and java when i was in college
it did me no good at all like it has not

5330
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
it did me no good at all like it has not
 

5331
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,470
it did me no good at all like it has not
been particularly useful

5332
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480
been particularly useful
 

5333
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,470
been particularly useful
i learned some fortran that was very

5334
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:54,480
i learned some fortran that was very
 

5335
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,870
i learned some fortran that was very
useful even though it's

5336
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:56,880
useful even though it's
 

5337
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,790
useful even though it's
really not a fun language because so

5338
01:30:58,790 --> 01:30:58,800
really not a fun language because so
 

5339
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,070
really not a fun language because so
much of legacy code

5340
01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:00,080
much of legacy code
 

5341
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,669
much of legacy code
is in fortran and so if you want to use

5342
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:03,679
is in fortran and so if you want to use
 

5343
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:06,390
is in fortran and so if you want to use
other people's code who have now retired

5344
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
other people's code who have now retired
 

5345
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,430
other people's code who have now retired
fortran will

5346
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:07,440
fortran will
 

5347
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,990
fortran will
be nice and then i used idl to visualize

5348
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:10,000
be nice and then i used idl to visualize
 

5349
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,950
be nice and then i used idl to visualize
so that

5350
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
so that
 

5351
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,709
so that
uh simulation and body simulation those

5352
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:12,719
uh simulation and body simulation those
 

5353
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,629
uh simulation and body simulation those
all fortran and idl

5354
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
all fortran and idl
 

5355
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,950
all fortran and idl
but thankfully since i've left college

5356
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:16,960
but thankfully since i've left college
 

5357
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,550
but thankfully since i've left college
i've just learned python like a

5358
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:18,560
i've just learned python like a
 

5359
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,229
i've just learned python like a
normal person and that has been much

5360
01:31:20,229 --> 01:31:20,239
normal person and that has been much
 

5361
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:22,870
normal person and that has been much
nicer so most of my code now

5362
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:22,880
nicer so most of my code now
 

5363
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,910
nicer so most of my code now
is in python i should also make a few

5364
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:25,920
is in python i should also make a few
 

5365
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,830
is in python i should also make a few
quick comments as well so one is uh

5366
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:27,840
quick comments as well so one is uh
 

5367
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,430
quick comments as well so one is uh
you say you're sort of bad at

5368
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:29,440
you say you're sort of bad at
 

5369
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,390
you say you're sort of bad at
programming i've

5370
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:32,400
programming i've
 

5371
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,149
programming i've
worked with a lot of excellent

5372
01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:34,159
worked with a lot of excellent
 

5373
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:35,830
worked with a lot of excellent
scientists that are quote-unquote bad at

5374
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:35,840
scientists that are quote-unquote bad at
 

5375
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,629
scientists that are quote-unquote bad at
programming

5376
01:31:36,629 --> 01:31:36,639
programming
 

5377
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:39,430
programming
they're not it gets the job done in fact

5378
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:39,440
they're not it gets the job done in fact
 

5379
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,550
they're not it gets the job done in fact
there's a

5380
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
there's a
 

5381
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,590
there's a
there's a downside to sort of

5382
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:43,600
there's a downside to sort of
 

5383
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,709
there's a downside to sort of
especially getting a software

5384
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:44,719
especially getting a software
 

5385
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,870
especially getting a software
engineering education if i were to give

5386
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:46,880
engineering education if i were to give
 

5387
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:47,750
engineering education if i were to give
advice

5388
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:47,760
advice
 

5389
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,350
advice
especially if you're doing a computer

5390
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:49,360
especially if you're doing a computer
 

5391
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,950
especially if you're doing a computer
science degree and you're doing software

5392
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:50,960
science degree and you're doing software

engineering

5394
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:52,239
engineering
 

5395
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:55,270
engineering
is not to get lost in the

5396
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:55,280
is not to get lost in the
 

5397
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,990
is not to get lost in the
in the like optimization of the correct

5398
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:58,000
in the like optimization of the correct
 

5399
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,510
in the like optimization of the correct
there's an obsession you can see it in

5400
01:31:59,510 --> 01:31:59,520
there's an obsession you can see it in
 

5401
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,870
there's an obsession you can see it in
like stack overflow

5402
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:00,880
like stack overflow
 

5403
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,149
like stack overflow
of the correct way to do things and

5404
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:04,159
of the correct way to do things and
 

5405
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:07,350
of the correct way to do things and
i think you can too easily get lost

5406
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:07,360
i think you can too easily get lost
 

5407
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,470
i think you can too easily get lost
in uh constantly trying to optimize and

5408
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:10,480
in uh constantly trying to optimize and
 

5409
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,990
in uh constantly trying to optimize and
do things the correct way when you

5410
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:12,000
do things the correct way when you
 

5411
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,830
do things the correct way when you
actually never get done the same thing

5412
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:13,840
actually never get done the same thing
 

5413
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,470
actually never get done the same thing
happens you have like

5414
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:16,480
happens you have like
 

5415
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,149
happens you have like
communities of people obsessed with

5416
01:32:18,149 --> 01:32:18,159
communities of people obsessed with
 

5417
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:19,910
communities of people obsessed with
productivity and they

5418
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:19,920
productivity and they
 

5419
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,229
productivity and they
keep researching productivity hacks and

5420
01:32:22,229 --> 01:32:22,239
keep researching productivity hacks and
 

5421
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,149
keep researching productivity hacks and
then they spend like 90 percent

5422
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:24,159
then they spend like 90 percent
 

5423
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:25,750
then they spend like 90 percent
plus of their time figuring out how to

5424
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:25,760
plus of their time figuring out how to
 

5425
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,750
plus of their time figuring out how to
do things productively and then never

5426
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:27,760
do things productively and then never
 

5427
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,350
do things productively and then never
actually do anything

5428
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:29,360
actually do anything
 

5429
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,669
actually do anything
so there's a certain sense if you focus

5430
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:31,679
so there's a certain sense if you focus
 

5431
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,910
so there's a certain sense if you focus
on the task that needs to be done

5432
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:33,920
on the task that needs to be done
 

5433
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,070
on the task that needs to be done
that's what programming is for so not

5434
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,080
that's what programming is for so not
 

5435
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,750
that's what programming is for so not
over optimizing not

5436
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:37,760
over optimizing not
 

5437
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,990
over optimizing not
not focus not thinking about variable

5438
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:40,000
not focus not thinking about variable
 

5439
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,950
not focus not thinking about variable
names

5440
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:40,960
names
 

5441
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,270
names
uh in this in the following sense

5442
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:43,280
uh in this in the following sense
 

5443
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,629
uh in this in the following sense
sometimes you think okay i'm going to

5444
01:32:44,629 --> 01:32:44,639
sometimes you think okay i'm going to
 

5445
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,310
sometimes you think okay i'm going to
write code that's going to last for

5446
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:46,320
write code that's going to last for
 

5447
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,430
write code that's going to last for
decades in reality your code

5448
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:49,440
decades in reality your code
 

5449
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,030
decades in reality your code
if it's well written or poorly written

5450
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,040
if it's well written or poorly written
 

5451
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,189
if it's well written or poorly written
will be very likely obsolete

5452
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
will be very likely obsolete
 

5453
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:55,669
will be very likely obsolete
very quickly the point is to get the job

5454
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:55,679
very quickly the point is to get the job
 

5455
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:56,310
very quickly the point is to get the job
done

5456
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:56,320
done
 

5457
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,390
done
uh really well so there's a trade-off

5458
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:58,400
uh really well so there's a trade-off
 

5459
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,430
uh really well so there's a trade-off
there that you

5460
01:32:59,430 --> 01:32:59,440
there that you

programmers out there i'm looking for

5474
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
programmers out there i'm looking for
 

5475
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,550
programmers out there i'm looking for
them i want to talk to you

5476
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:14,560
them i want to talk to you
 

5477
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,470
them i want to talk to you
because that will not be me i'm a

5478
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:16,480
because that will not be me i'm a
 

5479
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,149
because that will not be me i'm a
terrible foreign programmer

5480
01:33:18,149 --> 01:33:18,159
terrible foreign programmer
 

5481
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,910
terrible foreign programmer
but it's fascinating because so much of

5482
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:19,920
but it's fascinating because so much of
 

5483
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,270
but it's fascinating because so much of
the world in the past

5484
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,280
the world in the past
 

5485
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,149
the world in the past
and still runs programming languages and

5486
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
and still runs programming languages and
 

5487
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,149
and still runs programming languages and
there's like no experts on it so

5488
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:26,159
there's like no experts on it so
 

5489
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:29,189
there's like no experts on it so
they're all retiring yeah i i disagree

5490
01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:29,199
they're all retiring yeah i i disagree
 

5491
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:29,910
they're all retiring yeah i i disagree
slightly

5492
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:29,920
slightly
 

5493
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,510
slightly
in that i think because i can get the

5494
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:31,520
in that i think because i can get the
 

5495
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,510
in that i think because i can get the
job done i'm a programmer

5496
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:33,520
job done i'm a programmer
 

5497
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,030
job done i'm a programmer
but because no one else can look at my

5498
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,040
but because no one else can look at my
 

5499
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,790
but because no one else can look at my
code and know how i got my job done

5500
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:36,800
code and know how i got my job done
 

5501
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,950
code and know how i got my job done
i'm a bad programmer that's how i'm

5502
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:38,960
i'm a bad programmer that's how i'm
 

5503
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,149
i'm a bad programmer that's how i'm
defining it

5504
01:33:40,149 --> 01:33:40,159
defining it
 

5505
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:41,830
defining it
including yourself including myself six

with some um functions that run and i
was like

5520
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:53,840
was like
 

5521
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,510
was like
i i this was from 2018 it wasn't that

5522
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:57,520
i i this was from 2018 it wasn't that
 

5523
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,709
i i this was from 2018 it wasn't that
long ago and

5524
01:33:58,709 --> 01:33:58,719
long ago and
 

5525
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,149
long ago and
i can no longer remember what that code

5526
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159
i can no longer remember what that code
 

5527
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:02,470
i can no longer remember what that code
does i'm going to spend now two days

5528
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:02,480
does i'm going to spend now two days
 

5529
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,709
does i'm going to spend now two days
reading through my own code and trying

5530
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:04,719
reading through my own code and trying
 

5531
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,070
reading through my own code and trying
to improve it

5532
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,080
to improve it
 

5533
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,470
to improve it
and i i do think that's frustrating and

5534
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
and i i do think that's frustrating and
 

5535
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,990
and i i do think that's frustrating and
so i think my advice to

5536
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:10,000
so i think my advice to
 

5537
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,870
so i think my advice to
any young people who want to get into

5538
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
any young people who want to get into
 

5539
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,149
any young people who want to get into
astronomy

5540
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:14,159
astronomy
 

5541
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:17,270
astronomy
or astrobiology or quantum chemistry is

5542
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,280
or astrobiology or quantum chemistry is
 

5543
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,149
or astrobiology or quantum chemistry is
that

5544
01:34:18,149 --> 01:34:18,159
that
 

5545
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:21,030
that
i certainly find it much easier to teach

5546
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:21,040
i certainly find it much easier to teach
 

5547
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,510
i certainly find it much easier to teach
the science concepts to a programmer

5548
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
the science concepts to a programmer
 

5549
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,830
the science concepts to a programmer
than the programming to a scientist and

5550
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:25,840
than the programming to a scientist and
 

5551
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,510
than the programming to a scientist and
so i would much

5552
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,520
so i would much
 

5553
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,070
so i would much
much faster hire someone who knows

5554
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,080
much faster hire someone who knows
 

5555
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:30,870
much faster hire someone who knows
programming but

5556
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:30,880
programming but
 

5557
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,870
programming but
barely knows where space is

5558
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:34,880
barely knows where space is
 

5559
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,669
barely knows where space is
than teach programming to an astronomer

5560
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
than teach programming to an astronomer
 

5561
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:38,870
than teach programming to an astronomer
oh that's fascinating

5562
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:38,880
oh that's fascinating
 

5563
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,790
oh that's fascinating
yeah okay this is true i mean yeah

5564
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:40,800
yeah okay this is true i mean yeah
 

5565
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,310
yeah okay this is true i mean yeah
there's some basics

5566
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:42,320
there's some basics
 

5567
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,550
there's some basics
i'm uh i'm focusing too much on the

5568
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:44,560
i'm uh i'm focusing too much on the
 

5569
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,669
i'm uh i'm focusing too much on the
silver lining because i've

5570
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:45,679
silver lining because i've
 

5571
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:47,750
silver lining because i've
the people that write like matlab code

5572
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:47,760
the people that write like matlab code
 

5573
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,270
the people that write like matlab code
yeah single variable

5574
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:49,280
yeah single variable
 

5575
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,950
yeah single variable
single letter variable names so those

5576
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:50,960
single letter variable names so those
 

5577
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,270
single letter variable names so those
kinds of things it is accessibility

5578
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:53,280
kinds of things it is accessibility
 

5579
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:53,750
kinds of things it is accessibility
right

5580
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:53,760
right
 

5581
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,950
right
it's i want my my code to be open source

5582
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
it's i want my my code to be open source
 

5583
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,709
it's i want my my code to be open source
but and it is it's on github anyone can

5584
01:34:58,709 --> 01:34:58,719
but and it is it's on github anyone can
 

5585
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,629
but and it is it's on github anyone can
download it but is it really open source

5586
01:35:00,629 --> 01:35:00,639
download it but is it really open source
 

5587
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,709
download it but is it really open source
if it's written so cryptically

5588
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:02,719
if it's written so cryptically
 

5589
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,629
if it's written so cryptically
so poorly that no one can really use it

5590
01:35:04,629 --> 01:35:04,639
so poorly that no one can really use it
 

5591
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,070
so poorly that no one can really use it
to his full functionality

5592
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:06,080
to his full functionality
 

5593
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:09,270
to his full functionality
have i really published my work

5594
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:09,280
have i really published my work
 

5595
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,709
have i really published my work
and that weighs on on me i feel guilty

5596
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:12,719
and that weighs on on me i feel guilty
 

5597
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:16,709
and that weighs on on me i feel guilty
for my own inadequacies as a programmer

5598
01:35:16,709 --> 01:35:16,719
for my own inadequacies as a programmer
 

5599
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,149
for my own inadequacies as a programmer
you can only do so much it's i've

5600
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:18,159
you can only do so much it's i've
 

5601
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:19,430
you can only do so much it's i've
already learned quantum chemistry and

5602
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,440
already learned quantum chemistry and
 

5603
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,229
already learned quantum chemistry and
astrophysics

5604
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:20,239
astrophysics
 

5605
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:23,430
astrophysics
so you know uh yeah

5606
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:23,440
so you know uh yeah
 

5607
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,229
so you know uh yeah
i mean there is there's uh there's all

5608
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:26,239
i mean there is there's uh there's all
 

5609
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:27,750
i mean there is there's uh there's all
kinds of ways to contribute to the world

5610
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:27,760
kinds of ways to contribute to the world
 

5611
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,590
kinds of ways to contribute to the world
one of them is publication

5612
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:29,600
one of them is publication
 

5613
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,229
one of them is publication
but publishing code is a fascinating way

5614
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:32,239
but publishing code is a fascinating way
 

5615
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:33,750
but publishing code is a fascinating way
to contribute to the world even if it's

5616
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:33,760
to contribute to the world even if it's
 

5617
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,950
to contribute to the world even if it's
very small

5618
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:34,960
very small
 

5619
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,870
very small
very basic element great code

5620
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:38,880
very basic element great code
 

5621
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,109
very basic element great code
i guess i was also kind of criticizing

5622
01:35:41,109 --> 01:35:41,119
i guess i was also kind of criticizing
 

5623
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:41,990
i guess i was also kind of criticizing
the software

5624
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,000
the software
 

5625
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,109
the software
engineering process versus like which is

5626
01:35:45,109 --> 01:35:45,119
engineering process versus like which is
 

5627
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:46,149
engineering process versus like which is
a good thing to do

5628
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
a good thing to do
 

5629
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,709
a good thing to do
is code that's readable almost like

5630
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:48,719
is code that's readable almost like
 

5631
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:50,070
is code that's readable almost like
without documentation

5632
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:50,080
without documentation
 

5633
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,790
without documentation
it's readable it's understandable the

5634
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800
it's readable it's understandable the
 

5635
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,709
it's readable it's understandable the
variable names the structure all those

5636
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:54,719
variable names the structure all those
 

5637
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:55,590
variable names the structure all those
kinds of things and

5638
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:55,600
kinds of things and
 

5639
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,550
kinds of things and
that's the dream that's the dream this

5640
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:58,560
that's the dream that's the dream this
 

5641
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,830
that's the dream that's the dream this
is a dumb question

5642
01:35:59,830 --> 01:35:59,840
is a dumb question
 

5643
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,550
is a dumb question
what do you uh no tell me a dumb

5644
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:02,560
what do you uh no tell me a dumb
 

5645
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,629
what do you uh no tell me a dumb
question i want to hear it

5646
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:04,639
question i want to hear it
 

5647
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:07,430
question i want to hear it
okay uh i mean okay this is the question

5648
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:07,440
okay uh i mean okay this is the question
 

5649
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,950
okay uh i mean okay this is the question
about beauty it's way too general it's

5650
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:08,960
about beauty it's way too general it's
 

5651
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,830
about beauty it's way too general it's
very impossible

5652
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
very impossible
 

5653
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,350
very impossible
it's like asking what's your favorite

5654
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,360
it's like asking what's your favorite
 

5655
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,189
it's like asking what's your favorite
band uh what's your favorite music

5656
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199
band uh what's your favorite music
 

5657
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,709
band uh what's your favorite music
band oh i thought you meant wavelength

5658
01:36:14,709 --> 01:36:14,719
band oh i thought you meant wavelength
 

5659
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:15,830
band oh i thought you meant wavelength
band i was like i definitely have

5660
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:15,840
band i was like i definitely have
 

5661
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,310
band i was like i definitely have
favorite

5662
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,320
favorite
 

5663
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,950
favorite
my fans absolutely well it's hard to

5664
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:18,960
my fans absolutely well it's hard to
 

5665
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,070
my fans absolutely well it's hard to
narrow down huh

5666
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:20,080
narrow down huh
 

5667
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,270
narrow down huh
okay uh what uh what to use the most

5668
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:23,280
okay uh what uh what to use the most
 

5669
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,709
okay uh what uh what to use the most
beautiful idea

5670
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:24,719
beautiful idea
 

5671
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:27,750
beautiful idea
in science that's not a dumb question

5672
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:27,760
in science that's not a dumb question
 

5673
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:28,870
in science that's not a dumb question
do you want to try the question again

5674
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:28,880
do you want to try the question again
 

5675
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,390
do you want to try the question again
proudly okay

5676
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:32,400

 

5677
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,550

i i have a really good question to ask

5678
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
i i have a really good question to ask
 

5679
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,510
i i have a really good question to ask
you

5680
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
you
 

5681
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,950
you
okay don't oversell it i've got an okay

5682
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:38,960
okay don't oversell it i've got an okay
 

5683
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,550
okay don't oversell it i've got an okay
question to ask you

5684
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,560
question to ask you
 

5685
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,669
question to ask you
ever yeah what

5686
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:43,679
ever yeah what
 

5687
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,149
ever yeah what
uh what do you is the most beautiful

5688
01:36:46,149 --> 01:36:46,159
uh what do you is the most beautiful
 

5689
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:46,790
uh what do you is the most beautiful
idea

5690
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:46,800
idea
 

5691
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,109
idea
in uh in science something you just find

5692
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:49,119
in uh in science something you just find
 

5693
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,310
in uh in science something you just find
inspiring or

5694
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:50,320
inspiring or
 

5695
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,709
inspiring or
just maybe the reason you got into

5696
01:36:52,709 --> 01:36:52,719
just maybe the reason you got into
 

5697
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:53,910
just maybe the reason you got into
science

5698
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:53,920
science
 

5699
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:59,830
science
or the reason you think science is cool

5700
01:36:59,830 --> 01:36:59,840

 

5701
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,870

my favorite thing about science is kind

5702
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:02,880
my favorite thing about science is kind
 

5703
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,350
my favorite thing about science is kind
of the connection between the scales

5704
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:05,360
of the connection between the scales
 

5705
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,910
of the connection between the scales
so when i was little and i wanted to

5706
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:07,920
so when i was little and i wanted to
 

5707
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,030
so when i was little and i wanted to
know about space i

5708
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:09,040
know about space i
 

5709
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,590
know about space i
really felt that it would make me feel

5710
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:11,600
really felt that it would make me feel
 

5711
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,709
really felt that it would make me feel
powerful

5712
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
powerful
 

5713
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,709
powerful
to be able to predict the heavens

5714
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
to be able to predict the heavens
 

5715
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:17,510
to be able to predict the heavens
something so much larger than myself

5716
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:17,520
something so much larger than myself
 

5717
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,910
something so much larger than myself
that felt really powerful it was almost

5718
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:19,920
that felt really powerful it was almost
 

5719
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,910
that felt really powerful it was almost
a selfish desire

5720
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:21,920
a selfish desire
 

5721
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,830
a selfish desire
and that's what i wanted there was some

5722
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:23,840
and that's what i wanted there was some
 

5723
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,709
and that's what i wanted there was some
control to being able to know exactly

5724
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:26,719
control to being able to know exactly
 

5725
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:30,310
control to being able to know exactly
what the sky would do and then as i got

5726
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:30,320
what the sky would do and then as i got
 

5727
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:33,030
what the sky would do and then as i got
older and i got more into astronomy and

5728
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:33,040
older and i got more into astronomy and
 

5729
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,550
older and i got more into astronomy and
i didn't just want to know how the stars

5730
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
i didn't just want to know how the stars
 

5731
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,070
i didn't just want to know how the stars
moved i wanted to know how the planets

5732
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
moved i wanted to know how the planets
 

5733
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,830
moved i wanted to know how the planets
around them moved and

5734
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:37,840
around them moved and
 

5735
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,750
around them moved and
and then as i got deeper into that field

5736
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:39,760
and then as i got deeper into that field
 

5737
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,510
and then as i got deeper into that field
i really didn't care that much about the

5738
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:41,520
i really didn't care that much about the
 

5739
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,550
i really didn't care that much about the
planets i want to know about the

5740
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
planets i want to know about the
 

5741
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,390
planets i want to know about the
atmospheres around the planets and then

5742
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,400
atmospheres around the planets and then
 

5743
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,149
atmospheres around the planets and then
the molecules within those atmospheres

5744
01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:46,159
the molecules within those atmospheres
 

5745
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:48,310
the molecules within those atmospheres
and what that might mean

5746
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:48,320
and what that might mean
 

5747
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,510
and what that might mean
so i ended up shrinking my scale until

5748
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:51,520
so i ended up shrinking my scale until
 

5749
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,550
so i ended up shrinking my scale until
it was literally

5750
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:52,560
it was literally
 

5751
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,109
it was literally
the quantum scale and now all my work

5752
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:55,119
the quantum scale and now all my work
 

5753
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,030
the quantum scale and now all my work
the majority of my work is on this

5754
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:57,040
the majority of my work is on this
 

5755
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:00,550
the majority of my work is on this
insane quantum scale and yet

5756
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
insane quantum scale and yet
 

5757
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,669
insane quantum scale and yet
i'm using these literal

5758
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:03,679
i'm using these literal
 

5759
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,109
i'm using these literal
tiny tiny tools to try and answer

5760
01:38:07,109 --> 01:38:07,119
tiny tiny tools to try and answer
 

5761
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:10,149
tiny tiny tools to try and answer
the greatest questions

5762
01:38:10,149 --> 01:38:10,159
the greatest questions
 

5763
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,870
the greatest questions
that we've ever been able to ask and

5764
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:12,880
that we've ever been able to ask and
 

5765
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:13,750
that we've ever been able to ask and
this

5766
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:13,760
this
 

5767
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,750
this
crossing of scales from the quantum to

5768
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:15,760
crossing of scales from the quantum to
 

5769
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,189
crossing of scales from the quantum to
the astronomical

5770
01:38:19,189 --> 01:38:19,199
the astronomical
 

5771
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:22,070
the astronomical
that's so cool isn't it yeah it spans

5772
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:22,080
that's so cool isn't it yeah it spans
 

5773
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,870
that's so cool isn't it yeah it spans
the entirety

5774
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:22,880
the entirety
 

5775
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,030
the entirety
the tiny and the huge that's that's the

5776
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,040
the tiny and the huge that's that's the
 

5777
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:25,910
the tiny and the huge that's that's the
cool thing about

5778
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
cool thing about
 

5779
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,109
cool thing about
i guess being a quantum astrochemist

5780
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:29,119
i guess being a quantum astrochemist
 

5781
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,709
i guess being a quantum astrochemist
because you're using the tools of the

5782
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
because you're using the tools of the
 

5783
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,229
because you're using the tools of the
tiny to

5784
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239
tiny to
 

5785
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,229
tiny to
look at the heavenly bodies the the

5786
01:38:34,229 --> 01:38:34,239
look at the heavenly bodies the the
 

5787
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,070
look at the heavenly bodies the the
giant stuff and

5788
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:36,080
giant stuff and
 

5789
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,390
giant stuff and
the potential life out there that this

5790
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:38,400
the potential life out there that this
 

5791
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,470
the potential life out there that this
is the thing that connects us

5792
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:40,480
is the thing that connects us
 

5793
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,310
is the thing that connects us
that you can't escape the rules of the

5794
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:42,320
that you can't escape the rules of the
 

5795
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,990
that you can't escape the rules of the
quantum world and how universal they

5796
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,000
quantum world and how universal they
 

5797
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,910
quantum world and how universal they
themselves are despite being

5798
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,920
themselves are despite being
 

5799
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,510
themselves are despite being
probabilistic

5800
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:47,520
probabilistic
 

5801
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,750
probabilistic
and that makes me feel

5802
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:51,760
and that makes me feel
 

5803
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,070
and that makes me feel
really pleased to be in science but in a

5804
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
really pleased to be in science but in a
 

5805
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,910
really pleased to be in science but in a
really humbling way

5806
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:55,920
really humbling way
 

5807
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,950
really humbling way
it's no longer this thirst for power

5808
01:38:58,950 --> 01:38:58,960
it's no longer this thirst for power
 

5809
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,189
it's no longer this thirst for power
and i i feel less special the more work

5810
01:39:03,189 --> 01:39:03,199
and i i feel less special the more work
 

5811
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:03,669
and i i feel less special the more work
i do

5812
01:39:03,669 --> 01:39:03,679
i do
 

5813
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:05,590
i do
less exceptional the more work i do i

5814
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
less exceptional the more work i do i
 

5815
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,669
less exceptional the more work i do i
feel like humans and the earth

5816
01:39:07,669 --> 01:39:07,679
feel like humans and the earth
 

5817
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,430
feel like humans and the earth
and our place in the universe is less

5818
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:09,440
and our place in the universe is less
 

5819
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,950
and our place in the universe is less
and less exceptional

5820
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:10,960
and less exceptional
 

5821
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,629
and less exceptional
and yet i feel so much less lonely

5822
01:39:14,629 --> 01:39:14,639
and yet i feel so much less lonely
 

5823
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,390
and yet i feel so much less lonely
and so it's been a really good trade-off

5824
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:16,400
and so it's been a really good trade-off
 

5825
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,310
and so it's been a really good trade-off
that i've lost power but i've gained

5826
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:18,320
that i've lost power but i've gained
 

5827
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,310
that i've lost power but i've gained
company

5828
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:20,320
company
 

5829
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,750
company
wow that's a beautiful answer i don't

5830
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:21,760
wow that's a beautiful answer i don't
 

5831
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,109
wow that's a beautiful answer i don't
think there's a better way to actually

5832
01:39:23,109 --> 01:39:23,119
think there's a better way to actually
 

5833
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:24,070
think there's a better way to actually
end it you're right

5834
01:39:24,070 --> 01:39:24,080
end it you're right
 

5835
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,550
end it you're right
i asked a mediocre question and you came

5836
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:26,560
i asked a mediocre question and you came
 

5837
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,350
i asked a mediocre question and you came
through uh

5838
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:27,360
through uh
 

5839
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,830
through uh
you made the question good by a

5840
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:29,840
you made the question good by a
 

5841
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,950
you made the question good by a

um interviews
 

5933
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:18,550
um interviews
yeah yeah so as a a public science like

5934
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:18,560
yeah yeah so as a a public science like
 

5935
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,270
yeah yeah so as a a public science like
being a public communicator that's a job

5936
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:21,280
being a public communicator that's a job
 

5937
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,070
being a public communicator that's a job
yeah

5938
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:22,080
yeah
 

5939
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:27,109
yeah
the the whole thing very poorly

5940
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:27,119

 

5941
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:31,030

i'll pay you in bitcoin okay i'll take

5942
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:31,040
i'll pay you in bitcoin okay i'll take
 

5943
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,310
i'll pay you in bitcoin okay i'll take
uh so uh

5944
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:34,320
uh so uh
 

5945
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,790
uh so uh
is that is there some advice you can

5946
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:36,800
is that is there some advice you can
 

5947
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,669
is that is there some advice you can
give to

5948
01:41:37,669 --> 01:41:37,679
give to
 

5949
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:40,310
give to
to the process of being productive and

5950
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:40,320
to the process of being productive and
 

5951
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,109
to the process of being productive and
happy

5952
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:41,119
happy
 

5953
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:44,070
happy
as a researcher i think sadly it's very

5954
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:44,080
as a researcher i think sadly it's very
 

5955
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,830
as a researcher i think sadly it's very
hard to feel happy as a scientist if

5956
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:45,840
hard to feel happy as a scientist if
 

5957
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,270
hard to feel happy as a scientist if
you're not productive

5958
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,280
you're not productive
 

5959
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,390
you're not productive
it's a bit of a trap um but it's i

5960
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:50,400
it's a bit of a trap um but it's i
 

5961
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,149
it's a bit of a trap um but it's i
certainly find it very difficult to feel

5962
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:52,159
certainly find it very difficult to feel
 

5963
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:54,550
certainly find it very difficult to feel
happy when i'm not being productive

5964
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:54,560
happy when i'm not being productive
 

5965
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,030
happy when i'm not being productive
it's become slightly better if i know my

5966
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:57,040
it's become slightly better if i know my
 

5967
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,629
it's become slightly better if i know my
students are being productive

5968
01:41:58,629 --> 01:41:58,639
students are being productive
 

5969
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:00,950
students are being productive
i can be happy but i think a lot of

5970
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:00,960
i can be happy but i think a lot of
 

5971
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,030
i can be happy but i think a lot of
senior scientists

5972
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:03,040
senior scientists
 

5973
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,030
senior scientists
once they get into that mindset they

5974
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:05,040
once they get into that mindset they
 

5975
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,390
once they get into that mindset they
start thinking that their student

5976
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:06,400
start thinking that their student
 

5977
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,669
start thinking that their student
science is theirs

5978
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:07,679
science is theirs
 

5979
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:09,270
science is theirs
i think this happens a lot of senior

5980
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:09,280
i think this happens a lot of senior
 

5981
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,709
i think this happens a lot of senior
scientists

5982
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:10,719
scientists
 

5983
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:13,189
scientists
they have so many hats as you mentioned

5984
01:42:13,189 --> 01:42:13,199
they have so many hats as you mentioned
 

5985
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:14,550
they have so many hats as you mentioned
they have to do so much service and so

5986
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:14,560
they have to do so much service and so
 

5987
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,750
they have to do so much service and so
much admin

5988
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:15,760
much admin
 

5989
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,109
much admin
that they have very little time for

5990
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:17,119
that they have very little time for
 

5991
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:19,430
that they have very little time for
their own science and so they end up

5992
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:19,440
their own science and so they end up
 

5993
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:20,149
their own science and so they end up
feeling

5994
01:42:20,149 --> 01:42:20,159
feeling
 

5995
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:22,229
feeling
ownership over the junior people in

5996
01:42:22,229 --> 01:42:22,239
ownership over the junior people in
 

5997
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,629
ownership over the junior people in
their labs and their groups and

5998
01:42:24,629 --> 01:42:24,639
their labs and their groups and
 

5999
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:26,229
their labs and their groups and
that's really heartbreaking i see it all

6000
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:26,239
that's really heartbreaking i see it all
 

6001
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,709
that's really heartbreaking i see it all
the time and

01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:28,719
the time and
 

6003
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,830
the time and
and that i think i've escaped that trap

6004
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:31,840
and that i think i've escaped that trap
 

6005
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,709
and that i think i've escaped that trap
i feel so happy even when i'm not

6006
01:42:34,709 --> 01:42:34,719
i feel so happy even when i'm not
 

6007
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:35,430
i feel so happy even when i'm not
productive

6008
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:35,440
productive
 

6009
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,550
productive
when my students are productive i think

6010
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:38,560
when my students are productive i think
 

6011
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,830
when my students are productive i think
that sensation i was describing earlier

6012
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:40,840
that sensation i was describing earlier
 

6013
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,990
that sensation i was describing earlier
of

6014
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,000
of
 

6015
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,149
of
they only need to be half as productive

6016
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:44,159
they only need to be half as productive
 

6017
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,470
they only need to be half as productive
as me for me to feel like

6018
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:46,480
as me for me to feel like
 

6019
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:50,470
as me for me to feel like
i've done my job for humanity

6020
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:50,480
i've done my job for humanity
 

6021
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:53,750
i've done my job for humanity
so that has been the dynamic i've had to

6022
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:53,760
so that has been the dynamic i've had to
 

6023
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:54,950
so that has been the dynamic i've had to
worry about

6024
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:54,960
worry about
 

6025
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,270
worry about
but to be productive is not clear to me

6026
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:57,280
but to be productive is not clear to me
 

6027
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,229
but to be productive is not clear to me
what you have to do

6028
01:42:58,229 --> 01:42:58,239
what you have to do
 

6029
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:00,149
what you have to do
you have to not be miserable otherwise i

6030
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:00,159
you have to not be miserable otherwise i
 

6031
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:02,310
you have to not be miserable otherwise i
find it extremely hard when i'm having

01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:02,320
find it extremely hard when i'm having

kind of very hard to enjoy the work we

6038
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:07,760
kind of very hard to enjoy the work we
 

6039
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,750
kind of very hard to enjoy the work we
do even if the work is this you know

6040
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:09,760
do even if the work is this you know
 

6041
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,870

phosphine or things that i know i love

6044
01:43:14,709 --> 01:43:14,719
phosphine or things that i know i love
 

6045
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:17,830
phosphine or things that i know i love
still very difficult so i think choosing

6046
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:17,840
still very difficult so i think choosing
 

6047
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,910
still very difficult so i think choosing
your collaborators based on

6048
01:43:19,910 --> 01:43:19,920
your collaborators based on
 

6049
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,149
your collaborators based on
how well you get along with them is a

how well you get along with them is a
 

6051
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:23,350
how well you get along with them is a
really sound

6052
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:23,360
really sound
 

6053
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:26,790
really sound
scientific choice having a miserable

6054
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:26,800
scientific choice having a miserable
 

6055
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,669

6056
01:43:27,669 --> 01:43:27,679

ruins your whole life it's horrible it

6058
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:30,400
ruins your whole life it's horrible it
 

6059
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,109
ruins your whole life it's horrible it
makes you not

6060
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:31,119
makes you not
 

6061
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,709
makes you not
want to do the science it probably makes

6062
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:32,719
want to do the science it probably makes
 

6063
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,790
want to do the science it probably makes
you do clumsy science because you don't

6064
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:34,800
you do clumsy science because you don't
 

6065
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:35,590
you do clumsy science because you don't
focus on it

6066
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:35,600
focus on it
 

6067
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,430
focus on it
you don't go over it several times you

6068
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:37,440
you don't go over it several times you
 

6069
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,350
you don't go over it several times you
just want it to be over

6070
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:39,360
just want it to be over
 

6071
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:43,030
just want it to be over
and so i think in general just

6072
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:43,040
and so i think in general just
 

6073
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,310
and so i think in general just
not being a douche bag can get so much

6074
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:46,320
not being a douche bag can get so much
 

6075
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,590
not being a douche bag can get so much
good science done

6076
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:47,600
good science done
 

6077
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,590
good science done
just find the good people in your

6078
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:49,600
just find the good people in your
 

6079
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,270
just find the good people in your
community and collaborate with them

6080
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:51,280
community and collaborate with them
 

6081
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,629
community and collaborate with them
even if they're not as good scientists

6082
01:43:52,629 --> 01:43:52,639
even if they're not as good scientists
 

6083
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:55,510
even if they're not as good scientists
as others you'll get better science out

6084
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:55,520
as others you'll get better science out
 

6085
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,109
as others you'll get better science out
yeah don't be a douchebag yourself and

6086
01:43:57,109 --> 01:43:57,119
yeah don't be a douchebag yourself and
 

6087
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,189
yeah don't be a douchebag yourself and
surround yourself by other cool people

6088
01:43:59,189 --> 01:43:59,199
surround yourself by other cool people
 

6089
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:01,910
surround yourself by other cool people
exactly and then you'll get better

6090
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:01,920
exactly and then you'll get better
 

6091
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,030
exactly and then you'll get better
science than if you would

6092
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:03,040
science than if you would
 

6093
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,189
science than if you would
try to work with three geniuses who are

6094
01:44:05,189 --> 01:44:05,199
try to work with three geniuses who are
 

6095
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:06,149
try to work with three geniuses who are
just hell

6096
01:44:06,149 --> 01:44:06,159
just hell
 

6097
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:09,590
just hell
to be around yeah i mean there's

6098
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
to be around yeah i mean there's
 

6099
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,270
to be around yeah i mean there's
parallel things

6100
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:11,280
parallel things
 

6101
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,629
parallel things
like that i'm very fortunate now um

6102
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:14,639
like that i'm very fortunate now um
 

6103

i'm doing a lot of fun stuff on the side
 

6113
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:31,189
i'm doing a lot of fun stuff on the side
uh like this little podcast thing and

6114
01:44:31,189 --> 01:44:31,199
uh like this little podcast thing and
 

6115
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:33,350
uh like this little podcast thing and
i mentioned to you i think robotics

6116
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
i mentioned to you i think robotics
 

6117
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:34,709
i mentioned to you i think robotics
related stuff

6118
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:34,719
related stuff
 

6119
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,270
related stuff
um i was at just the boston dynamics

6120
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:37,280
um i was at just the boston dynamics
 

6121
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:37,990
um i was at just the boston dynamics
yesterday

6122
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:38,000
yesterday
 

6123
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,030
yesterday
checking out their robots um

6124
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:41,040
checking out their robots um
 

6125
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,990
checking out their robots um
and i'm currently i guess hiring people

6126
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:44,000
and i'm currently i guess hiring people
 

6127
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,830
and i'm currently i guess hiring people
to help me with a very fun little

6128
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
to help me with a very fun little
 

6129
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,270
to help me with a very fun little
project around those robots

6130
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,280
project around those robots
 

6131
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,590
project around those robots
i have more applications i can possibly

6132
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:51,600
i have more applications i can possibly
 

6133
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,590
i have more applications i can possibly
deal with there's thousands

6134
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:53,600
deal with there's thousands
 

6135
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,629
deal with there's thousands
so uh it's not

6136
01:44:56,629 --> 01:44:56,639
so uh it's not
 

6137
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:57,990
so uh it's not
it's the opposite it's like we need to

6138
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:58,000
it's the opposite it's like we need to
 

6139
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,830
it's the opposite it's like we need to
put an ad out for someone to help you go

6140
01:44:59,830 --> 01:44:59,840
put an ad out for someone to help you go
 

6141
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,510
put an ad out for someone to help you go
through the application well that too

6142
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:01,520
through the application well that too
 

6143
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,910
through the application well that too
is already there that over ten thousand

6144
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:03,920
is already there that over ten thousand
 

6145
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:04,950
is already there that over ten thousand
people apply for that an

6146
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:04,960
people apply for that an
 

6147
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,270
people apply for that an
infinite matriarchal dollar of uh

6148
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:07,280
infinite matriarchal dollar of uh
 

6149
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:07,990
infinite matriarchal dollar of uh
application

6150
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:08,000
application
 

6151
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,229
application
yeah exactly punishment but the point is

6152
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:10,239
yeah exactly punishment but the point is
 

6153
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:11,189
yeah exactly punishment but the point is
it's not

6154
01:45:11,189 --> 01:45:11,199
it's not
 

6155
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:14,550
it's not
it's not exactly the point is

6156
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:14,560
it's not exactly the point is
 

6157
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,790
it's not exactly the point is
like what i'm very distinctly aware of

6158
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:16,800
like what i'm very distinctly aware of
 

6159
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,109
like what i'm very distinctly aware of
is life is short

6160
01:45:19,109 --> 01:45:19,119
is life is short
 

6161
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:23,590
is life is short
and productivity

6162
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:23,600

 

6163
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,430

is not the right goal to optimize for at

it always is nothing
 

6611
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:15,990
it always is nothing
and looking for meaning in the universe

6612
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:16,000
and looking for meaning in the universe
 

6613
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,910

very reassuring
 

6623
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:27,830
very reassuring
because once there is no meaning i don't

6624
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:27,840
because once there is no meaning i don't
 

6625
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:28,960
because once there is no meaning i don't
have to find it

01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:55,199
the entirety of the world really argues
 

6653
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:56,070
the entirety of the world really argues
hard that there's

6654
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:56,080
hard that there's
 

6655
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:59,350
hard that there's
that free will is an illusion that um

6656
01:53:59,350 --> 01:53:59,360
that free will is an illusion that um
 

6657
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:00,870
that free will is an illusion that um
you know the the

6658
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:00,880
you know the the
 

6659
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,629
you know the the
the deterministic universe and it's

6660
01:54:02,629 --> 01:54:02,639
the deterministic universe and it's
 

6661
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,109
the deterministic universe and it's
already been predetermined and

6662
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:05,119
already been predetermined and
 

6663
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:07,589
already been predetermined and
and he's okay with it and he's happy

6664
01:54:07,589 --> 01:54:07,599
and he's okay with it and he's happy
 

6665
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,430
and he's okay with it and he's happy
with it that that

6666
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:09,440
with it that that
 

6667
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,830
with it that that
he's distinctly aware of it and that's

6668
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:11,840
he's distinctly aware of it and that's
 

6669
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,510
he's distinctly aware of it and that's
one of the moral will disagree with him

6670
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:13,520
one of the moral will disagree with him
 

6671
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,149
one of the moral will disagree with him
on the deterministic nature of

6672
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:16,159
on the deterministic nature of
 

6673
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:18,950
on the deterministic nature of
nature well he's uh it's not the he's

6674
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:18,960
nature well he's uh it's not the he's
 

6675
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,629
nature well he's uh it's not the he's
not saying it's deterministic but he's

6676
01:54:20,629 --> 01:54:20,639
not saying it's deterministic but he's
 

6677
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:21,350
not saying it's deterministic but he's
saying that the

6678
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:21,360
saying that the
 

6679
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,310
saying that the
randomness doesn't help either like

6680
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:24,320
randomness doesn't help either like
 

6681
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,830
randomness doesn't help either like
randomness does not

6682
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:25,840
randomness does not
 

6683
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:29,830
randomness does not
help in in the experience of feeling

6684
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:29,840
help in in the experience of feeling
 

6685
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,510
help in in the experience of feeling
like you're the decider of your own

6686
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:31,520
like you're the decider of your own
 

6687
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,790
like you're the decider of your own
actions

6688
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:32,800
actions
 

6689
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,669
actions
that he kind of is okay with being a

6690
01:54:35,669 --> 01:54:35,679
that he kind of is okay with being a
 

6691
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:36,070
that he kind of is okay with being a
leaf

6692
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:36,080
leaf
 

6693
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:39,109
leaf
flowing on the river like or being the

6694
01:54:39,109 --> 01:54:39,119
flowing on the river like or being the
 

6695
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:40,149
flowing on the river like or being the
river

6696
01:54:40,149 --> 01:54:40,159
river
 

6697
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:42,070
river
right as opposed to having or being like

6698
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:42,080
right as opposed to having or being like
 

6699
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,390
right as opposed to having or being like
a fish or something that can decide it's

6700
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,400
a fish or something that can decide it's
 

6701
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:47,350
a fish or something that can decide it's
swimming direction he's okay just

6702
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:47,360
swimming direction he's okay just
 

6703
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:48,870
swimming direction he's okay just
embracing the flow of life i mean in

6704
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:48,880
embracing the flow of life i mean in
 

6705
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,149
embracing the flow of life i mean in
that same way

6706
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:50,159
that same way
 

6707
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:52,390
that same way
it kind of sounds like your conception

6708
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:52,400
it kind of sounds like your conception
 

6709
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:53,430
it kind of sounds like your conception
of

6710
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:53,440
of
 

6711
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,709
of
meaning i mean it just is it doesn't

6712
01:54:56,709 --> 01:54:56,719
meaning i mean it just is it doesn't
 

6713
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:59,350
meaning i mean it just is it doesn't
the universe doesn't care it just is

6714
01:54:59,350 --> 01:54:59,360
the universe doesn't care it just is
 

6715
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,109
the universe doesn't care it just is
what it is and we experience certain

6716
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:01,119
what it is and we experience certain
 

6717
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:01,830
what it is and we experience certain
things

6718
01:55:01,830 --> 01:55:01,840
things
 

6719
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:07,109
things
and some feel good and some don't and uh

6720
01:55:07,109 --> 01:55:07,119

 

6721
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:09,109

that's life but i don't feel like that

6722
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:09,119
that's life but i don't feel like that
 

6723
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:11,030
that's life but i don't feel like that
about life i think life does have

6724
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:11,040
about life i think life does have
 

6725
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:11,510
about life i think life does have
meaning

6726
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:11,520
meaning
 

6727
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,990
meaning
and there's and it's laudable to look

6728
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:14,000
and there's and it's laudable to look
 

6729
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,149
and there's and it's laudable to look
for that meaning in life

6730
01:55:16,149 --> 01:55:16,159
for that meaning in life
 

6731
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:18,870
for that meaning in life
i just don't think you can apply that

6732
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:18,880
i just don't think you can apply that
 

6733
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:19,990
i just don't think you can apply that
beyond life

6734
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:20,000
beyond life
 

6735
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,270
beyond life
and certainly not be on earth that this

6736
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:23,280
and certainly not be on earth that this
 

6737
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,350
and certainly not be on earth that this
notion of meaning is a human construct

6738
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:25,360
notion of meaning is a human construct
 

6739
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,470
notion of meaning is a human construct
and so

6740
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:26,480
and so
 

6741
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:30,229
and so
it only applies within us and

6742
01:55:30,229 --> 01:55:30,239
it only applies within us and
 

6743
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:34,070
it only applies within us and
the other life forms and planet

6744
01:55:34,070 --> 01:55:34,080
the other life forms and planet
 

6745
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,430
the other life forms and planet
types that suffer from our intrusions or

6746
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:37,440
types that suffer from our intrusions or
 

6747
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,510
types that suffer from our intrusions or
rejoice from our interactions but

6748
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:41,520
rejoice from our interactions but
 

6749
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,910
rejoice from our interactions but
it's this this meaning is ours to do as

6750
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:43,920
it's this this meaning is ours to do as
 

6751
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:44,629
it's this this meaning is ours to do as
we please

6752
01:55:44,629 --> 01:55:44,639
we please
 

6753
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:46,790
we please
we created it we've created a need for

6754
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:46,800
we created it we've created a need for
 

6755
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:47,830
we created it we've created a need for
it and so

6756
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:47,840
it and so
 

6757
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,750
it and so
that's our problem to solve i don't

6758
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:49,760
that's our problem to solve i don't
 

6759
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,109
that's our problem to solve i don't
apply it beyond us

6760
01:55:51,109 --> 01:55:51,119
apply it beyond us
 

6761
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,550
apply it beyond us
i think we as humans have a lot of

6762
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:52,560
i think we as humans have a lot of
 

6763
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,070
i think we as humans have a lot of
responsibilities but they're moral

6764
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:54,080
responsibilities but they're moral
 

6765
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,430
responsibilities but they're moral
responsibilities

6766
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:55,440
responsibilities
 

6767
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,870
responsibilities
and a lot of the responsibilities are

6768
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:56,880
and a lot of the responsibilities are
 

6769
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,709
and a lot of the responsibilities are
much more easily fulfilled

6770
01:55:58,709 --> 01:55:58,719
much more easily fulfilled
 

6771
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:01,030
much more easily fulfilled
if you find meaning in them so i think

6772
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,040
if you find meaning in them so i think
 

6773
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,550
if you find meaning in them so i think
there's value to meaning

6774
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,560
there's value to meaning
 

6775
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,910
there's value to meaning
whether it's real or not i just think we

6776
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:05,920
whether it's real or not i just think we
 

6777
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:06,229
whether it's real or not i just think we
gain

6778
01:56:06,229 --> 01:56:06,239
gain
 

6779
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:09,109
gain
nothing from trying to anthropomorphize

6780
01:56:09,109 --> 01:56:09,119
nothing from trying to anthropomorphize
 

6781
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:10,790
nothing from trying to anthropomorphize
the entire universe

6782
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
the entire universe
 

6783
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,510
the entire universe
and also that's the height of hubris

6784
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:13,520
and also that's the height of hubris
 

6785
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,430
and also that's the height of hubris
that's not for us to do

6786
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:15,440
that's not for us to do
 

6787
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,390
that's not for us to do
yeah it also could be just like duality

6788
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:18,400
yeah it also could be just like duality
 

6789
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,510
yeah it also could be just like duality
and quantum mechanics

6790
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:19,520
and quantum mechanics
 

6791
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,790
and quantum mechanics
it could uh it could be both that there

6792
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:22,800
it could uh it could be both that there
 

6793
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:23,669
it could uh it could be both that there
is meaning

6794
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:23,679
is meaning
 

6795
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,550
is meaning
and then there isn't and we're somehow

6796
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:26,560
and then there isn't and we're somehow
 

6797
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:27,669
and then there isn't and we're somehow
depending on

6798
01:56:27,669 --> 01:56:27,679
depending on
 

6799
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:31,030
depending on
the observer depending on the

6800
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:31,040
the observer depending on the
 

6801
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,270
the observer depending on the
the perspective you take on the thing i

6802
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:33,280
the perspective you take on the thing i
 

6803
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,390
the perspective you take on the thing i
mean even on

6804
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:34,400
mean even on
 

6805
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:37,350
mean even on
earth that's true but the whether things

6806
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,360
earth that's true but the whether things
 

6807
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,709
earth that's true but the whether things
