these people
it's gonna i would predict like 2024

1534
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:55,679
it's gonna i would predict like 2024
 

1535

that's where we're going to have to

1536
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
that's where we're going to have to
 

1537
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,149
that's where we're going to have to
start having conversations about what

1538
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
start having conversations about what
 

1539
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,990
start having conversations about what
personal consequences have to be done

1540

personal consequences have to be done
 

1541
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,590
personal consequences have to be done
for these people because until then

1542
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
for these people because until then
 

1543
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,269
for these people because until then
they're going to do the same thing

1544

they're going to do the same thing
 

1545
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,470
they're going to do the same thing
so you think there's going to be

1546
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
so you think there's going to be
 

1547
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,470
so you think there's going to be
society-wide consequences of this that

1548
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
society-wide consequences of this that
 

1549
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,710
society-wide consequences of this that
we're going to see like ripple effects

1550
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
we're going to see like ripple effects

did that part of it i'm
 

1755
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,950

and you
wrote a bunch of stuff and then you

agreed on it

1832
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
agreed on it
 

1833
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,470
agreed on it
okay so you understand that no one

1834
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
okay so you understand that no one
 

1835
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,990

as lysandra spooner pointed out over 150

1840
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
as lysandra spooner pointed out over 150
 

1841
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,590
as lysandra spooner pointed out over 150
years ago

1842
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600

the constitution or the social contract
 

1845
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,710
the constitution or the social contract
if anything

1846
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:36,720
if anything
 

1847
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,269
if anything
is only binding to the signatories and

1848
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
is only binding to the signatories and
 

1849
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,029
is only binding to the signatories and
even then they're all long dead

00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039
even then they're all long dead
 

1851
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,190
even then they're all long dead
uh so it's it's this fallacy that

okay so do you acknowledge that there's
 

1973
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,029
okay so do you acknowledge that there's
some

value in authority
 

1977
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,870
value in authority
in different subjects so what what that

1978
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
in different subjects so what what that
 

1979
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,630
in different subjects so what what that
means is i don't mean an authority

1980
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:58,640
means is i don't mean an authority
 

1981

means is i don't mean an authority
somebody who's in control of you

somebody who's in control of you
 

1983
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,070
somebody who's in control of you
but you're doing the definition switch

1984
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
but you're doing the definition switch
 

1985
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,830
but you're doing the definition switch
because i am i am you're right you're

right it's unfair okay those those bad
but that's what they do that's their

but that's what they do that's their
 

1991
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,509
but that's what they do that's their
trick yeah and it's this is one of the

1992
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:11,519
trick yeah and it's this is one of the
 

1993
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,110
trick yeah and it's this is one of the
useful things by the way less is total

concepts

whereas if you only know one language

whereas if you only know one language
 

2011
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,389
whereas if you only know one language
you fall for things like this because

00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
you fall for things like this because

and someone is an authority in physics

2018
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,480
and someone is an authority in physics
 

2019
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,310
and someone is an authority in physics
it's the same word conceptually they're

2020
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,320
it's the same word conceptually they're
 

2021
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,430
it's the same word conceptually they're
extremely different

00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:33,440
extremely different
 

2023
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,789
extremely different
but if you're only thinking in one

2024
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
but if you're only thinking in one
 

2025
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,190
but if you're only thinking in one
language your brain is going to equate

2026
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,200
language your brain is going to equate
 

2027
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,789
language your brain is going to equate
the two and that's a trap that people

2028
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
the two and that's a trap that people
 

2029
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,149
the two and that's a trap that people
who only speak one language have

2030
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
who only speak one language have
 

2031
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,230
who only speak one language have
for sure but even if you know multiple

2032
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:42,240
for sure but even if you know multiple
 

2033
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,990
for sure but even if you know multiple
languages you can still use the trick of

2034
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
languages you can still use the trick of
 

2035
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,669
languages you can still use the trick of
using your c or convenience

2036
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:45,679
using your c or convenience
 

2037
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,509
using your c or convenience
yeah absolutely to manipulate the

2038
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
yeah absolutely to manipulate the
 

2039
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,029
yeah absolutely to manipulate the
conversation you weren't trying to do

2040

conversation you weren't trying to do
 

2041
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:49,669
conversation you weren't trying to do
that but you

2042
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
that but you
 

2043
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,509
that but you
you fell in i accidentally did it yeah

2044
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
you fell in i accidentally did it yeah
 

2045
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,190
you fell in i accidentally did it yeah
right we all tend to do that if you only

2046
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
right we all tend to do that if you only
 

2047
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,389
right we all tend to do that if you only
speak one language and think of one

00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
speak one language and think of one

nor eye to them so do you think this
 

2109
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,269
nor eye to them so do you think this
kind of there could be

2110
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:55,279
kind of there could be
 

2111
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,990
kind of there could be
a bunch of humans that behave kind of

like
ants in a distributed way there could be

2116
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
ants in a distributed way there could be
 

2117
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,029
ants in a distributed way there could be
an emergent behavior in them that

2118
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
an emergent behavior in them that
 

2119
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,350
an emergent behavior in them that
results in a stable society like

2120

results in a stable society like
 

2121

an overarching uh but answer
 

2127
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,430
an overarching uh but answer
i i mean answer the worst example here

2128
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
i i mean answer the worst example here
 

2129
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,589
i i mean answer the worst example here
because ants have a very firm authority

there's something beautiful that
 

2209
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,790
there's something beautiful that
i won't argue about because i do there's

i won't argue about because i do there's
 

2211
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,069
i won't argue about because i do there's
an interesting point there about

an interesting point there about
 

2213
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,030
an interesting point there about
individualism of

individualism of
ants i do think they're more individual

2216

ants i do think they're more individual
 

2217
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,230
ants i do think they're more individual
but like

2218
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,240
but like
 

2219
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,630
but like
let's let's give your view of ants that

2220
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
let's let's give your view of ants that
 

2221
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,710
let's let's give your view of ants that
they're it's their communists okay

2222
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
they're it's their communists okay
 

2223
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,630
they're it's their communists okay
let's go with the communist view of ants

2224
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
let's go with the communist view of ants
 

2225
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,390
let's go with the communist view of ants
okay yeah uh

2226
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
okay yeah uh
 

2227
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,470
okay yeah uh
but there's still a beautiful emergent

2228
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
but there's still a beautiful emergent
 

2229
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,990
but there's still a beautiful emergent
thing which is like

2230
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,000
thing which is like
 

2231
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,550
thing which is like
they can function as a as a society and

2232
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
they can function as a as a society and
 

2233
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,349
they can function as a as a society and
without i would say centralized control

2234
00:35:59,349 --> 00:35:59,359

 

2235
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,109

so is that the hope for anarchy it's

2236
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:01,119
so is that the hope for anarchy it's
 

2237
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,109
so is that the hope for anarchy it's
like you just throw a bunch of people

2238
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:03,119
like you just throw a bunch of people
 

2239
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,870

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,309

it's an open question of in which system

it's an open question of in which system

it's an open question of in which system

be able to thrive more and in in which
 

2797
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,349
be able to thrive more and in in which

system would the evils
 

2799
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,910
system would the evils
that arise in human nature would be more

2800

that arise in human nature would be more
 

2801
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,349
that arise in human nature would be more
easily suppressable

2802
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:01,359
easily suppressable
 

2803
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,670
easily suppressable
there that's that's the question it's a

2804
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:03,680
there that's that's the question it's a
 

2805
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,589
there that's that's the question it's a
scientific experiment and i'm asking

2806
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
scientific experiment and i'm asking
 

2807
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,190
scientific experiment and i'm asking
only from our perspective

2808
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,200
only from our perspective
 

2809
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,309
only from our perspective
of the fact that we've tried democracy

2810
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
of the fact that we've tried democracy
 

2811
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,190
of the fact that we've tried democracy
quite a bit recently and we i don't

2812
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,200
quite a bit recently and we i don't
 

2813
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,349
quite a bit recently and we i don't
maybe you can correct me we haven't yet

2814
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:15,359
maybe you can correct me we haven't yet
 

2815
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,910
maybe you can correct me we haven't yet
seriously tried anarchy in a large scale

2816
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:17,920
seriously tried anarchy in a large scale
 

2817
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,510
seriously tried anarchy in a large scale
well we don't need to try to

2818
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,520
well we don't need to try to
 

2819
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,430
well we don't need to try to
so anarchy isn't like a country right

2820
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
so anarchy isn't like a country right
 

2821
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,630
so anarchy isn't like a country right
it's like it's you can't

2822
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,640
it's like it's you can't
 

2823
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,790
it's like it's you can't
i'm not it's like saying well if anarchy

2824
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:24,800
i'm not it's like saying well if anarchy
 

2825
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,910
i'm not it's like saying well if anarchy
works how can we've never had an

2826
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
works how can we've never had an
 

2827
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,190
works how can we've never had an
anarchist government right

2828
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:27,200
anarchist government right
 

2829
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,589
anarchist government right
so anarchism is a relationship and

2830
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
so anarchism is a relationship and
 

2831
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,190
so anarchism is a relationship and
language is an example of this it's a

2832
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
language is an example of this it's a
 

2833
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,829
language is an example of this it's a

2834
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:31,839
worldwide
 

2835
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,030
worldwide
and our system you and i have an

2836
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,040
and our system you and i have an
 

2837
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,630
and our system you and i have an
anarchist relationship there's almost no

2838
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
anarchist relationship there's almost no
 

2839
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,470
anarchist relationship there's almost no
circumstances we'd be calling the police

2840
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
circumstances we'd be calling the police
 

2841
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,030
circumstances we'd be calling the police
on each other i mean it's i'm asking the

2842
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,040
on each other i mean it's i'm asking the
 

2843
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,990
on each other i mean it's i'm asking the
same question in

2844
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,000
same question in
 

2845
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,230
same question in
a bunch of different directions out of

2846
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
a bunch of different directions out of
 

2847
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,309
a bunch of different directions out of
born out of my curiosity

2848
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
born out of my curiosity
 

2849
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,710
born out of my curiosity
is why is anarchy going to be

2850
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:48,720
is why is anarchy going to be
 

2851
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,190
is why is anarchy going to be
better at preventing the darker sides of

2852
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,200
better at preventing the darker sides of
 

2853
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,390
better at preventing the darker sides of
human nature which

2854
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,400
human nature which
 

2855
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,630
human nature which
presumably your criticism of government

2856
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:54,640
presumably your criticism of government
 

2857
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,510
presumably your criticism of government
because it's this because of

2858
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
because it's this because of
 

2859
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,710
because it's this because of
decentralization

2860
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:56,720
decentralization
 

2861
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,710
decentralization
so the darker side of human nature is an

2862
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:58,720
so the darker side of human nature is an
 

2863
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,990
so the darker side of human nature is an
extreme concern

2864
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,000
extreme concern
 

2865
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,470
extreme concern
anyone who says it's going to go away is

2866
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
anyone who says it's going to go away is
 

2867
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,190
anyone who says it's going to go away is
absurd

2868
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,200
absurd
 

2869
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,470
absurd
and fallacious i think that's a

2870
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,480
and fallacious i think that's a
 

2871
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,150
and fallacious i think that's a
non-starter when people say that

2872
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,160
non-starter when people say that
 

2873
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,670
non-starter when people say that
everyone's going to be good human beings

2874
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:07,680
everyone's going to be good human beings
 

2875
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,109
everyone's going to be good human beings
are basically animals we're capable of

cruel and what we would call inhumanity
 

2885
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,870
cruel and what we would call inhumanity
but we see it on a daily basis even

2886
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
but we see it on a daily basis even
 

2887
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,510
but we see it on a daily basis even
today

2888
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:17,520
today
 

2889
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,990
today
uh and what's interesting is the

2890
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:20,000
uh and what's interesting is the
 

2891
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,270
uh and what's interesting is the
corporate press

2892
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
corporate press
 

2893
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,589
corporate press
won't even tell you the darkest aspects

2894
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:23,599
won't even tell you the darkest aspects
 

2895
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,190
won't even tell you the darkest aspects
because that's too upsetting to people

2896
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
because that's too upsetting to people
 

2897
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,870
because that's too upsetting to people
so they'll tell you about atrocities and

2898
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
so they'll tell you about atrocities and
 

2899
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,190
so they'll tell you about atrocities and
horrors but only to a point

2900
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
horrors but only to a point
 

2901
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,550
horrors but only to a point
um and then when you actually do the

2902
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
um and then when you actually do the
 

2903
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,750
um and then when you actually do the

01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,550
i it's one of my top 10 books where he
goes through every 20 years how there's

4344
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:16,560
goes through every 20 years how there's
 

4345
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,149
goes through every 20 years how there's
a different population that say

4346
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:18,159
a different population that say
 

4347
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:19,750
a different population that say
it's the end of the world here's the

4348
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:19,760
it's the end of the world here's the
 

4349
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,750
it's the end of the world here's the
proof and very often the proof is

4350
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:21,760
proof and very often the proof is
 

4351
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,550
proof and very often the proof is
something that is

4352
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:22,560
something that is
 

4353
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,550

01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,390
kind of self-fulfilling where there's no
it's not falsifiable

4356
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
it's not falsifiable
 

4357
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,750

produce more of this we need to produce
 

6735
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,709
produce more of this we need to produce
less of this

6736
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:54,719
less of this
 

6737
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,390
less of this
without prices being able to adjust and

able to produce
 

6745
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,709
able to produce
uh effectively efficiently and also

6746
01:49:04,709 --> 01:49:04,719
uh effectively efficiently and also
 

6747
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:07,669
uh effectively efficiently and also
it is uh it turns people against each

6748
01:49:07,669 --> 01:49:07,679
it is uh it turns people against each
 

6749
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:07,990
it is uh it turns people against each
other

6750
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,000
other
 

6751
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,910
other
when you force people to interact when

6752
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:09,920
when you force people to interact when
 

6753
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,270
when you force people to interact when
you force them into relationships when

6754
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,280
you force them into relationships when
 

6755
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,109
you force them into relationships when
you force them into jobs

6756
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:13,119
you force them into jobs
 

6757
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:14,310
you force them into jobs
and you don't give them any choice when

6758
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
and you don't give them any choice when
 

6759
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,390
and you don't give them any choice when
there's a monopoly uh the consequence of

6760
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:16,400
there's a monopoly uh the consequence of
 

6761
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,070
there's a monopoly uh the consequence of
monopoly everyone's familiar with

6762
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:18,080
monopoly everyone's familiar with
 

6763
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,990
monopoly everyone's familiar with
ostensibly under capitalism but somehow

6764
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:20,000
ostensibly under capitalism but somehow
 

6765
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,430
ostensibly under capitalism but somehow
when it's a government monopoly

6766
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:21,440
when it's a government monopoly
 

6767
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,870
when it's a government monopoly
all those economic principles don't work

6768
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:22,880
all those economic principles don't work
 

6769
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,030
all those economic principles don't work
doesn't make any sense but there's force

6770
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:25,040
doesn't make any sense but there's force
 

6771
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,070
doesn't make any sense but there's force
in democracy too

6772
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:26,080
in democracy too
 

6773
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,430
in democracy too
it's just you're saying there's a

6774
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:27,440
it's just you're saying there's a
 

6775
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,229
it's just you're saying there's a
there's a bit more force in uh

6776
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:30,239
there's a bit more force in uh
 

6777
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:33,030
there's a bit more force in uh
in socialism yeah but that's interesting

6778
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:33,040
in socialism yeah but that's interesting
 

6779
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,229
in socialism yeah but that's interesting
that you say that there's not enough

6780
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:34,239
that you say that there's not enough
 

6781
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:36,790
that you say that there's not enough
information i mean that's ultimately

6782
01:49:36,790 --> 01:49:36,800
information i mean that's ultimately
 

6783
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,149
information i mean that's ultimately
you need to have really good data yes

6784
01:49:40,149 --> 01:49:40,159
you need to have really good data yes
 

6785
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:43,270
you need to have really good data yes
to achieve the goals of the system even

6786
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:43,280
to achieve the goals of the system even
 

6787
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:44,870
to achieve the goals of the system even
even if there's no corruption

6788
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:44,880
even if there's no corruption
 

6789
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,310
even if there's no corruption
right you just need to have the

6790
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:46,320
right you just need to have the
 

6791
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,070
right you just need to have the
information right which you can't

6792
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,080
information right which you can't
 

6793
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:52,149
information right which you can't
and capitalism provides you um

6794
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159

 

6795
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:55,109

like really strong real-time real-time

6796
01:49:55,109 --> 01:49:55,119
like really strong real-time real-time
 

6797
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:56,709
like really strong real-time real-time
information

6798
01:49:56,709 --> 01:49:56,719
information
 

6799
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:00,149
information
that um and if like

6800
01:50:00,149 --> 01:50:00,159
that um and if like
 

6801
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:02,550
that um and if like
capitalism at its best and cleanest

6802
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:02,560
capitalism at its best and cleanest
 

6803
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,310
capitalism at its best and cleanest
which is like perfect information is

6804
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:04,320
which is like perfect information is
 

6805
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:05,350
which is like perfect information is
available

6806
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:05,360
available
 

6807
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:08,149
available
there's no manipulation of information

6808
01:50:08,149 --> 01:50:08,159
there's no manipulation of information
 

6809
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:08,709
there's no manipulation of information
that's what

6810
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:08,719
that's what
 

6811
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:11,589
that's what
you know that's one of the problems okay

6812
01:50:11,589 --> 01:50:11,599
you know that's one of the problems okay
 

6813
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:13,669
you know that's one of the problems okay
can we talk about some candidates

6814
01:50:13,669 --> 01:50:13,679
can we talk about some candidates
 

6815
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:15,510
can we talk about some candidates
the ones we got and possible

6816
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:15,520
the ones we got and possible
 

6817
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,109
the ones we got and possible
alternatives

6818
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:17,119
alternatives
 

6819
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:20,950
alternatives
so one question i have is why

6820
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:20,960
so one question i have is why
 

6821
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,750
so one question i have is why
do we have within this system why do we

6822
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:23,760
do we have within this system why do we
 

6823
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,229
do we have within this system why do we
have the candidates we have

6824
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:26,239
have the candidates we have
 

6825
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:30,950
have the candidates we have
is it seems um maybe you can correct me

6826
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
is it seems um maybe you can correct me
 

6827
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:35,189
is it seems um maybe you can correct me
highly unsatisfactory like the

6828
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:35,199
highly unsatisfactory like the
 

6829
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,270
highly unsatisfactory like the
like is anyone actually excited about

6830
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:37,280
like is anyone actually excited about
 

6831
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,430
like is anyone actually excited about
our current candidates

6832
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:39,440
our current candidates
 

6833
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,070
our current candidates
i'm kind of excited because no matter

who wins the elections can be hilarious
so that is something that i'm excited

6838
01:50:45,669 --> 01:50:45,679
so that is something that i'm excited
 

6839
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,750
so that is something that i'm excited
about from uh from a human perspective

6840
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:47,760
about from uh from a human perspective
 

6841
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,470
about from uh from a human perspective
yeah

6842
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:48,480
yeah
 

6843
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,149
yeah
is that what the whole system is uh so

6844
01:50:50,149 --> 01:50:50,159
is that what the whole system is uh so
 

6845
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:52,070
is that what the whole system is uh so
that's the one theory of the case

6846
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:52,080
that's the one theory of the case
 

6847
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,470
that's the one theory of the case
is the entire thing is optimized for

6848
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:54,480
is the entire thing is optimized for
 

6849
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,830
is the entire thing is optimized for
viewership

6850
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:55,840
viewership
 

6851
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:59,270
viewership
yeah and uh excitement by definitions of

6852
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
yeah and uh excitement by definitions of
 

6853
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,430
yeah and uh excitement by definitions of
like the reality show kind of excitement

6854
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:01,440
like the reality show kind of excitement
 

6855
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,709
like the reality show kind of excitement
i think it is if you look at what

6856
01:51:04,709 --> 01:51:04,719
i think it is if you look at what
 

6857
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:06,790
i think it is if you look at what
happened with brett kavanaugh

6858
01:51:06,790 --> 01:51:06,800
happened with brett kavanaugh
 

6859
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,470
happened with brett kavanaugh
this is not a career that would

6860
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:10,480
this is not a career that would
 

6861
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,270
this is not a career that would
draw people who are you might say

6862
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:13,280
draw people who are you might say
 

6863
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,550
draw people who are you might say
quality

6864
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:14,560
quality
 

6865
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,990
quality
because no matter who they are there

6866
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:16,000
because no matter who they are there
 

6867
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,830
because no matter who they are there
would be a huge incentive from the other

6868
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:17,840
would be a huge incentive from the other
 

6869
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:18,709
would be a huge incentive from the other
team

6870
01:51:18,709 --> 01:51:18,719
team
 

6871
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,870
team
to denigrate them and humiliate them in

6872
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:20,880
to denigrate them and humiliate them in
 

6873
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,390
to denigrate them and humiliate them in
the worst possible ways because

6874
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:22,400
the worst possible ways because
 

6875
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:25,109
the worst possible ways because
as the two teams lose their legitimacy

6876
01:51:25,109 --> 01:51:25,119
as the two teams lose their legitimacy
 

6877
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:25,510
as the two teams lose their legitimacy
among

6878
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:25,520
among
 

6879
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,510
among
gen pop it's going to get harder and

6880
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:27,520
gen pop it's going to get harder and
 

6881
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,870
gen pop it's going to get harder and
harder for them to maintain

6882
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:28,880
harder for them to maintain
 

6883
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,790
harder for them to maintain
any kind of claims to authority which is

6884
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:30,800
any kind of claims to authority which is
 

6885
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,910
any kind of claims to authority which is
something i like

6886
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:31,920
something i like
 

6887
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:34,070
something i like
but which does kind of play out in you

6888
01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:34,080
but which does kind of play out in you
 

6889
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,990
but which does kind of play out in you
know certain nefarious ways

6890
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,000
know certain nefarious ways
 

6891
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,149
know certain nefarious ways
so people the best of the best are not

6892
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:38,159
so people the best of the best are not
 

6893
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:39,990
so people the best of the best are not
going to want to be politicians

6894
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:40,000
going to want to be politicians
 

6895
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,550
going to want to be politicians

8469
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,589
now when ran says things that are too
goofy for them they say

goofy for them they say
oh that's not objectivism that's her

8472
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:09,920
oh that's not objectivism that's her

8477
02:16:15,119 --> 02:16:16,709
she did not have these lines objectivism
was always defined as

02:16:16,709 --> 02:16:16,719
was always defined as
 

8479
02:16:16,719 --> 02:16:18,790
was always defined as
ein rand's writings plus the additional

8480
02:16:18,790 --> 02:16:18,800
ein rand's writings plus the additional
 

8481
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:20,069
ein rand's writings plus the additional

essays in her books
 

8483
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:22,229
essays in her books
so if this was in part of those books

8484
02:16:22,229 --> 02:16:22,239
so if this was in part of those books
 

8485
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:24,069
so if this was in part of those books
this counts as official objectivism but

8486
02:16:24,069 --> 02:16:24,079
this counts as official objectivism but
 

8487
02:16:24,079 --> 02:16:24,629
this counts as official objectivism but
they pretend

02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:26,629
they pretend
otherwise so that's another example plus

8490
02:16:26,629 --> 02:16:26,639
otherwise so that's another example plus
 

8491

more limited information
yeah but this is the fundamental thing

9130

difficult conversations like that's a
good starting point because if you start

9210
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:36,080
good starting point because if you start
 

9211
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:39,349
good starting point because if you start

there's uh
the only conversations that have been

9244
02:28:10,070 --> 02:28:10,080
the only conversations that have been
 

9245
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:12,070
the only conversations that have been
nuanced about it that i've heard

9246
02:28:12,070 --> 02:28:12,080
nuanced about it that i've heard
 

9247
02:28:12,080 --> 02:28:14,389
nuanced about it that i've heard
is in the podcasting medium which is the

9248
02:28:14,389 --> 02:28:14,399
is in the podcasting medium which is the
 

9249
02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:15,990
is in the podcasting medium which is the
magic of podcasting which

9250
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:16,000
magic of podcasting which
 

9251
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,110
magic of podcasting which
is great but that that's the

9252
02:28:19,110 --> 02:28:19,120
is great but that that's the
 

9253
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:22,550
is great but that that's the
downside of podcasting is it's a

9254
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:22,560
downside of podcasting is it's a
 

9255
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:24,630
downside of podcasting is it's a
very small number of people even if it's

9256
02:28:24,630 --> 02:28:24,640
very small number of people even if it's
 

9257
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:25,830
very small number of people even if it's
in the thousands

9258
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:25,840
in the thousands
 

9259
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:28,150
in the thousands
it's still small and then there's

9260
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:28,160
it's still small and then there's
 

9261
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,429
it's still small and then there's
millions of people on

9262
02:28:29,429 --> 02:28:29,439
millions of people on
 

9263
02:28:29,439 --> 02:28:31,670
millions of people on
social media and they're not having

nuanced conversation at all they're not
capable of it

02:28:33,910 --> 02:28:33,920
capable of it
 

9269
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:34,950
capable of it
that's the difference in you that's

9270
02:28:34,950 --> 02:28:34,960
that's the difference in you that's

02:28:37,349 --> 02:28:37,359
that's there's
 

9275
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:38,710
that's there's
no data that's happening and then both

9276

no data that's happening and then both
 

9277
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:41,429
no data that's happening and then both
of us aren't being not scientific

9278
02:28:41,429 --> 02:28:41,439
of us aren't being not scientific
 

9279
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:42,630
of us aren't being not scientific
you don't have data to support your

uh humanities if you just look at the
 

10555
02:50:08,800 --> 02:50:11,429
uh humanities if you just look at the
percentage of universities it's still

10556
02:50:11,429 --> 02:50:11,439
percentage of universities it's still
 

10557
02:50:11,439 --> 02:50:14,150
percentage of universities it's still
a minority percentage and i would

10558
02:50:14,150 --> 02:50:14,160
a minority percentage and i would
 

10559
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:16,150
a minority percentage and i would
actually draw different

10560
02:50:16,150 --> 02:50:16,160
actually draw different
 

10561
02:50:16,160 --> 02:50:17,429
actually draw different
i think they serve very different

10562
02:50:17,429 --> 02:50:17,439
i think they serve very different
 

10563
02:50:17,439 --> 02:50:20,070
i think they serve very different
purposes sure and

10564
02:50:20,070 --> 02:50:20,080
purposes sure and
 

10565
02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:21,670
purposes sure and
that's actually a broken part about

10566
02:50:21,670 --> 02:50:21,680
that's actually a broken part about
 

10567
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:23,830
that's actually a broken part about
universities about like

10568
02:50:23,830 --> 02:50:23,840
universities about like
 

10569
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:27,030
universities about like
why why is some of the best research in

10570
02:50:27,030 --> 02:50:27,040
why why is some of the best research in
 

10571
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:28,309
why why is some of the best research in
the world done at universities that

10572
02:50:28,309 --> 02:50:28,319
the world done at universities that
 

10573
02:50:28,319 --> 02:50:29,110
the world done at universities that
doesn't

10574
02:50:29,110 --> 02:50:29,120
doesn't
 

10575
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:32,469
doesn't
like there might be a different like mit

10576
02:50:32,469 --> 02:50:32,479
like there might be a different like mit
 

10577
02:50:32,479 --> 02:50:34,710
like there might be a different like mit
it feels weird that a faculty yeah these

10578
02:50:34,710 --> 02:50:34,720
it feels weird that a faculty yeah these
 

10579
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:35,990
it feels weird that a faculty yeah these
are conceptually different things like

10580
02:50:35,990 --> 02:50:36,000
are conceptually different things like
 

10581
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,510
are conceptually different things like
we do research and we teach why is this

10582
02:50:37,510 --> 02:50:37,520
we do research and we teach why is this
 

10583
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:39,349
we do research and we teach why is this
the same yeah it feels weird but that's

10584
02:50:39,349 --> 02:50:39,359
the same yeah it feels weird but that's

just but but i'm also i'm coming to like
the defense

10588
02:50:42,389 --> 02:50:42,399
the defense
 

10589
02:50:42,399 --> 02:50:45,910
the defense
of the engineers that never talk about

10590
02:50:45,910 --> 02:50:45,920
of the engineers that never talk about
 

10591
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:46,950
of the engineers that never talk about
i'm not like

10592

i'm not like
 

10593

already see it but the
but the engineering departments were

10624
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:14,160
but the engineering departments were
 

10625
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:15,670
but the engineering departments were
like i believe

10626
02:51:15,670 --> 02:51:15,680
like i believe
 

10627
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:18,389

02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:44,469
so if you're calling for mercy that is
not how i'm wired

10660
02:51:44,469 --> 02:51:44,479
not how i'm wired
 

10661
02:51:44,479 --> 02:51:47,190
not how i'm wired
but i'm not closing the door yeah i'm

10662
02:51:47,190 --> 02:51:47,200
but i'm not closing the door yeah i'm
 

10663
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:48,389
but i'm not closing the door yeah i'm
actually realizing now

10664
02:51:48,389 --> 02:51:48,399
actually realizing now
 

10665
02:51:48,399 --> 02:51:50,710
actually realizing now
so for people listening to this i'll

10666
02:51:50,710 --> 02:51:50,720
so for people listening to this i'll
 

10667
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:52,550
so for people listening to this i'll
probably prepend this and saying that

10668
02:51:52,550 --> 02:51:52,560
probably prepend this and saying that
 

10669
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:55,190
probably prepend this and saying that
i'm even slower than usual i didn't

10670
02:51:55,190 --> 02:51:55,200
i'm even slower than usual i didn't
 

10671

but i feel i'm actually realizing just
 

10675
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:00,150
but i feel i'm actually realizing just
how slow i

10676
02:52:00,150 --> 02:52:00,160
how slow i
 

10677
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:03,030
how slow i
am and how much preparation i need to do

10678
02:52:03,030 --> 02:52:03,040
am and how much preparation i need to do
 

10679
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:03,429
am and how much preparation i need to do
in

i better come prepared i don't think you

10686
02:52:08,870 --> 02:52:08,880
i better come prepared i don't think you
 

10687
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,309
i better come prepared i don't think you
need to defend them i think i'm

10688
02:52:10,309 --> 02:52:10,319
need to defend them i think i'm
 

10689

they're working there instead of going

10750
02:53:05,269 --> 02:53:05,279
they're working there instead of going
 

10751
02:53:05,279 --> 02:53:07,510
they're working there instead of going
to college there it's possible but

10752
02:53:07,510 --> 02:53:07,520
to college there it's possible but
 

10753
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:09,030
to college there it's possible but
it's going against tradition and so you

have to build new institutions and
 

10757
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:12,710
have to build new institutions and
uh and then have these engineers

10758
02:53:12,710 --> 02:53:12,720
uh and then have these engineers
 

10759
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:14,469
uh and then have these engineers
building new things that's crazy

10760
02:53:14,469 --> 02:53:14,479
building new things that's crazy
 

10761
02:53:14,479 --> 02:53:16,469
building new things that's crazy
yeah these research engineers where

yeah these research engineers where
 

10763
02:53:16,479 --> 02:53:17,670
yeah these research engineers where
they're going to be building

10764

03:07:42,950 --> 03:07:42,960
so in some sense you are going to feel
 

11649
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:44,150
so in some sense you are going to feel
like a fraud because you're like what i

11650
03:07:44,150 --> 03:07:44,160
like a fraud because you're like what i
 

11651
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:45,110
like a fraud because you're like what i

11652
03:07:45,110 --> 03:07:45,120
don't have any training for this i have
 

11653
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:46,309
don't have any training for this i have
a training for a scientist

11654
03:07:46,309 --> 03:07:46,319
a training for a scientist
 

11655
03:07:46,319 --> 03:07:47,910
a training for a scientist
i can talk about artificial intelligence

11656
03:07:47,910 --> 03:07:47,920
i can talk about artificial intelligence
 

11657
03:07:47,920 --> 03:07:49,830
i can talk about artificial intelligence
for literally hours but in terms of this

11658
03:07:49,830 --> 03:07:49,840
for literally hours but in terms of this
 

11659
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:51,030
for literally hours but in terms of this
like i don't know what i'm doing i'm

11660
03:07:51,030 --> 03:07:51,040
like i don't know what i'm doing i'm
 

11661
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:51,670
like i don't know what i'm doing i'm
kind of

11662
03:07:51,670 --> 03:07:51,680
kind of
 

11663
03:07:51,680 --> 03:07:54,150
kind of
so when they call you a fake it's like

11664
03:07:54,150 --> 03:07:54,160
so when they call you a fake it's like
 

11665
03:07:54,160 --> 03:07:55,590
so when they call you a fake it's like
yeah you're kind of right because like i

11666
03:07:55,590 --> 03:07:55,600
yeah you're kind of right because like i
 

11667
03:07:55,600 --> 03:07:58,070
yeah you're kind of right because like i
i did kind of stumble into this and this

11668
03:07:58,070 --> 03:07:58,080
i did kind of stumble into this and this
 

11669
03:07:58,080 --> 03:07:59,750
i did kind of stumble into this and this
is not my pedigree

11670
03:07:59,750 --> 03:07:59,760
is not my pedigree
 

11671
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:01,750
is not my pedigree
so i think that kind of probably speaks

11672
03:08:01,750 --> 03:08:01,760
so i think that kind of probably speaks
 

11673
03:08:01,760 --> 03:08:03,269
so i think that kind of probably speaks
to you on some level well but they're

11674
03:08:03,269 --> 03:08:03,279
to you on some level well but they're
 

11675
03:08:03,279 --> 03:08:04,950
to you on some level well but they're
they're attacking not the podcasting

11676
03:08:04,950 --> 03:08:04,960
they're attacking not the podcasting
 

11677
03:08:04,960 --> 03:08:06,950
they're attacking not the podcasting
thing but more like the same

11678
03:08:06,950 --> 03:08:06,960
thing but more like the same
 

11679
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:08,790
thing but more like the same
thing people call elon musk fraud too

11680
03:08:08,790 --> 03:08:08,800
thing people call elon musk fraud too
 

11681
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:10,309
thing people call elon musk fraud too
which guy that that's the way i

11682
03:08:10,309 --> 03:08:10,319
which guy that that's the way i
 

11683
03:08:10,319 --> 03:08:11,429
which guy that that's the way i
rationalize it like

11684
03:08:11,429 --> 03:08:11,439
rationalize it like
 

11685
03:08:11,439 --> 03:08:13,990
rationalize it like
well if they're calling him a fraud and

11686
03:08:13,990 --> 03:08:14,000
well if they're calling him a fraud and
 

11687
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,630
well if they're calling him a fraud and
they're calling me a fraud

11688
03:08:16,630 --> 03:08:16,640
they're calling me a fraud
 

11689
03:08:16,640 --> 03:08:19,269
they're calling me a fraud
that like even if you have rockets that

11690
03:08:19,269 --> 03:08:19,279
that like even if you have rockets that
 

11691
03:08:19,279 --> 03:08:20,230
that like even if you have rockets that
go into

11692
03:08:20,230 --> 03:08:20,240
go into
 

11693
03:08:20,240 --> 03:08:23,349
go into
like if you successfully have rockets uh

11694
03:08:23,349 --> 03:08:23,359
like if you successfully have rockets uh
 

11695
03:08:23,359 --> 03:08:26,230
like if you successfully have rockets uh
landing back on earth usable rockets

11696
03:08:26,230 --> 03:08:26,240
landing back on earth usable rockets
 

11697
03:08:26,240 --> 03:08:28,389
landing back on earth usable rockets
you're still being called a fraud

11698
03:08:28,389 --> 03:08:28,399
you're still being called a fraud
 

11699
03:08:28,399 --> 03:08:31,590
you're still being called a fraud
then it's okay not necessarily it could

11700
03:08:31,590 --> 03:08:31,600
then it's okay not necessarily it could
 

11701
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:34,950
then it's okay not necessarily it could
be that he's not a fraud you really are

11702
03:08:34,950 --> 03:08:34,960
be that he's not a fraud you really are
 

11703
03:08:34,960 --> 03:08:36,790
be that he's not a fraud you really are
that's but it's not resonating with you

11704
03:08:36,790 --> 03:08:36,800
that's but it's not resonating with you
 

11705
03:08:36,800 --> 03:08:38,150
that's but it's not resonating with you
because your brain knows the logic so

11706
03:08:38,150 --> 03:08:38,160
because your brain knows the logic so
 

11707

because your brain knows the logic so
you can right

11708

you can right
 

11709
03:08:39,200 --> 03:08:42,469
