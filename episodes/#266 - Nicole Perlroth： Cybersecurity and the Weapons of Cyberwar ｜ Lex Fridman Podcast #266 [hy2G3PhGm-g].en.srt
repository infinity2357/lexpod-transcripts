57
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,310
forensic investigators
and uh mercenaries so let's talk about

58
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
and uh mercenaries so let's talk about
 

59
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,070
and uh mercenaries so let's talk about
cyber security and

60
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
cyber security and
 

61
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,789
cyber security and
cyber war start with the basics what is

62
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
cyber war start with the basics what is
 

63
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,429
cyber war start with the basics what is
a zero day vulnerability

64
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
a zero day vulnerability
 

65
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,390
a zero day vulnerability
and then

66
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
and then
 

67
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,070
and then
a zero day exploit or attack

68
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
a zero day exploit or attack
 

69
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,190
a zero day exploit or attack
so

70
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
so
 

71
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,590
so
at the most basic level let's say i'm a

72
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
at the most basic level let's say i'm a
 

73
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,870
at the most basic level let's say i'm a
hacker and i find a bug in your iphone

74
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
hacker and i find a bug in your iphone
 

75
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,870
hacker and i find a bug in your iphone
ios software that no one else knows

ios software that no one else knows
 

77
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,030
ios software that no one else knows
about especially apple

78
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
about especially apple
 

79
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,950
about especially apple
that's called a zero day because the

80
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
that's called a zero day because the
 

81
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,789
that's called a zero day because the
minute it's discovered engineers have

82
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
minute it's discovered engineers have
 

83
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,590
minute it's discovered engineers have
had zero days to fix it

84
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
had zero days to fix it
 

85
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,109
had zero days to fix it
if i

86
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
if i
 

87
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,030
if i
can study that zero day i could

88
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
can study that zero day i could
 

89
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,830
can study that zero day i could
potentially write a program to exploit

90
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
potentially write a program to exploit
 

91
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,789
potentially write a program to exploit
it

92
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
it
 

93
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,109
it
and that program would be called a zero

94
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
and that program would be called a zero
 

95
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,710
and that program would be called a zero
day exploit

96
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
day exploit
 

97
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,069
day exploit
and for ios the dream

98
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
and for ios the dream
 

99
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,149
and for ios the dream
is that you craft a zero day exploit

100
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
is that you craft a zero day exploit
 

101
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,789
is that you craft a zero day exploit
that can remotely exploit someone else's

102
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
that can remotely exploit someone else's
 

103
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,109
that can remotely exploit someone else's
iphone without them ever knowing about

104
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
iphone without them ever knowing about
 

105
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,749
iphone without them ever knowing about
it

106
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
it
 

107
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,910
it
and you can capture their location you

108
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
and you can capture their location you
 

109
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,270
and you can capture their location you
can capture

110
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
can capture
 

111
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,670
can capture
their contacts that record their

112
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
their contacts that record their
 

113
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,830
their contacts that record their
telephone calls record their camera

114
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
telephone calls record their camera
 

115
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,990
telephone calls record their camera
without them knowing about it basically

116
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
without them knowing about it basically
 

117
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,110
without them knowing about it basically
you can put an invisible ankle bracelet

118
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
you can put an invisible ankle bracelet
 

119
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,190
you can put an invisible ankle bracelet
on someone without them knowing and you

120
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
on someone without them knowing and you
 

121
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,589
on someone without them knowing and you
can see why that capability that zero

122
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
can see why that capability that zero
 

123
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,390
can see why that capability that zero
day exploit would have immense value

124
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
day exploit would have immense value
 

125
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,670
day exploit would have immense value
for a spy agency or a government that

126
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
for a spy agency or a government that
 

127
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,990
for a spy agency or a government that
wants to monitor its critics

128
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
wants to monitor its critics
 

129
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,510
wants to monitor its critics
or dissidents

130
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
or dissidents
 

131
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,150
or dissidents
and so there's a very lucrative market

132
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
and so there's a very lucrative market
 

133
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,630
and so there's a very lucrative market
now for zero day exploits so you said a

134
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
now for zero day exploits so you said a
 

135
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,150
now for zero day exploits so you said a
few things there one is ios why ios

136
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
few things there one is ios why ios
 

137
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,309
few things there one is ios why ios
which operating system which one is the

138
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
which operating system which one is the
 

139
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,470
which operating system which one is the
sexier thing to try to get to or the

140
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
sexier thing to try to get to or the
 

141
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,550
sexier thing to try to get to or the
most impactful thing

142
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
most impactful thing
 

143
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,990
most impactful thing
and uh the other thing you mentioned is

144
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
and uh the other thing you mentioned is
 

145
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,350
and uh the other thing you mentioned is
remote

146
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
remote
 

147
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,830
remote
versus like having to actually come in

148
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
versus like having to actually come in
 

149
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,589
versus like having to actually come in
physical contact with it is that the

150
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
physical contact with it is that the
 

151
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,790
physical contact with it is that the
distinction

152
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
distinction
 

153
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,589
distinction
so

154
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
so
 

155
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,710
so

is actually higher the value of that is
 

173
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,790
is actually higher the value of that is
now higher on this underground market

174
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
now higher on this underground market
 

175
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,470
now higher on this underground market
for zero day exploits

176
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
for zero day exploits
 

177
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,830
for zero day exploits
than an iphone ios exploit so things are

178
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
than an iphone ios exploit so things are
 

179
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,509
than an iphone ios exploit so things are
changing so the

180
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
changing so the
 

181
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,070
changing so the
there's probably more android devices so

182
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
there's probably more android devices so
 

183
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,509
there's probably more android devices so
that's why it's better

184
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
that's why it's better
 

185
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,430
that's why it's better
but then the iphone side

186
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
but then the iphone side
 

187
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,990
but then the iphone side
if i so i'm an android person

188
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
if i so i'm an android person
 

189
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,390
if i so i'm an android person
because i'm a man of the people

190
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
because i'm a man of the people
 

191
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,390
because i'm a man of the people
but it seems like all the elites use

192
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
but it seems like all the elites use
 

193
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,309
but it seems like all the elites use
iphone all the people at nice dinner

194
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
iphone all the people at nice dinner
 

195
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,830
iphone all the people at nice dinner
parties so

196
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
parties so
 

197
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,149
parties so
uh is that is that the reason that like

198
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
uh is that is that the reason that like
 

199
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,149
uh is that is that the reason that like
the more powerful people use iphones is

200
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
the more powerful people use iphones is
 

201
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,789
the more powerful people use iphones is
that why i don't think so i actually so

202
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
that why i don't think so i actually so
 

203
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,710
that why i don't think so i actually so
it was about two years ago that the

204
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
it was about two years ago that the
 

205
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,030
it was about two years ago that the
prices flipped it used to be

206
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
prices flipped it used to be
 

207
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,789
prices flipped it used to be
that if you could craft a remote

208
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
that if you could craft a remote
 

209
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,949
that if you could craft a remote
zero click

210
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959

exploit for ios
 

213
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,270
exploit for ios
then that was about as good as it gets

214
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
then that was about as good as it gets
 

215
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,030
then that was about as good as it gets
you could sell that

216
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
you could sell that
 

217
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,429
you could sell that
to a zero day broker

218
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
to a zero day broker
 

219
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,589
to a zero day broker
for two million dollars

220
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
for two million dollars
 

221
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,670
for two million dollars
the caveat is you can never tell anyone

222
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
the caveat is you can never tell anyone
 

223
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,149
the caveat is you can never tell anyone
about it because the minute you tell

about it because the minute you tell

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,710
about it because the minute you tell
someone about it apple learns about it

someone about it apple learns about it
 

227

someone about it apple learns about it
they patch it and that 2.5 million

228
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
they patch it and that 2.5 million
 

229
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,270
they patch it and that 2.5 million
dollar investment that that zero day

so a couple years ago

234
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
so a couple years ago
 

235
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,830
so a couple years ago
and don't quote me on the prices but

236
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
and don't quote me on the prices but
 

237
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,310
and don't quote me on the prices but
an android zero click

238
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
an android zero click

remote exploit for the first time topped
 

241
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,629
remote exploit for the first time topped
the ios and actually a lot of people's

242
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
the ios and actually a lot of people's
 

243
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,990
the ios and actually a lot of people's
read on that

244
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
read on that
 

245
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,110
read on that
was that it might be

246
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
was that it might be
 

247
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,230
was that it might be
a sign that apple security

248
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
a sign that apple security
 

249
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,070
a sign that apple security
was falling

250
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
was falling
 

251
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,950
was falling
and that it might actually be easier

252
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
and that it might actually be easier
 

253
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,629
and that it might actually be easier
to find

254
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
to find
 

255
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,270
to find
an ios zero-day exploit than find an

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
an ios zero-day exploit than find an
 

257
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,350
an ios zero-day exploit than find an
android zero-day exploit the other thing

258
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
android zero-day exploit the other thing
 

259
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,950
android zero-day exploit the other thing
is market share

260
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
is market share
 

261
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,390
is market share
there are just more people around the

262
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
there are just more people around the
 

263
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,550
there are just more people around the
world that use android

264
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
world that use android
 

265
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,590
world that use android
and a lot of governments that are paying

266
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
and a lot of governments that are paying
 

267
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,070
and a lot of governments that are paying
top dollar for zero day exploits these

268
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
top dollar for zero day exploits these
 

269
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,189

days
 

271
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,070

are deep pocketed governments in the

are deep pocketed governments in the
 

273
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,029
are deep pocketed governments in the
gulf

274

gulf
 

275
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,110
gulf
that want to use these exploits to

276
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
that want to use these exploits to
 

277
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,510
that want to use these exploits to
monitor their own citizens monitor their

monitor their own citizens monitor their

critics
 

281
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,550
critics
and so it's not necessarily that they're

282
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
and so it's not necessarily that they're
 

283
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,469
and so it's not necessarily that they're
trying to find elites

284
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
trying to find elites
 

285
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,310
trying to find elites
it's that they want to find out who

286
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
it's that they want to find out who
 

287
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,070
it's that they want to find out who
these people are that are criticizing

288
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
these people are that are criticizing
 

289
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,070
these people are that are criticizing
them or perhaps planning the next arab

290
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080

spring
 

293
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,830
spring
so in your experience are most of these

294
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
so in your experience are most of these
 

295
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,590
so in your experience are most of these
attack targeted to cover a large

296
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
attack targeted to cover a large
 

297
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,909
attack targeted to cover a large
population or is there

298
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919

299
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,270

specific individuals
 

303
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,710
specific individuals
so i think it's both

304
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
so i think it's both
 

305
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,189
so i think it's both
some of the zero day exploits that have

some of the zero day exploits that have
 

307
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,790
some of the zero day exploits that have
fetched top dollar

308
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
fetched top dollar

that i've heard of in my reporting in
 

311
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,870
that i've heard of in my reporting in
the united states were highly targeted

312
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
the united states were highly targeted
 

313
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,029
the united states were highly targeted
you know there was a potential terrorist

314
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
you know there was a potential terrorist
 

315
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,550

next 24 hours they approached hackers

320
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
next 24 hours they approached hackers
 

321
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,710
next 24 hours they approached hackers
and say we'll pay you

322
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
and say we'll pay you
 

323
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,590
and say we'll pay you
x millions of dollars if you can do this

x millions of dollars if you can do this
 

325
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,670
x millions of dollars if you can do this
but then you look at

326
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
but then you look at
 

327
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,469
but then you look at
when we've discovered ios zero day

328
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
when we've discovered ios zero day
 

329
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,629
when we've discovered ios zero day

some of them have been targeting large

some of them have been targeting large

so a couple years ago there was a

336
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
so a couple years ago there was a
 

337
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,629
so a couple years ago there was a

aimed at uyghurs
 

345
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,670
aimed at uyghurs
and you could access it all over the

346

uyghur diaspora
 

365
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,550
uyghur diaspora
would have gotten infected with this

366
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
would have gotten infected with this
 

367
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,830
would have gotten infected with this
zero-day exploit so in that case you

368
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
zero-day exploit so in that case you
 

369
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,830
zero-day exploit so in that case you
know they were

370
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
know they were
 

371
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,749
know they were
targeting huge swaths of this one

is it the challenge

388
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
is it the challenge
 

389
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,990

these are big philosophical human
 

393
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,350
these are big philosophical human
questions i guess

394
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
questions i guess
 

395
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,230
questions i guess
so these are the questions i set out to

396
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
so these are the questions i set out to
 

397
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,230
so these are the questions i set out to
answer for my book

question
 

421
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,430
question
you know it started out

422
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
you know it started out
 

423
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,469
you know it started out
in the 80s and 90s when hackers

424
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
in the 80s and 90s when hackers
 

425
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,710
in the 80s and 90s when hackers
were just finding holes and bugs and

426
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
were just finding holes and bugs and
 

427
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,869
were just finding holes and bugs and
software for curiosity's sake really as

and some of them would go to the tech
 

433
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,150
and some of them would go to the tech
companies like microsoft or sun

or oracle
and they'd say hey i just found this

440
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
and they'd say hey i just found this
 

441
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,909
and they'd say hey i just found this
zero day in your software and i can use

442
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
zero day in your software and i can use
 

443
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,070
zero day in your software and i can use
it to break into nasa

444
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
it to break into nasa
 

445

wasn't thank you so much for pointing
 

449
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,950
wasn't thank you so much for pointing
out this flaw and our software we'll get

450
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
out this flaw and our software we'll get
 

451
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,110
out this flaw and our software we'll get
it fixed as soon as possible

452
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
it fixed as soon as possible
 

453
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,150
it fixed as soon as possible
it was

454
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
it was
 

455
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,469
it was
don't ever poke around our software ever

456
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
don't ever poke around our software ever
 

457
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,710
don't ever poke around our software ever
again or we'll stick our general counsel

458
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
again or we'll stick our general counsel
 

459
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,070
again or we'll stick our general counsel
on you

460
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
on you

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,110
on you
and

462
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
and
 

463
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,070
and
that was really sort of the common

464
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
that was really sort of the common
 

465
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,309
that was really sort of the common
thread for years

466
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
thread for years
 

467
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,870
thread for years
and so hackers who set out to do the

468
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
and so hackers who set out to do the
 

469
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,310
and so hackers who set out to do the
right thing

470
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
right thing
 

471
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,709
right thing
were basically told to

472
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
were basically told to
 

473
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,990
were basically told to
shut up and stop doing what you're doing

shut up and stop doing what you're doing
 

475
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,269
shut up and stop doing what you're doing
and what happened next was

476
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
and what happened next was
 

477
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,030
and what happened next was
they basically started trading this

478
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
they basically started trading this
 

479
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,949
they basically started trading this

482
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
and interview people from those early
 

483
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,550
and interview people from those early
days

484

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
and then they'll quietly tell you what
 

835
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,030
and then they'll quietly tell you what
they found

836
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
they found
 

837
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,949
they found
and i think that's a really positive

838
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
and i think that's a really positive
 

839
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,189
and i think that's a really positive
development and actually the department

840
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
development and actually the department
 

841
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,629
development and actually the department
of defense hired all three of those uh

842
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
of defense hired all three of those uh
 

843
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,710
of defense hired all three of those uh
companies i just mentioned to help

844
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
companies i just mentioned to help
 

845
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,550
companies i just mentioned to help
secure their systems now i think they're

846
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
secure their systems now i think they're
 

847
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,069
secure their systems now i think they're
still a little timid

848
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
still a little timid
 

849
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,310
still a little timid
in terms of letting those hackers into

850
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
in terms of letting those hackers into
 

851
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,990
in terms of letting those hackers into
the really sensitive

852
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
the really sensitive
 

853
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,230
the really sensitive
high side classified stuff

854
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
high side classified stuff
 

855
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,030
high side classified stuff
but you know baby steps

856
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
but you know baby steps
 

857
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,710
but you know baby steps
just to understand what you were saying

858
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
just to understand what you were saying
 

859
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,189
just to understand what you were saying
you think it's some impossible for

860
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
you think it's some impossible for
 

861
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,430
you think it's some impossible for
companies to financially compete with

862
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
companies to financially compete with
 

863
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,829
companies to financially compete with
the zero day brokers with governments

864
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
the zero day brokers with governments
 

865
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,910
the zero day brokers with governments
so like the defense can't outpay

866
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
so like the defense can't outpay
 

867
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,389
so like the defense can't outpay
the um the hackers it's interesting you

868
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
the um the hackers it's interesting you
 

869
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,829
the um the hackers it's interesting you
know they

870
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
know they
 

871
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,790
know they
they shouldn't out pay them because what

872
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
they shouldn't out pay them because what
 

873
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,069
they shouldn't out pay them because what
would happen if they started offering

874
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
would happen if they started offering
 

875
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,189
would happen if they started offering
2.5 million dollars at apple

876
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
2.5 million dollars at apple
 

877
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,389
2.5 million dollars at apple
for any you know zero day exploit that

878
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
for any you know zero day exploit that
 

879
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,629
for any you know zero day exploit that
governments would pay that much for

880
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
governments would pay that much for
 

881
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,550
governments would pay that much for
is their own engineers would say why the

882
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
is their own engineers would say why the
 

883
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,269
is their own engineers would say why the
hell am i working you know for less than

884
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
hell am i working you know for less than
 

885
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,150
hell am i working you know for less than
that

886
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
that
 

887
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,310
that
and and doing my nine to five every day

888
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,320
and and doing my nine to five every day
 

889
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,550
and and doing my nine to five every day
so you would create a perverse incentive

890
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
so you would create a perverse incentive
 

891
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,790
so you would create a perverse incentive
and i didn't i didn't think about that

892
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
and i didn't i didn't think about that
 

893
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,550
and i didn't i didn't think about that
until i started this research and i

894
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
until i started this research and i
 

895
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,550
until i started this research and i
realized okay yeah that makes sense you

896
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
realized okay yeah that makes sense you
 

897
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,389
realized okay yeah that makes sense you
don't want to incentivize offense so

898
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
don't want to incentivize offense so
 

899
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,350
don't want to incentivize offense so
much that it's to your own detriment

900
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
much that it's to your own detriment
 

901
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,350
much that it's to your own detriment
and so i think what they have though

902
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
and so i think what they have though
 

903
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,110
and so i think what they have though
what the companies have on government

904
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
what the companies have on government
 

905
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,550
what the companies have on government
agencies

906
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
agencies
 

907
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,509
agencies
is

908
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
is
 

909
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,990
is
if they pay you you get to talk about it

910
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
if they pay you you get to talk about it
 

911
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,310
if they pay you you get to talk about it
you know you get the street cred you get

912
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
you know you get the street cred you get
 

913
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,110
you know you get the street cred you get
to brag about the fact you just found

914
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
to brag about the fact you just found
 

915
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,749
to brag about the fact you just found
that 2.5 million dollar

916
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
that 2.5 million dollar
 

917
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,990
that 2.5 million dollar
you know ios zero day that no one else

918
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
you know ios zero day that no one else
 

919
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,949
you know ios zero day that no one else
did

920
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
did
 

921
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,949
did
and if you sell it to a broker you never

922
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
and if you sell it to a broker you never
 

923
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,629
and if you sell it to a broker you never
get to talk about it and i think that

924
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
get to talk about it and i think that
 

925
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,949
get to talk about it and i think that
really does eat at people

926
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
really does eat at people
 

927
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,870
really does eat at people
can i see a big philosophical question

928
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
can i see a big philosophical question
 

929
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,110
can i see a big philosophical question
about human nature here

930
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
about human nature here
 

931
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,949
about human nature here
so if you have

932
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
so if you have
 

933
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,629
so if you have
in what you've seen

934
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
in what you've seen
 

935
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,230
in what you've seen
if a human being

936
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
if a human being
 

937
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,710
if a human being
has a zero day they've found a zero day

938
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
has a zero day they've found a zero day
 

939
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,470
has a zero day they've found a zero day
vulnerability

940
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
vulnerability
 

941
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,309
vulnerability
that can um

942
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
that can um
 

943
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,470
that can um
hack into i don't know what's the worst

944
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
hack into i don't know what's the worst
 

945
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,309
hack into i don't know what's the worst
thing you can hack into something that

946
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
thing you can hack into something that
 

947
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,949
thing you can hack into something that
could launch nuclear weapons

948
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
could launch nuclear weapons
 

949
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,549
could launch nuclear weapons
which percentage of the people in the

950
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
which percentage of the people in the
 

951
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,710
which percentage of the people in the
world that have the skill would not

952
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
world that have the skill would not
 

953
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,669
world that have the skill would not
share that with anyone um with any

954
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
share that with anyone um with any
 

955

share that with anyone um with any
bad party

956
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
bad party
 

957
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,510
bad party
i guess how many people

958
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
i guess how many people
 

959
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,549
i guess how many people
are completely devoid of ethical

960
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
are completely devoid of ethical
 

961
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,630
are completely devoid of ethical
concerns in your

962
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
concerns in your
 

963
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,390
concerns in your
in your sense so my my belief is

964
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
in your sense so my my belief is
 

965
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,029
in your sense so my my belief is
all the ultra competent people or very

966

all the ultra competent people or very
 

967
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,190
all the ultra competent people or very
very high percentage of ultra competent

968
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
very high percentage of ultra competent
 

969
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,430
very high percentage of ultra competent
people are also ethical people

970
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
people are also ethical people
 

971
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,669
people are also ethical people
that's been my experience but then again

972
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
that's been my experience but then again
 

973
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,750
that's been my experience but then again
my experience is narrow

974
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
my experience is narrow
 

975
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,590
my experience is narrow
what's what's what's your experience

been like so
 

979
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,830
been like so
this was another question i wanted to

980
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
this was another question i wanted to
 

981
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,510
this was another question i wanted to
answer you know

982
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
answer you know
 

983
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,390
answer you know
who are these people who would sell

984
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
who are these people who would sell
 

985
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,350
who are these people who would sell
a zero day exploit that would neutralize

986
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
a zero day exploit that would neutralize
 

987
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,830
a zero day exploit that would neutralize
a schneider electric safety lock at a

988
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
a schneider electric safety lock at a
 

989
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,830
a schneider electric safety lock at a
petrochemical plant basically the last

990
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
petrochemical plant basically the last
 

991
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,270
petrochemical plant basically the last
thing you would need to neutralize

992
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
thing you would need to neutralize
 

993
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,710
thing you would need to neutralize
before you trigger some kind of

994
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
before you trigger some kind of
 

995
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,830
before you trigger some kind of
explosion

996

explosion
who would sell that

998
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240

those zero-day exploits
which sucks because um

1358
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
which sucks because um
 

1359
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,350

it just feels like when you operate in

1368
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
it just feels like when you operate in
 

1369
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,669
it just feels like when you operate in
the shadows um

1370
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
the shadows um
 

1371
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,669
the shadows um
it doesn't help us move in the positive

1372
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
it doesn't help us move in the positive
 

1373
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,669
it doesn't help us move in the positive
direction in terms of like getting more

1374
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
direction in terms of like getting more

people on the defense side versus on the
 

1377
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,510
people on the defense side versus on the
attack side right but of course what can

1378
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
attack side right but of course what can
 

1379
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,190
attack side right but of course what can
you do i mean the best you can possibly

1380
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
you do i mean the best you can possibly
 

1381
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,430
you do i mean the best you can possibly
do is have great journalists

1382
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,440
do is have great journalists
 

1383
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,149

uh
 

1385
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,909
uh
just like you did interview and write

1386
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
just like you did interview and write
 

1387
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,669
just like you did interview and write
books about it and integrate the

1388
00:24:59,669 --> 00:24:59,679
books about it and integrate the
 

1389
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,990
books about it and integrate the
information you get while hiring the

information you get while hiring the
 

1391
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,710
information you get while hiring the
sources yeah and i think you know what

1392
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
sources yeah and i think you know what
 

1393
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,430

okay let's just put away the people that

1396
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
okay let's just put away the people that
 

1397
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,070
okay let's just put away the people that
are

1398
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
are
 

1399
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,110
are
finding and developing zero day exploits

1400
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,120
finding and developing zero day exploits
 

1401
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,430
finding and developing zero day exploits
all day long let's put that aside

1402
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
all day long let's put that aside
 

1403
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,830
all day long let's put that aside
what about the you know however many

1404
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
what about the you know however many
 

1405
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,230
what about the you know however many
millions of programmers all over the

millions of programmers all over the
 

1407
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,070
millions of programmers all over the
world who've never even heard of a zero

1408
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
world who've never even heard of a zero
 

1409
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,430
world who've never even heard of a zero
to exploit why not tap into them

1410
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440
to exploit why not tap into them
 

1411
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,669
to exploit why not tap into them
and say hey we'll start paying you if

1412
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
and say hey we'll start paying you if
 

1413
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,070
and say hey we'll start paying you if
you can find a bug in

1414
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
you can find a bug in
 

1415
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,350
you can find a bug in
united airlines software or in schneider

1416

and i think that is a really smart

1420
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,360
and i think that is a really smart
 

1421
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,390
and i think that is a really smart
approach let's go find this untapped

1422
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
approach let's go find this untapped
 

1423
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,950
approach let's go find this untapped

to sell these to governments can find
 

1429
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,590
to sell these to governments can find
them and exploit them okay i have to ask

1430
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
them and exploit them okay i have to ask
 

1431
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,230
them and exploit them okay i have to ask
you about this uh from a personal side

1432
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
you about this uh from a personal side
 

1433
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,950
you about this uh from a personal side

it's funny enough after we agreed to to

1436
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
it's funny enough after we agreed to to
 

1437
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,470
it's funny enough after we agreed to to
talk

1438
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480

um
 

1445
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,750
um
so this is ransomware it's called

1446
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:07,760
so this is ransomware it's called
 

1447
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,390
so this is ransomware it's called
deadbolt people can look it up i have a

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,400
deadbolt people can look it up i have a
 

1449
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,070
deadbolt people can look it up i have a

basically
kind of coldish storage so it's about 60

1454
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:16,880
kind of coldish storage so it's about 60
 

1455

were
 

1465
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,830
were
hacked and taken over with this

1466
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
hacked and taken over with this
 

1467
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,470
hacked and taken over with this
ransomware and what what ransomware does

1468
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:32,480
ransomware and what what ransomware does
 

1469
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,669
ransomware and what what ransomware does
there is

1470
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
there is

00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
it goes file by file almost all the
 

1473
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,110
it goes file by file almost all the
files on the qnap storage device and

1474
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
files on the qnap storage device and
 

1475
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,590
files on the qnap storage device and
encrypts them and then there's this

1476
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
encrypts them and then there's this
 

1477
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,909
encrypts them and then there's this

we're working very hard day and night to
solve this mm-hmm

1642
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:41,919

 

1643
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,750

it's so philosophically interesting to

1644
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
it's so philosophically interesting to
 

1645
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,070
it's so philosophically interesting to
me because i also project onto them

1646
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,080
me because i also project onto them
 

1647
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,070
me because i also project onto them
thinking what is their motivation

1648
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
thinking what is their motivation
 

1649
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,909
thinking what is their motivation
because the way they phrased it on

1650
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:49,919
because the way they phrased it on
 

1651
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,630
because the way they phrased it on
purpose perhaps but i'm not sure if that

1652
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:52,640
purpose perhaps but i'm not sure if that
 

1653
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,710
purpose perhaps but i'm not sure if that
actually reflects their real motivation

1654
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
actually reflects their real motivation
 

1655
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,669
actually reflects their real motivation
is

1656
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679
is
 

1657
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,590
is
um maybe they're trying to help

1658
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
um maybe they're trying to help
 

1659
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,510
um maybe they're trying to help
themselves sleep at night basically

1660
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
themselves sleep at night basically
 

1661
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,430
themselves sleep at night basically
saying this is not about you this is

1662
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,440
saying this is not about you this is
 

1663
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,430
saying this is not about you this is
about the company with the

1664
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,440
about the company with the
 

1665
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,029
about the company with the
vulnerabilities just like you mentioned

1666
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
vulnerabilities just like you mentioned
 

1667
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,110
vulnerabilities just like you mentioned
this is the justification they have

1668
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,120
this is the justification they have
 

1669
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,430
this is the justification they have
but they're hurting real people

1670
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
but they're hurting real people
 

1671
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,590
but they're hurting real people
they hurt me but i'm sure there's a few

1672
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:11,600
they hurt me but i'm sure there's a few
 

1673
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,389
they hurt me but i'm sure there's a few
others that are really hurt

1674
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
others that are really hurt
 

1675
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,430
others that are really hurt
and the zero day factor is a big one you

1676
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440
and the zero day factor is a big one you
 

1677
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,510
and the zero day factor is a big one you
know that their qnap right now is trying

1678
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
know that their qnap right now is trying
 

1679
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,950
know that their qnap right now is trying
to figure out what the hell is wrong

1680
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
to figure out what the hell is wrong
 

1681
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,430
to figure out what the hell is wrong
with their system that would let this in

1682
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
with their system that would let this in
 

1683
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,389
with their system that would let this in
and

1684
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
and
 

1685
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,310
and
even if they pay

1686
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
even if they pay
 

1687
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,070
even if they pay
if they still don't know where the zero

1688
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
if they still don't know where the zero
 

1689
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,750
if they still don't know where the zero
day is what's to say that they won't

1690
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:31,760
day is what's to say that they won't
 

1691
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,070
day is what's to say that they won't
just hit them again and hit you again

1692
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
just hit them again and hit you again
 

1693
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,149
just hit them again and hit you again
so that really complicates thing and

1694
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:36,159
so that really complicates thing and
 

1695
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,350
so that really complicates thing and
things and that is a huge advancement

1696
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
things and that is a huge advancement
 

1697
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,549
things and that is a huge advancement
for ransomware it's really only been i

1698
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:42,559
for ransomware it's really only been i
 

1699
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,870
for ransomware it's really only been i
think in the last 18 months that we've

1700
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
think in the last 18 months that we've
 

1701
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,190
think in the last 18 months that we've
ever really seen ransomware exploit zero

1702
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200
ever really seen ransomware exploit zero
 

1703
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,230
ever really seen ransomware exploit zero
days

1704
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
days
 

1705
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,470
days
to pull these off usually 80 of them

1706
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
to pull these off usually 80 of them
 

1707
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,870
to pull these off usually 80 of them
i think the data shows 80 of them come

1708
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
i think the data shows 80 of them come
 

1709
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,710
i think the data shows 80 of them come
down to a lack of two-factor

1710
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:56,720
down to a lack of two-factor
 

1711
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,070
down to a lack of two-factor
authentication

1712
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
authentication
 

1713
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,669
authentication
you know so when someone gets hit by it

1714
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
you know so when someone gets hit by it
 

1715
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,669
you know so when someone gets hit by it
by a ransomware attack they don't have

1716
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
by a ransomware attack they don't have
 

1717
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,230
by a ransomware attack they don't have
two-factor authentication on you know

1718
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:04,240
two-factor authentication on you know
 

1719
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,909
two-factor authentication on you know
their employees were using stupid

1720
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
their employees were using stupid
 

1721
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,630
their employees were using stupid
passwords like you can mitigate that in

1722
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
passwords like you can mitigate that in
 

1723
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,870
passwords like you can mitigate that in
the future this one they don't know they

1724
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
the future this one they don't know they
 

1725
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,950
the future this one they don't know they
probably don't know yeah and it was uh i

1726
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
probably don't know yeah and it was uh i
 

1727
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,630
probably don't know yeah and it was uh i
guess it's zero click because i didn't

1728
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
guess it's zero click because i didn't
 

1729
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,990
guess it's zero click because i didn't
have to do anything

1730
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
have to do anything
 

1731
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,750
have to do anything
the only thing i i'm

1732
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
the only thing i i'm
 

1733
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,669
the only thing i i'm
well you know here's the thing

1734
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:21,679
well you know here's the thing
 

1735
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,310
well you know here's the thing
i did you know basics of you know i put

1736
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
i did you know basics of you know i put
 

1737
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,990
i did you know basics of you know i put
it behind a firewall

1738
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
it behind a firewall
 

1739
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,750
it behind a firewall
i follow the instructions

1740
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
i follow the instructions
 

1741
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,750
i follow the instructions
but like i wasn't i didn't really pay

1742
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
but like i wasn't i didn't really pay
 

1743
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,909
but like i wasn't i didn't really pay
attention so maybe there's like maybe

1744
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:31,919
attention so maybe there's like maybe
 

1745
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,070
attention so maybe there's like maybe
there's a misconfiguration of some sort

1746
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080
there's a misconfiguration of some sort
 

1747
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,830
there's a misconfiguration of some sort
that's easy to make

1748
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,840
that's easy to make
 

1749
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,269
that's easy to make
it's it's difficult when you have a

1750
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:37,279
it's it's difficult when you have a
 

1751
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,389
it's it's difficult when you have a
personal

1752
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
personal
 

1753
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,990
personal
nas on i so i don't i i'm not willing to

1754
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
nas on i so i don't i i'm not willing to
 

1755
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,389
nas on i so i don't i i'm not willing to
sort of uh say that i did everything i

1756
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
sort of uh say that i did everything i
 

1757
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,389
sort of uh say that i did everything i
possibly could um but i did

1758
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:48,399
possibly could um but i did
 

1759
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,230
possibly could um but i did
a lot of reasonable stuff and they still

1760
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
a lot of reasonable stuff and they still
 

1761
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,830
a lot of reasonable stuff and they still
hit it with zero clicks i didn't have to

1762
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
hit it with zero clicks i didn't have to
 

1763
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,590
hit it with zero clicks i didn't have to
do anything yeah well it's like a zero

1764
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
do anything yeah well it's like a zero
 

1765
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,470
do anything yeah well it's like a zero
day and it's a supply chain attack

1766
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
day and it's a supply chain attack
 

1767
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,470
day and it's a supply chain attack
you know you're getting hit from your

1768
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:58,480
you know you're getting hit from your
 

1769
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,149
you know you're getting hit from your
supplier you're you're getting hit

1770
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159
supplier you're you're getting hit
 

1771
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,310
supplier you're you're getting hit
because of your vendor and it's also a

1772
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320
because of your vendor and it's also a
 

1773
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,269
because of your vendor and it's also a
new thing for ransomware groups to go to

1774
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
new thing for ransomware groups to go to
 

1775
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,509
new thing for ransomware groups to go to
the individuals to pressure them to pay

1776
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:07,519
the individuals to pressure them to pay
 

1777
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,669
the individuals to pressure them to pay
there was this really interesting case

1778
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
there was this really interesting case
 

1779
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,909
there was this really interesting case
i think it was in norway

1780
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:11,919
i think it was in norway
 

1781
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,549
i think it was in norway
where there was a mental health clinic

1782
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:14,559
where there was a mental health clinic
 

1783
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,990
where there was a mental health clinic
that got hit

1784
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,000
that got hit
 

1785
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,070
that got hit
and the cyber criminals were going to

1786
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,080
and the cyber criminals were going to
 

1787
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,430
and the cyber criminals were going to
the patients themselves to say pay this

1788
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
the patients themselves to say pay this
 

1789
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,669
the patients themselves to say pay this
or we're going to release

1790
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
or we're going to release
 

1791
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,909
or we're going to release
your psychiatric records i mean talk

1792
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:25,919
your psychiatric records i mean talk
 

1793
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,269
your psychiatric records i mean talk
about hell

1794
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:27,279
about hell
 

1795
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,470
about hell
um in terms of whether to pay you know

1796
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,480
um in terms of whether to pay you know
 

1797
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,950
um in terms of whether to pay you know

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,590
and the other one i always think about
is baltimore you know when the city of

000 it may have even started smaller

1892
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:15,359
000 it may have even started smaller
 

1893
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,629
000 it may have even started smaller
than that

1894
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:16,639
than that
 

1895
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,629
than that
and baltimore stood its ground and

1896
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
and baltimore stood its ground and
 

1897
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,589
and baltimore stood its ground and

remediate was 18 million dollars it's a

1900
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
remediate was 18 million dollars it's a
 

1901
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,869
remediate was 18 million dollars it's a
lot for the city of baltimore that's

1902
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:26,879

00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
just went to rebuilding these systems
 

1911
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,349
just went to rebuilding these systems
from scratch and so a lot of residents

1912
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
from scratch and so a lot of residents

and for the most part there is nothing

and for the most part there is nothing
out there

2294
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:30,400

legislating that those companies

2296
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:33,760
legislating that those companies
 

2297
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,510
legislating that those companies
share the fact they've been breached

00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,520
share the fact they've been breached
 

2299
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,630
share the fact they've been breached
they don't even have to tell the

2300
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:36,640
they don't even have to tell the
 

2301
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,550
they don't even have to tell the
government they've been hit

2302
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560
government they've been hit
 

2303
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,390
government they've been hit
there's nothing mandating that they even

2304
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,400
there's nothing mandating that they even
 

2305
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,710
there's nothing mandating that they even
meet a bare minimum standard of cyber

2306
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:42,720
meet a bare minimum standard of cyber

security
 

2309
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,630
security
and that's it

2310
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
and that's it
 

2311
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,349
and that's it
so

2312
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,359
so
 

2313
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,030
so
even when there are these attacks most

2314
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
even when there are these attacks most
 

2315
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,190
even when there are these attacks most
of the time we don't even know about it

2316
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,200
of the time we don't even know about it
 

2317
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,710
of the time we don't even know about it
so that is you know if you were going to

2318
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
so that is you know if you were going to
 

2319
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,430
so that is you know if you were going to
design a system to be as

2320
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
design a system to be as
 

2321
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,230
design a system to be as
blind and vulnerable as possible that's

2322
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,240
blind and vulnerable as possible that's
 

2323
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,470
blind and vulnerable as possible that's
that is pretty pretty good

2324
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,480
that is pretty pretty good
 

2325
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,150
that is pretty pretty good
that's what it looks like is what we

2326
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,160
that's what it looks like is what we
 

2327
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,390
that's what it looks like is what we

everyone here is just operating like

and no one has ever stopped to pause and
 

2359
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,190
and no one has ever stopped to pause and
think

2360
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200
think
 

2361
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,270
think
should we be hooking up these systems to

2362
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
should we be hooking up these systems to
 

2363
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,910
should we be hooking up these systems to
the internet

2364
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:47,920
the internet
 

2365
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,069
the internet
they've just been saying can we let's do

2366
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
they've just been saying can we let's do
 

2367
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,030
they've just been saying can we let's do
it

2368
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,040
it
 

2369
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,109
it
and that's a real problem and this and

2370
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:53,119
and that's a real problem and this and
 

2371
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,630
and that's a real problem and this and
just in the last year you know we've

2372
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:54,640
just in the last year you know we've
 

2373
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,710
just in the last year you know we've
seen a record number of zero-day attacks

2374
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:56,720
seen a record number of zero-day attacks
 

2375
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,870
seen a record number of zero-day attacks
i think there were 80 last year

2376
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
i think there were 80 last year
 

2377
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,550
i think there were 80 last year
which is probably more than double what

2378
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
which is probably more than double what
 

2379
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,960
which is probably more than double what
it was in 2019.

2380
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:01,970
it was in 2019.

if you're a nation state
 

2401
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,190
if you're a nation state
the goal would be to maximize the

the goal would be to maximize the

zero day that nobody's aware of

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,390
zero day that nobody's aware of
and whenever

2408
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
and whenever
 

2409
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,950
and whenever
war is initiated the huge negative

effects of shutting down infrastructure
 

2413
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,630
effects of shutting down infrastructure
or any kind of zero day is the chaos it

2414
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:40,640
or any kind of zero day is the chaos it
 

2415
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,829
or any kind of zero day is the chaos it
creates

2416
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:41,839
creates
 

2417
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,030
creates
so if you just there's a certain

2418
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
so if you just there's a certain
 

2419
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,190
so if you just there's a certain
threshold when you create the chaos

2420
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
threshold when you create the chaos
 

2421
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,950
threshold when you create the chaos
the the markets plummet just everything

2422
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:46,960
the the markets plummet just everything
 

2423
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,870
the the markets plummet just everything
goes it goes to hell

2425
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,950

so it's not just zero days you know we

2426
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:52,960
so it's not just zero days you know we
 

2427
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,950
so it's not just zero days you know we
make it so easy

2428
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:54,960
make it so easy
 

2429
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,430
make it so easy
for for threat actors i mean

2430
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
for for threat actors i mean
 

2431
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,270
for for threat actors i mean
we're not using two-factor

um there was the shell shock

2436
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
um there was the shell shock
 

2437
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,230
um there was the shell shock
vulnerability that was discovered

2438
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,240
vulnerability that was discovered
 

2439
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,950
vulnerability that was discovered
a couple years ago it's still being

2440
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:08,960
a couple years ago it's still being
 

2441
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,030
a couple years ago it's still being
exploited no because so many people

2442
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,040
exploited no because so many people
 

2443
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,710
exploited no because so many people
haven't fixed it

2444
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:12,720
haven't fixed it
 

2445
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,829
haven't fixed it
um

2446
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:13,839
um
 

2447
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,150
um
so you know the zero days are really the

2448
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160
so you know the zero days are really the
 

2449
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,390
so you know the zero days are really the
sexy stuff and what really got drew me

2450
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:18,400

and you're in the game so it's a really
 

2583
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,990
and you're in the game so it's a really
low barrier to entry

where they would say you will have blood
on your hands if you publish this story

on your hands if you publish this story
 

2681
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,309
on your hands if you publish this story
and instead they gave us the opposite

2682
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:22,319
and instead they gave us the opposite
 

2683
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,950
and instead they gave us the opposite
answer they said we have no problem

2684
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
answer they said we have no problem
 

2685
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,109
answer they said we have no problem
with you publishing this story

2686
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119
with you publishing this story
 

2687
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,069
with you publishing this story
why well they didn't say it out loud but

2688
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
why well they didn't say it out loud but
 

2689
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,150
why well they didn't say it out loud but
it was pretty obvious they wanted russia

2690
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:32,160
it was pretty obvious they wanted russia
 

2691
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,390
it was pretty obvious they wanted russia
to know that we're hacking into their

2692
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:34,400
to know that we're hacking into their
 

2693
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,069
to know that we're hacking into their
power grid too and they better think

2694
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:36,079
power grid too and they better think
 

2695
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,710
power grid too and they better think
twice before they do to us what they've

2696
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
twice before they do to us what they've
 

2697
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,750
twice before they do to us what they've
done to ukraine so yeah you know we have

2698
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,760
done to ukraine so yeah you know we have
 

2699
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,950
done to ukraine so yeah you know we have
stumbled

2700
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:42,960
stumbled
 

2701
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,430
stumbled
into this new era of mutually assured

2702
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:45,440
into this new era of mutually assured
 

2703
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,270
into this new era of mutually assured
digital destruction

2704
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
digital destruction
 

2705
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,710
digital destruction
um i think another sort of

2706
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:50,720
um i think another sort of
 

2707
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,190
um i think another sort of
quasi norm we've we've stumbled into is

2708
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
quasi norm we've we've stumbled into is
 

2709
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,750
quasi norm we've we've stumbled into is
proportional responses you know there's

2710
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
proportional responses you know there's
 

2711
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,710
proportional responses you know there's
this idea that if you get hit you're

2712
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
this idea that if you get hit you're
 

2713
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,270
this idea that if you get hit you're
allowed to respond proportionally

2714
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:03,280
allowed to respond proportionally
 

2715
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,430
allowed to respond proportionally
at a time and place of your choosing you

2716
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
at a time and place of your choosing you
 

2717
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,430
at a time and place of your choosing you
know that is how the language always

2718
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,440
know that is how the language always
 

2719
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,630
know that is how the language always
goes that's what obama

2720
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:10,640
goes that's what obama
 

2721
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,109
goes that's what obama
said after north korea hit sony we will

2722
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:13,119
said after north korea hit sony we will
 

2723
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,870
said after north korea hit sony we will
respond at a time and place of our

2724
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:14,880
respond at a time and place of our
 

2725
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,950
respond at a time and place of our
choosing um but no one really knows

2726
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
choosing um but no one really knows
 

2727
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,109
choosing um but no one really knows
like what that response looks like and

2728
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:21,119
like what that response looks like and
 

2729
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,790
like what that response looks like and
so what you see a lot of the time are

2730
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800
so what you see a lot of the time are
 

2731
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,150
so what you see a lot of the time are
just these like

2732
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160
just these like
 

2733
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,910
just these like
just short of war

2734
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:25,920
just short of war
 

2735
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,230
just short of war
attacks you know russia turned off the

2736
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,240
attacks you know russia turned off the
 

2737
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,990
attacks you know russia turned off the
power in ukraine but it wasn't like it

2738

power in ukraine but it wasn't like it
 

2739
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,670
power in ukraine but it wasn't like it
stayed off for a week

2740
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:31,680
stayed off for a week
 

2741
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,109
stayed off for a week
you know it stayed off for a number of

2742
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119
you know it stayed off for a number of
 

2743
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,150
you know it stayed off for a number of
hours

2744
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,160
hours
 

2745
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,470
hours
um you know not pecha

2746
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:36,480
um you know not pecha
 

2747
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,190
um you know not pecha
hit those companies pretty hard

2748
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,200
hit those companies pretty hard
 

2749
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,589
hit those companies pretty hard
um but no one died you know and the

2750
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:41,599
um but no one died you know and the
 

2751
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,870
um but no one died you know and the
question is what's going to happen when

2752
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:42,880
question is what's going to happen when
 

2753
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,470
question is what's going to happen when
someone dies

2754
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,480
someone dies
 

2755
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,670
someone dies
and

2756
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:45,680
and
 

2757
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,870
and
can a nation state masquerade as a cyber

2758
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:48,880
can a nation state masquerade as a cyber
 

2759
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,510
can a nation state masquerade as a cyber
criminal group as a ransomware group

2760
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,520
criminal group as a ransomware group
 

2761
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,349
criminal group as a ransomware group
and that's what really complicates

2762
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
and that's what really complicates
 

2763
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,750
and that's what really complicates
coming to some sort of digital geneva

2764
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:55,760
coming to some sort of digital geneva
 

2765
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,950
coming to some sort of digital geneva
convention

2766
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
convention
 

2767
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,710
convention
like there's been there's been a push

2768
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,720
like there's been there's been a push
 

2769
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,349
like there's been there's been a push
from brad smith at microsoft we need a

florida was hacked last year
how did it happen

2932
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
how did it happen
 

2933
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,510
how did it happen
they were using windows xp from like a

2934
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:55,520
they were using windows xp from like a
 

2935
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,829
they were using windows xp from like a
decade ago that can't even get patches

2936
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
decade ago that can't even get patches
 

2937
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,750
decade ago that can't even get patches
if you wanted to and they didn't have

2938
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,760
if you wanted to and they didn't have
 

2939
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,230
if you wanted to and they didn't have
two-factor authentication time and time

2940
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,240
two-factor authentication time and time
 

2941
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,309
two-factor authentication time and time
again if they just switched on

2942
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,319
again if they just switched on
 

2943
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,030
again if they just switched on
two-factor authentication some of these

2944
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
two-factor authentication some of these
 

2945
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,870
two-factor authentication some of these
attacks wouldn't have been possible now

2946
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:08,880
attacks wouldn't have been possible now
 

2947
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,230
attacks wouldn't have been possible now
if i could snap my fingers that's the

2948
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,240
if i could snap my fingers that's the
 

2949
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,630
if i could snap my fingers that's the
thing i would do right now but of course

2950
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
thing i would do right now but of course
 

2951
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,950
thing i would do right now but of course
you know this is a cat and mouse game

2952
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
you know this is a cat and mouse game
 

2953
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,190
you know this is a cat and mouse game
and then the attackers on to the next

2954
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
and then the attackers on to the next
 

2955
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,430
and then the attackers on to the next
thing but i think right now

2956
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,440
thing but i think right now
 

2957
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,109
thing but i think right now
that is like

2958
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:21,119
that is like
 

2959
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,190
that is like
bar none that is just that is the

2960
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
bar none that is just that is the
 

2961
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,349
bar none that is just that is the
easiest simplest way to deflect the most

2962
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:25,359
easiest simplest way to deflect the most
 

2963
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,870
easiest simplest way to deflect the most
attacks and

2964
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:26,880
attacks and
 

2965
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,309
attacks and
you know the name of the game right now

2966
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
you know the name of the game right now
 

2967
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,710
you know the name of the game right now
isn't perfect security perfect security

2968
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:30,720
isn't perfect security perfect security
 

2969
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,069
isn't perfect security perfect security
is impossible

2970
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079
is impossible
 

2971
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,549
is impossible
they will always find a way in the name

2972
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
they will always find a way in the name
 

2973
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,630
they will always find a way in the name
of the game right now is make yourself a

2974
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
of the game right now is make yourself a
 

2975
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,349
of the game right now is make yourself a
little bit harder to attack than your

2976
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:39,359
little bit harder to attack than your
 

2977
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,510
little bit harder to attack than your
competitor than anyone else out there so

2978
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,520
competitor than anyone else out there so
 

2979
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,390
competitor than anyone else out there so
that they just

2980
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
that they just
 

2981
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,630
that they just
give up and move along and you know

2982
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,640
give up and move along and you know
 

2983
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,790
give up and move along and you know
maybe if you are a target for an

2984
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:46,800
maybe if you are a target for an
 

2985
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,710
maybe if you are a target for an
advanced nation state or the svr

2986
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:50,720
advanced nation state or the svr
 

2987
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,470
advanced nation state or the svr
you know you're going to get hacked no

2988
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:52,480
you know you're going to get hacked no
 

2989
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,750
you know you're going to get hacked no
matter what

2990
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
matter what
 

2991
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,470
matter what
but you can make cyber criminal groups

2992
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:56,480
but you can make cyber criminal groups
 

2993
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,870
but you can make cyber criminal groups
deadbolt is it you can make their jobs a

2994
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:58,880
deadbolt is it you can make their jobs a
 

2995
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,069
deadbolt is it you can make their jobs a
lot harder

2996
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:00,079
lot harder
 

2997
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,349
lot harder
um simply by doing the bare basics and

2998
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:03,359
um simply by doing the bare basics and
 

2999
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,630
um simply by doing the bare basics and
the other thing is stop reusing your

3000
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:04,640
the other thing is stop reusing your
 

3001
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,549
the other thing is stop reusing your
passwords but if i only get one then

3002
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:06,559
passwords but if i only get one then
 

3003
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,710
passwords but if i only get one then
two-factor authentication so what is

3004
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
two-factor authentication so what is
 

3005
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,109
two-factor authentication so what is
two-factor authentication factor one is

3006
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:11,119
two-factor authentication factor one is
 

3007
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,270
two-factor authentication factor one is
what logging in with a password and

3008
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,280
what logging in with a password and
 

3009
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,750
what logging in with a password and
factor two is like have another device

3010
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
factor two is like have another device
 

3011
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,829
factor two is like have another device
or another channel through which you can

3012
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:17,839
or another channel through which you can
 

3013
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,309
or another channel through which you can
confirm yeah that's me yes you know

3014
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:20,319
confirm yeah that's me yes you know
 

3015
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,069
confirm yeah that's me yes you know
usually this happens through some kind

3016
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:22,079
usually this happens through some kind
 

3017
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,710
usually this happens through some kind
of text you know you get your one-time

3018
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
of text you know you get your one-time
 

3019
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,150
of text you know you get your one-time
code from bank of america or from google

3020
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:28,160
code from bank of america or from google
 

3021
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,549
code from bank of america or from google
and the better way to do it is spend

3022
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
and the better way to do it is spend
 

3023
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,549
and the better way to do it is spend
twenty dollars buying yourself a fido

3024
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
twenty dollars buying yourself a fido
 

3025
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:33,430
twenty dollars buying yourself a fido
key

3026
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:33,440
key
 

3027
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,910
key
on amazon that's a hardware device

3028
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:35,920
on amazon that's a hardware device
 

3029
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,510
on amazon that's a hardware device
and if you don't have that hardware

3030
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:37,520
and if you don't have that hardware
 

3031
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,349
and if you don't have that hardware
device with you

3032
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:39,359
device with you
 

3033
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,109
device with you
then you're not going to get in

3034
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:41,119
then you're not going to get in
 

3035
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,430
then you're not going to get in
and the whole goal is i mean basically

3036
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:43,440
and the whole goal is i mean basically
 

3037
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,510
and the whole goal is i mean basically
you know my first half of my decade at

3038
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:45,520
you know my first half of my decade at
 

3039
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,829
you know my first half of my decade at
the times was spent covering like the

3040
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:47,839
the times was spent covering like the
 

3041
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,789
the times was spent covering like the
cop beat it was like home depot got

3042
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:50,799
cop beat it was like home depot got
 

3043
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,190
cop beat it was like home depot got
breached news at 11 you know target

3044
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:53,200
breached news at 11 you know target
 

3045
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,990
breached news at 11 you know target
neiman marcus like who wasn't hacked

3046
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,000
neiman marcus like who wasn't hacked
 

3047
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,470
neiman marcus like who wasn't hacked
over the course of those five years and

3048
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:58,480
over the course of those five years and
 

3049
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,950
over the course of those five years and
a lot of those companies that got hacked

3050
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
a lot of those companies that got hacked
 

3051
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,710
a lot of those companies that got hacked
what did hackers take they took the

3052
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
what did hackers take they took the
 

3053
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,510
what did hackers take they took the
credentials they took the passwords they

3054
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:05,520
credentials they took the passwords they
 

3055
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,670
credentials they took the passwords they
can make a pretty penny selling them on

3056
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:07,680
can make a pretty penny selling them on
 

3057
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,390
can make a pretty penny selling them on
the dark web and people reuse their

3058
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:10,400
the dark web and people reuse their
 

3059
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,829
the dark web and people reuse their
passwords so you get one from you know

3060
00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:13,839
passwords so you get one from you know
 

3061
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,870
passwords so you get one from you know
god knows who i don't know lastpass

3062
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:16,880
god knows who i don't know lastpass
 

3063
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,190
god knows who i don't know lastpass
the worst case example actually lastpass

3064
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,200
the worst case example actually lastpass
 

3065
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,750
the worst case example actually lastpass
but you get one and then you go test it

3066
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
but you get one and then you go test it
 

3067
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,990
but you get one and then you go test it
on their email account and you go test

3068
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,000
on their email account and you go test
 

3069
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,829
on their email account and you go test
it on their brokerage account and you

3070
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:25,839
it on their brokerage account and you
 

3071
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,990
it on their brokerage account and you
test it on their cold storage account

3072
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:28,000
test it on their cold storage account
 

3073
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,750
test it on their cold storage account
yeah you know that's how it works but if

3074
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:29,760
yeah you know that's how it works but if
 

3075
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,789
yeah you know that's how it works but if
you have multi-factor authentication

3076
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:32,799
you have multi-factor authentication
 

3077
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,950
you have multi-factor authentication
then they can't get in because they

3078
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:34,960
then they can't get in because they
 

3079
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,950
then they can't get in because they
might have your password but they don't

3080
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:36,960
might have your password but they don't
 

3081
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,470
might have your password but they don't
have your phone they don't have your

3082
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480
have your phone they don't have your
 

3083
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,750
have your phone they don't have your
fido key

3084
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:39,760
fido key
 

3085
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,549
fido key
you know and and so you keep them out

3086
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:42,559
you know and and so you keep them out
 

3087
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,829
you know and and so you keep them out
and you know i get a lot of alerts

3088
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:45,839
and you know i get a lot of alerts
 

3089
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,589
and you know i get a lot of alerts
that tell me someone is trying to get

3090
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
that tell me someone is trying to get
 

3091
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,069
that tell me someone is trying to get
into your instagram account or your

3092
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:50,079
into your instagram account or your
 

3093
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,069
into your instagram account or your
twitter account or your email account

3094
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
twitter account or your email account
 

3095
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,150
twitter account or your email account
and i don't worry because i use

3096
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160
and i don't worry because i use
 

3097
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,230
and i don't worry because i use
multi-factor authentication they can try

3098
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
multi-factor authentication they can try
 

3099
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,430
multi-factor authentication they can try
all day

3100
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:57,440
all day
 

3101
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,829
all day
um okay i worry a little bit but you

3102
00:55:59,829 --> 00:55:59,839
um okay i worry a little bit but you
 

3103
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,349
um okay i worry a little bit but you
know there it's

3104
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:01,359
know there it's
 

3105
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,910
know there it's
it's the simplest thing to do and we

3106
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
it's the simplest thing to do and we
 

3107
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,510
it's the simplest thing to do and we
don't even do it well there's an

3108
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
don't even do it well there's an
 

3109
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,190
don't even do it well there's an
interface aspect to it because it's

3110
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
interface aspect to it because it's
 

3111
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,030
interface aspect to it because it's
pretty annoying if it's implemented

3112
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,040
pretty annoying if it's implemented
 

3113
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,230
pretty annoying if it's implemented
poorly yeah so uh so actually bad

3114
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,240
poorly yeah so uh so actually bad
 

3115
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,589
poorly yeah so uh so actually bad
implementation of two-factor

3116
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:13,599
implementation of two-factor
 

3117
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,430
implementation of two-factor
authentication

3118
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:15,440
authentication
 

3119
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,430
authentication
not just bad but just

3120
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:17,440
not just bad but just
 

3121
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,270
not just bad but just
something that adds friction is a

3122
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,280
something that adds friction is a
 

3123
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,589
something that adds friction is a
security vulnerability i guess because

3124
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
security vulnerability i guess because
 

3125
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,789
security vulnerability i guess because
it's really annoying like uh i think mit

3126
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:24,799
it's really annoying like uh i think mit
 

3127
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,230
it's really annoying like uh i think mit
for a while had

3128
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,240
for a while had
 

3129
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,990
for a while had
two-factor authentication it was really

3130
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:28,000
two-factor authentication it was really
 

3131
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,470
two-factor authentication it was really
annoying i just like though the time the

3132
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
annoying i just like though the time the
 

3133
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,870
annoying i just like though the time the
number of times it pings you

3134
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
number of times it pings you
 

3135
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,870
number of times it pings you
like uh

3136
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
like uh
 

3137
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,829
like uh
it re it asks to re-authenticate across

3138
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:37,839
it re it asks to re-authenticate across
 

3139
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,630
it re it asks to re-authenticate across
multiple sub-domains like it just feels

3140
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
multiple sub-domains like it just feels
 

3141
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,549
multiple sub-domains like it just feels
like a pain

3142
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:42,559
like a pain
 

3143
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,670
like a pain
i don't know what the right balance

3144
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:43,680
i don't know what the right balance
 

3145
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,230
i don't know what the right balance
there yeah it feels like friction

3146
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:46,240
there yeah it feels like friction
 

3147
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,030
there yeah it feels like friction
in our frictionless society it feels

3148
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,040
in our frictionless society it feels
 

3149
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,270
in our frictionless society it feels
like friction it's annoying that's

3150
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
like friction it's annoying that's
 

3151
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,069
like friction it's annoying that's
security's biggest problem it's annoying

3152
00:56:54,069 --> 00:56:54,079
security's biggest problem it's annoying
 

3153
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,390
security's biggest problem it's annoying
you know we need the steve jobs of

3154
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:56,400
you know we need the steve jobs of
 

3155
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,309
you know we need the steve jobs of
security to come along and we need to

3156
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:58,319
security to come along and we need to
 

3157
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,750
security to come along and we need to
make it painless

3158
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
make it painless
 

3159
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,990
make it painless
and actually you know on that point

3160
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,000
and actually you know on that point
 

3161
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,950
and actually you know on that point
apple

3162
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:02,960
apple
 

3163
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,390
apple
has probably done more for security than

3164
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
has probably done more for security than
 

3165
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,710
has probably done more for security than
anyone else simply by introducing

3166
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:08,720
anyone else simply by introducing
 

3167
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,349
anyone else simply by introducing
biometric authentication first with the

3168
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:11,359
biometric authentication first with the
 

3169
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,750
biometric authentication first with the
fingerprint and then with face id it's

3170
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:13,760
fingerprint and then with face id it's
 

3171
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,109
fingerprint and then with face id it's
not perfect

3172
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
not perfect
 

3173
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,789
not perfect
but you know if you think just eight

3174
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:16,799
but you know if you think just eight
 

3175
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,309
but you know if you think just eight
years ago everyone was running around

3176
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:18,319
years ago everyone was running around
 

3177
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,789
years ago everyone was running around

00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:24,880
phone that anyone you know think of what
 

3183
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,789
phone that anyone you know think of what
you can get when you get someone's

3184
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:26,799
you can get when you get someone's
 

3185
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,430
you can get when you get someone's
iphone if you steal someone's iphone and

3186
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:29,440
iphone if you steal someone's iphone and
 

3187
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,589
iphone if you steal someone's iphone and
you know props to them for introducing

3188
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:31,599
you know props to them for introducing
 

3189
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,990
you know props to them for introducing
the fingerprint and face id and again it

3190
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,000
the fingerprint and face id and again it
 

3191
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,910
the fingerprint and face id and again it
wasn't perfect but it was a huge step

3192
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:35,920
wasn't perfect but it was a huge step
 

3193
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,470
wasn't perfect but it was a huge step
forward now it's time to make another

3194
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:38,480
forward now it's time to make another
 

3195
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,750
forward now it's time to make another
huge step forward um i want to see the

3196
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
huge step forward um i want to see the
 

3197
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,150
huge step forward um i want to see the
password die i mean

3198
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:44,160
password die i mean
 

3199
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,990
password die i mean
it's gotten us as far as it was ever

3200
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,000
it's gotten us as far as it was ever
 

3201
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,990
it's gotten us as far as it was ever
going to get us and i hope whatever we

3202
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:48,000
going to get us and i hope whatever we
 

3203
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,309
going to get us and i hope whatever we
come up with next is not going to be

3204
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
come up with next is not going to be
 

3205
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,470
come up with next is not going to be
annoying is going to be seamless when i

3206
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,480
annoying is going to be seamless when i
 

3207
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,150
annoying is going to be seamless when i
was at google that's what we worked on

3208
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:54,160
was at google that's what we worked on
 

3209
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,870
was at google that's what we worked on
is

3210
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:54,880
is
 

3211
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,950
is
and there's a lot of ways to call this

3212
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:56,960
and there's a lot of ways to call this
 

3213
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,789
and there's a lot of ways to call this
active authentication or passive

3214
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799
active authentication or passive
 

3215
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,470
active authentication or passive
authentication so basically use

3216
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:00,480
authentication so basically use
 

3217
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,390
authentication so basically use
biometric data

3218
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:02,400
biometric data
 

3219
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,069
biometric data
not just like a fingerprint but

3220
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
not just like a fingerprint but
 

3221
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,470
not just like a fingerprint but
everything from your body to identify

3222
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
everything from your body to identify
 

3223
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,950
everything from your body to identify
who you are like movement patterns

3224
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:08,960
who you are like movement patterns
 

3225
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,829
who you are like movement patterns
so basically create a lot of layers of

3226
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:11,839
so basically create a lot of layers of
 

3227
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,589
so basically create a lot of layers of
protection where

3228
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:13,599
protection where
 

3229
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,870
protection where
it's very difficult to fake including um

3230
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:16,880
it's very difficult to fake including um
 

3231
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,710
it's very difficult to fake including um
like face unlock

3232
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
like face unlock
 

3233
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,349
like face unlock
checking that it's your actual face like

3234
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
checking that it's your actual face like
 

3235
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,230
checking that it's your actual face like
the liveness tests so like from video so

3236
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
the liveness tests so like from video so
 

3237
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,190
the liveness tests so like from video so
unlocking it with video yeah voice the

3238
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
unlocking it with video yeah voice the
 

3239
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,950
unlocking it with video yeah voice the
way you move the the the phone um the

3240
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:30,960
way you move the the the phone um the
 

3241
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,470
way you move the the the phone um the
way you take it out of the pocket that

3242
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:32,480
way you take it out of the pocket that
 

3243
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,870
way you take it out of the pocket that
kind of thing all of those factors

3244
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:34,880
kind of thing all of those factors
 

3245
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,190
kind of thing all of those factors
it's a really hard problem though yeah

3246
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:37,200
it's a really hard problem though yeah
 

3247
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,069
it's a really hard problem though yeah
and

3248
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:38,079
and
 

3249
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,069
and
ultimately

3250
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:40,079
ultimately
 

3251
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,829
ultimately
it's very difficult to beat the password

3252
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:41,839
it's very difficult to beat the password
 

3253
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,430
it's very difficult to beat the password
in terms of security

3254
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:43,440
in terms of security
 

3255
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,349
in terms of security
well there's a company that i actually

3256
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:45,359
well there's a company that i actually
 

3257
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,430
well there's a company that i actually
will call out and that's abnormal

3258
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:47,440
will call out and that's abnormal
 

3259
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,549
will call out and that's abnormal
security so they work on email

3260
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:50,559
security so they work on email
 

3261
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,950
security so they work on email
attacks and

3262
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
attacks and
 

3263
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,829
attacks and
it was started by a couple guys who

3264
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:55,839
it was started by a couple guys who
 

3265
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,190
it was started by a couple guys who
were doing i think ad tech at twitter

3266
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,200
were doing i think ad tech at twitter
 

3267
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,829
were doing i think ad tech at twitter
so you know ad technology now like it's

3268
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:01,839
so you know ad technology now like it's
 

3269
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,670
so you know ad technology now like it's
a joke how much they know about us you

3270
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:03,680
a joke how much they know about us you
 

3271
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,270
a joke how much they know about us you
know you always hear the conspiracy

3272
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:05,280
know you always hear the conspiracy
 

3273
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,510
know you always hear the conspiracy
theories that you know you saw someone's

3274
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:07,520
theories that you know you saw someone's
 

3275
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,109
theories that you know you saw someone's
shoes and next thing you know it's on

3276
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:09,119
shoes and next thing you know it's on
 

3277
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,150
shoes and next thing you know it's on
your phone

3278
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:10,160
your phone
 

3279
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,390
your phone
it's amazing what they know about you

3280
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:12,400
it's amazing what they know about you
 

3281
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,510
it's amazing what they know about you
um

3282
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:13,520
um
 

3283
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,549
um
and they're basically taking that

3284
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559
and they're basically taking that
 

3285
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,670
and they're basically taking that
and they're applying it to attacks so

3286
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
and they're applying it to attacks so
 

3287
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,789
and they're applying it to attacks so
they're saying

3288
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:20,799
they're saying
 

3289
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,030
they're saying
okay you know if you're this is what

3290
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,040
okay you know if you're this is what
 

3291
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,270
okay you know if you're this is what
your email patterns are it might be

3292
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:25,280
your email patterns are it might be
 

3293
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,710
your email patterns are it might be
different for you and me because we're

3294
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:26,720
different for you and me because we're
 

3295
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,870
different for you and me because we're
emailing strangers all the time

3296
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:28,880
emailing strangers all the time
 

3297
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,430
emailing strangers all the time
um but for most people their email

3298
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
um but for most people their email
 

3299
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,670
um but for most people their email
patterns are pretty predictable

3300
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,680
patterns are pretty predictable
 

3301
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,670
patterns are pretty predictable
and if something strays from that

3302
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,680
and if something strays from that
 

3303
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,870
and if something strays from that
pattern

3304
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
pattern
 

3305
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,589
pattern
that's abnormal and they'll block it

3306
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:39,599
that's abnormal and they'll block it
 

3307
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,390
that's abnormal and they'll block it
they'll investigate it you know and and

3308
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:42,400
they'll investigate it you know and and
 

3309
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,789
they'll investigate it you know and and
that's great you know let's start using

3310
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:44,799
that's great you know let's start using
 

3311
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,710
that's great you know let's start using
that kind of targeted

3312
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,720
that kind of targeted
 

3313
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,470
that kind of targeted
ad technology

3314
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,480
ad technology
 

3315
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,390
ad technology
to protect people

3316
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
to protect people
 

3317
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,549
to protect people
and yeah i mean it's not going to get us

3318
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:52,559
and yeah i mean it's not going to get us
 

3319
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,549
and yeah i mean it's not going to get us
away from the password and using

3320
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:54,559
away from the password and using
 

3321
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,190
away from the password and using
multi-factor authentication but

3322
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200
multi-factor authentication but
 

3323
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,910
multi-factor authentication but
you know the technology is out there and

3324
00:59:59,910 --> 00:59:59,920
you know the technology is out there and
 

3325
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,990
you know the technology is out there and
we just have to figure out how to use it

3326
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,000
we just have to figure out how to use it
 

3327
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,549
we just have to figure out how to use it
in a really seamless way because

3328
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:04,559
in a really seamless way because
 

3329
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,990
in a really seamless way because
it doesn't matter if you have the

3330
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,000
it doesn't matter if you have the
 

3331
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,150
it doesn't matter if you have the
perfect security solution if no one uses

3332
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160
perfect security solution if no one uses
 

3333
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,150
perfect security solution if no one uses
it i mean when i started at the times

3334
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
it i mean when i started at the times
 

3335
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,069
it i mean when i started at the times
when i was trying to be really good

3336
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:12,079
when i was trying to be really good
 

3337
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,670
when i was trying to be really good
about

3338
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:13,680
about
 

3339
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,829
about
protecting sources i was trying to use

3340
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:15,839
protecting sources i was trying to use
 

3341
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,789
protecting sources i was trying to use
pgp encryption and it's like it didn't

3342
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:18,799
pgp encryption and it's like it didn't
 

3343
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,270
pgp encryption and it's like it didn't
work you know the number of mistakes i

3344
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,280
work you know the number of mistakes i
 

3345
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,510
work you know the number of mistakes i
would probably make just trying to email

3346
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,520
would probably make just trying to email
 

3347
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,950
would probably make just trying to email
someone with pgp just wasn't worth it

3348
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:26,960
someone with pgp just wasn't worth it
 

3349
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,670
someone with pgp just wasn't worth it
um and then signal came along and and

3350
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:29,680
um and then signal came along and and
 

3351
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,630
um and then signal came along and and
signal made it wicker you know they made

3352
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:32,640
signal made it wicker you know they made
 

3353
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,670
signal made it wicker you know they made
it a lot easier to send someone an

3354
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:35,680
it a lot easier to send someone an
 

3355
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,390
it a lot easier to send someone an
encrypted text message so we we we have

3356
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:38,400
encrypted text message so we we we have
 

3357
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,710
encrypted text message so we we we have
to start investing in

3358
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720
to start investing in
 

3359
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,710
to start investing in
creative minds

3360
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:42,720
creative minds
 

3361
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,430
creative minds
um in good security design you know i

3362
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
um in good security design you know i
 

3363
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,950
um in good security design you know i
really think that's the hack that's

3364
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:46,960
really think that's the hack that's
 

3365
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,630
really think that's the hack that's
going to get us out of where we are

3366
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,640
going to get us out of where we are
 

3367
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,910
going to get us out of where we are
today

3368
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:49,920
today
 

3369
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,390
today
what about social engineering

3370
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:52,400
what about social engineering
 

3371
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,150
what about social engineering
do you worry about this

3372
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,160
do you worry about this
 

3373
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,990
do you worry about this
sort of hacking

3374
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:56,000
sort of hacking
 

3375
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,670
sort of hacking
people

3376
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:57,680
people
 

3377
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,789
people
yes i mean this is the worst nightmare

3378
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:00,799
yes i mean this is the worst nightmare
 

3379
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,950
yes i mean this is the worst nightmare
of every chief information security

3380
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
of every chief information security
 

3381
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,630
of every chief information security
officer out there

3382

um
 

3385
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,910
um
you know social engineering we work from

3386
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
you know social engineering we work from
 

3387
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,829
you know social engineering we work from
home

3388
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:08,839
home
 

3389
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:12,230

technology
 

3735
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,829
technology
just because it introduces risks

3736
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
just because it introduces risks
 

3737
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,549
just because it introduces risks
we've always said okay the promise of

3738
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:26,559
we've always said okay the promise of
 

3739
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,270
we've always said okay the promise of
this technology means we should

3740
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
this technology means we should
 

3741
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,829
this technology means we should
keep going keep pressing ahead we just

3742
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:31,839
keep going keep pressing ahead we just
 

3743
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,069
keep going keep pressing ahead we just
need to figure out new ways to manage

3744
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:34,079
need to figure out new ways to manage
 

3745
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,349
need to figure out new ways to manage
that risk

3746
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:35,359
that risk
 

3747
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,750
that risk
and you know that is that's

3748
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:37,760
and you know that is that's
 

3749
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,750
and you know that is that's
that's the blockchain right now

3750
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:39,760
that's the blockchain right now
 

3751
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,549
that's the blockchain right now
like

3752
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:40,559
like
 

3753
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,630
like
when i was covering all of these

3754
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
when i was covering all of these
 

3755
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,710
when i was covering all of these
ransomware attacks

3756

ransomware attacks
 

3757
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,349
ransomware attacks
i thought okay this is gonna be it for

enough
like we have to put this genie back in

3768
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:56,160
like we have to put this genie back in
 

3769

ransomware i mean
 

3773
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,549
ransomware i mean
five years ago they would hijack your pc

3774

five years ago they would hijack your pc
 

3775
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,549
five years ago they would hijack your pc
and they'd say go to the local

know five bitcoin
 

3785
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,190
know five bitcoin
um and so there's no doubt

3786
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:15,200
um and so there's no doubt
 

3787
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,189
um and so there's no doubt
cryptocurrencies enabled ransomware

3788
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:17,199
cryptocurrencies enabled ransomware
 

3789
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:18,950
cryptocurrencies enabled ransomware
attacks but

3790
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:18,960
attacks but
 

3791
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,910
attacks but
after the colonial pipeline ransom was

3792
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:21,920
after the colonial pipeline ransom was
 

3793
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,669
after the colonial pipeline ransom was
seized because if you remember the fbi

3794
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
seized because if you remember the fbi
 

3795
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,590
seized because if you remember the fbi
was actually able to go in

3796
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:25,600
was actually able to go in
 

3797
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,910
was actually able to go in
and claw some of it back from dark side

3798
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:27,920
and claw some of it back from dark side
 

3799
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,590
and claw some of it back from dark side
which was the ransomware group that hit

3800
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:29,600
which was the ransomware group that hit
 

3801
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,030
which was the ransomware group that hit
it

3802
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,040
it
 

3803
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,070
it
and i spoke to these guys at trm labs so

3804
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:34,080
and i spoke to these guys at trm labs so
 

3805
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,590
and i spoke to these guys at trm labs so
they're they're one of these blockchain

3806

intelligence companies and a lot of
 

3809
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,269
intelligence companies and a lot of
people that work there used to work at

cryptocurrency has enabled ransomware
 

3817
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,110
cryptocurrency has enabled ransomware
but

3818
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:47,120
but
 

3819
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,030
but
to track down

3820
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:49,040
to track down
 

3821
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,950
to track down
that ransom payment

3822
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
that ransom payment
 

3823
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,550
that ransom payment
would have taken you know if we were

3824
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560
would have taken you know if we were
 

3825
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,950
would have taken you know if we were
dealing with fiat currency would have

3826
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:54,960
dealing with fiat currency would have
 

3827
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,510
dealing with fiat currency would have
taken us years to get to that one bank

3828
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,520
taken us years to get to that one bank
 

3829

and now thanks to the blockchain

3834
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:03,920
and now thanks to the blockchain
 

3835
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,470
and now thanks to the blockchain
we can track the movement of those funds

3836
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
we can track the movement of those funds
 

3837
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,149
we can track the movement of those funds
in real time

3838
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:08,159
in real time
 

3839
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:10,149
in real time
and you know what you know these

3840
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
and you know what you know these
 

3841
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,390
and you know what you know these
payments are not as anonymous as people

3842
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:12,400
payments are not as anonymous as people
 

3843
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,709
payments are not as anonymous as people
think like we still can use our old

3844
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:14,719
think like we still can use our old
 

3845
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,669
think like we still can use our old
hacking ways and zero days and you know

3846
01:09:17,669 --> 01:09:17,679
hacking ways and zero days and you know
 

3847
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,829
hacking ways and zero days and you know
old school intelligence methods to find

3848
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:19,839
old school intelligence methods to find
 

3849
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,910
old school intelligence methods to find
out who owns that private wallet and how

3850
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920
out who owns that private wallet and how
 

3851
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,430
out who owns that private wallet and how
to get to it

3852
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:23,440
to get to it
 

3853
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,470
to get to it
so it's a it's a curse in some ways and

3854
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,480
so it's a it's a curse in some ways and
 

3855
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,149
so it's a it's a curse in some ways and
that it's an enabler but it's also a

3856
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:28,159
that it's an enabler but it's also a
 

3857
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:30,709
that it's an enabler but it's also a
blessing and they said that same thing

3858
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
blessing and they said that same thing
 

3859
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,789
blessing and they said that same thing
to me that i just said to you they said

3860
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:32,799
to me that i just said to you they said
 

3861
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,510
to me that i just said to you they said
we've never shut down

3862
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:35,520
we've never shut down
 

3863
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,749
we've never shut down
a promising new technology because it

3864
01:09:37,749 --> 01:09:37,759
a promising new technology because it
 

3865
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,550
a promising new technology because it
introduced risk we just figured out how

3866
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
introduced risk we just figured out how
 

3867
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,470
introduced risk we just figured out how
to manage that risk

3868
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,480
to manage that risk
 

3869
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,510
to manage that risk
and i think that's where the

3870
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,520
and i think that's where the
 

3871
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,309
and i think that's where the
conversation unfortunately has to go is

3872
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:46,319
conversation unfortunately has to go is
 

3873
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,430
conversation unfortunately has to go is
how do we

3874
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:47,440
how do we
 

3875
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,669
how do we
in the metaverse

3876
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
in the metaverse
 

3877
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,430
in the metaverse
use technology to uh to fix things

3878
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:53,440
use technology to uh to fix things
 

3879
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,470
use technology to uh to fix things
so maybe we'll finally be able to not

3880
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:56,480
so maybe we'll finally be able to not
 

3881
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,110
so maybe we'll finally be able to not
finally but figure out a way

3882
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
finally but figure out a way
 

3883
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,030
finally but figure out a way
to solve the identity problem on the

3884
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,040
to solve the identity problem on the
 

3885
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,270
to solve the identity problem on the
internet meaning like a blue check mark

3886
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,280
internet meaning like a blue check mark
 

3887
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,030
internet meaning like a blue check mark
for actual human

3888
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,040
for actual human
 

3889
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,990
for actual human
and connect it to identity

3890
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,000
and connect it to identity
 

3891
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,470
and connect it to identity
like a fingerprint so you can prove your

3892
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:10,480
like a fingerprint so you can prove your
 

3893
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,270
like a fingerprint so you can prove your
you

3894
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,280
you
 

3895
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,709

and the press eats it up and then that

4678
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:26,320
and the press eats it up and then that
 

4679
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,830
and the press eats it up and then that
creates a narrative

4680
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:27,840
creates a narrative
 

4681
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,110
creates a narrative
that is

4682
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,120
that is
 

4683
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,110
that is
just like with the nsa you said it's out

4684
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,120
just like with the nsa you said it's out
 

4685
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,669
just like with the nsa you said it's out
of context very targeted

4686
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679

because of this one leak

4690
01:24:38,629 --> 01:24:38,639
because of this one leak
 

4691
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:40,070
because of this one leak
it's really hard to know what to do

4692
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,080
it's really hard to know what to do
 

4693
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,910
it's really hard to know what to do
there because we're now in a society

4694
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:41,920
there because we're now in a society
 

4695
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,390
there because we're now in a society
that's deeply distrust institutions

4696
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,400
that's deeply distrust institutions
 

4697
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,310
that's deeply distrust institutions
and so

4698
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:46,320
and so
 

4699
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,229
and so
narratives by whistleblowers make that

4700
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
narratives by whistleblowers make that
 

4701
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,390
narratives by whistleblowers make that
whistleblower and their forthcoming book

4702
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,400
whistleblower and their forthcoming book
 

4703
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,070
whistleblower and their forthcoming book
very popular

01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:52,080
very popular
 

4705
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,310
very popular
and so there's a huge incentive to take

4706
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:54,320
and so there's a huge incentive to take
 

4707
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,629
and so there's a huge incentive to take
stuff out of context and to tell stories

future yeah and you know it's
 

6275
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,870
future yeah and you know it's
interesting i mean in cyber security the

6276
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:12,880
interesting i mean in cyber security the
 

6277
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,750
interesting i mean in cyber security the
difference is oftentimes you see the

6278
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:15,760
difference is oftentimes you see the
 

6279
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,669
difference is oftentimes you see the
more interesting threats in the private

6280
01:53:17,669 --> 01:53:17,679
more interesting threats in the private
 

6281
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:19,830
more interesting threats in the private
sector because that's where the attacks

6282
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:19,840
sector because that's where the attacks
 

6283
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,390
sector because that's where the attacks
come you know when when cyber criminals

6284
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:22,400
come you know when when cyber criminals
 

6285
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,550
come you know when when cyber criminals
and nation-state adversaries come for

6286
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:24,560
and nation-state adversaries come for
 

6287
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,390
and nation-state adversaries come for
the united states they don't go directly

6288
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:26,400
the united states they don't go directly
 

6289
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,870
the united states they don't go directly
for cyber command or the nsa

6290
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:28,880
for cyber command or the nsa
 

6291
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,790
for cyber command or the nsa
no they go for banks they go for google

6292
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:32,800
no they go for banks they go for google
 

6293
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:34,870
no they go for banks they go for google
they go for microsoft they go for

6294
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:34,880
they go for microsoft they go for
 

6295
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,350
they go for microsoft they go for
critical infrastructure and so those

6296
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:37,360
critical infrastructure and so those
 

6297
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,430
critical infrastructure and so those
companies those private sector companies

6298
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:39,440
companies those private sector companies
 

6299
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,669
companies those private sector companies
get to see some of the most advanced

6300
01:53:41,669 --> 01:53:41,679
get to see some of the most advanced
 

6301
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:43,270
get to see some of the most advanced

sophisticated
 

6303
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,870
sophisticated
attacks

6304
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:44,880
attacks
 

6305
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,030

you just saved
 

6313
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,950
you just saved
god knows how many systems from you know

6314
01:53:56,950 --> 01:53:56,960
god knows how many systems from you know
 

6315
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,830
god knows how many systems from you know
that compromise turning into something

6316
