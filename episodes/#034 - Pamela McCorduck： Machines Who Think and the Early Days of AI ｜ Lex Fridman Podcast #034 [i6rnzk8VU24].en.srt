retrospect is that they were at the
height of their research careers and

176
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:00,610
height of their research careers and
 

177
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,340
height of their research careers and
it's humbling to me

178
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,350
it's humbling to me
 

179

thought it was the first textbook of
 

265
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,170
thought it was the first textbook of
readings of AI and they they only did it

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,180
readings of AI and they they only did it
 

267
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,910
readings of AI and they they only did it
because they were trying to teach AI to

because they were trying to teach AI to
 

269

Internet where you could go look at
 

277
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,399

an article so I was fascinated from the

278
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:22,409
an article so I was fascinated from the
 

279
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:26,089
an article so I was fascinated from the
get-go by AI I was an English major yeah

280
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:26,099
get-go by AI I was an English major yeah
 

281
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,200
get-go by AI I was an English major yeah
what did I know and yet I was fascinated

282
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,210
what did I know and yet I was fascinated
 

283
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,080
what did I know and yet I was fascinated
and that's why you saw that historical

284
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,090
and that's why you saw that historical
 

285
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,600
and that's why you saw that historical
but that literary background which i

286
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:35,610
but that literary background which i
 

287
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,390
but that literary background which i
think is very much a part of the

288
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
think is very much a part of the
 

289
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,010
think is very much a part of the
continuum of AI that the AI grew out of

290
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,020
continuum of AI that the AI grew out of
 

291
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,159
continuum of AI that the AI grew out of
that same impulse is that yeah that

292
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,169
that same impulse is that yeah that
 

293
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,270
that same impulse is that yeah that

how did you even think of it back back
 

297
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,040
how did you even think of it back back
then what what was the possibilities the

00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
dreams I was interesting to you the idea
 

301
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,270
dreams I was interesting to you the idea
of intelligence outside the human

302
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,280
of intelligence outside the human
 

303
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,420
of intelligence outside the human
cranium this was a phenomenal idea and

304
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,430
cranium this was a phenomenal idea and
 

305
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,059
cranium this was a phenomenal idea and
even when I finished machines who think

306
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:08,069
even when I finished machines who think
 

307
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:10,279
even when I finished machines who think
I didn't know if they were gonna succeed

308
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:10,289
I didn't know if they were gonna succeed

algorithms so you you can think about
 

635
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,220
algorithms so you you can think about
their social networks have algorithms

636
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,230
their social networks have algorithms
 

637
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,380
their social networks have algorithms
that recommend the content you see there

638
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,390
that recommend the content you see there
 

639
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,810
that recommend the content you see there
by these algorithms control the behavior

640
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:35,820
by these algorithms control the behavior
 

641
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,570
by these algorithms control the behavior
of the masses there are these concerns

642
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:37,580
of the masses there are these concerns
 

643
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,370
of the masses there are these concerns
but it to me it feels like the fear that

644
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:40,380
but it to me it feels like the fear that
 

645
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,390
but it to me it feels like the fear that
people have is deeper than that

646
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,400
people have is deeper than that
 

647
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,010
people have is deeper than that
so have you thought about the psychology

648
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,020
so have you thought about the psychology
 

649
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,040
so have you thought about the psychology
of it I think in a superficial way I

650
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,050
of it I think in a superficial way I
 

651
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:55,000
of it I think in a superficial way I
have there is this notion that if we

652
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,010
have there is this notion that if we
 

653
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,640
have there is this notion that if we
produce a machine that can think it will

654
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:58,650
produce a machine that can think it will
 

655
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,490
produce a machine that can think it will
out thank us and therefore replace us I

656
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:01,500
out thank us and therefore replace us I
 

657
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,730
out thank us and therefore replace us I

me of when I was in Santa Fe I knew a

724
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,370
me of when I was in Santa Fe I knew a
 

725
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,299
me of when I was in Santa Fe I knew a
lot of archaeologists and which was a

726
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:01,309
lot of archaeologists and which was a
 

727
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:06,130
lot of archaeologists and which was a
hobby of mine and I would say yeah yeah

728
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,140
hobby of mine and I would say yeah yeah
 

729
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,900
hobby of mine and I would say yeah yeah
well you can look at the shards and say

730
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:07,910
well you can look at the shards and say
 

731
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,940
well you can look at the shards and say
oh this came from this tribe and this

732
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:09,950
oh this came from this tribe and this
 

733
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,090
oh this came from this tribe and this
came from this trade route and so on but

734
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,100
came from this trade route and so on but
 

735
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,630
came from this trade route and so on but
what about the big picture and a very

736
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
what about the big picture and a very
 

737
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,730
what about the big picture and a very
distinguished archeologist said to me

they're trying to match the shard to the

that's you know where did this corn the

746
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,270
that's you know where did this corn the
 

747
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,659
that's you know where did this corn the
remainder of this corn come from was it

748
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:31,669
remainder of this corn come from was it
 

749
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,539
remainder of this corn come from was it
grown here was it grown elsewhere and I

750
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:34,549
grown here was it grown elsewhere and I
 

751
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,360

think this is part of the AI any

752
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,370
think this is part of the AI any

the the hard work and it is hard work

756
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,220
the the hard work and it is hard work

that you don't step I can say oh well

758
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:47,900
that you don't step I can say oh well
 

759
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,220
that you don't step I can say oh well
now let's talk about that you know the

760
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,230
now let's talk about that you know the
 

761
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,610
now let's talk about that you know the
general meaning of all yes so none of

00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:54,620
general meaning of all yes so none of

the even Minsky and McCarthy they oh

764
00:18:59,169 --> 00:18:59,179
the even Minsky and McCarthy they oh

00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,570
the even Minsky and McCarthy they oh
those guys did yeah the founding fathers

766
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:01,580
those guys did yeah the founding fathers
 

767
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,990
those guys did yeah the founding fathers
did early on or pretty early on what

I looked at it the two cognitive

772
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,250
I looked at it the two cognitive
 

773
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,600
I looked at it the two cognitive
psychologists Newell and Simon they

774
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:13,610
psychologists Newell and Simon they
 

775
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,220
psychologists Newell and Simon they
wanted to imagine

776
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,230
wanted to imagine
 

777
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,600
wanted to imagine
and reforming cognitive psychology so

778
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:19,610
and reforming cognitive psychology so
 

779
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,240
and reforming cognitive psychology so
that we would really really understand

780
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,250
that we would really really understand
 

781
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,960
that we would really really understand
the brain

782
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:24,970

 

783
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,890

Minsky was more speculative and John

McCarthy saw it as I think I'm doing

786
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:33,830
McCarthy saw it as I think I'm doing
 

787
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,049
McCarthy saw it as I think I'm doing
doing him right by this he really saw it

788
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:38,059
doing him right by this he really saw it
 

789
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:40,210
doing him right by this he really saw it
as a great boon for human beings to have

a technological answer but here's how we
could get over that and then bla bla bla

808
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
could get over that and then bla bla bla

00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,659
you have if we get philosophical for a
second do you worry that once we create

second do you worry that once we create
 

913
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:56,369
second do you worry that once we create
machines that are a little bit more

intelligent let's look at Roomba that

916
00:22:58,529 --> 00:22:58,539
intelligent let's look at Roomba that
 

917
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:01,999
intelligent let's look at Roomba that
vacuum is the cleaner that that this

different will come out I don't worry

924
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:14,259
different will come out I don't worry
 

925
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,539
different will come out I don't worry
about it I could imagine it happening

about it I could imagine it happening
but I think that what AI has to offer

928
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:21,940
but I think that what AI has to offer
 

929
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,950

see master McCarthy is uh what about the

946
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:49,720
see master McCarthy is uh what about the
 

947
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,280
see master McCarthy is uh what about the
years at CMU Carnegie Mellon with Joe

948
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,290
years at CMU Carnegie Mellon with Joe
 

949
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:59,240
years at CMU Carnegie Mellon with Joe
and was sure a Joe was not in AI he was

950

of time fine I said so the following we

1108
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,140
of time fine I said so the following we
 

1109
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,620
of time fine I said so the following we
exchanged mail over the summer that was

1110
00:27:59,620 --> 00:27:59,630
exchanged mail over the summer that was
 

1111

exchanged mail over the summer that was
us post in those days because you didn't

1112
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:02,809
us post in those days because you didn't
 

1113
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:07,240
us post in those days because you didn't
have personal email right and we I

1114
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,250
have personal email right and we I
 

1115
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,649
have personal email right and we I
decided I would

1116

decided I would
 

1117
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:11,200
decided I would
organize it and there would be eight of

eight people and we met monthly and we

1134
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:39,609
eight people and we met monthly and we
 

1135
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:43,690
eight people and we met monthly and we
we just sank our teeth into really hard

1136
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:43,700
we just sank our teeth into really hard
 

1137
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,960
we just sank our teeth into really hard
topics and it was great fun how have

1138
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:46,970
topics and it was great fun how have
 

1139
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,219
topics and it was great fun how have
your own views around artificial

1140
00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:51,229

and afterwards the ripple effects I was

1146
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:58,700
and afterwards the ripple effects I was
 

1147
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,469
and afterwards the ripple effects I was
a little skeptical that this whole thing

1148
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:02,479
a little skeptical that this whole thing
 

1149
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,330
a little skeptical that this whole thing
would work out it didn't matter to me it

1150
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:04,340
would work out it didn't matter to me it
 

1151
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,909
would work out it didn't matter to me it
was so audacious the whole thing being a

1154
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:14,690
IAI general yeah and in some ways it
 

1155
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,019
IAI general yeah and in some ways it
hasn't worked out the way I expected so

1156
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:17,029
hasn't worked out the way I expected so
 

1157
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:21,930
hasn't worked out the way I expected so
far that is to say there's this

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:33,940
algorithmic yeah and in the part of
 

1165
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,690
algorithmic yeah and in the part of
symbolic processing there is very little

1166
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:37,700
symbolic processing there is very little
 

1167

some figures they popped up in your life
 

1175
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:53,320
some figures they popped up in your life
in the 80s with expert systems where

1176

in the 80s with expert systems where
 

1177
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,039
in the 80s with expert systems where
there was the symbolic AI possibilities

1178
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:57,049
there was the symbolic AI possibilities
 

1179
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:59,379
there was the symbolic AI possibilities
of what's you know that what most people

1180
00:29:59,379 --> 00:29:59,389
of what's you know that what most people
 

1181
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:02,200
of what's you know that what most people
think of as AI if you dream of the

1182
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,210
think of as AI if you dream of the
 

1183
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,499
think of as AI if you dream of the
possibilities AI is really expert system

and those hit a few walls and those

1186
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:08,119
and those hit a few walls and those
 

1187
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,539
and those hit a few walls and those
challenges there and I think yes they

1188
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:10,549
challenges there and I think yes they
 

1189
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:12,009
challenges there and I think yes they
will reemerge again with some new

1190

will reemerge again with some new
 

1191
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,259
will reemerge again with some new
breakthroughs and so on but what did

00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:14,269
breakthroughs and so on but what did
 

1193
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:14,950
breakthroughs and so on but what did
that feel like

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
that feel like
 

1195
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,799
that feel like
both the possibility and the winter that

slow down ah you know this whole thing
 

1201
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,549
slow down ah you know this whole thing
about AI winter is to me a crock snow

1202
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:26,559
about AI winter is to me a crock snow

which is supposed to be my god it was
 

1209
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,440
which is supposed to be my god it was
really important it was laying down

things that nobody had thought about
 

1213
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,850
things that nobody had thought about
before but it was basic research

impossible you really have to believe it

1262
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:41,549
impossible you really have to believe it
 

1263
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,789
impossible you really have to believe it
and I think what's going to happen when

1264
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:44,799
and I think what's going to happen when
 

1265
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,169
and I think what's going to happen when
you believe it cuz there's a lot of

1266
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:46,179
you believe it cuz there's a lot of
 

1267
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,930
you believe it cuz there's a lot of
really brilliant people around him is

1268
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:47,940
really brilliant people around him is
 

1269
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,780
really brilliant people around him is
some good stuff will come out of it some

1270
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:51,790
some good stuff will come out of it some
 

1271
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,640
some good stuff will come out of it some
unexpected brilliant breakthroughs will

1272
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:53,650
unexpected brilliant breakthroughs will
 

1273
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,140
unexpected brilliant breakthroughs will
come out of it when you really believe

1274
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,150
come out of it when you really believe
 

1275
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,330
come out of it when you really believe
it when you work that hard I believe

1276
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:57,340
it when you work that hard I believe
 

1277
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,760
it when you work that hard I believe
that I believe autonomous vehicles will

1278
00:31:59,760 --> 00:31:59,770
that I believe autonomous vehicles will
 

1279
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,260
that I believe autonomous vehicles will
come I just don't believe that it'll be

1280
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,270
come I just don't believe that it'll be
 

1281
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,260
come I just don't believe that it'll be
in a year yeah I wish but nevertheless

1282
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,270
in a year yeah I wish but nevertheless
 

1283
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,539
in a year yeah I wish but nevertheless
there's I found vehicles is a good

1284
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:06,549
there's I found vehicles is a good
 

1285
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,930
there's I found vehicles is a good
example there's a feeling many companies

1286
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:09,940
example there's a feeling many companies
 

1287
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,690
example there's a feeling many companies
have promised by 2021 by 2022 for GM I

1288
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:14,700
have promised by 2021 by 2022 for GM I
 

1289
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,740
have promised by 2021 by 2022 for GM I
basically every single automotive

1290
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:16,750
basically every single automotive
 

1291
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,270
basically every single automotive
companies promise they'll have

1292
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:18,280
companies promise they'll have
 

1293
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,490
companies promise they'll have
autonomous vehicles so that kind of over

1294
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:20,500
autonomous vehicles so that kind of over
 

1295
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,470
autonomous vehicles so that kind of over
the promise is what leads to the winter

1296
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
the promise is what leads to the winter
 

1297
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,810
the promise is what leads to the winter
because it will come to those dates

1298
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:24,820
because it will come to those dates
 

1299
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,970
because it will come to those dates
there won't be autonomous vehicles and

1300
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:26,980
there won't be autonomous vehicles and
 

1301
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,850
there won't be autonomous vehicles and
they'll be a feeling well wait a minute

1302
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:29,860
they'll be a feeling well wait a minute
 

1303
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,340
they'll be a feeling well wait a minute
if we took your word at that time that

1304
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:32,350
if we took your word at that time that
 

1305
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,130
if we took your word at that time that
means

1306
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:33,140
means
 

1307
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,620
means
we just spent billions of dollars had

1308
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:35,630
we just spent billions of dollars had
 

1309
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,919
we just spent billions of dollars had
made no money and there's a counter

1310
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:38,929
made no money and there's a counter
 

1311
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:41,080
made no money and there's a counter
response to where everybody gives up on

00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,090
response to where everybody gives up on
 

1313
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,549
response to where everybody gives up on
it sort of intellectually and at every

1314
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:45,559
it sort of intellectually and at every
 

1315
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,549
it sort of intellectually and at every
level the hope just dies and all that's

1316
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
level the hope just dies and all that's
 

1317
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,940
level the hope just dies and all that's
left is a few basic researchers so

1318
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:51,950
left is a few basic researchers so
 

1319
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,650
left is a few basic researchers so
you're uncomfortable with some aspects

1320
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:53,660
you're uncomfortable with some aspects
 

1321
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,900
you're uncomfortable with some aspects
of this this idea well it's the

1322
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:55,910
of this this idea well it's the
 

1323
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,730
of this this idea well it's the
difference between science and commerce

1324
00:32:59,730 --> 00:32:59,740
difference between science and commerce
 

1325
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,070
difference between science and commerce
so you think science prevail science

1326
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,080
so you think science prevail science
 

1327
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,970
so you think science prevail science
goes on the way does oh it was science

1328
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:06,980
goes on the way does oh it was science
 

1329
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,250
goes on the way does oh it was science
can really be killed by not getting

1330
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,260
can really be killed by not getting
 

1331
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,380
can really be killed by not getting
proper funding or timely funding I think

1332
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:14,390
proper funding or timely funding I think
 

1333
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,720
proper funding or timely funding I think

00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,750
working diligently but there certainly
is a huge amount of funding now and

1418
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:34,760
is a huge amount of funding now and
 

1419
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,110
is a huge amount of funding now and
there's a concern on the AI side and

1420
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,120
there's a concern on the AI side and
 

1421
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,210
there's a concern on the AI side and
deep learning there's a concern that we

1422
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:40,220
deep learning there's a concern that we
 

1423
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,300
deep learning there's a concern that we
might with over-promising hit another

00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,670
might with over-promising hit another
slowdown and funding which does affect

the number of students you know that
 

1429
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,500
the number of students you know that
kind of thing yeah it no it does so the

1430
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:50,510
kind of thing yeah it no it does so the
 

1431
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,880
kind of thing yeah it no it does so the
kind of ideas you had two machines who

1432
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:51,890
kind of ideas you had two machines who
 

1433
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,670
kind of ideas you had two machines who
think did you continue that curiosity

1434
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:54,680
think did you continue that curiosity
 

1435
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,290
think did you continue that curiosity
throw through the decades that followed

yes I did and what what was your view

1438
00:35:59,500 --> 00:35:59,510
yes I did and what what was your view
 

1439
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,340
yes I did and what what was your view
historical view of how AI community

historical view of how AI community
 

1441
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,190

evolved the conversations about it the
 

1443
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,320

just as we were just talking
 

1449
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:19,750
just as we were just talking
the symbolic AI really kind of dried up

1450
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
the symbolic AI really kind of dried up
 

1451
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,050
the symbolic AI really kind of dried up
and it all became algorithmic I remember

1452
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:23,060
and it all became algorithmic I remember
 

1453
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,170
and it all became algorithmic I remember
a young AI student telling me what he

1454
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:26,180
a young AI student telling me what he
 

1455
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,870
a young AI student telling me what he
was doing and I had been away from the

was doing and I had been away from the
 

1457
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,720

00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,190
no they became the main event that
surprised me and we all know the

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,660
last projects I did
concerning AI in particular was looking

1520
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:02,670
concerning AI in particular was looking
 

1521
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,489
concerning AI in particular was looking
at the work of Harold Cohen the painter

1522
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:04,499
at the work of Harold Cohen the painter
 

1523
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:10,900
at the work of Harold Cohen the painter
and Harold was deeply involved with AI

1524
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:10,910
and Harold was deeply involved with AI
 

1525
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:17,209
and Harold was deeply involved with AI
he was a painter first and and what his

1526
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:17,219
he was a painter first and and what his
 

1527
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:19,880
he was a painter first and and what his
project Aaron which was a lifelong

1528
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:19,890
project Aaron which was a lifelong
 

1529
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:26,839
project Aaron which was a lifelong
project did was reflect his own

1530
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:26,849
project did was reflect his own
 

1531
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:31,609
project did was reflect his own
cognitive processes okay Harold and I

1532
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:31,619
cognitive processes okay Harold and I
 

1533
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,200
cognitive processes okay Harold and I
even though I wrote a book about it we

1534
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,210
even though I wrote a book about it we
 

1535
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,630
even though I wrote a book about it we
had a lot of friction between us and I

1536
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:37,640
had a lot of friction between us and I
 

1537
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,880
had a lot of friction between us and I
went I thought this is it you know the

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:40,890
went I thought this is it you know the
 

1539
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,239
went I thought this is it you know the
book died it was published didn't fell

1540
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:44,249
book died it was published didn't fell

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:47,609
into a ditch this is it I'm finished
 

1543
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:50,209
into a ditch this is it I'm finished
it's time for me to do something

1544
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:50,219
it's time for me to do something
 

1545
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:53,569
it's time for me to do something
different by chance this was a

00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:53,579
different by chance this was a
 

1547
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,630
different by chance this was a
sabbatical year for my husband and we

1548
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
sabbatical year for my husband and we
 

1549
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,759
sabbatical year for my husband and we
spent two months at the Santa Fe

1550

spent two months at the Santa Fe
 

1551

two months at the Santa Fe Institute

1560
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:12,700
two months at the Santa Fe Institute
 

1561
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,830
two months at the Santa Fe Institute
were so restorative for me and I began

1562
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:16,840
were so restorative for me and I began
 

1563
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,860
were so restorative for me and I began
to it this the Institute was very small

1564
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:19,870
to it this the Institute was very small
 

1565
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,560
to it this the Institute was very small
then it was in some kind of office

1566
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:22,570
then it was in some kind of office
 

1567
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,560
then it was in some kind of office
complex on old Santa Fe Trail everybody

1568
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:25,570
complex on old Santa Fe Trail everybody
 

1569
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,030

kept their door open so you could crack

1570
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,040
kept their door open so you could crack
 

1571
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,650
kept their door open so you could crack
your head on a problem and if you

1572
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:31,660
your head on a problem and if you
 

1573
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,690
your head on a problem and if you
finally didn't get it you could walk in

yourself in the corner unfortunately as

1970
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:41,609
yourself in the corner unfortunately as
 

1971
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:45,079
yourself in the corner unfortunately as
humans when were assistants we we care

1972
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:45,089
humans when were assistants we we care
 

1973
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:46,819
humans when were assistants we we care
we're still even when we're assisting

1974
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:46,829
we're still even when we're assisting
 

1975
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:48,620
we're still even when we're assisting
others we care about ourselves more of

1976
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:48,630
others we care about ourselves more of
 

1977
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,539
others we care about ourselves more of
course and so you create more

1978
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:50,549
course and so you create more
 

1979
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:55,430
course and so you create more
frustration and in robot AI assistant

1980
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
frustration and in robot AI assistant
 

1981
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,249
frustration and in robot AI assistant
can really optimize the experience of

1982
00:49:58,249 --> 00:49:58,259
can really optimize the experience of
 

1983
00:49:58,259 --> 00:50:01,819
can really optimize the experience of
you I was just speaking to the point you

1984
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:01,829
you I was just speaking to the point you
 

1985
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:03,950
you I was just speaking to the point you
actually bring up a very very good point

1986
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:03,960
actually bring up a very very good point
 

1987
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,569
actually bring up a very very good point
but I was speaking to the fact that as

1988
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:05,579
but I was speaking to the fact that as
 

1989
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,370
but I was speaking to the fact that as
humans they're a little complicated that

1990
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:07,380
humans they're a little complicated that
 

1991
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,759
humans they're a little complicated that
we don't necessarily want a perfect

1992
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:10,769
we don't necessarily want a perfect
 

1993
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:11,420
we don't necessarily want a perfect
servant

1994
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:11,430
servant
 

1995
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,779
servant
I don't maybe you disagree with that but

1996
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:14,789
I don't maybe you disagree with that but
 

1997
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:20,210
I don't maybe you disagree with that but
there's um I think there's a push and

1998
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:20,220
there's um I think there's a push and
 

1999
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,120
there's um I think there's a push and
pull with humans mm-hmm a little tension

2000
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,130
pull with humans mm-hmm a little tension
 

2001
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,390
pull with humans mm-hmm a little tension
a little mystery that of course that's

2002
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
a little mystery that of course that's
 

2003
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,829
a little mystery that of course that's
really difficult failure to get right

2004
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
really difficult failure to get right
 

2005
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,180
really difficult failure to get right
but I do sense especially in today with

2006
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:32,190
but I do sense especially in today with
 

2007
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,819
but I do sense especially in today with
social media the people are getting more

2008
00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:34,829

loneliness there's a longing for
 

2015

2016
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:46,589
connection and AI can help alleviate
 

2017
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:49,609

00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:09,539
level of intelligence is exceptionally
 

2029
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:12,499
level of intelligence is exceptionally
difficult to achieve actually as the

2030
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:12,509
difficult to achieve actually as the
 

2031
00:51:12,509 --> 00:51:14,779

hardest chapter to write and I used
 

2187
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,519
hardest chapter to write and I used
something from the Santa Fe Institute

2188
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:34,529
something from the Santa Fe Institute
 

2189
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:38,370
something from the Santa Fe Institute
which is the sand pile effect that you

2190
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:38,380
which is the sand pile effect that you
 

2191
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:42,180
which is the sand pile effect that you
drop sand very slowly onto a pile and it

2192
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,190
drop sand very slowly onto a pile and it
 

2193
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:44,579
drop sand very slowly onto a pile and it
grows and it grows and it grows until

2194
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:44,589
grows and it grows and it grows until
 

2195
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:50,579
grows and it grows and it grows until
suddenly it just breaks apart and in a

2196
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:50,589
suddenly it just breaks apart and in a
 

2197
00:55:50,589 --> 00:55:54,150
suddenly it just breaks apart and in a
way me too has done that that was the

2198
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160
way me too has done that that was the
 

2199
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,630
way me too has done that that was the
last drop of sand that broke everything

2200
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:57,640
last drop of sand that broke everything
 

2201
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,299
last drop of sand that broke everything
apart that was a perfect example of the

2202
00:56:00,299 --> 00:56:00,309
apart that was a perfect example of the
 

2203
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:03,059
apart that was a perfect example of the
sand pile effect and that made me feel

2204
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:03,069
sand pile effect and that made me feel
 

2205
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:05,759
sand pile effect and that made me feel
good it didn't change all of society but

2206
00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:05,769
good it didn't change all of society but
 

2207

good it didn't change all of society but
