um in Puerto Rico we lived in a very
small uh local Town Dorado and most of

small uh local Town Dorado and most of
 

199
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,490
small uh local Town Dorado and most of
the athletes were living with each other

200
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:01,500
the athletes were living with each other
 

201
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,610
the athletes were living with each other
and so unlike New York where there was

202
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,620
and so unlike New York where there was
 

203
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,470
and so unlike New York where there was
always a break you trained together but

204
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
always a break you trained together but
 

205
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,030
always a break you trained together but
when training was over you went about

206
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,040
when training was over you went about
 

207
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,270
when training was over you went about
your life in New York and New Jersey

208
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
your life in New York and New Jersey
 

209
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,670
your life in New York and New Jersey
um with everyone living in very close

um with everyone living in very close
proximity to each other any tensions

00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,220
proximity to each other any tensions
 

213
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,189
proximity to each other any tensions
got magnified because there was no

214
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
got magnified because there was no
 

215
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,870
got magnified because there was no
relief from them you didn't get to get

216
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
relief from them you didn't get to get
 

217
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,610
relief from them you didn't get to get
away from people if you had a problem

218
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:22,620
away from people if you had a problem
 

219
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,530
away from people if you had a problem
with someone on the mat well now you had

220
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:24,540
with someone on the mat well now you had
 

221
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,590
with someone on the mat well now you had
to to live with them for uh the rest of

222
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
to to live with them for uh the rest of
 

223
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,810
to to live with them for uh the rest of
the day and the night and this goes on

224
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:29,820
the day and the night and this goes on
 

225
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,510
the day and the night and this goes on
for long periods of time so I believe it

226
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:32,520
for long periods of time so I believe it
 

227
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,790
for long periods of time so I believe it
had the effect of magnifying whatever

to a point where
 

273
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,170
to a point where
um it was difficult for them even to be

in the training room together at that
 

277
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,249
in the training room together at that
point you're starting to you know when

278
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,259
point you're starting to you know when
 

279
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,170
point you're starting to you know when
Once training takes a hit then you

280
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,180
Once training takes a hit then you
 

281
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,810
Once training takes a hit then you
you've got to start to address these

282
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:44,820
you've got to start to address these
 

283
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,930
you've got to start to address these
um the attempts at reconciliation

284
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:47,940
um the attempts at reconciliation
 

285
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,249
um the attempts at reconciliation
uh fell through and uh

286
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:52,259
uh fell through and uh
 

287
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,670
uh fell through and uh
a decision was made to to move to Texas

288
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
a decision was made to to move to Texas
 

289
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,070
a decision was made to to move to Texas
I wanted everyone to move as a team

290
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
I wanted everyone to move as a team
 

291
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,950
I wanted everyone to move as a team
what I wanted to do was keep the team

292
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
what I wanted to do was keep the team
 

293
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,749
what I wanted to do was keep the team
together

294
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:02,759
together
 

295
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,749
together
as long as the period leading up to 80cc

296
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
as long as the period leading up to 80cc
 

297
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,270
as long as the period leading up to 80cc
so that everyone could train together

298
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,280
so that everyone could train together
 

299
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,189
so that everyone could train together
so I said okay there's problems but

300
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:10,199
so I said okay there's problems but
 

301
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,870
so I said okay there's problems but
let's just tough it out one year we

302
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:11,880
let's just tough it out one year we
 

303
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,310
let's just tough it out one year we
moved to Texas

304
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,320
moved to Texas
 

305
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,969
moved to Texas
let's just go there and keep Unity if

306
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:16,979
let's just go there and keep Unity if
 

307
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:17,990
let's just go there and keep Unity if
some people don't want to train with

308
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
some people don't want to train with
 

309
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,730
some people don't want to train with
other people that's fine but I believe

310
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:19,740
other people that's fine but I believe
 

311
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,210
other people that's fine but I believe
that the team would be weakened by

312
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,220
that the team would be weakened by
 

313
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,090
that the team would be weakened by
breaking apart I believe that they had

314
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,100
breaking apart I believe that they had
 

315
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,710
breaking apart I believe that they had
an excellent Rapport as training

316
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720
an excellent Rapport as training
 

317
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,390
an excellent Rapport as training
Partners the technical level was

318
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:29,400
Partners the technical level was
 

319
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,150
Partners the technical level was
increasing dramatically

320
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,160
increasing dramatically
 

321
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,350
increasing dramatically
many of the younger athletes are really

322
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
many of the younger athletes are really
 

323
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,670
many of the younger athletes are really
starting to come into their own and

324
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:34,680
starting to come into their own and
 

325
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,730
starting to come into their own and
really develop well and so my take on it

326
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:37,740
really develop well and so my take on it
 

327
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,370
really develop well and so my take on it
was okay if there's problems

328
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:40,380
was okay if there's problems
 

329
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,590
was okay if there's problems
so be it but let's all just stay

330
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:42,600
so be it but let's all just stay
 

331
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,529
so be it but let's all just stay
together until 80cc 2022 was a unified

332
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:45,539
together until 80cc 2022 was a unified
 

333
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,770
together until 80cc 2022 was a unified
team go out prepare yourselves as best

334
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:48,780
team go out prepare yourselves as best
 

335
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,809
team go out prepare yourselves as best
you can and

336
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:50,819
you can and
 

337
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,090
you can and
um uh and then after that we can make a

338
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,100
um uh and then after that we can make a
 

339
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,249
um uh and then after that we can make a
decision as to whether we break up or

340
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:55,259
decision as to whether we break up or
 

341
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:56,689
decision as to whether we break up or
not

342
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:56,699
not
 

343
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,170
not
um but that was rejected and uh the team

344
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,180
um but that was rejected and uh the team
 

345
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,330
um but that was rejected and uh the team
split and

346
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:02,340
split and
 

347
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,290
split and
um uh they moved to Austin uh We've made

348
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,300
um uh they moved to Austin uh We've made
 

349
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,550
um uh they moved to Austin uh We've made
prior arrangements to go to a local gym

350
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:09,560
prior arrangements to go to a local gym
 

351
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,850
prior arrangements to go to a local gym
and they took that jam and uh we were

352
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:13,860
and they took that jam and uh we were
 

353
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,510
and they took that jam and uh we were
left with no gym and more or less

354
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
left with no gym and more or less
 

355
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,110
left with no gym and more or less
homeless in uh in Austin so uh a year

356
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
homeless in uh in Austin so uh a year
 

357
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,270
homeless in uh in Austin so uh a year
out from ADCC yes this is one year out

358
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
out from ADCC yes this is one year out
 

359
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,550
out from ADCC yes this is one year out
so roughly three quarters of the uh

360
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:25,560
so roughly three quarters of the uh
 

361
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,110
so roughly three quarters of the uh
competitive athletes left in in one week

362
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
competitive athletes left in in one week
 

363
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,050
competitive athletes left in in one week
um so uh at that point uh that was

364
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,060
um so uh at that point uh that was
 

365
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,969
um so uh at that point uh that was
probably the lowest point because at

366
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:34,979
probably the lowest point because at
 

367
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,070
probably the lowest point because at
that point not only did we not have a

368
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,080
that point not only did we not have a
 

369
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,409
that point not only did we not have a
place to train

370
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:39,419
place to train
 

371
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,629
place to train
um we had very few training partners for

372
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:41,639
um we had very few training partners for
 

373
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,730
um we had very few training partners for
the few that had remained

374
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:43,740
the few that had remained
 

375
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,650
the few that had remained
and um uh the main athlete in the team

376
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:48,660
and um uh the main athlete in the team
 

377
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,749
and um uh the main athlete in the team
Gordon Ryan was going through a

378
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:50,759
Gordon Ryan was going through a
 

379
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,210
Gordon Ryan was going through a
particularly bad spell with his

380
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:53,220
particularly bad spell with his
 

381
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,430
particularly bad spell with his
unresolved stomach issues and there was

382
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
unresolved stomach issues and there was
 

383
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,689
unresolved stomach issues and there was
doubt as to whether or not he could

384
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:56,699
doubt as to whether or not he could
 

385
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,529
doubt as to whether or not he could
compete at all and was actively thinking

386
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:00,539
compete at all and was actively thinking
 

387
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,150
compete at all and was actively thinking
about retiring from the sport so maybe

388
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
about retiring from the sport so maybe
 

389
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,370
about retiring from the sport so maybe
not compete ever again potentially yeah

390
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:04,380
not compete ever again potentially yeah
 

391
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,290
not compete ever again potentially yeah
yeah so that was a time when he's like

392
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,300
yeah so that was a time when he's like
 

393
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,990
yeah so that was a time when he's like
man this is the whole program seems to

394
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
man this is the whole program seems to
 

395
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,089
man this is the whole program seems to
be dead in the water at this point

396
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:11,099
be dead in the water at this point
 

397
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,070
be dead in the water at this point
um most of the competitive athletes were

398
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,080
um most of the competitive athletes were
 

399
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,749
um most of the competitive athletes were
gone there were very few training

gone there were very few training
 

401
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,189
gone there were very few training

most ills not all of them but most of

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
most ills not all of them but most of
 

427
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,490
most ills not all of them but most of
them and

them and
 

429
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,610
them and
um uh I'm confident that if you give me

430
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:52,620
um uh I'm confident that if you give me
 

431
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,430
um uh I'm confident that if you give me
a new crop of students I can

432
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
a new crop of students I can
 

433
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,269
a new crop of students I can
I can produce magic but it's going to

434
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
I can produce magic but it's going to
 

435
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,030
I can produce magic but it's going to
take time so that conference was in part

take time so that conference was in part
 

437
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,370
take time so that conference was in part
a source of strength yes it's just like

438
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:04,380
a source of strength yes it's just like
 

439
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,329
a source of strength yes it's just like
I I wasn't confident that ADCC 2022

440
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:08,339
I I wasn't confident that ADCC 2022
 

441
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,949
I I wasn't confident that ADCC 2022
would go well because we only had one

442
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:09,959
would go well because we only had one
 

443
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:15,170
would go well because we only had one
year without a gym and with a team that

444
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,180
year without a gym and with a team that
 

445
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,130
year without a gym and with a team that
was completely broken up to um to to

446
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,140
was completely broken up to um to to
 

447
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,490
was completely broken up to um to to
even an attempt to get into ADCC

448
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,500
even an attempt to get into ADCC
 

449
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,190
even an attempt to get into ADCC
so um uh things looked a little Grim but

450
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
so um uh things looked a little Grim but
 

451
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,389
so um uh things looked a little Grim but
I was confident you know given enough

badoni was interested in the idea of
 

467
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,090
badoni was interested in the idea of
coming down and training but he'd always

468
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,100
coming down and training but he'd always
 

469
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,949
coming down and training but he'd always
felt like it would be difficult because

470
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:51,959
felt like it would be difficult because

there were people in his weight class
 

473
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,509
there were people in his weight class
who were already there and he felt it

who were already there and he felt it
 

475
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,130
who were already there and he felt it
would be awkward

00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,140
would be awkward
 

477
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,810
would be awkward
um but now that they had left that

00:09:59,810 --> 00:09:59,820
um but now that they had left that

so there was this um uh long and tough
preparation and it was compounded by the

824
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:52,680
preparation and it was compounded by the
 

825
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,410
preparation and it was compounded by the
fact that it's golden felt better he

826
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:54,420
fact that it's golden felt better he
 

827
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,170
fact that it's golden felt better he
felt a need to

everything I taught them they still

1266
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:42,659
everything I taught them they still
 

1267

everything I taught them they still
coach and teach with the same

1268
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:44,340

1269
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,570
coach and teach with the same
methodology that I told them so um I

1270
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:47,580
methodology that I told them so um I
 

1271
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,130
methodology that I told them so um I
don't think they have any need to do so

1272
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,140
don't think they have any need to do so
 

1273
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,409
don't think they have any need to do so
uh if they did it would be because they

1274
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:51,419
uh if they did it would be because they
 

1275
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,029
uh if they did it would be because they
wanted to

1276
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
wanted to
 

1277
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,310
wanted to
um I still think many of the same

1278
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:55,320
um I still think many of the same
 

1279
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,830
um I still think many of the same
personality conflicts that originated

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:01,860
ability to build weight sorry to lift
 

1603
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,669
ability to build weight sorry to lift
weight over time so to a Jujitsu player

1604
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:04,679
weight over time so to a Jujitsu player
 

1605
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,490
weight over time so to a Jujitsu player
does it by gradually increasing

1606
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,500
does it by gradually increasing
 

1607
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,889
does it by gradually increasing
resistance now in Jiu Jitsu resistance

1608
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:09,899
resistance now in Jiu Jitsu resistance
 

1609
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,630
resistance now in Jiu Jitsu resistance
is not done by weight it's done by skill

1610
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:11,640
is not done by weight it's done by skill
 

1611
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,990
is not done by weight it's done by skill
level and so over time they started to

1612
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,000
level and so over time they started to
 

1613
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,750
level and so over time they started to
accumulate this experience

1614
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
accumulate this experience
 

1615
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,970
accumulate this experience
in time

1616
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:19,980
in time
 

1617
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,970
in time
um they uh we were able to switch off

1618
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:22,980
um they uh we were able to switch off
 

1619
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,769
um they uh we were able to switch off
and have them go against

1620
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:24,779
and have them go against
 

1621
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,889
and have them go against
very very tough athletes each other so

1622
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:27,899
very very tough athletes each other so
 

1623
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,590
very very tough athletes each other so
you know uh Luke Griffiths will do a

1624
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:30,600
you know uh Luke Griffiths will do a
 

1625
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,289
you know uh Luke Griffiths will do a
full power match with Gordon Ryan now

1626
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:33,299
full power match with Gordon Ryan now
 

1627
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,269
full power match with Gordon Ryan now
they're fully aware that there's no one

1628
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:35,279
they're fully aware that there's no one
 

1629
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,909
they're fully aware that there's no one
better in the world than Gordon Ryan so

1630
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
better in the world than Gordon Ryan so
 

1631
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,529
better in the world than Gordon Ryan so
if you have a competitive match with

1632
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:39,539
if you have a competitive match with
 

1633
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,830
if you have a competitive match with
Gordon Ryan that's a very very healthy

1634
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:42,840
Gordon Ryan that's a very very healthy
 

1635
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,769
Gordon Ryan that's a very very healthy
sign so they went from the start where

1636
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:45,779
sign so they went from the start where
 

1637
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,450
sign so they went from the start where
they were being programmed going against

1638
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:47,460
they were being programmed going against
 

1639
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,730
they were being programmed going against
relatively mild resistance and building

1640
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:49,740
relatively mild resistance and building
 

1641
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,310
relatively mild resistance and building
up over time and then building up to the

1642
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
up over time and then building up to the
 

1643
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,930
up over time and then building up to the
greatest resistance possible in the

1644
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:53,940
greatest resistance possible in the
 

1645
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,310
greatest resistance possible in the
sport of jiu jitsu

sport of jiu jitsu
and their goal is not to win obviously

1648
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:57,779
and their goal is not to win obviously
 

1649
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,630
and their goal is not to win obviously
but their goal is to provide a

but their goal is to provide a
 

1651
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,130
but their goal is to provide a
competitive match

1652

competitive match
 

1653
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,049
competitive match
now Gordon doesn't have any confidence

1654
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:03,059
now Gordon doesn't have any confidence
 

1655
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,750
now Gordon doesn't have any confidence
issues so for him it's just good hard

1656
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
issues so for him it's just good hard
 

1657
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,490
issues so for him it's just good hard
competitive training against people that

1658
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:07,500
competitive training against people that
 

1659
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,830
competitive training against people that
are

1660
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:08,840
are
 

1661
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,330
are
in some ways better than those you'll be

1662
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:11,340
in some ways better than those you'll be
 

1663
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,549
in some ways better than those you'll be
facing in competition for the other guys

1664
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:13,559
facing in competition for the other guys
 

1665
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,389
facing in competition for the other guys
it's

1666
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
it's
 

1667
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,549
it's
getting a clear assessment of what their

1668
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
getting a clear assessment of what their
 

1669
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,049
getting a clear assessment of what their
current skill level is

1670
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:18,059
current skill level is
 

1671
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,570
current skill level is
by going against the best there is

1672
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:20,580
by going against the best there is
 

1673
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,610
by going against the best there is
then we add to this a competitive

1674
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:22,620
then we add to this a competitive
 

1675
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,350
then we add to this a competitive
schedule where the athletes have to go

1676
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:24,360
schedule where the athletes have to go
 

1677
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,090
schedule where the athletes have to go
out into competition so they get used to

1678
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,100
out into competition so they get used to
 

1679
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,470
out into competition so they get used to
the idea of performing in front of

1680
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:27,480
the idea of performing in front of
 

1681
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,490
the idea of performing in front of
strangers

1682
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:28,500
strangers
 

1683
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,690
strangers
on stage getting used to the the strange

1684
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:32,700
on stage getting used to the the strange
 

1685
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,330
on stage getting used to the the strange
elements of going out being observed and

1686
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:35,340
elements of going out being observed and
 

1687
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,909
elements of going out being observed and
judged by people you don't know in a

1688
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:37,919
judged by people you don't know in a
 

1689
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,250
judged by people you don't know in a
performance atmosphere and so they were

1690
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,260
performance atmosphere and so they were
 

1691
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,250
performance atmosphere and so they were
all given matches and wno competition

1692
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,260
all given matches and wno competition
 

1693
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,490
all given matches and wno competition
leading up to the event uh ADCC trials

1694
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:46,500
leading up to the event uh ADCC trials
 

1695
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,130
leading up to the event uh ADCC trials
local grappling events here in Austin

1696
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:49,140
local grappling events here in Austin
 

1697
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,289
local grappling events here in Austin
and given a competitive schedule to

1698
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:51,299
and given a competitive schedule to
 

1699
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,169
and given a competitive schedule to
fight and prepare them for ADCC

1700
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:53,179
fight and prepare them for ADCC
 

1701
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:55,909
fight and prepare them for ADCC
obviously as ADCC got closer and closer

1702
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
obviously as ADCC got closer and closer
 

1703
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,289
obviously as ADCC got closer and closer
this was pulled back because of the

1704
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:57,299
this was pulled back because of the
 

1705
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,409
this was pulled back because of the
danger of injury So within about three

1706
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:00,419
danger of injury So within about three
 

1707
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:01,850
danger of injury So within about three
weeks out was the last time we had a

1708
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:01,860
weeks out was the last time we had a
 

1709
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,230
weeks out was the last time we had a
competition

1710
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,240
competition
 

1711
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,169
competition
and by this method confidence starts to

1712
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:06,179
and by this method confidence starts to
 

1713
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:09,290
and by this method confidence starts to
grow and uh and so the mental

1714
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,300
grow and uh and so the mental
 

1715
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,329
grow and uh and so the mental
preparation came out of those physical

1716
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:11,339
preparation came out of those physical
 

1717
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,609
preparation came out of those physical
underpaints the idea of progressive

1718
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:13,619
underpaints the idea of progressive
 

1719
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,490
underpaints the idea of progressive
resistance increasing over time uh for

1720
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:16,500
resistance increasing over time uh for
 

1721
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,889
resistance increasing over time uh for
both offense and defense building up to

1722
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:18,899
both offense and defense building up to
 

1723
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,570
both offense and defense building up to
a peak where they go in against the best

1724
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:20,580
a peak where they go in against the best
 

1725
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,550
a peak where they go in against the best
athlete in the world so they can get an

1726
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,560
athlete in the world so they can get an
 

1727
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,109
athlete in the world so they can get an
accurate assessment of where they stand

1728
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:24,119
accurate assessment of where they stand
 

1729
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,389
accurate assessment of where they stand
once you're given a competitive match to

1730
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
once you're given a competitive match to
 

1731
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,310
once you're given a competitive match to
the best guy in the world you know damn

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
the best guy in the world you know damn
 

1733
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,470
the best guy in the world you know damn
well that when you go out in 80cc you're

1734
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
well that when you go out in 80cc you're
 

1735
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,149
well that when you go out in 80cc you're
ready to fight anybody

1736
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
ready to fight anybody

in symmetrical positions like positions
 

1743
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,470
in symmetrical positions like positions
like guard and then defense also

1744
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
like guard and then defense also
 

1745
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,970
like guard and then defense also
includes escaping from horrible

1746
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:43,980
includes escaping from horrible
 

1747
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,530
includes escaping from horrible
positions yes

1748
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:45,540
positions yes
 

1749
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,970
positions yes
um we're big Believers in the idea of

1750
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:46,980
um we're big Believers in the idea of
 

1751
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,849
um we're big Believers in the idea of
depth of Defense the idea that uh you

1752
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:49,859
depth of Defense the idea that uh you
 

1753
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,349
depth of Defense the idea that uh you
should be able to mount defense all the

1754
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359
should be able to mount defense all the
 

1755
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,089
should be able to mount defense all the
way through from early stages based

1756
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:53,099
way through from early stages based
 

1757
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,250
way through from early stages based
mostly around anticipation of

1758
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:55,260
mostly around anticipation of
 

1759
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,470
mostly around anticipation of
identifying danger visually before it

1760
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:57,480
identifying danger visually before it
 

1761
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,690
identifying danger visually before it

00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,470
fire the music is an illusion
and it's put there intentionally to make

1922
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
and it's put there intentionally to make
 

1923
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,230
and it's put there intentionally to make
you feel a certain kind of way and your

1924
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,240
you feel a certain kind of way and your
 

1925
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,510
you feel a certain kind of way and your
whole goal is to see this as an illusion

1926
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
whole goal is to see this as an illusion
 

1927
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,790
whole goal is to see this as an illusion
and walk out and see only the reality

1928
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:13,800
and walk out and see only the reality
 

1929
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,890
and walk out and see only the reality
which is that this is the same damn

1930
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:15,900
which is that this is the same damn
 

1931
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,250
which is that this is the same damn
thing you do every day in the gym

1932
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,260
thing you do every day in the gym
 

1933
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,930
thing you do every day in the gym
the only difference is you're going with

1934
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:20,940
the only difference is you're going with
 

1935
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,670
the only difference is you're going with
a guy you've never grappled before

1936
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:22,680
a guy you've never grappled before
 

1937
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,130
a guy you've never grappled before
so the actual act of removing the

1938
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:25,140
so the actual act of removing the
 

1939
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,109
so the actual act of removing the
illusion or realizing that it is an

1940
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:27,119
illusion or realizing that it is an
 

1941
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,069
illusion or realizing that it is an
illusion

1942
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
illusion
 

1943
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,990
illusion
how do you practice that so when you

1944
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
how do you practice that so when you
 

1945
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,550
how do you practice that so when you
step on the mat once you're aware of it

1946
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:31,560
step on the mat once you're aware of it
 

1947
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,329
step on the mat once you're aware of it
I I always have them to you it it it's

1948
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:35,339
I I always have them to you it it it's
 

1949
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,490
I I always have them to you it it it's
like when you when you see a magician

1950
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:37,500
like when you when you see a magician
 

1951
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,210
like when you when you see a magician
and you have his tricks explained to you

1952
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:41,220
and you have his tricks explained to you
 

1953
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,630
and you have his tricks explained to you
you never see the magic again the first

1954
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
you never see the magic again the first
 

1955
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,609
you never see the magic again the first
time you see a good card trick from a

1956
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:46,619
time you see a good card trick from a
 

1957
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,950
time you see a good card trick from a
good magician's oh my God then when they

1958
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
good magician's oh my God then when they
 

1959
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,930
good magician's oh my God then when they
explain it to you I did this this and

1960
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:50,940
explain it to you I did this this and
 

1961
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,670
explain it to you I did this this and
that step one step two

1962
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:52,680
that step one step two
 

1963
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,710
that step one step two
then you look at it like it's not that

1964
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
then you look at it like it's not that
 

1965
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,690
then you look at it like it's not that
special

1966
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:56,700
special
 

1967
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,349
special
and when you explain to people this idea

1968
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:00,359
and when you explain to people this idea
 

1969
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:03,710
and when you explain to people this idea
is the pageantry is an illusion

1970
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:03,720
is the pageantry is an illusion
 

1971
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,990
is the pageantry is an illusion
then just as when you watch the magician

1972
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,000
then just as when you watch the magician
 

1973
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,790
then just as when you watch the magician
and you learn the trick

1974
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:07,800
and you learn the trick
 

1975
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,430
and you learn the trick
all the magic flies out the window so

1976
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:10,440
all the magic flies out the window so
 

1977
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,530
all the magic flies out the window so
too with the the nervous response so

1978
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:12,540
too with the the nervous response so
 

1979
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,750
too with the the nervous response so
that's for the pageantry but what about

1980
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:14,760
that's for the pageantry but what about
 

1981
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,270
that's for the pageantry but what about
the maybe the physical intensity of

1982
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
the maybe the physical intensity of
 

1983
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,030
the maybe the physical intensity of
competition isn't there

1984
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,040
competition isn't there
 

1985
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,210
competition isn't there
an extra no it's the same in every

1986
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,220
an extra no it's the same in every
 

1987
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,670
an extra no it's the same in every
competition this it's not like you know

1988
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:25,680
competition this it's not like you know
 

1989
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,530
competition this it's not like you know
they're twice as strong and 80cc is

1990
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:27,540
they're twice as strong and 80cc is
 

1991
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,170
they're twice as strong and 80cc is
there and the ibjf World Championships

1992
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:30,180
there and the ibjf World Championships
 

1993
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,089
there and the ibjf World Championships
it's the physical intensity is always

1994
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:32,099
it's the physical intensity is always
 

1995
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:33,950
it's the physical intensity is always
pretty much the same they experience it

1996
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:33,960
pretty much the same they experience it
 

1997
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,710
pretty much the same they experience it
every day in the gym and

1998
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,720
every day in the gym and
 

1999
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,950
every day in the gym and
um uh like you know if you go out and

2000
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:39,960
um uh like you know if you go out and
 

2001
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,210
um uh like you know if you go out and
you grapple Gordon Ryan it's not like

2002
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:41,220
you grapple Gordon Ryan it's not like
 

2003
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,530
you grapple Gordon Ryan it's not like
the next guy who grapple is going to be

2004
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:42,540
the next guy who grapple is going to be
 

2005
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,270
the next guy who grapple is going to be
twice as strong as hell or twice as fast

2006
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:44,280
twice as strong as hell or twice as fast
 

2007
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,849
twice as strong as hell or twice as fast
this could be a little stronger a little

2008
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:46,859
this could be a little stronger a little
 

2009
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,190
this could be a little stronger a little
faster but not so much so that it

2010
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,200
faster but not so much so that it
 

2011
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,690
faster but not so much so that it
completely changes your approach of the

2012
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:50,700
completely changes your approach of the
 

2013
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,010
completely changes your approach of the
game

2014
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,020
game
 

2015
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,690
game
um you know there's not that much

2016
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:53,700
um you know there's not that much
 

2017
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,430
um you know there's not that much
difference between the human bodies out

2018
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
difference between the human bodies out
 

2019
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,589
difference between the human bodies out
there on stage so if you've felt

2020
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
there on stage so if you've felt
 

2021
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,970
there on stage so if you've felt
intensity before you're not going to be

2022
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:58,980
intensity before you're not going to be
 

2023
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,250
intensity before you're not going to be
shocked by ADCC but in terms of in

2024
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,260
shocked by ADCC but in terms of in
 

2025
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,390
shocked by ADCC but in terms of in
training

2026
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
training
 

2027
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,190
training
do you have to try to match the

2028
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,200
do you have to try to match the
 

2029
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,050
do you have to try to match the
intensity of competition no

2030
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:06,060
intensity of competition no
 

2031
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,609
intensity of competition no
um that would be fool should be every

2032
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:07,619
um that would be fool should be every
 

2033
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,349
um that would be fool should be every
athlete in the gym would be injured uh

2034
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,359
athlete in the gym would be injured uh
 

2035
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,170
athlete in the gym would be injured uh
you can do it for short periods of time

2036
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,180
you can do it for short periods of time
 

2037
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,569
you can do it for short periods of time
um but the uh the training has to be

2038
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:14,579
um but the uh the training has to be
 

2039
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,829
um but the uh the training has to be
carefully monitored in terms of

2040
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
carefully monitored in terms of
 

2041
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,630
carefully monitored in terms of
intensity levels remember we're training

2042
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:17,640
intensity levels remember we're training
 

2043
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,150
intensity levels remember we're training
seven days a week a minimum of twice a

2044
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,160
seven days a week a minimum of twice a
 

2045
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,589
seven days a week a minimum of twice a
day

2046
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599
day
 

2047
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,870
day
um you you've got to keep things under

2048
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:23,880
um you you've got to keep things under
 

2049
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,089
um you you've got to keep things under
wraps like you know every other workout

2050
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:26,099
wraps like you know every other workout
 

2051
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,089
wraps like you know every other workout
you can have a like one of the five

2052
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:29,099
you can have a like one of the five
 

2053
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:32,329
you can have a like one of the five
rounds can be full power but not seven

2054
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:32,339
rounds can be full power but not seven
 

2055
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,069
rounds can be full power but not seven
days a week three times a day that's

2056
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
days a week three times a day that's
 

2057
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,170
days a week three times a day that's
that's just gonna break bodies and the

2058
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:36,180
that's just gonna break bodies and the
 

2059
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,450
that's just gonna break bodies and the
full power is just a reminder

2060
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:38,460
full power is just a reminder
 

2061
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,970
full power is just a reminder
of it's more about skill development for

2062
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:40,980
of it's more about skill development for
 

2063
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,470
of it's more about skill development for
us it always comes back to school

2064
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
us it always comes back to school
 

2065
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,290
us it always comes back to school
development but what about matching the

2066
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:45,300
development but what about matching the
 

2067
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,109
development but what about matching the
the feeling of the intensity of

2068
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:48,119
the feeling of the intensity of
 

2069
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,190
the feeling of the intensity of
competition

2070
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
competition
 

2071
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,010
competition
so yeah periodically periodically it

2072
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:52,020
so yeah periodically periodically it
 

2073
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,810
so yeah periodically periodically it
can't be rare a single time not not

2074
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:53,820
can't be rare a single time not not
 

2075
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,270
can't be rare a single time not not
really it's not rare like yeah meaning

2076
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,280

Felipe Pena in the weight division prior

2478
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:04,920
Felipe Pena in the weight division prior
 

2479
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,890
Felipe Pena in the weight division prior
to getting to the Super fight so there

2480
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:06,900
to getting to the Super fight so there
 

2481
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,109
to getting to the Super fight so there
was genuine concern here that he may

2482
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:09,119
was genuine concern here that he may
 

2483
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,050
was genuine concern here that he may
have completely overstepped himself

2484
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:12,060
have completely overstepped himself
 

2485
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,329
have completely overstepped himself
um the biggest concern I had as a coach

2486
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:14,339
um the biggest concern I had as a coach
 

2487
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:16,670
um the biggest concern I had as a coach
and I'm sure the organizers Mo Jessica

2488
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:16,680
and I'm sure the organizers Mo Jessica
 

2489
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,470
and I'm sure the organizers Mo Jessica
must have had the same concern so he

2490
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
must have had the same concern so he
 

2491
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,349
must have had the same concern so he
would get injured or exhausted fighting

2492
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:21,359
would get injured or exhausted fighting
 

2493
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,870
would get injured or exhausted fighting
in his weight division

2494

in his weight division
 

2495
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,750
in his weight division
there were two athletes in particular uh

2496
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:26,760
there were two athletes in particular uh
 

2497
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,970
there were two athletes in particular uh
Felipe Pena who had given Gordon a very

2498
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:28,980
Felipe Pena who had given Gordon a very
 

2499
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,670
Felipe Pena who had given Gordon a very
tough 40-minute match and a no rules

2500
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:31,680
tough 40-minute match and a no rules
 

2501
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,410
tough 40-minute match and a no rules
setting

2502
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:33,420
setting
 

2503
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,829
setting
um uh shortly before ADCC and his former

2504
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:36,839
um uh shortly before ADCC and his former
 

2505
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,309
um uh shortly before ADCC and his former
training partner uh Nick Rodriguez

2506
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:40,319
training partner uh Nick Rodriguez
 

2507
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,829
training partner uh Nick Rodriguez
um who were expected to give Gordon very

2508
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:42,839
um who were expected to give Gordon very
 

2509
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:44,390
um who were expected to give Gordon very
very tough matches if they came up

2510
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
very tough matches if they came up
 

2511
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,829
very tough matches if they came up
against each other

2512
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:45,839
against each other
 

2513
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,329
against each other
so

2514
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:47,339
so
 

2515
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,550
so
there was a genuine concern that Gordon

2516
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:49,560
there was a genuine concern that Gordon
 

2517
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,650
there was a genuine concern that Gordon
may burn himself out before he even got

2518
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:51,660
may burn himself out before he even got
 

2519
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,329
may burn himself out before he even got
to fight the guy who most people believe

2520
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:53,339
to fight the guy who most people believe
 

2521
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,130
to fight the guy who most people believe
was the greatest ADCC champion of all

2522
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:55,140
was the greatest ADCC champion of all
 

2523
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,270
was the greatest ADCC champion of all
time

2524
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:56,280
time
 

2525
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,390
time
so our concern was how do we manage this

2526
00:49:59,390 --> 00:49:59,400
so our concern was how do we manage this
 

2527
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,109
so our concern was how do we manage this
so what we looked for is extremely

2528
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
so what we looked for is extremely
 

2529
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,470
so what we looked for is extremely
efficient methods of reducing the time

2530
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,480
efficient methods of reducing the time
 

2531
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,329
efficient methods of reducing the time
of the measures making the matches as

2532
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:08,339
of the measures making the matches as
 

2533
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,490
of the measures making the matches as
short as possible

2534
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:10,500
short as possible
 

2535
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,550
short as possible
um our favorite way to fight bigger

2536
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:13,560
um our favorite way to fight bigger
 

2537
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,309
um our favorite way to fight bigger
stronger athletes and I think Gordon was

2538
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:16,319
stronger athletes and I think Gordon was
 

2539
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,490
stronger athletes and I think Gordon was
the lightest athlete in his weight

2540
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:19,500
the lightest athlete in his weight
 

2541
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,530
the lightest athlete in his weight
division everyone goes all going so big

2542
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:21,540
division everyone goes all going so big
 

2543
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,290
division everyone goes all going so big
and strong which is actually quite light

2544
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:24,300
and strong which is actually quite light
 

2545
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,390
and strong which is actually quite light
um uh I think it was outweighed by

2546
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
um uh I think it was outweighed by
 

2547
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,430
um uh I think it was outweighed by
almost all of his opponents

2548
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:28,440
almost all of his opponents
 

2549
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,250
almost all of his opponents
it's nice to see Gordon looking small

2550
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:31,260
it's nice to see Gordon looking small
 

2551
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,870
it's nice to see Gordon looking small
relative to his opponents which is

2552
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:32,880
relative to his opponents which is
 

2553
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,370
relative to his opponents which is
absurd to say but it is the open

2554
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:34,380
absurd to say but it is the open
 

2555
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,490
absurd to say but it is the open
division plus 99 kilos it was plus 99

2556
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:37,500
division plus 99 kilos it was plus 99
 

2557
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,170
division plus 99 kilos it was plus 99
kilos right that's what I mean sorry by

2558
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:39,180
kilos right that's what I mean sorry by
 

2559
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,809
kilos right that's what I mean sorry by
open plus 99 kilos everyone looks like

2560
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:41,819
open plus 99 kilos everyone looks like
 

2561
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:45,170
open plus 99 kilos everyone looks like
the Incredible Hulk yeah yeah so

2562
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:45,180
the Incredible Hulk yeah yeah so
 

2563
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,910
the Incredible Hulk yeah yeah so
um our big thing is when we fight bigger

2564
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:46,920
um our big thing is when we fight bigger
 

2565
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,589
um our big thing is when we fight bigger
stronger opponents we always go in two

2566
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:48,599
stronger opponents we always go in two
 

2567
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,510
stronger opponents we always go in two
directions you either go for the legs or

2568
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:50,520
directions you either go for the legs or
 

2569
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,210
directions you either go for the legs or
you go for the back and so

2570
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:53,220
you go for the back and so
 

2571
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,670
you go for the back and so
um we constructed strategies based

2572
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:55,680
um we constructed strategies based
 

2573
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,290
um we constructed strategies based
around those two methods so going for

2574
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:57,300
around those two methods so going for
 

2575
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,750
around those two methods so going for
submissions and we should also mention

2576
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:58,760
submissions and we should also mention
 

2577
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,450
submissions and we should also mention
that agcc rule said is for regular

2578
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:02,460
that agcc rule said is for regular
 

2579
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,089
that agcc rule said is for regular
matches I think it's five minutes and

2580
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:05,099
matches I think it's five minutes and
 

2581
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,710
matches I think it's five minutes and
five minutes total is 10 minutes and

2582
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
five minutes total is 10 minutes and
 

2583
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,450
five minutes total is 10 minutes and
then for finals matches it's 20 minutes

2584
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:08,460
then for finals matches it's 20 minutes
 

2585
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,270
then for finals matches it's 20 minutes
and half the time is spent with no

2586
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:11,280
and half the time is spent with no
 

2587
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,410
and half the time is spent with no
points

2588
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:12,420
points
 

2589
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,390
points
so these can be very very long matches

2590
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
so these can be very very long matches
 

2591
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,130
so these can be very very long matches
let me put this in a perspective a

2592
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:16,140
let me put this in a perspective a
 

2593
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,950
let me put this in a perspective a
modern Judo matches five minutes and

2594
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:18,960
modern Judo matches five minutes and
 

2595
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,329
modern Judo matches five minutes and
modern wrestling match I believe is six

2596
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:20,339
modern wrestling match I believe is six
 

2597
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:22,790
modern wrestling match I believe is six
minutes in international freestyle

2598
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
minutes in international freestyle
 

2599
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,710
minutes in international freestyle
um so these matches can be 40 minutes

2600
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:24,720
um so these matches can be 40 minutes
 

2601
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,890
um so these matches can be 40 minutes
long now that's a long long grappling

2602
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:27,900
long now that's a long long grappling
 

2603
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,530
long now that's a long long grappling
match yeah and um depending on how you

2604
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:30,540
match yeah and um depending on how you
 

2605
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,630
match yeah and um depending on how you
compete in it that can have a huge tour

2606
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:32,640
compete in it that can have a huge tour
 

2607
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,030
compete in it that can have a huge tour
absolutely you can get to the finals and

2608
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,040
absolutely you can get to the finals and
 

2609
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,790
absolutely you can get to the finals and
just be absolutely spent so our whole

2610
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:37,800
just be absolutely spent so our whole
 

2611
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,230
just be absolutely spent so our whole
thing is okay Gordon's got to not only

2612
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:39,240
thing is okay Gordon's got to not only
 

2613
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,490
thing is okay Gordon's got to not only
get to the finals then he's got to fight

2614
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:40,500

the toughest 80cc rapper of all time

2616
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:42,420
the toughest 80cc rapper of all time
 

2617
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,589
the toughest 80cc rapper of all time
after that so um we were looking for

2618
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:45,599
after that so um we were looking for
 

2619
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,650
after that so um we were looking for
quick and energy efficient matches and

2620
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:48,660
quick and energy efficient matches and
 

2621
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,390
quick and energy efficient matches and
that meant going to the back or going to

2622
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,400
that meant going to the back or going to
 

2623
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,829
that meant going to the back or going to
the legs

2624
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:51,839
the legs
 

2625
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,809
the legs
um and in the overwhelming majority of

2626
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:53,819
um and in the overwhelming majority of
 

2627
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,370
um and in the overwhelming majority of
cases that's exactly what he did he was

2628
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:55,380
cases that's exactly what he did he was
 

2629
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,770
cases that's exactly what he did he was
able to get some very very quick matches

2630
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:57,780
able to get some very very quick matches
 

2631
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,829
able to get some very very quick matches
uh courtesy of leglock finishes and in

2632
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:00,839
uh courtesy of leglock finishes and in
 

2633
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:03,829
uh courtesy of leglock finishes and in
the few cases where he didn't finish on

2634
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:03,839
the few cases where he didn't finish on
 

2635
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,089
the few cases where he didn't finish on
legs then he would simply take his

2636
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:05,099
legs then he would simply take his
 

2637
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,150
legs then he would simply take his
opponents back and uh that's a very low

2638
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,160
opponents back and uh that's a very low
 

2639
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,349
opponents back and uh that's a very low
stress position to to occupy in one case

2640
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:12,359
stress position to to occupy in one case
 

2641
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,450
stress position to to occupy in one case
uh his opponent deliberately kept his

2642
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:14,460
uh his opponent deliberately kept his
 

2643
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,829
uh his opponent deliberately kept his
back on the ground to prevent the back

2644
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
back on the ground to prevent the back
 

2645
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,349
back on the ground to prevent the back
tag and he just chose mounted position

2646
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:18,359
tag and he just chose mounted position
 

2647
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:20,630
tag and he just chose mounted position
instead and so he was able to go through

2648
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
instead and so he was able to go through
 

2649
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,730
instead and so he was able to go through
his weight division with extremely low

2650
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:22,740
his weight division with extremely low
 

2651
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,130
his weight division with extremely low
energy expenditure which set him up well

2652
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:25,140
energy expenditure which set him up well
 

2653
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,490
energy expenditure which set him up well
to go into the uh the finals no injuries

2654
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:28,500
to go into the uh the finals no injuries
 

2655
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,890
to go into the uh the finals no injuries
very little energy expenditure now it

2656
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:30,900
very little energy expenditure now it
 

2657
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,049
very little energy expenditure now it
sounds easy to say that you know oh okay

2658
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:33,059
sounds easy to say that you know oh okay
 

2659
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:34,730
sounds easy to say that you know oh okay
the strategy worked

2660
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:34,740
the strategy worked
 

2661
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,470
the strategy worked
but in order to get that strategy to

2662
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:36,480
but in order to get that strategy to
 

2663
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,290
but in order to get that strategy to
work you have to have one hell of a set

2664
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:39,300
work you have to have one hell of a set
 

2665
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,510
work you have to have one hell of a set
of skills and

2666
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:41,520
of skills and
 

2667
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,930
of skills and
um uh and we can see those now would you

2668
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:44,940
um uh and we can see those now would you
 

2669
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,609
um uh and we can see those now would you
like to yeah I would love to go through

2670
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:46,619
like to yeah I would love to go through
 

2671
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:49,670
like to yeah I would love to go through
them and I should also mention for

2672
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
them and I should also mention for
 

2673
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,349
them and I should also mention for
people just listening to this we'll I'll

2674
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
people just listening to this we'll I'll
 

2675
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,730
people just listening to this we'll I'll
try to commentate on different things

2676
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:52,740
try to commentate on different things
 

2677
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,109
try to commentate on different things
we'll look at but

2678
00:52:54,109 --> 00:52:54,119
we'll look at but
 

2679
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,589
we'll look at but
the thing that was made clear is uh

2680
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
the thing that was made clear is uh
 

2681
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,150
the thing that was made clear is uh
maybe you can

2682
00:52:59,150 --> 00:52:59,160
maybe you can
 

2683
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,829
maybe you can
speak to that

2684
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:00,839
speak to that
 

2685
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:03,730
speak to that
maybe to you it looks like efficiency

2686
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:03,740
maybe to you it looks like efficiency
 

2687
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,470
maybe to you it looks like efficiency
but to me it looked like

2688
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
but to me it looked like
 

2689
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,150
but to me it looked like
a Gordon was not even trying there's a

2690
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:11,160
a Gordon was not even trying there's a
 

2691
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,370
a Gordon was not even trying there's a
um a relaxed aspect to the whole thing

2692
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:13,380
um a relaxed aspect to the whole thing
 

2693
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,990
um a relaxed aspect to the whole thing
so maybe it had to do with saving energy

2694
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,000
so maybe it had to do with saving energy
 

2695
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,930
so maybe it had to do with saving energy
but he made it look very easy yeah and

2696
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:17,940
but he made it look very easy yeah and
 

2697
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,089
but he made it look very easy yeah and
he made the the pathos submission look

2698
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:20,099
he made the the pathos submission look
 

2699
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,089
he made the the pathos submission look
very easy so here the first match

2700
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:23,099
very easy so here the first match
 

2701
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,309
very easy so here the first match
against an opponent that again looks

2702
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:25,319
against an opponent that again looks
 

2703
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:26,690
against an opponent that again looks
bigger than him

2704
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:26,700
bigger than him
 

2705
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,030
bigger than him
okay I'll just give an initial comment

2706
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
okay I'll just give an initial comment
 

2707
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,930
okay I'll just give an initial comment
here

2708
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:29,940
here
 

2709
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,849
here
um first you'll see that Gordon elected

2710
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:31,859
um first you'll see that Gordon elected
 

2711
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:34,370
um first you'll see that Gordon elected
to sit to the bottom position

2712
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:34,380
to sit to the bottom position
 

2713
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,710
to sit to the bottom position
um the hardest work in submission

2714
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:36,720
um the hardest work in submission
 

2715
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,230
um the hardest work in submission
grappling is when two athletes take the

2716
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:39,240
grappling is when two athletes take the
 

2717
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,390
grappling is when two athletes take the
standing position and just for takedowns

2718
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:41,400
standing position and just for takedowns
 

2719
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,670
standing position and just for takedowns
uh that's where most of the energy gets

2720
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:43,680
uh that's where most of the energy gets
 

2721
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,829
uh that's where most of the energy gets
burned up so working on the idea of

2722
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:45,839
burned up so working on the idea of
 

2723
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,349
burned up so working on the idea of
Energy Efficiency let's go out and we we

2724
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:48,359
Energy Efficiency let's go out and we we
 

2725
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,569
Energy Efficiency let's go out and we we
chose to sit into guard position and

2726
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:50,579
chose to sit into guard position and
 

2727
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:51,829
chose to sit into guard position and
then start looking to access our

2728
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
then start looking to access our
 

2729
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,870
then start looking to access our
opponents back because if our opponent's

2730
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:53,880
opponents back because if our opponent's
 

2731
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,910
opponents back because if our opponent's
hit position a far side arm drag makes a

2732
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
hit position a far side arm drag makes a
 

2733
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,290
hit position a far side arm drag makes a
lot of sense Gordon's able to beat the

2734
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:57,300
lot of sense Gordon's able to beat the
 

2735
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,849
lot of sense Gordon's able to beat the
arm and quickly get behind his opponent

2736
00:53:58,849 --> 00:53:58,859
arm and quickly get behind his opponent
 

2737
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:00,650
arm and quickly get behind his opponent
now the question is going to be getting

2738
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:00,660
now the question is going to be getting
 

2739
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,630
now the question is going to be getting
into a scoring position it's too early

2740
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
into a scoring position it's too early
 

2741
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,490
into a scoring position it's too early
to score at this point but we're just

2742
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:04,500
to score at this point but we're just
 

2743
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,530
to score at this point but we're just
concerned at this stage of just energy

2744
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:06,540
concerned at this stage of just energy
 

2745
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,970
concerned at this stage of just energy
expenditure and make the other guy work

2746
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:07,980
expenditure and make the other guy work
 

2747
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,010
expenditure and make the other guy work
harder than us so uh going to the arm

2748
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:10,020
harder than us so uh going to the arm
 

2749
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,109
harder than us so uh going to the arm
drag to the back and I was working on

2750
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:12,119
drag to the back and I was working on
 

2751
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,849
drag to the back and I was working on
the hooks

2752
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:13,859
the hooks
 

2753
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,230
the hooks
um the hooks are not particularly

2754
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:15,240
um the hooks are not particularly
 

2755
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,910
um the hooks are not particularly
important here he'll use it just to get

2756
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:16,920
important here he'll use it just to get
 

2757
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,890
important here he'll use it just to get
stability on his opponent but um

2758
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:18,900
stability on his opponent but um
 

2759
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,990
stability on his opponent but um
interestingly his opponent here had an

2760
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,000
interestingly his opponent here had an
 

2761
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,910
interestingly his opponent here had an
interesting strategy too which was to

2762
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:22,920
interesting strategy too which was to
 

2763
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,069
interesting strategy too which was to
occupy bottom Turtle position and uh and

2764
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,079
occupy bottom Turtle position and uh and
 

2765
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,410
occupy bottom Turtle position and uh and
look to get to the critical five-point

2766
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:30,420
look to get to the critical five-point
 

2767
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,030
look to get to the critical five-point
Demarcus sorry our five minute

2768
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:32,040
Demarcus sorry our five minute
 

2769
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,430
Demarcus sorry our five minute
demarcation point where points began

2770
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:34,440
demarcation point where points began
 

2771
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,650
demarcation point where points began
begin to get scored his idea I believe

2772
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:36,660
begin to get scored his idea I believe
 

2773
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,210
begin to get scored his idea I believe
I'm speculating here based on his

2774
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:38,220
I'm speculating here based on his
 

2775
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,450
I'm speculating here based on his
actions was to keep Gordon at Bay in a

2776
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:41,460
actions was to keep Gordon at Bay in a
 

2777
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,309
actions was to keep Gordon at Bay in a
defensive Turtle position until a five

2778
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:43,319
defensive Turtle position until a five
 

2779
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:45,230
defensive Turtle position until a five
minute Mark occurred in which case he

2780
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:45,240
minute Mark occurred in which case he
 

2781
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,170
minute Mark occurred in which case he
would Shake Gordon off walk away and

2782
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:48,180
would Shake Gordon off walk away and
 

2783
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,510
would Shake Gordon off walk away and
force a takedown battle how many people

2784
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:50,520
force a takedown battle how many people
 

2785
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,730
force a takedown battle how many people
are are comfortable in that and what do

2786
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:52,740
are are comfortable in that and what do
 

2787
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,930
are are comfortable in that and what do
you think about the defense attorney

2788
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:53,940
you think about the defense attorney
 

2789
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,910
you think about the defense attorney
position versus always trying to come

2790
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
position versus always trying to come
 

2791
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,250
position versus always trying to come
back to guard the total position is the

2792
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:58,260
back to guard the total position is the
 

2793
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,870
back to guard the total position is the
second bottom position of units so many

2794
00:54:59,870 --> 00:54:59,880
second bottom position of units so many
 

2795
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,329
second bottom position of units so many
people only associate God position with

2796
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:02,339
people only associate God position with
 

2797
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:03,710
people only associate God position with
bottom position and Jiu-Jitsu that's

2798
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:03,720
bottom position and Jiu-Jitsu that's
 

2799
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,530
bottom position and Jiu-Jitsu that's
that's naive there's two there's guard

2800
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:06,540
that's naive there's two there's guard
 

2801
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,230
that's naive there's two there's guard
position and turtle position now as a

2802
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:09,240
position and turtle position now as a
 

2803
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,049
position and turtle position now as a
general rule guard position offers a

2804
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:12,059
general rule guard position offers a
 

2805
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,770
general rule guard position offers a
much much greater variety of attacking

2806
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:15,780
much much greater variety of attacking
 

2807
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,609
much much greater variety of attacking
options then total position does

2808
00:55:18,609 --> 00:55:18,619
options then total position does
 

2809
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:21,890
options then total position does
but that's not to say turtle position

2810
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:21,900
but that's not to say turtle position
 

2811
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,950
but that's not to say turtle position
absolutely Can Be

2812
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:23,960
absolutely Can Be
 

2813
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,329
absolutely Can Be
an Effective bottom position you can

2814
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:26,339
an Effective bottom position you can
 

2815
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:28,250
an Effective bottom position you can
work effectively from there so there's

2816
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:28,260
work effectively from there so there's
 

2817
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,650
work effectively from there so there's
some case to be made that to wait out

2818
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:30,660
some case to be made that to wait out
 

2819
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,750
some case to be made that to wait out
five minutes the turtle might be I mean

2820
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:32,760
five minutes the turtle might be I mean
 

2821
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,329
five minutes the turtle might be I mean
I I personally think it it get against

2822
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:35,339
I I personally think it it get against
 

2823
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:37,609
I I personally think it it get against
Gordon Ryan I mean I admire the fellows

2824
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:37,619
Gordon Ryan I mean I admire the fellows
 

2825
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,530
Gordon Ryan I mean I admire the fellows
courage I I

2826
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:39,540
courage I I
 

2827
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,170
courage I I
um it's not easy but there was a logic

2828
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:42,180
um it's not easy but there was a logic
 

2829
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,210
um it's not easy but there was a logic
to what he was doing uh people think oh

2830
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:44,220
to what he was doing uh people think oh
 

2831
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,030
to what he was doing uh people think oh
he just got his back taken so easily but

2832
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:46,040
he just got his back taken so easily but
 

2833
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,370
he just got his back taken so easily but
he did have a strategy now did he pick

2834
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:49,380
he did have a strategy now did he pick
 

2835
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,809
he did have a strategy now did he pick
the right person to use that strategy

2836
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:50,819
the right person to use that strategy
 

2837
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,790
the right person to use that strategy
against probably not

2838
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:52,800
against probably not
 

2839
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,370
against probably not
um so Gordon is able to uh break the

2840
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:55,380
um so Gordon is able to uh break the
 

2841
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,809
um so Gordon is able to uh break the
turtle down get one hook in

2842
00:55:59,809 --> 00:55:59,819
turtle down get one hook in
 

2843
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:04,010
turtle down get one hook in
at which point I I is this becoming an

2844
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:04,020
at which point I I is this becoming an
 

2845
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,349
at which point I I is this becoming an
uh extremely controlling position with

2846
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:06,359
uh extremely controlling position with
 

2847
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,030
uh extremely controlling position with
Gordon in the back at which point is

2848
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:08,040
Gordon in the back at which point is
 

2849
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,450
Gordon in the back at which point is
there are you happy with where at this

2850
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:11,460
there are you happy with where at this
 

2851
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,370
there are you happy with where at this
point uh it just started to dawn on me

2852
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:13,380
point uh it just started to dawn on me
 

2853
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,049
point uh it just started to dawn on me
at this point this guy actually had a

2854
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:15,059
at this point this guy actually had a
 

2855
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:17,750
at this point this guy actually had a
strategy which was to maintain a a prone

2856
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
strategy which was to maintain a a prone
 

2857
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,849
strategy which was to maintain a a prone
position that he's in now and then Shake

2858
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:19,859
position that he's in now and then Shake
 

2859
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:23,690
position that he's in now and then Shake
golden off after the five minute Mark so

2860
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:23,700
golden off after the five minute Mark so
 

2861
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,690
golden off after the five minute Mark so
um uh once that became obvious then I

01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,329
in their program know what to do
um so I'm I'm usually

3142
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:47,339
um so I'm I'm usually
 

3143
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:50,750
um so I'm I'm usually
pretty confident I'm also very confident

that even in worst case scenarios

3146
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
that even in worst case scenarios
 

3147
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,270
that even in worst case scenarios
they're going to have effective

3148

they're going to have effective
 

3149
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,609
they're going to have effective
Solutions because they train those worst

sometimes they will

3166
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
sometimes they will

Hit Upon A Certain move or strategy and
 

3169
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,970

just say I'm going to go with this when

3170
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:16,980
just say I'm going to go with this when
 

3171

there's much easier Alternatives but

3172
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:19,980
there's much easier Alternatives but
 

3173
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,410
there's much easier Alternatives but
because they're so focused on the

3174

because they're so focused on the
 

3175

alternative they've chosen they get this
 

3177
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,130
alternative they've chosen they get this
tunnel vision and just focus only on

3178
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:25,140
tunnel vision and just focus only on
 

3179
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,710
tunnel vision and just focus only on
that the most constructive thing the

3180
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:27,720
that the most constructive thing the
 

3181
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,510
that the most constructive thing the
corner man can do is alert them to the

3182

corner man can do is alert them to the
 

3183
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,370
corner man can do is alert them to the
presence of time which is very important

3184
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:31,380
presence of time which is very important
 

3185
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,990
presence of time which is very important
in ADCC match because they're all the

3186
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:33,000
in ADCC match because they're all the
 

3187
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,230
in ADCC match because they're all the
scoring is structured by time and to

3188
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
scoring is structured by time and to
 

3189
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,970
scoring is structured by time and to
alleviate problems associated with

3190
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:37,980
alleviate problems associated with
 

3191
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,430
alleviate problems associated with
tunnel vision that okay you're doing

3192
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:40,440
tunnel vision that okay you're doing
 

3193
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,329
tunnel vision that okay you're doing
this

3194
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:41,339
this
 

3195
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:43,010
this
but if you just did this it'll be so

3196
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:43,020
but if you just did this it'll be so
 

3197
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:46,490
but if you just did this it'll be so
much easier so that's the main goal so

3198
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:46,500
much easier so that's the main goal so
 

3199
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,609
much easier so that's the main goal so
here uh this was one of several

3200
01:02:49,609 --> 01:02:49,619
here uh this was one of several
 

3201
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:52,309
here uh this was one of several
anticipated matches against a second one

3202
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:52,319
anticipated matches against a second one
 

3203
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,349
anticipated matches against a second one
against Victor Hugo

3204
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:54,359
against Victor Hugo
 

3205
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,930
against Victor Hugo
which is a very tough opponent

3206
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:56,940
which is a very tough opponent
 

3207
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,410
which is a very tough opponent
and uh again this was a situation where

3208
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:00,420
and uh again this was a situation where
 

3209
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,630
and uh again this was a situation where
golden was considerably outweighed by

3210
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:02,640
golden was considerably outweighed by
 

3211
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,250
golden was considerably outweighed by
his opponent so the main thing here was

3212
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:04,260
his opponent so the main thing here was
 

3213
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,010
his opponent so the main thing here was
efficiency his opponent elected to avoid

3214
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:07,020
efficiency his opponent elected to avoid
 

3215
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,349
efficiency his opponent elected to avoid
the standing position by jumping into

3216
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:09,359
the standing position by jumping into
 

3217
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,569
the standing position by jumping into
God so now guard yeah yeah golden would

today so
 

3233
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:30,650
today so
um it's a tall order to hold Gordon off

3234
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:30,660
um it's a tall order to hold Gordon off
 

3235
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,809
um it's a tall order to hold Gordon off
for a 10-minute match is there something

3236
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:32,819
for a 10-minute match is there something
 

3237
01:03:32,819 --> 01:03:34,370
for a 10-minute match is there something
you can say about this guard passing

3238
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:34,380
you can say about this guard passing
 

3239
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,250
you can say about this guard passing
Gordon is making it look very easy it's

3240
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:36,260
Gordon is making it look very easy it's
 

3241
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,910
Gordon is making it look very easy it's
middle distance guard passing here

3242
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:40,920
middle distance guard passing here
 

3243
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,069
middle distance guard passing here
um and he eventually passes to mount I

3244
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:43,079
um and he eventually passes to mount I
 

3245
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:43,910
um and he eventually passes to mount I
believe

3246
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:43,920
believe
 

3247
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,690
believe
in a very uh again why don't you run

3248
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:47,700
in a very uh again why don't you run
 

3249
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,770
in a very uh again why don't you run
through the sequence where he gets

3250
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:48,780
through the sequence where he gets
 

3251
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,630
through the sequence where he gets
mounted this uh there's a couple I

3252
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
mounted this uh there's a couple I
 

3253
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,309
mounted this uh there's a couple I
believe he gets mounted twice as I'm not

3254
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
believe he gets mounted twice as I'm not
 

3255
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,930
believe he gets mounted twice as I'm not
I just back just a little bit further

3256
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:53,940
I just back just a little bit further
 

3257
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,010
I just back just a little bit further
yeah

3258
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:55,020
yeah
 

3259
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,789
yeah
so he's trying to one one arm under yeah

3260
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799
so he's trying to one one arm under yeah
 

3261
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,190
so he's trying to one one arm under yeah
this is a stacking position now normally

3262
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,200
this is a stacking position now normally
 

3263
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,049
this is a stacking position now normally
we always insist on the idea of getting

3264
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:03,059
we always insist on the idea of getting
 

3265
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:05,089
we always insist on the idea of getting
advantageous angle first controlling the

3266
01:04:05,089 --> 01:04:05,099
advantageous angle first controlling the
 

3267
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:06,950
advantageous angle first controlling the
feet and getting angle

3268
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
feet and getting angle
 

3269
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,170
feet and getting angle
um but there's a height advantage that

3270
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:09,180
um but there's a height advantage that
 

3271
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,789
um but there's a height advantage that
Victor Hugo has here and the length of

3272
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:10,799
Victor Hugo has here and the length of
 

3273
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,349
Victor Hugo has here and the length of
his legs

3274
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:12,359
his legs
 

3275
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:15,650
his legs
um means that he can play very very wide

3276
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:15,660
um means that he can play very very wide
 

3277
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,390
um means that he can play very very wide
with his leg so getting an advantageous

3278
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:17,400
with his leg so getting an advantageous
 

3279
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,250
with his leg so getting an advantageous
angle might be difficult in these

3280
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:19,260
angle might be difficult in these
 

3281
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:20,870
angle might be difficult in these
circumstances it often makes sense to go

3282
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
circumstances it often makes sense to go
 

3283
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,730
circumstances it often makes sense to go
right up the middle

3284
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:22,740
right up the middle
 

3285
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,849
right up the middle
um now Gordon could just go back for

3286
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:25,859
um now Gordon could just go back for
 

3287
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:29,030
um now Gordon could just go back for
legs because the legs Victor Hugo's legs

3288
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:29,040
legs because the legs Victor Hugo's legs
 

3289
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,370
legs because the legs Victor Hugo's legs
are so far apart at this point that you

3290
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:31,380
are so far apart at this point that you
 

3291
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,750
are so far apart at this point that you
could easily isolate a leg and attack

3292
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:32,760
could easily isolate a leg and attack
 

3293
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,750
could easily isolate a leg and attack
there but Gordon wanted to uh to show

3294
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
there but Gordon wanted to uh to show
 

3295
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,270
there but Gordon wanted to uh to show
off his passing prowess very often he'll

3296
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:38,280
off his passing prowess very often he'll
 

3297
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,890
off his passing prowess very often he'll
go into a match and say okay I'm gonna

3298
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:39,900
go into a match and say okay I'm gonna
 

3299
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,170
go into a match and say okay I'm gonna
I'm gonna show this skill and he'll

3300
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:42,180
I'm gonna show this skill and he'll
 

3301
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,630
I'm gonna show this skill and he'll
often use it as a demonstration of um

3302
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,640
often use it as a demonstration of um
 

3303
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,270
often use it as a demonstration of um
techniques he teaches in instructional

3304
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:47,280
techniques he teaches in instructional
 

3305
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,270
techniques he teaches in instructional
videos so he wanted to show that he

3306
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:50,280
videos so he wanted to show that he
 

3307
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,829
videos so he wanted to show that he
could pass them out readily on a world

3308
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:51,839
could pass them out readily on a world
 

3309
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,930
could pass them out readily on a world
champion like this part here

3310
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:53,940
champion like this part here
 

3311
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,630
champion like this part here
this little step okay I just freeze it

3312
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:56,640
this little step okay I just freeze it
 

3313
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,970
this little step okay I just freeze it
right there go back one step okay you

3314
01:04:58,970 --> 01:04:58,980
right there go back one step okay you
 

3315
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,370
right there go back one step okay you
can clearly see that all of his

3316
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:01,380
can clearly see that all of his
 

3317
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,190
can clearly see that all of his
opponents defensive frames are built on

3318
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:04,200
opponents defensive frames are built on
 

3319
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,470
opponents defensive frames are built on
his opponent's left hand side so

3320
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
his opponent's left hand side so
 

3321
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,630
his opponent's left hand side so
everything is defense on the on the left

3322
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:08,640
everything is defense on the on the left
 

3323
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,609
everything is defense on the on the left
but you can see this comes at a price

3324
01:05:10,609 --> 01:05:10,619
but you can see this comes at a price
 

3325
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:12,589
but you can see this comes at a price
and that price is back exposure on the

3326
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:12,599
and that price is back exposure on the
 

3327
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:14,390
and that price is back exposure on the
right hand side you can literally see

3328
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,400
right hand side you can literally see
 

3329
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,609
right hand side you can literally see
his opponents back on that side so

3330
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:16,619
his opponents back on that side so
 

3331
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:19,609
his opponents back on that side so
Gordon's whole uh game is to to place

3332
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:19,619
Gordon's whole uh game is to to place
 

3333
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:21,710
Gordon's whole uh game is to to place
sufficient pressure that you the

3334
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:21,720
sufficient pressure that you the
 

3335
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,750
sufficient pressure that you the
opponent overcompensates on the side of

across to the other side there's the
 

3341
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,089
across to the other side there's the
vulnerability

3342
01:05:29,089 --> 01:05:29,099
vulnerability
 

3343
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:31,069
vulnerability
there's the back exposure his opponent

3344
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:31,079
there's the back exposure his opponent
 

3345
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:32,210
there's the back exposure his opponent
has to put his back on the ground

3346
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:32,220

right there on bottom who does a good
 

3351
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,150
right there on bottom who does a good
job of recovering from the first danger

3352
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
job of recovering from the first danger
 

3353
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,910
job of recovering from the first danger
but unfortunately Gordon has been here a

3354
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:40,920
but unfortunately Gordon has been here a
 

3355
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,490
but unfortunately Gordon has been here a
thousand times and kicks out a little

3356
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:43,500
thousand times and kicks out a little
 

3357
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,950
thousand times and kicks out a little
little step and so you see there's two

3358
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:45,960
little step and so you see there's two
 

3359
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,870
little step and so you see there's two

changes in Direction left right in a
 

3361
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,730
changes in Direction left right in a
very short period of time that people

3362
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:49,740
very short period of time that people
 

3363
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,069
very short period of time that people
find very very hard to keep up with now

3364
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:52,079
find very very hard to keep up with now
 

3365
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,710
find very very hard to keep up with now
his opponent builds up to an album he's

his opponent builds up to an album he's
 

3367
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,630
his opponent builds up to an album he's
looking to to create more and more space

3368
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,640
looking to to create more and more space
 

3369
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,130

01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
second ahead of every decision going up
 

3385
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,789
second ahead of every decision going up
in the elbow

3386
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:18,799

 

3387
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,289

3401
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,390

notice how golden is never satisfied

3402
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:41,400
notice how golden is never satisfied
 

3403
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,309
notice how golden is never satisfied
with the mounted position itself he's

3404
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:43,319
with the mounted position itself he's
 

3405
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,230
with the mounted position itself he's
only satisfied with an extended mounted

3406
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:45,240
only satisfied with an extended mounted
 

3407
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,730
only satisfied with an extended mounted
position with the elbow comes up over

01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:46,740
position with the elbow comes up over
 

3409
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,049
position with the elbow comes up over

3410
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:48,059
the shoulder line
 

3411
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:50,750
the shoulder line
he only then does he show there's a

3412
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:50,760
he only then does he show there's a
 

3413
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,490

3419
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:57,890
there's a little bit of relief now
that's that's the look of a man who's

3420
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:57,900
that's that's the look of a man who's
 

3421
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,770
that's that's the look of a man who's
just proved a point

3422
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:00,780

 

3423
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,049

oh yeah this is very Michael Jordan like

3424
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:03,059
oh yeah this is very Michael Jordan like
 

3425
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:05,329
oh yeah this is very Michael Jordan like
sticks his tongue out so yeah I mean

3426
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:05,339
sticks his tongue out so yeah I mean
 

3427
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:06,950
sticks his tongue out so yeah I mean
there's no points at the stage he really

3428
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:06,960
there's no points at the stage he really
 

3429
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,870
there's no points at the stage he really
is going for submission

3430
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:11,880

 

3431
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:23,990

and then this this happens again

3432
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000

 

3433
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,569

is this the match that wasn't Gordon was

3434
01:07:26,569 --> 01:07:26,579
is this the match that wasn't Gordon was
 

3435
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:29,029
is this the match that wasn't Gordon was
the only match where Gordon didn't uh

3436
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
the only match where Gordon didn't uh
 

3437
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,870
the only match where Gordon didn't uh
finish his opponent by submission

3438
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:32,880

 

3439
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,690

was just very frustrating for him was

3440
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:35,700
was just very frustrating for him was
 

3441
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,370
was just very frustrating for him was
there uh it's actually interesting that

3442
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:37,380
there uh it's actually interesting that
 

3443
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,109
there uh it's actually interesting that
when he came off the mat

3444
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:39,119
when he came off the mat
 

3445
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,470
when he came off the mat
um uh he was visibly frustrated he

3446
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:42,480
um uh he was visibly frustrated he
 

3447
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,890
um uh he was visibly frustrated he
wanted to uh to get a finish and

3448
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:45,900
wanted to uh to get a finish and
 

3449
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,250
wanted to uh to get a finish and
um I think he was more upset about not

3450
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:49,260
um I think he was more upset about not
 

3451
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,650
um I think he was more upset about not
finishing Victor Hugo then he was

3452
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:51,660
finishing Victor Hugo then he was
 

3453
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,829
finishing Victor Hugo then he was
delighted by winning his two gold medals

3454
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:54,839
delighted by winning his two gold medals
 

3455
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:55,930
delighted by winning his two gold medals
um

3456
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:55,940
um
 

3457
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,910
um
uh so I think that says a lot about the

3458
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:58,920
uh so I think that says a lot about the
 

3459
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,829
uh so I think that says a lot about the
perfectionism of Gordon Ryan most people

3460
01:08:00,829 --> 01:08:00,839
perfectionism of Gordon Ryan most people
 

3461
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,589
perfectionism of Gordon Ryan most people
would be thrilled to beat one of the

3462
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:03,599
would be thrilled to beat one of the
 

3463
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,309
would be thrilled to beat one of the
great Grapplers of this generation

3464
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:06,319
great Grapplers of this generation
 

3465
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:09,710
great Grapplers of this generation
decisively in this fashion but he was uh

3466
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:09,720
decisively in this fashion but he was uh
 

3467
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,510
decisively in this fashion but he was uh
he was not happy

3468
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:11,520
he was not happy
 

3469
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,210
he was not happy
and so this is a Gordon's third match

3470
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:14,220
and so this is a Gordon's third match
 

3471
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:17,689
and so this is a Gordon's third match
against uh Souza Roosevelt Souza now

3472
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:17,699
against uh Souza Roosevelt Souza now

could just freeze it right there maybe
 

3491
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:36,050
could just freeze it right there maybe
go back one step

3492
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:36,060
go back one step
 

3493
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,990
go back one step
um now we're on Sunday morning and the

3494
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:39,000
um now we're on Sunday morning and the
 

3495
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,910
um now we're on Sunday morning and the
idea is that Gordon will be fighting the

3496
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:40,920
idea is that Gordon will be fighting the
 

3497
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,010
idea is that Gordon will be fighting the
biggest fight of his life late that

3498
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:43,020
biggest fight of his life late that
 

3499
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,169
biggest fight of his life late that
afternoon so now we're into the idea of

3500
01:08:45,169 --> 01:08:45,179
afternoon so now we're into the idea of
 

3501
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:48,650
afternoon so now we're into the idea of
energy conservation okay it's okay to

3502
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:48,660
energy conservation okay it's okay to
 

3503
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,269
energy conservation okay it's okay to
have two hard matches on on Saturday

3504
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:50,279
have two hard matches on on Saturday
 

3505
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,590
have two hard matches on on Saturday
because you get to rest on Saturday

3506
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:51,600
because you get to rest on Saturday
 

3507
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,410
because you get to rest on Saturday
night but now Gordon has to beat two

3508
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:54,420
night but now Gordon has to beat two
 

3509
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,249
night but now Gordon has to beat two
people

3510
01:08:55,249 --> 01:08:55,259
people
 

3511
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:57,890
people
back to back and save energy for the

3512
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:57,900
back to back and save energy for the
 

3513
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,709
back to back and save energy for the
biggest fight of his life on Sunday uh

3514
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:00,719
biggest fight of his life on Sunday uh
 

3515
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,410
biggest fight of his life on Sunday uh
late Sunday afternoon so now the

3516
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:03,420
late Sunday afternoon so now the
 

3517
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,450
late Sunday afternoon so now the
emphasis is on a quick win and you can

3518
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:05,460
emphasis is on a quick win and you can
 

3519
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,550
emphasis is on a quick win and you can
see Gordon Ryan

3520
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:07,560
see Gordon Ryan
 

3521
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,610
see Gordon Ryan
certainly delivers on this now when you

3522
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:10,620
certainly delivers on this now when you
 

3523
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,829
certainly delivers on this now when you
go to entangle your opponent's legs the

3524
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:12,839
go to entangle your opponent's legs the
 

3525
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:14,090
go to entangle your opponent's legs the
basic choice you have is between

3526
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:14,100
basic choice you have is between
 

3527
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,990
basic choice you have is between
straight ashigurami and cross ashigurami

3528
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,000
straight ashigurami and cross ashigurami
 

3529
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,829
straight ashigurami and cross ashigurami
um

3530
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:18,839
um
 

3531
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:21,410
um
in the last five years cross ashigrami

3532
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:21,420
in the last five years cross ashigrami
 

3533
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,749
in the last five years cross ashigrami
has proven to be statistically the more

3534
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
has proven to be statistically the more
 

3535
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,910
has proven to be statistically the more
important of the two

3536
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920
important of the two
 

3537
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,910
important of the two
um and as a result many people have

3538
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:28,920
um and as a result many people have
 

3539
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,189
um and as a result many people have
forgotten the value of straight

3540
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:31,199
forgotten the value of straight
 

3541
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:35,590
forgotten the value of straight
ashigurami leg base leg locks and

3542
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:35,600
ashigurami leg base leg locks and
 

3543
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,749
ashigurami leg base leg locks and
undervalued them Gordon has outstanding

3544
01:09:38,749 --> 01:09:38,759
undervalued them Gordon has outstanding
 

3545
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:41,030
undervalued them Gordon has outstanding
heel hooks from both straight and cross

3546
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,040
heel hooks from both straight and cross
 

3547
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,630
heel hooks from both straight and cross
positions and his opponent was probably

3548
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:44,640
positions and his opponent was probably
 

3549
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,030
positions and his opponent was probably
more concerned about the danger of a

3550
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
more concerned about the danger of a
 

3551
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,930
more concerned about the danger of a
cross ashigurami left the the right leg

3552
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:49,940
cross ashigurami left the the right leg
 

3553
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:54,110
cross ashigurami left the the right leg
uh undefended for far too long and as a

3554
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:54,120
uh undefended for far too long and as a
 

3555
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,850
uh undefended for far too long and as a
result Gordon goes into

3556
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:55,860
result Gordon goes into
 

3557
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,790
result Gordon goes into
a very classical

3558
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:57,800
a very classical
 

3559
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,630
a very classical
ashigrama you would normally expect to

3560
01:09:59,630 --> 01:09:59,640
ashigrama you would normally expect to
 

3561
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,570
ashigrama you would normally expect to
see from five or six years ago and gets

3562
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:02,580
see from five or six years ago and gets
 

3563
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:05,390
see from five or six years ago and gets
a very very quick finish so lifts his

3564
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:05,400
a very very quick finish so lifts his
 

3565
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,950
a very very quick finish so lifts his
opponent

3566
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
opponent
 

3567
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,930
opponent
there's the ashigurami the entanglement

3568
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:08,940
there's the ashigurami the entanglement
 

3569
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,669
there's the ashigurami the entanglement
of one of his opponent's legs were two

3570
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:10,679
of one of his opponent's legs were two
 

3571
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:13,070
of one of his opponent's legs were two
of his now he's got to turn and expose

3572
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:13,080
of his now he's got to turn and expose
 

3573
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,930
of his now he's got to turn and expose
his opponent's heel so there's an

3574
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:14,940
his opponent's heel so there's an
 

3575
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,669
his opponent's heel so there's an
initial off balance to the left to get a

3576
01:10:16,669 --> 01:10:16,679
initial off balance to the left to get a
 

3577
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,350
initial off balance to the left to get a
defensive reaction the opponent

3578
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:18,360
defensive reaction the opponent
 

3579
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,290
defensive reaction the opponent
overcompensates exposes his heel and

3580
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:21,300
overcompensates exposes his heel and
 

3581
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,149
overcompensates exposes his heel and
then there's the submission

3582
01:10:25,149 --> 01:10:25,159

 

3583
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:27,770

leg being broken here Gordon has a

3584
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:27,780
leg being broken here Gordon has a
 

3585
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,990
leg being broken here Gordon has a
absolutely ferocious uh outside here

3586
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
absolutely ferocious uh outside here
 

3587
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,169
absolutely ferocious uh outside here
okay until you felt it it's um it's

3588
01:10:33,169 --> 01:10:33,179
okay until you felt it it's um it's
 

3589
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:35,590
okay until you felt it it's um it's
quite different so the the opponent

3590
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,600
quite different so the the opponent
 

3591
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,209
quite different so the the opponent
probably before he even felt the heel

3592
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:38,219
probably before he even felt the heel
 

3593
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:40,430
probably before he even felt the heel
hook felt the control that it's yeah

3594
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:40,440
hook felt the control that it's yeah
 

3595
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,250
hook felt the control that it's yeah
it's I think he's screwed there yeah he

3596
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:43,260
it's I think he's screwed there yeah he
 

3597
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,050
it's I think he's screwed there yeah he
doesn't even want the yeah when someone

3598
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:45,060
doesn't even want the yeah when someone
 

3599
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,790
doesn't even want the yeah when someone
has a someone who knows what they're

3600
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
has a someone who knows what they're
 

3601
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,189
has a someone who knows what they're
doing gets a bite on your leg like that

3602
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:49,199
doing gets a bite on your leg like that
 

3603
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,430
doing gets a bite on your leg like that
you feel it deep inside your knee and

3604
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:52,440
you feel it deep inside your knee and
 

3605
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:57,669
you feel it deep inside your knee and
Ankle tendons immediately and um

3606
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:57,679

 

3607
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,350

it's there's a sense in which you almost

3608
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:00,360
it's there's a sense in which you almost
 

3609
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,250
it's there's a sense in which you almost
tap

3610
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:01,260
tap
 

3611
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:04,790
tap
uh he got a couple of TAPS almost almost

3612
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:04,800
uh he got a couple of TAPS almost almost
 

3613
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,669
uh he got a couple of TAPS almost almost
like as if they're early because people

3614
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
like as if they're early because people
 

3615
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,169
like as if they're early because people
came out to us and said this guy tapped

3616
01:11:09,169 --> 01:11:09,179
came out to us and said this guy tapped
 

3617
01:11:09,179 --> 01:11:12,770
came out to us and said this guy tapped
early he's like no he knew yeah yeah he

3618
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:12,780
early he's like no he knew yeah yeah he
 

3619
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,890
early he's like no he knew yeah yeah he
knew that uh late would be a big problem

3620
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:15,900
knew that uh late would be a big problem
 

3621
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,830
knew that uh late would be a big problem
got it so this is within within within

3622
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:18,840
got it so this is within within within
 

3623
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,229
got it so this is within within within
like 30 seconds within 10 seconds he was

3624
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:21,239
like 30 seconds within 10 seconds he was
 

3625
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:23,090
like 30 seconds within 10 seconds he was
within 10 seconds so this was a

3626
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:23,100
within 10 seconds so this was a
 

3627
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,310
within 10 seconds so this was a
excellent example of someone saying Okay

3628
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:25,320
excellent example of someone saying Okay
 

3629
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,050
excellent example of someone saying Okay
I'm going to conserve energy with a

3630
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:27,060
I'm going to conserve energy with a
 

3631
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,330
I'm going to conserve energy with a
short match I'm not just going to go

3632
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:29,340
short match I'm not just going to go
 

3633
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,830
short match I'm not just going to go
down into a neutral position I'm going

3634
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:30,840
down into a neutral position I'm going
 

3635
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,290
down into a neutral position I'm going
to directly pull into a leg lock attack

3636
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:33,300
to directly pull into a leg lock attack
 

3637
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,330
to directly pull into a leg lock attack
from standing position you don't see

3638
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:35,340
from standing position you don't see
 

3639
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,410
from standing position you don't see
that much in heavyweight divisions

3640
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:36,420
that much in heavyweight divisions
 

3641
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,729
that much in heavyweight divisions
that's something you see more in the

3642
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:37,739
that's something you see more in the
 

3643
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:39,350
that's something you see more in the
lightweight divisions

3644
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:39,360
lightweight divisions
 

3645
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,410
lightweight divisions
so we got to go to the final match of uh

3646
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:42,420
so we got to go to the final match of uh

finals match so instead of being 10
minutes long it's 20 minutes long with

3720
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:14,159
the option of a 20 minute overtime so
 

3721
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,770
the option of a 20 minute overtime so
this could potentially be a 40-minute

supposed to be you you have a skill
 

3901
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,930
supposed to be you you have a skill
level it's set in stone this is your

3902
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:50,940
level it's set in stone this is your
 

3903
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,910

3905
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,290
skill level you don't just go on stage
and suddenly your school level gets here

3906
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:54,300
and suddenly your school level gets here
 

3907
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,350
and suddenly your school level gets here
what you do have is a situation where

3908
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:57,360
what you do have is a situation where
 

3909
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,810
what you do have is a situation where
you have a skill level okay

3910
01:16:59,810 --> 01:16:59,820
you have a skill level okay
 

3911
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,669
you have a skill level okay
another opponent has a higher skill

3912
01:17:01,669 --> 01:17:01,679
another opponent has a higher skill
 

3913
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,189
another opponent has a higher skill
level but he runs into confidence issues

3914
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:04,199
level but he runs into confidence issues
 

3915
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:06,890
level but he runs into confidence issues
so that he only uses a small percentage

3916
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:06,900
so that he only uses a small percentage
 

3917
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,770
so that he only uses a small percentage
of his actual skills and then he will

3918
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:09,780
of his actual skills and then he will
 

3919
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:12,649
of his actual skills and then he will
fall below someone who is technically

3920
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:12,659
fall below someone who is technically
 

3921
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:15,350
fall below someone who is technically
lower on the skill scale than he is that

3922
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:15,360
lower on the skill scale than he is that
 

3923
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,430
lower on the skill scale than he is that
can happen

3924
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:16,440
can happen
 

3925
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,310
can happen
but you can't just magically acquire

3926
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:19,320
but you can't just magically acquire
 

3927
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:23,090
but you can't just magically acquire
skills yeah but they're able to fall in

3928
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,100
skills yeah but they're able to fall in
 

3929
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,010
skills yeah but they're able to fall in
confidence yes so the question becomes

3930
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:25,020
confidence yes so the question becomes
 

3931
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,649
confidence yes so the question becomes
who manages that for best and that can

3932
01:17:27,649 --> 01:17:27,659
who manages that for best and that can
 

3933
01:17:27,659 --> 01:17:29,930
who manages that for best and that can
create upsets absolutely so you don't

3934
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:29,940
create upsets absolutely so you don't
 

3935
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,729
create upsets absolutely so you don't

when the pressure is so high there was
 

3941
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,270
when the pressure is so high there was
just no basis for a fall to occur you

3942
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:38,280
just no basis for a fall to occur you
 

3943

there's going to be a psychological uh
 

3969
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,669
there's going to be a psychological uh
dissonance between

I totally agree with that can you try to
 

4009
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,450
I totally agree with that can you try to
like dissect that's what I mean when I

4010
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:53,460
like dissect that's what I mean when I
 

4011
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,370
like dissect that's what I mean when I
said I had many students but only one

4012
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:55,380
said I had many students but only one
 

4013
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,770
said I had many students but only one
Gordon Ryan like I've taught many many

4014
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:57,780
Gordon Ryan like I've taught many many
 

4015
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,990
Gordon Ryan like I've taught many many
people but they don't all have his skill

4016
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,000
people but they don't all have his skill
 

4017
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,850
people but they don't all have his skill
level so there's an obvious elephants in

4018
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:01,860
level so there's an obvious elephants in
 

4019
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:04,010
level so there's an obvious elephants in
the room be okay what distinguishes him

4020

the room be okay what distinguishes him
 

4021
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,229
the room be okay what distinguishes him
from from other athletes

4022
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:06,239
from from other athletes
 

4023
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,850
from from other athletes
great question I'll try and give an

4024
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:07,860
great question I'll try and give an
 

4025
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:11,570
great question I'll try and give an
answer

4026
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:11,580

 

4027
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,850

more than anyone else that I've ever

4028
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:13,860
more than anyone else that I've ever
 

4029
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,729
more than anyone else that I've ever
taught he has a memory

4030
01:19:16,729 --> 01:19:16,739
taught he has a memory
 

4031
01:19:16,739 --> 01:19:19,010
taught he has a memory
for things that were taught to him

4032
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:19,020
for things that were taught to him
 

4033
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,729
for things that were taught to him
he has an ability to recall information

4034
01:19:21,729 --> 01:19:21,739
he has an ability to recall information
 

4035
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:24,530
he has an ability to recall information
that is extraordinary compared with

4036
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:24,540
that is extraordinary compared with
 

4037
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,270
that is extraordinary compared with
other people in the room so that's

4038
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:26,280
other people in the room so that's
 

4039
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,530
other people in the room so that's
definitely a big part of it

4040
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:30,540

 

4041
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:35,510

secondly he has a pride in technique and

Technical prowess
 

4045
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:42,169
Technical prowess
that will not allow him to settle for

4046
01:19:42,169 --> 01:19:42,179
that will not allow him to settle for
 

4047
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:44,689
that will not allow him to settle for
anything less than Perfection and he

4048
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:44,699
anything less than Perfection and he
 

4049
01:19:44,699 --> 01:19:46,850
anything less than Perfection and he
will hate himself when there is

4050
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:46,860
will hate himself when there is
 

4051
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,410
will hate himself when there is
imperfection

4052
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:48,420
imperfection
 

4053
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,630
imperfection
so there is a love of excellence and a

hatred of anything less than than
excellence

4058
01:19:58,189 --> 01:19:58,199

 

4059
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,649

he has

4060
01:20:00,649 --> 01:20:00,659
he has
 

4061
01:20:00,659 --> 01:20:03,350
he has
an ability

4062
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
an ability
 

4063
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,630
an ability
to pull the trigger

4064
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:05,640
to pull the trigger
 

4065
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,390
to pull the trigger
when opportunity arises

4066
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,400
when opportunity arises
 

4067
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,910
when opportunity arises
which is truly extraordinary

4068
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:10,920
which is truly extraordinary
 

4069
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,669
which is truly extraordinary
many people know what to do but when the

4070
01:20:13,669 --> 01:20:13,679
many people know what to do but when the
 

4071
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,110
many people know what to do but when the
moment comes

4072
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:15,120
moment comes
 

4073
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,090
moment comes
they back off

4074
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:17,100
they back off
 

4075
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,250
they back off
and they'll doubt themselves

4076
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:19,260
and they'll doubt themselves
 

4077
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,649
and they'll doubt themselves
if Gordon sees the opportunity the

4078
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:21,659
if Gordon sees the opportunity the
 

4079
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:23,990
if Gordon sees the opportunity the
trigger pulls every time

4080
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,000
trigger pulls every time
 

4081
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,550
trigger pulls every time
so again I just just link on that

4082
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:25,560
so again I just just link on that
 

4083
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,370
so again I just just link on that
absolutely there's a few times where he

4084
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:28,380
absolutely there's a few times where he
 

4085
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,229
absolutely there's a few times where he
gets a little bit of an advantage and he

4086
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
gets a little bit of an advantage and he
 

4087
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,930
gets a little bit of an advantage and he
just chases it to get a big like uh with

4088
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:32,940
just chases it to get a big like uh with
 

4089
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:36,649
just chases it to get a big like uh with
Andre gaval you know you get it's like

4090
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:36,659
Andre gaval you know you get it's like
 

4091
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:38,930
Andre gaval you know you get it's like
uh there's a dance and you get one step

4092
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:38,940
uh there's a dance and you get one step
 

4093
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,689
uh there's a dance and you get one step
ahead and he's able to chase that you

4094
01:20:41,689 --> 01:20:41,699
ahead and he's able to chase that you
 

4095
01:20:41,699 --> 01:20:43,490
ahead and he's able to chase that you
know get a little glimmer of the back

4096
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:43,500
know get a little glimmer of the back
 

4097
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,990
know get a little glimmer of the back
and he's able to chase that all the way

4098
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:45,000
and he's able to chase that all the way
 

4099
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,310
and he's able to chase that all the way
to back control

4100
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:46,320
to back control
 

4101
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,590
to back control
so that that is that kind of the trigger

4102
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:48,600
so that that is that kind of the trigger
 

4103
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,810
so that that is that kind of the trigger
that you're referring to yes it runs

4104
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:50,820
that you're referring to yes it runs
 

4105
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,490
that you're referring to yes it runs
deeper than that too it's the idea that

4106
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:52,500
deeper than that too it's the idea that
 

4107
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,310
deeper than that too it's the idea that
good athletes are greedy athletes

4108
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:55,320
good athletes are greedy athletes
 

4109
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,590
good athletes are greedy athletes
okay when they see a small opportunity

4110
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:57,600
okay when they see a small opportunity
 

4111
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,649
okay when they see a small opportunity

when you talk about memory recall which
 

4295
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:44,390
when you talk about memory recall which
is interesting I can't help but see

just chess is just a board game so you
can actually calculate the probability

4318

can actually calculate the probability
 

4319
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,110
can actually calculate the probability
that you could win so he is the highest

4320
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:09,120
that you could win so he is the highest
 

4321
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,169
that you could win so he is the highest
ELO rating uh ever and he's maintained

against
the number two in the world he could

4328
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:17,580
the number two in the world he could
 

4329
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,310
the number two in the world he could
just prove that he's the number one in

4330
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:19,320
just prove that he's the number one in
 

4331
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,229
just prove that he's the number one in
the world for many years uh anyway

there's uh certain similarities one's

there's uh certain similarities one's
 

4335
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:28,490
there's uh certain similarities one's
ability to re recall so memory recall of

4336
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:28,500
ability to re recall so memory recall of
 

4337
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,490
ability to re recall so memory recall of
information is fascinatingly good and

4338
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:31,500
information is fascinatingly good and
 

4339
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,950
information is fascinatingly good and
the other one is not so much a love for

4340
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:33,960
the other one is not so much a love for
 

4341

the other one is not so much a love for
Perfection which is something you

4342
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,280
Perfection which is something you
 

4343
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,250
Perfection which is something you
mentioned but yeah the flip side of that

4344
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:37,260
mentioned but yeah the flip side of that
 

4345
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,229
mentioned but yeah the flip side of that
which is what you also mentioned is the

4346
01:25:39,229 --> 01:25:39,239
which is what you also mentioned is the
 

4347
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:42,709
which is what you also mentioned is the
hate of imperfection uh now in the case

4348
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
hate of imperfection uh now in the case
 

4349
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,689
hate of imperfection uh now in the case
of Magnus

4350
01:25:44,689 --> 01:25:44,699
of Magnus
 

4351
01:25:44,699 --> 01:25:47,530
of Magnus
it almost uh

4352
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:47,540
it almost uh
 

4353
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:50,930
it almost uh
creates a level of anxiety for him

4354
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:50,940
creates a level of anxiety for him
 

4355
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:53,689
creates a level of anxiety for him
that's almost destructive

4356
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:53,699
that's almost destructive
 

4357
01:25:53,699 --> 01:25:56,350
that's almost destructive
so the thing he seems to hate the most

4358
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:56,360
so the thing he seems to hate the most
 

4359
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,689
so the thing he seems to hate the most
is imperfection against people he knows

4360
01:25:59,689 --> 01:25:59,699
is imperfection against people he knows
 

4361
01:25:59,699 --> 01:26:01,370
is imperfection against people he knows
are worse than him

4362

are worse than him
 

4363
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,470
are worse than him
so the thing he loves is competing

01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:03,480
so the thing he loves is competing
 

4365
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:06,350
so the thing he loves is competing
against people that are close to the

4366
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:06,360
against people that are close to the
 

4367
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,229
against people that are close to the
skill level or the favorite is people

4368
01:26:09,229 --> 01:26:09,239
skill level or the favorite is people
 

4369
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:11,390
skill level or the favorite is people
who are might actually be better than

4370
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:11,400
who are might actually be better than
 

4371
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,209
who are might actually be better than
him especially in certain positions he

4372
01:26:14,209 --> 01:26:14,219
him especially in certain positions he
 

4373
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:16,910
him especially in certain positions he
loves competing against them he hates

4374
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:16,920
loves competing against them he hates
 

4375

um still from the perspective of
 

4379
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,149
um still from the perspective of
everyone else

everyone else
 

4381
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:25,490
everyone else
uh what are called super Grand Master so

4382
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:25,500
uh what are called super Grand Master so
 

4383
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,950
uh what are called super Grand Master so
top three in the world but he knows he's

4384
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:27,960
top three in the world but he knows he's
 

4385
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,350
top three in the world but he knows he's
much better than them and the anxiety of

4386
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:30,360
much better than them and the anxiety of
 

4387
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,810
much better than them and the anxiety of
being not perfect against those people

4388

being not perfect against those people
 

4389
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,270
being not perfect against those people
that's why that's why he I don't know if

4390
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:35,280
that's why that's why he I don't know if
 

4391
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,129
that's why that's why he I don't know if
you're paying attention but he stepped

4392
01:26:37,129 --> 01:26:37,139
you're paying attention but he stepped
 

4393
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:38,629
you're paying attention but he stepped
away he's not going to defend his world

championship
 

4397
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,470
championship
uh because he hates the anxiety of

4398
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
uh because he hates the anxiety of
 

4399
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,689
uh because he hates the anxiety of
playing people worse than him

4400

playing people worse than him
 

4401
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:46,850
playing people worse than him
interesting so he figures they would

4402
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:46,860
interesting so he figures they would
 

4403
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,669
interesting so he figures they would
somehow make him look bad or no he just

4404
01:26:49,669 --> 01:26:49,679
somehow make him look bad or no he just
 

4405
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,149
somehow make him look bad or no he just
for him at least the language he uses is

4406
01:26:53,149 --> 01:26:53,159
for him at least the language he uses is
 

4407
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:54,770
for him at least the language he uses is
just not fun

4408
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:54,780
just not fun
 

4409
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:58,790
just not fun
and he likes having fun it's to him it

and he likes having fun it's to him it
 

4411
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,709
and he likes having fun it's to him it
was fun to win no matter the skill level

4412
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
was fun to win no matter the skill level
 

4413
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:03,290
was fun to win no matter the skill level
the world championship the first time

the world championship the first time
 

4415
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,890
the world championship the first time
but then defending it is a very grueling

4416
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:06,900
but then defending it is a very grueling
 

4417
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:07,970
but then defending it is a very grueling
process

4418
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:07,980
process
 

4419
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,290
process
is

4420
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:09,300
is
 

4421
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,189
is
um

4422
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:10,199
um
 

4423
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:12,649
um
with classical chess you play these many

4424
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:12,659
with classical chess you play these many
 

4425
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:15,169
with classical chess you play these many
hours could be seven hour long games

4426
01:27:15,169 --> 01:27:15,179
hours could be seven hour long games
 

4427
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:16,610
hours could be seven hour long games
and

4428
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:16,620
and
 

4429
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:19,610
and
uh on on top of that he really hates the

4430
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:19,620
uh on on top of that he really hates the
 

4431
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:21,830
uh on on top of that he really hates the
fact that it's only I forget what it is

4432
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,840
fact that it's only I forget what it is
 

4433
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,350
fact that it's only I forget what it is
but it's single digit number of games he

4434
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:24,360
but it's single digit number of games he
 

4435
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,750
but it's single digit number of games he
says it's it's low sample

4436
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:26,760
says it's it's low sample
 

4437
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,649
says it's it's low sample
so uh I can't

4438
01:27:30,649 --> 01:27:30,659
so uh I can't

01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:23,340
in the ADCC finals you cannot set to
 

4527
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,729
in the ADCC finals you cannot set to
guard so the the approach that Gordon

4528
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:25,739
guard so the the approach that Gordon
 

4529
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:27,830
guard so the the approach that Gordon
used earlier that we saw on video cannot

4530
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
used earlier that we saw on video cannot
 

4531
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,570
used earlier that we saw on video cannot
be used in the finals Gordon must

4532
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:29,580

wrestle his opponent
 

4535
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,410
wrestle his opponent
so

4536
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:33,420
so
 

4537
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,830
so
on the way out

4538
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:36,840

 

4539
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,370

uh Gordon and I were talking and we'd

4540
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:40,380
uh Gordon and I were talking and we'd
 

4541
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,810
uh Gordon and I were talking and we'd
had discussions obviously during the

4542
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:41,820
had discussions obviously during the
 

4543
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,430
had discussions obviously during the
camp what's the appropriate thing to do

4544
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:43,440
camp what's the appropriate thing to do
 

4545
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,330
camp what's the appropriate thing to do
here

4546
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:44,340
here
 

4547
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:50,090
here
and there had been some

4548
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:50,100

 

4549
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,490

matches earlier in the event where it

4550
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:52,500
matches earlier in the event where it
 

4551
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,070
matches earlier in the event where it
was becoming obvious that stalling

4552
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:55,080
was becoming obvious that stalling
 

4553
01:29:55,080 --> 01:30:00,110
was becoming obvious that stalling
was being heavily punished by referees

4554
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:00,120

 

4555
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,629

so

4556
01:30:02,629 --> 01:30:02,639
so
 

4557
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,149
so
I said to Gordon on the way out just

4558
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:05,159
I said to Gordon on the way out just
 

4559
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:06,530
I said to Gordon on the way out just
give him your leg

4560
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:06,540
give him your leg
 

4561
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,930
give him your leg
let him take you down because in the

4562
01:30:08,930 --> 01:30:08,940
let him take you down because in the
 

4563
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,090
let him take you down because in the
first 10 minutes of the finals takedowns

4564
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:11,100
first 10 minutes of the finals takedowns
 

4565
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,490
first 10 minutes of the finals takedowns
don't score anything well there are no

4566
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:13,500
don't score anything well there are no
 

4567
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,050
don't score anything well there are no
there are no means of scoring the first

4568
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:15,060
there are no means of scoring the first
 

4569
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,669
there are no means of scoring the first
10 minutes but you can't sit to God that

4570
01:30:16,669 --> 01:30:16,679
10 minutes but you can't sit to God that
 

4571
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:18,649
10 minutes but you can't sit to God that
will be that will award you a negative

4572
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:18,659
will be that will award you a negative
 

4573
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:20,149
will be that will award you a negative
point so I said just let Nikki Royal

4574
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:20,159
point so I said just let Nikki Royal
 

4575
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,310
point so I said just let Nikki Royal
take you down and he's like Nikki Rod's

4576
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
take you down and he's like Nikki Rod's
 

4577
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,290
take you down and he's like Nikki Rod's
not going to take the bait and I said if

4578
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:24,300
not going to take the bait and I said if
 

4579
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,390
not going to take the bait and I said if
he doesn't they'll call him for stalling

4580
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
he doesn't they'll call him for stalling
 

4581
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,750
he doesn't they'll call him for stalling
and so and and then Craig Jones also

4582
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:29,760
and so and and then Craig Jones also
 

4583
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,510
and so and and then Craig Jones also
commented after the fact is I don't know

4584
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:32,520
commented after the fact is I don't know
 

4585
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:36,110
commented after the fact is I don't know
why Nikki took the beat

4586
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:36,120

 

4587
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,729

um so if we see the start of the match

4588
01:30:37,729 --> 01:30:37,739
um so if we see the start of the match
 

4589
01:30:37,739 --> 01:30:39,830
um so if we see the start of the match
you see Gordon comes out and offers a

4590
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:39,840

it's hard
to just keep a potentially 40 minute

5038
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:28,980
to just keep a potentially 40 minute
 

5039

5074
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,480
he's doing enough action not to get
 

5075
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,169
he's doing enough action not to get
called for stalling but not so much to

engage with the dangerous Gordon Ryan on
 

5079
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,910
engage with the dangerous Gordon Ryan on
the ground then it's feasible he could

5080
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:13,920
the ground then it's feasible he could
 

5081
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,229
the ground then it's feasible he could
have won

5082
01:40:15,229 --> 01:40:15,239
have won
 

5083
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:17,570
have won
but it would have been as I said it

the only way I can lose this

5154
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:39,480
the only way I can lose this
 

5155
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,050
the only way I can lose this
is if this guy plays a tactical game

5156
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:42,060
is if this guy plays a tactical game
 

5157
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:45,649
is if this guy plays a tactical game
so in his best case scenario

5158
01:41:45,649 --> 01:41:45,659
so in his best case scenario
 

5159
01:41:45,659 --> 01:41:47,450
so in his best case scenario
I lose my Tactical

5160
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:47,460
I lose my Tactical
 

5161
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,850
I lose my Tactical
by a tactical game but from Andre's

5162
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:49,860
by a tactical game but from Andre's
 

5163
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:51,410
by a tactical game but from Andre's
perspective it's like if I make one

5164
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:51,420
perspective it's like if I make one
 

5165
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:53,810
perspective it's like if I make one
screw up this kid could finish me

5166
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:53,820
screw up this kid could finish me
 

5167
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:55,850
screw up this kid could finish me
like it's you can see which way the

5168
01:41:55,850 --> 01:41:55,860
like it's you can see which way the
 

5169
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,830
like it's you can see which way the
intimidation game goes

5170
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:57,840
intimidation game goes
 

5171
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,470
intimidation game goes
now for the start things get interesting

5172
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480
now for the start things get interesting
 

5173
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,390
now for the start things get interesting
here we've already said if you can just

5174
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:02,400
here we've already said if you can just
 

5175
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,030
here we've already said if you can just
freeze it right there

5176
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:04,040
freeze it right there
 

5177
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:07,070
freeze it right there
Andre's only real realistic part to

01:42:07,070 --> 01:42:07,080
Andre's only real realistic part to
 

5179
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,590
Andre's only real realistic part to
Victory is standing grappling okay that

5180
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
Victory is standing grappling okay that
 

5181
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,410
Victory is standing grappling okay that
would require him to take Gordon down

5182
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:12,420
would require him to take Gordon down
 

5183
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:15,290
would require him to take Gordon down
presumably multiple times after the

5184
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:15,300
presumably multiple times after the
 

5185
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,330
presumably multiple times after the
first 10 minutes and not be taken down

5186
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:17,340
first 10 minutes and not be taken down
 

5187
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,209
first 10 minutes and not be taken down
at all by Gordon so it's a tall order

5188
01:42:20,209 --> 01:42:20,219
at all by Gordon so it's a tall order
 

5189
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:23,149
at all by Gordon so it's a tall order
it's possible but difficult

5190
01:42:23,149 --> 01:42:23,159
it's possible but difficult
 

5191
01:42:23,159 --> 01:42:24,890
it's possible but difficult

01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,330
but just getting Andre gavar's good just
getting the guard back all of that is

5378
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:53,340
getting the guard back all of that is
 

5379
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:55,790
getting the guard back all of that is
great there's also a sensor in which

5380
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:55,800
great there's also a sensor in which
 

5381
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,470
great there's also a sensor in which
Gordon is pacing it too just to

5382
01:45:57,470 --> 01:45:57,480
Gordon is pacing it too just to
 

5383
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:01,090
Gordon is pacing it too just to
physically fatigue an opponent

5384
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:01,100
physically fatigue an opponent
 

5385
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:03,830
physically fatigue an opponent
so I was passing the guards but not

5386
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:03,840
so I was passing the guards but not
 

5387
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:07,430
so I was passing the guards but not
rushing it

5388
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:07,440

 

5389
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,350

now what Gordon's looking for here is

5390
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:09,360
now what Gordon's looking for here is
 

5391
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,770
now what Gordon's looking for here is
complete chest to Chase contact

5392
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:12,780
complete chest to Chase contact
 

5393
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:15,290
complete chest to Chase contact
he's getting very close to it now

5394
01:46:15,290 --> 01:46:15,300
he's getting very close to it now
 

5395
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:17,209
he's getting very close to it now
and once he gets chest to chased on an

5396
01:46:17,209 --> 01:46:17,219
and once he gets chest to chased on an
 

5397
01:46:17,219 --> 01:46:18,890
and once he gets chest to chased on an
opponent in top position past one of his

5398
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:18,900
opponent in top position past one of his
 

5399
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,810
opponent in top position past one of his
opponent's knees it's going to be

5400
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:20,820
opponent's knees it's going to be
 

5401
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:22,310
opponent's knees it's going to be
awfully awfully difficult for an

5402
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:22,320
awfully awfully difficult for an
 

5403
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:28,250
awfully awfully difficult for an
opponent to recover

5404
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:28,260

 

5405
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:30,770

what is he waiting for here is the this

5406
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:30,780
what is he waiting for here is the this
 

5407
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:33,410
what is he waiting for here is the this
pressure here over time he just wears

5408
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:33,420
pressure here over time he just wears
 

5409
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,810
pressure here over time he just wears
you out yeah it's part of a campaign of

5410
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:35,820
you out yeah it's part of a campaign of
 

5411
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,090
you out yeah it's part of a campaign of
attrition of pressure over time now he's

5412
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:38,100
attrition of pressure over time now he's
 

5413
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,649
attrition of pressure over time now he's
creating a situation where he's he's

5414
01:46:39,649 --> 01:46:39,659
creating a situation where he's he's
 

5415
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:42,290
creating a situation where he's he's
either going to get back exposure or

5416
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:42,300
either going to get back exposure or
 

5417
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,930
either going to get back exposure or
Mount exposure and either way is pretty

5418
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:44,940
Mount exposure and either way is pretty
 

5419
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,070
Mount exposure and either way is pretty
much fatal when you're dealing with

5420
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,080
much fatal when you're dealing with
 

5421
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,209
much fatal when you're dealing with
Gordon

5422
01:46:47,209 --> 01:46:47,219
Gordon
 

5423
01:46:47,219 --> 01:46:49,550
Gordon
um Andre elected to to go the route of

5424
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:49,560
um Andre elected to to go the route of
 

5425
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:56,450
um Andre elected to to go the route of
back exposure

5426
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:56,460

 

5427
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:59,390

now Gordon got the body triangle is on

5428
01:46:59,390 --> 01:46:59,400
now Gordon got the body triangle is on
 

5429
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,490
now Gordon got the body triangle is on
his back

5430
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:01,500
his back
 

5431
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,010
his back
and now it's uh now there's one physical

5432
01:47:04,010 --> 01:47:04,020
and now it's uh now there's one physical
 

5433
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:06,649
and now it's uh now there's one physical
problem here that's uh that Andre Galvan

5434
01:47:06,649 --> 01:47:06,659
problem here that's uh that Andre Galvan
 

5435
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:10,070
problem here that's uh that Andre Galvan
has a neck like a bull and um he's a

5436
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
has a neck like a bull and um he's a
 

5437
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,109

very short and very thick neck so

5438
01:47:12,109 --> 01:47:12,119
very short and very thick neck so
 

5439
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:13,910
very short and very thick neck so
penetrating under the chin for the

5440
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:13,920
penetrating under the chin for the
 

5441
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,370
penetrating under the chin for the
strangle can be a real problem he also

5442
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:16,380
strangle can be a real problem he also
 

5443
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,169
strangle can be a real problem he also
has extremely well developed shoulders

5444
01:47:18,169 --> 01:47:18,179
has extremely well developed shoulders
 

5445
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:20,030
has extremely well developed shoulders
and upper arms so when the head comes

5446
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:20,040
and upper arms so when the head comes
 

5447
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,830
and upper arms so when the head comes
down and the shoulders go up there's

5448
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:21,840
down and the shoulders go up there's
 

5449
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,570
down and the shoulders go up there's
very little real estate to work with

5450
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:23,580
very little real estate to work with
 

5451
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:26,209
very little real estate to work with
with regards to strangleholds so Gordon

5452
01:47:26,209 --> 01:47:26,219
with regards to strangleholds so Gordon
 

5453
01:47:26,219 --> 01:47:28,609
with regards to strangleholds so Gordon
in time will trap one of his opponent's

5454
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:28,619
in time will trap one of his opponent's
 

5455
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:31,070
in time will trap one of his opponent's
arms with his legs in order to take away

5456
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:31,080
arms with his legs in order to take away
 

5457
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,810
arms with his legs in order to take away
one of those strong defensive arms there

5458
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:32,820
one of those strong defensive arms there
 

5459
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,850
one of those strong defensive arms there
you can see the arm has been trapped and

5460
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:34,860
you can see the arm has been trapped and
 

5461
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:36,410
you can see the arm has been trapped and
now he can see the biting towards the

5462
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:36,420
now he can see the biting towards the
 

5463
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:37,790
now he can see the biting towards the
strangle

5464
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:37,800
strangle
 

5465
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,310
strangle

looking good there's still a
 

5471
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:45,050
looking good there's still a
considerable amount of time left on the

5472
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:45,060
considerable amount of time left on the
 

5473
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,149
considerable amount of time left on the
clock Gordon as well ahead on points so

you are and where where does the
 

5497
01:48:24,659 --> 01:48:28,070
you are and where where does the
strangle actually happen in terms of

5498
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:28,080
strangle actually happen in terms of
 

5499
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,149
strangle actually happen in terms of
um

5500
01:48:29,149 --> 01:48:29,159
um
 

5501
01:48:29,159 --> 01:48:31,370
um
it felt like the strangle was at the

5502
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:31,380
it felt like the strangle was at the
 

5503
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,609
it felt like the strangle was at the
blade of the it wasn't even fully sunk

5504
01:48:34,609 --> 01:48:34,619
blade of the it wasn't even fully sunk
 

5505
01:48:34,619 --> 01:48:36,649

full car was like um one-handed there's
a sense in which once you get underneath

5510
01:48:42,169 --> 01:48:42,179
a sense in which once you get underneath
 

5511
01:48:42,179 --> 01:48:44,330
a sense in which once you get underneath
you know the inevitable yeah follow-up

you know the inevitable yeah follow-up
 

5513
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,310
you know the inevitable yeah follow-up
is again the inevitable you're feeling

the inevitable it's like a um to go back
 

5517
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:49,910
the inevitable it's like a um to go back
to your chest analogy it's like

5518
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:49,920
to your chest analogy it's like
 

5519
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,550
to your chest analogy it's like
resigning in cheers yeah and chess is

5520

resigning in cheers yeah and chess is
 

5521
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,950
resigning in cheers yeah and chess is
considered almost like impolite to let

5522
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:54,960
considered almost like impolite to let
 

5523
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,590

when you understand that death is
 

5527
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,410
when you understand that death is
on the horizon

5528
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:03,420
on the horizon
 

5529
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:05,030
on the horizon
and there's a lot of

5530
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:05,040
and there's a lot of
 

5531

02:05:06,350 --> 02:05:06,360
barrel of defeat there's not that much
 

6345
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:08,390
barrel of defeat there's not that much
time left and that's what's going to set

6346
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:08,400
time left and that's what's going to set
 

6347
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,430
time left and that's what's going to set
up the the pressure now it's tactical

6348
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:10,440
up the the pressure now it's tactical
 

6349
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,870
up the the pressure now it's tactical
pressure it's not physical pressure it's

Tactical Matthias has to turn away

6352
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:15,420
Tactical Matthias has to turn away
 

6353
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,089
Tactical Matthias has to turn away
and that's going to create back exposure

6354
02:05:17,089 --> 02:05:17,099
and that's going to create back exposure
 

6355
02:05:17,099 --> 02:05:18,890
and that's going to create back exposure
the most dangerous kind of exposure in

6356
02:05:18,890 --> 02:05:18,900
the most dangerous kind of exposure in
 

6357
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:20,149
the most dangerous kind of exposure in
ADCC

ADCC
 

6359
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:23,390
ADCC
oh there it is

Giancarlo capitalizes
 

6367
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,270
Giancarlo capitalizes
Mateus is smart he's keeping on the side

6368
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,280
Mateus is smart he's keeping on the side
 

6369
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,790
Mateus is smart he's keeping on the side
so that less than 75 percent of his back

6370
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:37,800
so that less than 75 percent of his back
 

6371
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,589
so that less than 75 percent of his back
is on the floor to deny the uh the

6372
02:05:39,589 --> 02:05:39,599
is on the floor to deny the uh the
 

6373
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:41,450
is on the floor to deny the uh the
mountain points but that comes at a

6374
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:41,460
mountain points but that comes at a
 

6375
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:44,209
mountain points but that comes at a
price and that price is back exposure so

6376
02:05:44,209 --> 02:05:44,219
price and that price is back exposure so
 

6377
02:05:44,219 --> 02:05:46,750
price and that price is back exposure so
the thing we talked about with Gordon

6378
02:05:46,750 --> 02:05:46,760
the thing we talked about with Gordon
 

6379
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:51,290
the thing we talked about with Gordon
the the circumstance of Fate which is he

6380
02:05:51,290 --> 02:05:51,300
the the circumstance of Fate which is he
 

6381
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:53,810
the the circumstance of Fate which is he
has a lot of grueling tough matches and

6382
02:05:53,810 --> 02:05:53,820
has a lot of grueling tough matches and
 

6383
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:56,089
has a lot of grueling tough matches and
still chooses to do absolute so what's

6384
02:05:56,089 --> 02:05:56,099
still chooses to do absolute so what's
 

6385
02:05:56,099 --> 02:05:58,250
still chooses to do absolute so what's
and he seems to just power through all

6386
02:05:58,250 --> 02:05:58,260
and he seems to just power through all
 

6387
02:05:58,260 --> 02:06:00,830
and he seems to just power through all
of it what how much of it

6388
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:00,840
of it what how much of it
 

6389
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:02,930
of it what how much of it
how much of the calculation is how to

6390
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:02,940
how much of the calculation is how to
 

6391
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:05,450
how much of the calculation is how to
survive the cardio the grueling cardio

6392
02:06:05,450 --> 02:06:05,460
survive the cardio the grueling cardio
 

6393
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:07,490
survive the cardio the grueling cardio
aspect of all of this that's uh it's a

6394
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:07,500
aspect of all of this that's uh it's a
 

6395
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,870
aspect of all of this that's uh it's a
great question and the truth of the

6396
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:08,880
great question and the truth of the
 

6397
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,149
great question and the truth of the
matter is you can't

6398
02:06:11,149 --> 02:06:11,159
matter is you can't
 

6399
02:06:11,159 --> 02:06:14,990
matter is you can't
forward to pace yourself

6400
02:06:14,990 --> 02:06:15,000
forward to pace yourself
 

6401
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,910
forward to pace yourself
because if you say I'm going to hold

6402
02:06:16,910 --> 02:06:16,920
because if you say I'm going to hold
 

6403
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:19,189
because if you say I'm going to hold
myself back for this match an

6404
02:06:19,189 --> 02:06:19,199
myself back for this match an
 

6405
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:20,510
myself back for this match an
expectation of the others you could end

6406
02:06:20,510 --> 02:06:20,520
expectation of the others you could end
 

6407
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,609
expectation of the others you could end
up losing your first match so he didn't

6408
02:06:22,609 --> 02:06:22,619
up losing your first match so he didn't
 

6409
02:06:22,619 --> 02:06:25,430
up losing your first match so he didn't
Pierce himself at all any of the matches

6410
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:25,440
Pierce himself at all any of the matches
 

6411
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,830
Pierce himself at all any of the matches
you have to just be in good shape and

6412
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:27,840
you have to just be in good shape and
 

6413
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,550
you have to just be in good shape and
that's what they're they're going on

6414
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:30,560
that's what they're they're going on
 

6415
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:33,890
that's what they're they're going on
no it's mostly physical you've that's

6416
02:06:33,890 --> 02:06:33,900
no it's mostly physical you've that's
 

6417
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:35,930
no it's mostly physical you've that's
what the camp is for like he's felt more

6418
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:35,940
what the camp is for like he's felt more
 

6419
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:37,550
what the camp is for like he's felt more
pressure in the training room that he

6420
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:37,560
pressure in the training room that he
 

6421
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:40,990
pressure in the training room that he
felt in any of his matches

6422
02:06:40,990 --> 02:06:41,000

 

6423
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,910

but still sort of attacking look at this

6424
02:06:45,910 --> 02:06:45,920
but still sort of attacking look at this
 

6425
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:49,010
but still sort of attacking look at this
from back or from whatever the heck that

6426
02:06:49,010 --> 02:06:49,020
from back or from whatever the heck that
 

6427
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:50,089
from back or from whatever the heck that
position was

6428
02:06:50,089 --> 02:06:50,099
position was
 

6429
02:06:50,099 --> 02:06:53,689
position was
uh a rate for uh from looking for the

6430
02:06:53,689 --> 02:06:53,699
uh a rate for uh from looking for the
 

6431
02:06:53,699 --> 02:06:56,450
uh a rate for uh from looking for the
back transitioning here what the heck is

6432
02:06:56,450 --> 02:06:56,460
back transitioning here what the heck is
 

6433
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:58,609
back transitioning here what the heck is
this transition so Matthias is engaging

6434
02:06:58,609 --> 02:06:58,619
this transition so Matthias is engaging
 

6435
02:06:58,619 --> 02:07:00,709
this transition so Matthias is engaging
in a very good tactic which is to get

6436
02:07:00,709 --> 02:07:00,719
in a very good tactic which is to get
 

6437
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:02,450
in a very good tactic which is to get
most of his back off the ground to deny

6438
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:02,460
most of his back off the ground to deny
 

6439
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:04,669
most of his back off the ground to deny
the amount points so as back exposure

6440
02:07:04,669 --> 02:07:04,679
the amount points so as back exposure
 

6441
02:07:04,679 --> 02:07:07,609
the amount points so as back exposure
starts okay he turns in threatening yeah

6442
02:07:07,609 --> 02:07:07,619
starts okay he turns in threatening yeah
 

6443
02:07:07,619 --> 02:07:09,229
starts okay he turns in threatening yeah
but you can see what's happening here is

6444
02:07:09,229 --> 02:07:09,239
but you can see what's happening here is
 

6445
02:07:09,239 --> 02:07:10,729
but you can see what's happening here is
the left foot goes under it's going to

6446
02:07:10,729 --> 02:07:10,739
the left foot goes under it's going to
 

6447
02:07:10,739 --> 02:07:13,970
the left foot goes under it's going to
create a beautiful triangle entry

6448
02:07:13,970 --> 02:07:13,980
create a beautiful triangle entry
 

6449
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:15,649
create a beautiful triangle entry
right foot penetrates through underneath

6450
02:07:15,649 --> 02:07:15,659
right foot penetrates through underneath
 

6451
02:07:15,659 --> 02:07:16,729
right foot penetrates through underneath
the neck

6452
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:16,739
the neck
 

6453
02:07:16,739 --> 02:07:19,129
the neck
and now he's locking a triangle a

6454
02:07:19,129 --> 02:07:19,139
and now he's locking a triangle a
 

6455
02:07:19,139 --> 02:07:21,050
and now he's locking a triangle a
senkaku but not just any triangle a

6456
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:21,060
senkaku but not just any triangle a
 

6457
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:23,750
senkaku but not just any triangle a
triangle with the the figure four locked

6458
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:23,760
triangle with the the figure four locked
 

6459
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,129
triangle with the the figure four locked
on the back of the opponent's head which

6460
02:07:25,129 --> 02:07:25,139
on the back of the opponent's head which
 

6461
02:07:25,139 --> 02:07:27,589
on the back of the opponent's head which
makes any kind of stacking defense very

6462
02:07:27,589 --> 02:07:27,599
makes any kind of stacking defense very
 

6463
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:29,030
makes any kind of stacking defense very
very difficult it makes it very very

6464
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,040
very difficult it makes it very very
 

6465
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,950
very difficult it makes it very very
hard for an opponent to pull away and

6466
02:07:30,950 --> 02:07:30,960
hard for an opponent to pull away and
 

6467
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,510
hard for an opponent to pull away and
creates a much tighter strangle than

6468
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:32,520
creates a much tighter strangle than
 

6469
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,850
creates a much tighter strangle than
average

6470
02:07:34,850 --> 02:07:34,860

 

6471
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:38,450

and as a result it's a quick submission

6472
02:07:38,450 --> 02:07:38,460
and as a result it's a quick submission
 

6473
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:40,430
and as a result it's a quick submission
beautifully done still chasing the

6474
02:07:40,430 --> 02:07:40,440
beautifully done still chasing the
 

6475
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:43,490
beautifully done still chasing the
submission yes uh with a minute left up

6476
02:07:43,490 --> 02:07:43,500
submission yes uh with a minute left up
 

6477

02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:00,719
how is he the control comes from his
 

6643
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:03,129
how is he the control comes from his
opponent the entanglement is his

6644
02:11:03,129 --> 02:11:03,139
opponent the entanglement is his
 

6645
02:11:03,139 --> 02:11:06,109
opponent the entanglement is his
opponent's ah his opponent is holding

6646
02:11:06,109 --> 02:11:06,119
opponent's ah his opponent is holding
 

6647
02:11:06,119 --> 02:11:08,750
opponent's ah his opponent is holding
his own body in place with his own legs

6648
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:08,760
his own body in place with his own legs
 

6649
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:13,250
his own body in place with his own legs
so he's the root of his own problem here

6650
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:13,260
so he's the root of his own problem here
 

6651
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:16,870
so he's the root of his own problem here
so you got sloppy well done well done

6652
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:16,880
so you got sloppy well done well done
 

6653
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:19,250
so you got sloppy well done well done
and a little smile from drunk that was

6654
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:19,260
and a little smile from drunk that was
 

6655
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:20,930
and a little smile from drunk that was
very nice the reason for that smile you

6656
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:20,940
very nice the reason for that smile you
 

6657
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:22,850
very nice the reason for that smile you
can probably guess is because

6658
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:22,860
can probably guess is because
 

6659
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:24,709
can probably guess is because
a year ago

6660
02:11:24,709 --> 02:11:24,719
a year ago
 

6661
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:27,589
a year ago
this would have been a disaster and now

6662
02:11:27,589 --> 02:11:27,599
this would have been a disaster and now
 

6663
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:30,290
this would have been a disaster and now
instead it's a guaranteed ticket to the

6664
02:11:30,290 --> 02:11:30,300
instead it's a guaranteed ticket to the
 

6665
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:31,790
instead it's a guaranteed ticket to the
finals in either a gold or a silver

6666
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:31,800
finals in either a gold or a silver
 

6667
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:34,070
finals in either a gold or a silver
medal and so you can see in that

6668
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:34,080
medal and so you can see in that
 

6669
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:36,109
medal and so you can see in that
compressed moment that's the look of a

6670
02:11:36,109 --> 02:11:36,119
compressed moment that's the look of a
 

6671
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:38,689
compressed moment that's the look of a
man who's made was just recognized as

6672
02:11:38,689 --> 02:11:38,699
man who's made was just recognized as
 

6673
02:11:38,699 --> 02:11:40,430
man who's made was just recognized as
how much progress he's made and what was

6674
02:11:40,430 --> 02:11:40,440
how much progress he's made and what was
 

6675
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:43,790
how much progress he's made and what was
once a weakness in roughly 10 months was

6676
02:11:43,790 --> 02:11:43,800
once a weakness in roughly 10 months was
 

6677
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:46,910
once a weakness in roughly 10 months was
the time it took and so uh he faces

6678
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:46,920
the time it took and so uh he faces
 

6679
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:50,510
the time it took and so uh he faces
Lucas Hulk Barbosa in the in in the

6680
02:11:50,510 --> 02:11:50,520
Lucas Hulk Barbosa in the in in the
 

6681
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:52,729
Lucas Hulk Barbosa in the in in the
final here now these do have a history

6682
02:11:52,729 --> 02:11:52,739

and uh now there's eight minutes left so

6766
02:13:40,310 --> 02:13:40,320
and uh now there's eight minutes left so
 

6767

all the time in the world
 

6769
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:45,350
all the time in the world
is it only just a matter of time at this

6770
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:45,360
is it only just a matter of time at this
 

6771
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:47,569
is it only just a matter of time at this
point in situations like this yeah John

6772
02:13:47,569 --> 02:13:47,579

6775
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:51,890
Carter has a massive tactical lead and
points there's literally no way he could

6776
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:51,900
points there's literally no way he could
 

6777
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,990
points there's literally no way he could
lose this match at this point

6778
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:54,000
lose this match at this point
 

6779
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,490
lose this match at this point
um even if his opponent did get out of

6780
02:13:55,490 --> 02:13:55,500
um even if his opponent did get out of
 

6781
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:56,870
um even if his opponent did get out of
here and take him down

6782
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:56,880
here and take him down
 

6783

John Carter would still be a hit on

6784
02:13:58,609 --> 02:13:58,619
John Carter would still be a hit on
 

6785
02:13:58,619 --> 02:14:01,310
John Carter would still be a hit on
points

6786
02:14:01,310 --> 02:14:01,320

 

6787
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:04,250

so at this question the question now is

6788
02:14:04,250 --> 02:14:04,260
so at this question the question now is
 

6789
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:05,990
so at this question the question now is
not whether John Carter will get the

6790
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,000
not whether John Carter will get the
 

6791
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,729
not whether John Carter will get the
gold medal but whether John Carter will

6792
02:14:07,729 --> 02:14:07,739
gold medal but whether John Carter will
 

6793
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:09,709
gold medal but whether John Carter will
will get it by submission and there it

6794
02:14:09,709 --> 02:14:09,719
will get it by submission and there it
 

6795
02:14:09,719 --> 02:14:11,169
will get it by submission and there it
is there's the penetration of the neck

6796
02:14:11,169 --> 02:14:11,179
is there's the penetration of the neck
 

6797
02:14:11,179 --> 02:14:13,729
is there's the penetration of the neck
and he can't get the figure four so he

6798
02:14:13,729 --> 02:14:13,739
and he can't get the figure four so he
 

6799
02:14:13,739 --> 02:14:15,410
and he can't get the figure four so he
asks for Palms Apartment instead and

6800

I think technically uh Gary perhaps got

6878
02:16:00,290 --> 02:16:00,300
I think technically uh Gary perhaps got
 

6879
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,330
I think technically uh Gary perhaps got
a little far away from

6880
02:16:02,330 --> 02:16:02,340
a little far away from
 

6881
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:03,950
a little far away from
uh

6882
02:16:03,950 --> 02:16:03,960
uh
 

6883
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,990
uh
his true nature and grappling which is

6884
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:06,000
his true nature and grappling which is
 

6885
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,770
his true nature and grappling which is
Relentless submission attack and perhaps

6886
02:16:08,770 --> 02:16:08,780
Relentless submission attack and perhaps
 

6887
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:11,270
Relentless submission attack and perhaps
uh I should be

6888
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:11,280
uh I should be
 

6889
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,010
uh I should be
given blame for this because they put

6890
02:16:13,010 --> 02:16:13,020
given blame for this because they put
 

6891
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:14,930
given blame for this because they put
such a heavy emphasis on the in the

6892
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:14,940
such a heavy emphasis on the in the
 

6893
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:17,390
such a heavy emphasis on the in the
training camp overall on positional

6894
02:16:17,390 --> 02:16:17,400
training camp overall on positional
 

6895
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,550
training camp overall on positional
pressure that I feel that worked very

6896
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:19,560
pressure that I feel that worked very
 

6897
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:21,350
pressure that I feel that worked very
well for all of the athletes except Gary

6898
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,360
well for all of the athletes except Gary
 

6899
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:25,129
well for all of the athletes except Gary
tonan and um interesting so his his name

6900
02:16:25,129 --> 02:16:25,139
tonan and um interesting so his his name
 

6901
02:16:25,139 --> 02:16:26,689
tonan and um interesting so his his name
you have to acknowledge the nature of

6902
02:16:26,689 --> 02:16:26,699
you have to acknowledge the nature of
 

6903
02:16:26,699 --> 02:16:28,850
you have to acknowledge the nature of
the athletes part and I think I was

6904
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:28,860
the athletes part and I think I was
 

6905
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:30,950
the athletes part and I think I was
coaching so hard to the to the new

6906
02:16:30,950 --> 02:16:30,960
coaching so hard to the to the new
 

6907
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,389
coaching so hard to the to the new
people in the room on positional

6908
02:16:32,389 --> 02:16:32,399
people in the room on positional
 

6909
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:35,690
people in the room on positional
pressure that I neglected Gary's uh

6910
02:16:35,690 --> 02:16:35,700
pressure that I neglected Gary's uh
 

6911
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:38,209
pressure that I neglected Gary's uh
innate ability to it the fact that he

6912
02:16:38,209 --> 02:16:38,219
innate ability to it the fact that he
 

6913
02:16:38,219 --> 02:16:40,849
innate ability to it the fact that he
does best when he um attacks exclusively

6914
02:16:40,849 --> 02:16:40,859
does best when he um attacks exclusively
 

6915
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:43,429
does best when he um attacks exclusively
by submission so I think if if anyone

6916
02:16:43,429 --> 02:16:43,439
by submission so I think if if anyone
 

6917
02:16:43,439 --> 02:16:45,110
by submission so I think if if anyone
should get blamed for the failure here

6918
02:16:45,110 --> 02:16:45,120
should get blamed for the failure here
 

6919
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:47,450
should get blamed for the failure here
it should be me uh there's another

6920
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:47,460
it should be me uh there's another
 

6921
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:53,270
it should be me uh there's another
comment as uh maybe I'm over

6922
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:53,280

 

6923
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,310

um

6924
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:54,320
um
 

6925
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:56,270
um
overvaluing that sort of just the

6926
02:16:56,270 --> 02:16:56,280
overvaluing that sort of just the
 

6927
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:58,429
overvaluing that sort of just the
physical aspect of this but it seemed

6928
02:16:58,429 --> 02:16:58,439
physical aspect of this but it seemed
 

6929
02:16:58,439 --> 02:17:01,009
physical aspect of this but it seemed
like Gary was looked skinny is is the

6930
02:17:01,009 --> 02:17:01,019
like Gary was looked skinny is is the
 

6931
02:17:01,019 --> 02:17:02,810
like Gary was looked skinny is is the
weight cut yeah he

6937
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:10,549
down to the uh 66 kilos so
um you know it wasn't critical these

6938
02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:10,559
um you know it wasn't critical these
 

6939
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:12,349
um you know it wasn't critical these
other guys who were bigger than him who

6940
02:17:12,349 --> 02:17:12,359
other guys who were bigger than him who
 

6941

um but the weight cut if you can just
 

6945

um but the weight cut if you can just
comment on is that does that ever play a

part in the athletes the the physical
and the mental aspect of the weight cut

6950
02:17:22,849 --> 02:17:22,859
and the mental aspect of the weight cut
 

6951
02:17:22,859 --> 02:17:25,549
and the mental aspect of the weight cut
it is it is a thing can wrestling That

6958
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:31,920
that would break someone like Garrett's
 

6959
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:34,490
that would break someone like Garrett's
owner and it was it's more physical you

6960
02:17:34,490 --> 02:17:34,500
owner and it was it's more physical you
 

6961
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:37,129
owner and it was it's more physical you
you train lighter and weaker you tend to

6962
02:17:37,129 --> 02:17:37,139
you train lighter and weaker you tend to
 

6963
02:17:37,139 --> 02:17:38,389
you train lighter and weaker you tend to
get injured more in Camp because you're

6964
02:17:38,389 --> 02:17:38,399
get injured more in Camp because you're
 

6965
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:40,009
get injured more in Camp because you're
lighter

6966
02:17:40,009 --> 02:17:40,019
lighter
 

6967
02:17:40,019 --> 02:17:42,950
lighter
um we have a team now after the breakout

6968
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
um we have a team now after the breakout
 

6969
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:45,110
um we have a team now after the breakout
that's mostly comprised of people over

6970
02:17:45,110 --> 02:17:45,120
that's mostly comprised of people over
 

6971
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:49,310
that's mostly comprised of people over
215 pounds so um uh there's very few

6972
02:17:49,310 --> 02:17:49,320
215 pounds so um uh there's very few
 

6973
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:51,049
215 pounds so um uh there's very few
small people left in the gym most of the

6974
02:17:51,049 --> 02:17:51,059
small people left in the gym most of the
 

6975
02:17:51,059 --> 02:17:55,310
small people left in the gym most of the
smaller athletes went uh to B team so

6976
02:17:55,310 --> 02:17:55,320
smaller athletes went uh to B team so
 

6977
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:57,169
smaller athletes went uh to B team so
um uh Gary's been struggling a little

6978
02:17:57,169 --> 02:17:57,179
um uh Gary's been struggling a little
 

6979
02:17:57,179 --> 02:18:00,250
um uh Gary's been struggling a little
bit with with training partners and um

6980
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:00,260
bit with with training partners and um
 

6981
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:02,870
bit with with training partners and um
uh but here I think the chief problem

6982
02:18:02,870 --> 02:18:02,880
uh but here I think the chief problem
 

6983
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:06,589
uh but here I think the chief problem
was that uh Gary focused perhaps a

6984
02:18:06,589 --> 02:18:06,599
was that uh Gary focused perhaps a
 

6985
02:18:06,599 --> 02:18:08,629
was that uh Gary focused perhaps a
little too much on the positional

6986
02:18:08,629 --> 02:18:08,639
little too much on the positional
 

6987
02:18:08,639 --> 02:18:11,209
little too much on the positional
tactical game and got away from his his

6988
02:18:11,209 --> 02:18:11,219
tactical game and got away from his his
 

6989
02:18:11,219 --> 02:18:14,209
tactical game and got away from his his
true gift which is uh uh Relentless

6990
02:18:14,209 --> 02:18:14,219
true gift which is uh uh Relentless
 

6991
02:18:14,219 --> 02:18:16,610

hunting for submissions and as I said I

6992
02:18:16,610 --> 02:18:16,620
hunting for submissions and as I said I
 

6993
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:18,110
hunting for submissions and as I said I
think the person to blame for that is me

6994
02:18:18,110 --> 02:18:18,120
think the person to blame for that is me
 

6995
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:20,030
think the person to blame for that is me
because I put I had to put so much

6996
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:20,040
because I put I had to put so much
 

6997

movement
 

7067
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:49,070
movement
in order to create opportunity so one is

7068

in order to create opportunity so one is
 

7069
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:51,710
in order to create opportunity so one is
based more on movement as the the source

7070

of opportunity one is based more upon
pressure as the source of opportunity so

7074

Gary's uh um slipped up with his
considerable braking pressures oh it

7270
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:34,140
considerable braking pressures oh it
 

7271
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:36,349
considerable braking pressures oh it
slipped yeah yeah it's unclear even

slipped yeah yeah it's unclear even
 

7273
02:23:36,359 --> 02:23:38,090
slipped yeah yeah it's unclear even
before but sometimes the heel can slip

7274
02:23:38,090 --> 02:23:38,100
before but sometimes the heel can slip
 

7275
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:41,210
before but sometimes the heel can slip
because it's because something's popped

7276
02:23:41,210 --> 02:23:41,220
because it's because something's popped
 

7277
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:43,309
because it's because something's popped
so it's unclear what happened there

7278
02:23:43,309 --> 02:23:43,319
so it's unclear what happened there
 

7279

so it's unclear what happened there
there seems to be a reaction from the

there seems to be a reaction from the
 

7281
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:46,969
there seems to be a reaction from the
part of the opponent like it definitely

7282
02:23:46,969 --> 02:23:46,979
part of the opponent like it definitely
 

7283
02:23:46,979 --> 02:23:49,250
part of the opponent like it definitely
did some damage so Gary goes back for a

did some damage so Gary goes back for a
 

7285
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:52,490
did some damage so Gary goes back for a
second one oh no and again you get that

7286
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:52,500
second one oh no and again you get that
 

7287
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:55,670
second one oh no and again you get that
same kind of pressure oh no oh right but

internal fortitude and um but now Gary
 

7301
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:10,910
internal fortitude and um but now Gary
knows he's lost it so it there's a

7302
02:24:10,910 --> 02:24:10,920
knows he's lost it so it there's a
 

7303
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:13,010
knows he's lost it so it there's a
sensor in which you you see how

7304
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:13,020
sensor in which you you see how
 

7305
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:15,050
sensor in which you you see how
close it gets in these situations how

7306
02:24:15,050 --> 02:24:15,060
close it gets in these situations how
 

7307
02:24:15,060 --> 02:24:16,730
close it gets in these situations how
little there is between winner and loser

7308
02:24:16,730 --> 02:24:16,740
little there is between winner and loser
 

7309
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:18,170
little there is between winner and loser
and sometimes you just get these

7310
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:18,180
and sometimes you just get these
 

7311
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:19,450
and sometimes you just get these
heartbreaking

7312
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:19,460
heartbreaking
 

7313
02:24:19,460 --> 02:24:22,670

to tap
 

7393
02:25:54,359 --> 02:25:56,750
to tap
um I also think that if you're in a

7394
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:56,760
um I also think that if you're in a
 

7395
02:25:56,760 --> 02:25:58,490
um I also think that if you're in a
Stranglehold it doesn't make a lot of

7396
02:25:58,490 --> 02:25:58,500
Stranglehold it doesn't make a lot of
 

7397
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:00,770
Stranglehold it doesn't make a lot of
sense and not tapping because you're

7398
02:26:00,770 --> 02:26:00,780
sense and not tapping because you're
 

7399
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:02,929
sense and not tapping because you're
gonna pass out and

7400
02:26:02,929 --> 02:26:02,939
gonna pass out and
 

7401
02:26:02,939 --> 02:26:06,830
gonna pass out and
like it's like you said in cheers it's

7402
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:06,840
like it's like you said in cheers it's
 

7403
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:09,650
like it's like you said in cheers it's
kind of impolite to make the guy take it

7404
02:26:09,650 --> 02:26:09,660
kind of impolite to make the guy take it
 

7405
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:12,050
kind of impolite to make the guy take it
through to its conclusion so um I don't

7406
02:26:12,050 --> 02:26:12,060
through to its conclusion so um I don't
 

7407
02:26:12,060 --> 02:26:15,170
through to its conclusion so um I don't
see any heroism and and just letting

7408
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:15,180
see any heroism and and just letting
 

7409
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:17,030
see any heroism and and just letting
yourself pass out

7410
02:26:17,030 --> 02:26:17,040
yourself pass out
 

7411
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:19,070
yourself pass out
um now things change when you get into a

02:26:19,070 --> 02:26:19,080
um now things change when you get into a
 

7413
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:20,150
um now things change when you get into a
final

if you're in a final and you're hit on
 

7417
02:26:23,399 --> 02:26:25,190
if you're in a final and you're hit on
points and

you're willing to
for most people at that point are going

7422
02:26:30,050 --> 02:26:30,060
for most people at that point are going
 

7423
02:26:30,060 --> 02:26:31,730
for most people at that point are going

at that point I leave it up to the
 

7429
02:26:35,580 --> 02:26:36,410
at that point I leave it up to the

mature enough to make up their own minds
 

7443
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:52,130
mature enough to make up their own minds
uh I would be angry if they let their

uh I would be angry if they let their
 

7445
02:26:52,140 --> 02:26:55,670
uh I would be angry if they let their
bodies break in a meaningless fashion in

there's no way you could go on to to the
 

7453
02:27:02,340 --> 02:27:04,730
there's no way you could go on to to the
second third and fourth matches with it

7454
02:27:04,730 --> 02:27:04,740
second third and fourth matches with it
 

7455

with a broken limb
 

7457
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:10,309

in 80cc I would leave the decision to

7460
02:27:13,130 --> 02:27:13,140
in 80cc I would leave the decision to
 

7461
02:27:13,140 --> 02:27:14,990
in 80cc I would leave the decision to
them a spontaneous decision in the

7462
02:27:14,990 --> 02:27:15,000
them a spontaneous decision in the
 

7463
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,790
them a spontaneous decision in the
moment I would be confident that I had

7464
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:16,800
moment I would be confident that I had
 

7465
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:18,590
moment I would be confident that I had
prepared them to do their very best to

7466
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:18,600
prepared them to do their very best to
 

7467
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,929
prepared them to do their very best to
defend themselves

7468
02:27:20,929 --> 02:27:20,939
defend themselves
 

7469
02:27:20,939 --> 02:27:23,389
defend themselves
um but what ultimately they do is their

7470
02:27:23,389 --> 02:27:23,399
um but what ultimately they do is their
 

7471
02:27:23,399 --> 02:27:25,309
um but what ultimately they do is their
decision and

7472
02:27:25,309 --> 02:27:25,319
decision and
 

7473
02:27:25,319 --> 02:27:28,250
decision and
winning ADCC is for a grip or at least

7474
02:27:28,250 --> 02:27:28,260
winning ADCC is for a grip or at least
 

7475
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:29,990

7479
02:27:32,340 --> 02:27:36,050
forever and no one can ever take that
moment away from you so I would

7480
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:36,060
moment away from you so I would
 

7481
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:37,910
moment away from you so I would
I would understand if they took a

7482
02:27:37,910 --> 02:27:37,920
I would understand if they took a
 

7483
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:40,010
I would understand if they took a
decision to take damage hopefully it

7484
02:27:40,010 --> 02:27:40,020
decision to take damage hopefully it
 

7485
02:27:40,020 --> 02:27:41,389
decision to take damage hopefully it
will never come to that because they do

7486
02:27:41,389 --> 02:27:41,399
will never come to that because they do
 

7487
02:27:41,399 --> 02:27:42,889
will never come to that because they do
a good job of Preparing People to get

02:27:42,889 --> 02:27:42,899
a good job of Preparing People to get
 

7489
02:27:42,899 --> 02:27:44,929
a good job of Preparing People to get
out of situations as he saw with Gary

02:27:44,929 --> 02:27:44,939
out of situations as he saw with Gary
 

7491
02:27:44,939 --> 02:27:47,030
out of situations as he saw with Gary
Turner who was in a dreadful situation

7492
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:47,040
Turner who was in a dreadful situation
 

7493
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,849
Turner who was in a dreadful situation
and got out within five seconds okay so

and got out within five seconds okay so
 

7495
02:27:49,859 --> 02:27:52,730
and got out within five seconds okay so
um uh Gary's been in arm locks that

7496
02:27:52,730 --> 02:27:52,740
um uh Gary's been in arm locks that
 

7497
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:54,349
um uh Gary's been in arm locks that
looked like even I was in the corner

7498
02:27:54,349 --> 02:27:54,359
looked like even I was in the corner
 

7499
02:27:54,359 --> 02:27:55,910
looked like even I was in the corner
going like oh my God what is happening

7500
02:27:55,910 --> 02:27:55,920
going like oh my God what is happening

going like oh my God what is happening
here and still got out so uh it comes

7502
02:27:58,969 --> 02:27:58,979
here and still got out so uh it comes
 

7503
02:27:58,979 --> 02:28:01,429
here and still got out so uh it comes
down to training preparation but if they

7504
02:28:01,429 --> 02:28:01,439
down to training preparation but if they
 

7505
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:03,410
down to training preparation but if they
did make that decision I would

7506
02:28:03,410 --> 02:28:03,420
did make that decision I would
 

7507
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:06,050
did make that decision I would
understand provided it was a situation

7508
02:28:06,050 --> 02:28:06,060
understand provided it was a situation
 

7509
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:08,570
understand provided it was a situation
that would make their lives better and

7510
02:28:08,570 --> 02:28:08,580
that would make their lives better and
 

7511
02:28:08,580 --> 02:28:10,370
that would make their lives better and
they made a calculation it's not an

7512
02:28:10,370 --> 02:28:10,380
they made a calculation it's not an
 

7513
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:13,070
they made a calculation it's not an
emotional thing now sometimes you get

7514
02:28:13,070 --> 02:28:13,080
emotional thing now sometimes you get
 

7515
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:14,630
emotional thing now sometimes you get
emotional you fight a guy you just don't

7516
02:28:14,630 --> 02:28:14,640
emotional you fight a guy you just don't
 

7517
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:16,429
emotional you fight a guy you just don't
like and you just don't want to tap to

7518
02:28:16,429 --> 02:28:16,439
like and you just don't want to tap to
 

7519
02:28:16,439 --> 02:28:17,630
like and you just don't want to tap to
them

7520
02:28:17,630 --> 02:28:17,640
them
 

7521
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:18,309
them
um

7522
02:28:18,309 --> 02:28:18,319
um
 

7523
02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:20,750
um
then things get a little more

7524
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:20,760
then things get a little more
 

7525
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:22,969
then things get a little more
interesting I then

7526
02:28:22,969 --> 02:28:22,979
interesting I then
 

7527
02:28:22,979 --> 02:28:25,130
interesting I then
again it's a personal decision if you

7528
02:28:25,130 --> 02:28:25,140
again it's a personal decision if you
 

7529
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:26,870
again it's a personal decision if you
hate someone so much that you literally

7530
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:26,880
hate someone so much that you literally
 

7531
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:28,130
hate someone so much that you literally
can't even conceive of yourself

7532
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:28,140
can't even conceive of yourself
 

7533
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:30,290
can't even conceive of yourself
submitting to them

7534
02:28:30,290 --> 02:28:30,300
submitting to them
 

7535
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:31,969
submitting to them
probably best you don't get into matches

7536
02:28:31,969 --> 02:28:31,979
probably best you don't get into matches
 

7537
02:28:31,979 --> 02:28:33,889
probably best you don't get into matches
with them in the first place

7538
02:28:33,889 --> 02:28:33,899
with them in the first place
 

7539
02:28:33,899 --> 02:28:36,410
with them in the first place
um but if it should happen

7540
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:36,420
um but if it should happen
 

7541
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:38,210
um but if it should happen
um again it comes down to the student I

7542
02:28:38,210 --> 02:28:38,220
um again it comes down to the student I
 

7543
02:28:38,220 --> 02:28:41,690
um again it comes down to the student I
teach technique not morals so I let

7544
02:28:41,690 --> 02:28:41,700
teach technique not morals so I let
 

7545
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:43,250
teach technique not morals so I let
people make their own decisions on that

7546
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:43,260
people make their own decisions on that
 

7547
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:45,170
people make their own decisions on that
my thing is look don't get injured

7548
02:28:45,170 --> 02:28:45,180
my thing is look don't get injured
 

7549
02:28:45,180 --> 02:28:46,070
my thing is look don't get injured
because if you're injured you can't

7550
02:28:46,070 --> 02:28:46,080
because if you're injured you can't
 

7551
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:47,450
because if you're injured you can't
train you can't train you can't get

7552
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:47,460
train you can't train you can't get
 

7553
02:28:47,460 --> 02:28:49,849
train you can't train you can't get
better so stay away from injury as much

7554
02:28:49,849 --> 02:28:49,859
better so stay away from injury as much
 

7555
02:28:49,859 --> 02:28:51,230
better so stay away from injury as much
as you can

7813
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:49,190
silver medal he wanted two goals he got
a gold and a silver and there's a sense

7814
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:49,200
a gold and a silver and there's a sense
 

7815
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:52,790
a gold and a silver and there's a sense
in which the sheer audaciousness of of

in which the sheer audaciousness of of
 

7817

in which the sheer audaciousness of of
the goal set

the goal set
 

7819
02:33:55,020 --> 02:33:57,110
the goal set
seemed ludicrous when it first happened

7820
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:57,120
seemed ludicrous when it first happened
 

7821
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:59,990
seemed ludicrous when it first happened
as they say this is this is insanity and

7822
02:33:59,990 --> 02:34:00,000
as they say this is this is insanity and
 

7823
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,090
as they say this is this is insanity and
yet he came at it with a plan he came at

7824
02:34:02,090 --> 02:34:02,100
yet he came at it with a plan he came at
 

7825
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:03,770
yet he came at it with a plan he came at
it with his characteristic passion and

7826
02:34:03,770 --> 02:34:03,780
it with his characteristic passion and
 

7827
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:06,349
it with his characteristic passion and
hard work and came within inches of

7828
02:34:06,349 --> 02:34:06,359
hard work and came within inches of
 

7829
02:34:06,359 --> 02:34:09,050
hard work and came within inches of
doing so and there's a sense in which

7830
02:34:09,050 --> 02:34:09,060
doing so and there's a sense in which
 

7831
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,150
doing so and there's a sense in which
you could look at it as oh he had a plan

7832
02:34:11,150 --> 02:34:11,160
you could look at it as oh he had a plan
 

7833
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:12,590
you could look at it as oh he had a plan
and it failed

7834
02:34:12,590 --> 02:34:12,600
and it failed
 

7835
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:14,990
and it failed
and yet of course no one in their right

7836

and yet of course no one in their right
 

7837
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,030
and yet of course no one in their right
mind would look at it that was he set on

7838
02:34:17,030 --> 02:34:17,040
mind would look at it that was he set on
 

7839
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:19,309
mind would look at it that was he set on
audacious goal so high that it seemed

7840
02:34:19,309 --> 02:34:19,319
audacious goal so high that it seemed
 

7841
02:34:19,319 --> 02:34:21,650
audacious goal so high that it seemed
impossible and it pulled his entire

7842
02:34:21,650 --> 02:34:21,660
impossible and it pulled his entire
 

7843
02:34:21,660 --> 02:34:23,809
impossible and it pulled his entire
performance up to a level where even

7844
02:34:23,809 --> 02:34:23,819
performance up to a level where even
 

7845
02:34:23,819 --> 02:34:25,790
performance up to a level where even
failure creates something truly

7846
02:34:25,790 --> 02:34:25,800
failure creates something truly
 

7847
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:30,110

forget athletes human nature yeah that's
a great question

7856
02:34:39,530 --> 02:34:39,540
a great question
 

7857
02:34:39,540 --> 02:34:42,290
a great question
um there's a sense in which you know you

7858
02:34:42,290 --> 02:34:42,300
um there's a sense in which you know you
 

7859
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:44,030
um there's a sense in which you know you
don't want to make people delusional

7860

if people are sufficiently
 

7865
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:53,330
if people are sufficiently
embedded in a given project if they're

7866
02:34:53,330 --> 02:34:53,340
embedded in a given project if they're
 

7867
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:56,150
embedded in a given project if they're
committed to it to a certain degree

7868
02:34:56,150 --> 02:34:56,160
committed to it to a certain degree
 

7869
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:58,070
committed to it to a certain degree

otherwise be a perfect year
um even that

7892
02:35:23,090 --> 02:35:23,100
um even that
 

7893
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:27,469
um even that
still creates such a massive uh uptick

7894
02:35:27,469 --> 02:35:27,479
still creates such a massive uh uptick
 

7895
02:35:27,479 --> 02:35:30,469
still creates such a massive uh uptick
in your performance that it's absolutely

7896
02:35:30,469 --> 02:35:30,479
in your performance that it's absolutely
 

7897
02:35:30,479 --> 02:35:32,929
in your performance that it's absolutely
the right way to go but there is a

7898
02:35:32,929 --> 02:35:32,939
the right way to go but there is a
 

7899
02:35:32,939 --> 02:35:34,730
the right way to go but there is a
danger to this where people aren't

7900
02:35:34,730 --> 02:35:34,740
danger to this where people aren't
 

7901
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:36,950
danger to this where people aren't
committed and simply aren't working from

7902
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:36,960
committed and simply aren't working from
 

7903
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:39,650
committed and simply aren't working from
a framework where they can realistically

7904
02:35:39,650 --> 02:35:39,660
a framework where they can realistically
 

7905
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:42,170
a framework where they can realistically
achieve these things then it descends

7906
02:35:42,170 --> 02:35:42,180
achieve these things then it descends
 

7907
02:35:42,180 --> 02:35:44,030
achieve these things then it descends
into delusion and that that direction

7908
02:35:44,030 --> 02:35:44,040
into delusion and that that direction
 

7909
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:45,889
into delusion and that that direction
goes towards Madness you can't have that

7910
02:35:45,889 --> 02:35:45,899
goes towards Madness you can't have that
 

7911
02:35:45,899 --> 02:35:48,230
goes towards Madness you can't have that
so there has to be

7912
02:35:48,230 --> 02:35:48,240
so there has to be
 

7913
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:50,270
so there has to be
some kind of reality check here where

7914
02:35:50,270 --> 02:35:50,280
some kind of reality check here where
 

7915
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:51,730
some kind of reality check here where
you have to be

7916
02:35:51,730 --> 02:35:51,740
you have to be
 

7917
02:35:51,740 --> 02:35:56,210
you have to be
uh uh physically and mentally capable to

7918
02:35:56,210 --> 02:35:56,220
uh uh physically and mentally capable to
 

7919
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:58,130
uh uh physically and mentally capable to
some degree of moving towards these

7920
02:35:58,130 --> 02:35:58,140
some degree of moving towards these
 

7921
02:35:58,140 --> 02:36:00,889
some degree of moving towards these
goals you can't just you know uh a

7922
02:36:00,889 --> 02:36:00,899
goals you can't just you know uh a
 

7923
02:36:00,899 --> 02:36:02,809
goals you can't just you know uh a
random blue but can't make audacious

7924
02:36:02,809 --> 02:36:02,819
random blue but can't make audacious
 

7925
02:36:02,819 --> 02:36:05,690
random blue but can't make audacious
calls like that it's just ludicrous but

7926
02:36:05,690 --> 02:36:05,700
calls like that it's just ludicrous but
 

7927
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:07,370
calls like that it's just ludicrous but
um

7928
02:36:07,370 --> 02:36:07,380
um
 

7929
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:10,010
um
with with that in mind if if you're

7930
02:36:10,010 --> 02:36:10,020
with with that in mind if if you're
 

7931
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:12,469
with with that in mind if if you're
committed and and you there's a sense in

7932
02:36:12,469 --> 02:36:12,479
committed and and you there's a sense in
 

7933
02:36:12,479 --> 02:36:15,230
committed and and you there's a sense in
which this is a definite possibility set

7934
02:36:15,230 --> 02:36:15,240
which this is a definite possibility set
 

7935
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:17,809
which this is a definite possibility set
your goals high okay make big demands

7936
02:36:17,809 --> 02:36:17,819
your goals high okay make big demands
 

7937
02:36:17,819 --> 02:36:19,490
your goals high okay make big demands
yes there'll be times of frustration

7938
02:36:19,490 --> 02:36:19,500
yes there'll be times of frustration
 

7939
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:21,410
yes there'll be times of frustration
there'll be more failure in your life

7940
02:36:21,410 --> 02:36:21,420
there'll be more failure in your life
 

7941
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:23,150
there'll be more failure in your life
than otherwise but even your failures

7942
02:36:23,150 --> 02:36:23,160
than otherwise but even your failures
 

7943
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:24,889
than otherwise but even your failures
will be something great something

7944
02:36:24,889 --> 02:36:24,899
will be something great something
 

7945
02:36:24,899 --> 02:36:28,130
will be something great something
memorable see but in the near term

7946
02:36:28,130 --> 02:36:28,140
memorable see but in the near term
 

7947
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:30,650
memorable see but in the near term
you would be hard-pressed to find any

7948
02:36:30,650 --> 02:36:30,660
you would be hard-pressed to find any
 

7949
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:34,010
you would be hard-pressed to find any
data that justifies that goal because in

7950
02:36:34,010 --> 02:36:34,020
data that justifies that goal because in
 

7951
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:36,349
data that justifies that goal because in
his case he he probably wasn't very good

7952
02:36:36,349 --> 02:36:36,359
his case he he probably wasn't very good
 

7953
02:36:36,359 --> 02:36:39,110
his case he he probably wasn't very good
in nogi in the even in the training room

7954
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,120
in nogi in the even in the training room
 

7955
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:43,130
in nogi in the even in the training room
so it's like where do you look for even

7956
02:36:43,130 --> 02:36:43,140
so it's like where do you look for even
 

7957
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:45,950
so it's like where do you look for even
inklings of hope uh we saw it in

7958
02:36:45,950 --> 02:36:45,960
inklings of hope uh we saw it in
 

7959
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:47,929
inklings of hope uh we saw it in
incremental progress with each

7960
02:36:47,929 --> 02:36:47,939
incremental progress with each
 

7961
02:36:47,939 --> 02:36:50,570
incremental progress with each
successive competition that he was in

7962
02:36:50,570 --> 02:36:50,580
successive competition that he was in
 

7963
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:54,050
successive competition that he was in
um his first competition uh uh he looked

7964
02:36:54,050 --> 02:36:54,060
um his first competition uh uh he looked
 

7965
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:57,230
um his first competition uh uh he looked
good but not great second competition a

7966
02:36:57,230 --> 02:36:57,240
good but not great second competition a
 

7967
02:36:57,240 --> 02:36:59,570
good but not great second competition a
little better third competition took on

7968
02:36:59,570 --> 02:36:59,580
little better third competition took on
 

7969
02:36:59,580 --> 02:37:01,250
little better third competition took on
one of the legends of

7970
02:37:01,250 --> 02:37:01,260
one of the legends of
 

7971
02:37:01,260 --> 02:37:03,889
one of the legends of
uh American grappling and won decisively

7972
02:37:03,889 --> 02:37:03,899
uh American grappling and won decisively
 

7973
02:37:03,899 --> 02:37:05,450
uh American grappling and won decisively
so there was a sense in which it was

7974
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:05,460
so there was a sense in which it was
 

7975
02:37:05,460 --> 02:37:08,630
so there was a sense in which it was
becoming more realistic with each outing

7976
02:37:08,630 --> 02:37:08,640
becoming more realistic with each outing
 

7977
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:11,090
becoming more realistic with each outing
so now now putting that inspiring

7978
02:37:11,090 --> 02:37:11,100
so now now putting that inspiring
 

7979
02:37:11,100 --> 02:37:13,070
so now now putting that inspiring

plan on how to make it happen so the leg

7982
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:16,560
plan on how to make it happen so the leg
 

7983
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:18,290
plan on how to make it happen so the leg
locks thirsty with the same thing with

John Carla first you got to learn how to

02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:19,680
John Carla first you got to learn how to
 

7987
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:21,650
John Carla first you got to learn how to
defend a Lego up so

7988
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:21,660
defend a Lego up so
 

7989
02:37:21,660 --> 02:37:22,270
defend a Lego up so
um

7990
02:37:22,270 --> 02:37:22,280
um
 

7991
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:25,550
um
uh initially just as John Carlos

7992
02:37:25,550 --> 02:37:25,560
uh initially just as John Carlos
 

7993
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:28,490
uh initially just as John Carlos
struggled he struggled uh then he had to

7994
02:37:28,490 --> 02:37:28,500
struggled he struggled uh then he had to
 

7995
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:29,210
struggled he struggled uh then he had to
learn

7996
02:37:29,210 --> 02:37:29,220
learn
 

7997
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:31,490
learn
not just takedowns but just how to set

7998
02:37:31,490 --> 02:37:31,500
not just takedowns but just how to set
 

7999
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:33,469
not just takedowns but just how to set
up a teacher I had to learn Basics like

8000
02:37:33,469 --> 02:37:33,479
up a teacher I had to learn Basics like
 

8001
02:37:33,479 --> 02:37:35,750
up a teacher I had to learn Basics like
stance and motion and how to fight with

8002

8003
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:38,090
stance and motion and how to fight with
the hands etc etc so he had to learn

8004
02:37:38,090 --> 02:37:38,100
the hands etc etc so he had to learn
 

8005
02:37:38,100 --> 02:37:40,790
the hands etc etc so he had to learn
from the ground up and

8006
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:40,800
from the ground up and
 

8007
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:42,830
from the ground up and
um uh

8008
02:37:42,830 --> 02:37:42,840
um uh
 

8009
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:45,170
um uh
then he had to improve he always had a

arm bar those were his two strengths

8014
02:37:48,650 --> 02:37:48,660
arm bar those were his two strengths
 

8015
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:50,990

great collar strangles on the back but
he really really struggled with

8028
02:38:02,150 --> 02:38:02,160
he really really struggled with
 

8029
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:05,030
he really really struggled with
finishing people from the back so

8030
02:38:05,030 --> 02:38:05,040
finishing people from the back so
 

8031
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:08,030
finishing people from the back so
um he's learning all this and then he's

8032
02:38:08,030 --> 02:38:08,040
um he's learning all this and then he's
 

8033
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:09,410
um he's learning all this and then he's
like well now I've got to get ready for

8034
02:38:09,410 --> 02:38:09,420
like well now I've got to get ready for
 

8035
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:11,570
like well now I've got to get ready for
the ghee so we had to switch his

8036
02:38:11,570 --> 02:38:11,580
the ghee so we had to switch his
 

8037
02:38:11,580 --> 02:38:14,809
the ghee so we had to switch his
training to ghee training and uh that

8038
02:38:14,809 --> 02:38:14,819
training to ghee training and uh that
 

8039
02:38:14,819 --> 02:38:16,490
training to ghee training and uh that
took out a couple of months then he got

02:38:16,500 --> 02:38:18,469
took out a couple of months then he got
he went back briefly to Brazil and got a

he went back briefly to Brazil and got a
 

8043
02:38:18,479 --> 02:38:20,870
he went back briefly to Brazil and got a
terrible rib injury right before the

02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:49,910
jiu jitsu
started Jujitsu as adults I was 28 years

8364
02:44:49,910 --> 02:44:49,920
started Jujitsu as adults I was 28 years
 

8365
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:51,650
started Jujitsu as adults I was 28 years
old when I've had my first lesson as a

8366
02:44:51,650 --> 02:44:51,660
old when I've had my first lesson as a
 

8367
02:44:51,660 --> 02:44:54,309
old when I've had my first lesson as a
white belt so

8368
02:44:54,309 --> 02:44:54,319
white belt so
 

8369
02:44:54,319 --> 02:44:56,750
white belt so
in time people got a little younger for

8370
02:44:56,750 --> 02:44:56,760
in time people got a little younger for
 

8371
02:44:56,760 --> 02:44:58,370
in time people got a little younger for
example Nikki Ryan started when I think

8372
02:44:58,370 --> 02:44:58,380
example Nikki Ryan started when I think
 

8373
02:44:58,380 --> 02:45:01,210
example Nikki Ryan started when I think
when he was 12 but

8374
02:45:01,210 --> 02:45:01,220
when he was 12 but
 

8375
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:03,530
when he was 12 but
the rule told us started when they were

8376
02:45:03,530 --> 02:45:03,540
the rule told us started when they were
 

8377
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:05,750
the rule told us started when they were
literally children they had excellent

8378
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:05,760
literally children they had excellent
 

8379
02:45:05,760 --> 02:45:07,250
literally children they had excellent
coaching going all the way up through

8380
02:45:07,250 --> 02:45:07,260
coaching going all the way up through
 

8381
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:09,490
coaching going all the way up through
into their teenage years

8382
02:45:09,490 --> 02:45:09,500
into their teenage years
 

8383
02:45:09,500 --> 02:45:12,889
into their teenage years
so they had the advantage of of starting

8384
02:45:12,889 --> 02:45:12,899
so they had the advantage of of starting
 

8385
02:45:12,899 --> 02:45:15,469
so they had the advantage of of starting
the way so many successful athletes do

8386
02:45:15,469 --> 02:45:15,479
the way so many successful athletes do
 

8387
02:45:15,479 --> 02:45:19,090
the way so many successful athletes do
as as children and going up through uh

8388
02:45:19,090 --> 02:45:19,100
as as children and going up through uh
 

8389
02:45:19,100 --> 02:45:22,130
as as children and going up through uh
adulthood and with strong coaching all

8390
02:45:22,130 --> 02:45:22,140
adulthood and with strong coaching all
 

8391
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:24,230
adulthood and with strong coaching all
along the way excellent parental support

8392
02:45:24,230 --> 02:45:24,240
along the way excellent parental support
 

8393
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:28,309
along the way excellent parental support
so they had like a great history where

8394
02:45:28,309 --> 02:45:28,319
so they had like a great history where
 

8395
02:45:28,319 --> 02:45:32,510
so they had like a great history where
they their youth didn't show off just

8396
02:45:32,510 --> 02:45:32,520
they their youth didn't show off just
 

8397
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:34,790
they their youth didn't show off just
how long they'd been in the sport right

8398
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:34,800
how long they'd been in the sport right
 

8399
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:37,370
how long they'd been in the sport right
so you're dealing with a kid who's 19

8400
02:45:37,370 --> 02:45:37,380
so you're dealing with a kid who's 19
 

8401
02:45:37,380 --> 02:45:39,170
so you're dealing with a kid who's 19
years old but he's been grappling for 15

8402
02:45:39,170 --> 02:45:39,180
years old but he's been grappling for 15
 

8403
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:42,650
years old but he's been grappling for 15
years yeah and uh what counts is not

8404
02:45:42,650 --> 02:45:42,660
years yeah and uh what counts is not
 

8405
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:46,910
years yeah and uh what counts is not
your age but your met age yeah and

8406
02:45:46,910 --> 02:45:46,920
your age but your met age yeah and
 

8407
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:49,969
your age but your met age yeah and
quality yeah now they were very young in

8408
02:45:49,969 --> 02:45:49,979
quality yeah now they were very young in
 

8409
02:45:49,979 --> 02:45:52,550
quality yeah now they were very young in
years but they were very old and mad age

8410
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:52,560
years but they were very old and mad age
 

8411
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:55,429
years but they were very old and mad age
and um but there's a lot of athletes

8412
02:45:55,429 --> 02:45:55,439
and um but there's a lot of athletes
 

8413
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:57,670
and um but there's a lot of athletes
that have now as you've correctly said

8414
02:45:57,670 --> 02:45:57,680
that have now as you've correctly said
 

8415
02:45:57,680 --> 02:46:00,889
that have now as you've correctly said
have spent from a very early age on the

8416
02:46:00,889 --> 02:46:00,899
have spent from a very early age on the
 

8417
02:46:00,899 --> 02:46:03,830
have spent from a very early age on the
mat but still these particular ones

8418
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:03,840
mat but still these particular ones
 

8419
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:05,389
mat but still these particular ones
stand out it's interesting yeah no

8420
02:46:05,389 --> 02:46:05,399
stand out it's interesting yeah no
 

8421
02:46:05,399 --> 02:46:06,889
stand out it's interesting yeah no
there's a lot more to it than that this

8422
02:46:06,889 --> 02:46:06,899
there's a lot more to it than that this
 

8423
02:46:06,899 --> 02:46:08,929
there's a lot more to it than that this
is just the the first set in the scene

8424
02:46:08,929 --> 02:46:08,939
is just the the first set in the scene
 

8425
02:46:08,939 --> 02:46:11,510
is just the the first set in the scene
but what really makes them stand out

8426
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:11,520
but what really makes them stand out
 

8427
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:16,070
but what really makes them stand out
is that they've mastered this idea of

8428
02:46:16,070 --> 02:46:16,080
is that they've mastered this idea of
 

8429
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:19,790
is that they've mastered this idea of
covering up and improving initial

8430
02:46:19,790 --> 02:46:19,800
covering up and improving initial
 

8431
02:46:19,800 --> 02:46:22,190
covering up and improving initial
weaknesses while building upon strengths

8432
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:22,200
weaknesses while building upon strengths
 

8433
02:46:22,200 --> 02:46:24,710
weaknesses while building upon strengths
when the rotolers first encountered my

8434
02:46:24,710 --> 02:46:24,720
when the rotolers first encountered my
 

8435
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:26,690
when the rotolers first encountered my
students they were relatively easy to

8436
02:46:26,690 --> 02:46:26,700
students they were relatively easy to
 

8437
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:28,969
students they were relatively easy to
lay lock because none of their training

8438
02:46:28,969 --> 02:46:28,979
lay lock because none of their training
 

8439
02:46:28,979 --> 02:46:31,790
lay lock because none of their training
experience had prepared them for that

8440
02:46:31,790 --> 02:46:31,800
experience had prepared them for that
 

8441
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:32,809
experience had prepared them for that
um

8442
02:46:32,809 --> 02:46:32,819
um
 

8443
02:46:32,819 --> 02:46:35,870
um
now they were they were young at that

8444
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:35,880
now they were they were young at that
 

8445
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:40,309
now they were they were young at that
time I believe like 16 or 17 and uh it

8446
02:46:40,309 --> 02:46:40,319
time I believe like 16 or 17 and uh it
 

8447
02:46:40,319 --> 02:46:42,170
time I believe like 16 or 17 and uh it
was an obvious problem for them they

8448
02:46:42,170 --> 02:46:42,180
was an obvious problem for them they
 

8449
02:46:42,180 --> 02:46:44,870
was an obvious problem for them they
both got peel hooked

8450
02:46:44,870 --> 02:46:44,880
both got peel hooked
 

8451
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:49,010
both got peel hooked
um by male youngsters also

8452
02:46:49,010 --> 02:46:49,020
um by male youngsters also
 

8453
02:46:49,020 --> 02:46:54,110
um by male youngsters also
um Nikki Ryan and Ethan crownston and um

8454
02:46:54,110 --> 02:46:54,120
um Nikki Ryan and Ethan crownston and um
 

8455
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:56,809
um Nikki Ryan and Ethan crownston and um
you could clearly see that they

8456
02:46:56,809 --> 02:46:56,819
you could clearly see that they
 

8457
02:46:56,819 --> 02:46:58,730
you could clearly see that they
identified

8458
02:46:58,730 --> 02:46:58,740
identified
 

8459
02:46:58,740 --> 02:47:00,889
identified
their current weakness and made

8460
02:47:00,889 --> 02:47:00,899
their current weakness and made
 

8461
02:47:00,899 --> 02:47:03,830
their current weakness and made
prodigious steps to improve upon it to a

8462
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:03,840
prodigious steps to improve upon it to a
 

8463
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:05,410
prodigious steps to improve upon it to a
point now where they're winning

8464
02:47:05,410 --> 02:47:05,420
point now where they're winning
 

8465
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:07,610
point now where they're winning
championships with their own leg locks

8466
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:07,620
championships with their own leg locks
 

8467
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:09,889
championships with their own leg locks
like I love the fact that even as

8468
02:47:09,889 --> 02:47:09,899
like I love the fact that even as
 

8469
02:47:09,899 --> 02:47:12,530
like I love the fact that even as
teenagers they had the maturity to say

8470
02:47:12,530 --> 02:47:12,540
teenagers they had the maturity to say
 

8471
02:47:12,540 --> 02:47:14,389
teenagers they had the maturity to say
okay here's an obvious weakness let's

8472
02:47:14,389 --> 02:47:14,399
okay here's an obvious weakness let's
 

8473
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:15,830
okay here's an obvious weakness let's
get around this let's turn it into a

8474
02:47:15,830 --> 02:47:15,840
get around this let's turn it into a
 

8475
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:17,270
get around this let's turn it into a
strength

8476
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:17,280
strength
 

8477
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:19,309
strength
um I love the way they did that and

8478
02:47:19,309 --> 02:47:19,319
um I love the way they did that and
 

8479
02:47:19,319 --> 02:47:20,929
um I love the way they did that and
focusing on the weakness and let that

8480
02:47:20,929 --> 02:47:20,939
focusing on the weakness and let that
 

8481
02:47:20,939 --> 02:47:22,370
focusing on the weakness and let that
guide you to the thing you're working on

8482
02:47:22,370 --> 02:47:22,380
guide you to the thing you're working on
 

8483
02:47:22,380 --> 02:47:24,770
guide you to the thing you're working on
but they also that they they covered up

8484
02:47:24,770 --> 02:47:24,780
but they also that they they covered up
 

8485
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:26,690
but they also that they they covered up
their weaknesses but they also

8486
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:26,700
their weaknesses but they also
 

8487
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:29,150
their weaknesses but they also
understood what are our actual strengths

8488
02:47:29,150 --> 02:47:29,160
understood what are our actual strengths
 

8489
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:32,809
understood what are our actual strengths
now physically both of the brothers have

8490
02:47:32,809 --> 02:47:32,819
now physically both of the brothers have
 

8491
02:47:32,819 --> 02:47:34,910
now physically both of the brothers have
extraordinary reach for their height

8492
02:47:34,910 --> 02:47:34,920
extraordinary reach for their height
 

8493
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:38,030
extraordinary reach for their height
they both have extraordinarily long arms

8494
02:47:38,030 --> 02:47:38,040
they both have extraordinarily long arms
 

8495
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:39,290
they both have extraordinarily long arms
for their height

8496
02:47:39,290 --> 02:47:39,300
for their height
 

8497
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:42,530
for their height
that means that variations of karakatama

8498
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:42,540
that means that variations of karakatama
 

8499
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:46,010
that means that variations of karakatama
in particular dasas anacondas are going

8500
02:47:46,010 --> 02:47:46,020
in particular dasas anacondas are going
 

8501
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:48,170
in particular dasas anacondas are going
to be much easier for them in their way

8502
02:47:48,170 --> 02:47:48,180
to be much easier for them in their way
 

8503
02:47:48,180 --> 02:47:49,790
to be much easier for them in their way
division than for most people these are

8504
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:49,800
division than for most people these are
 

8505
02:47:49,800 --> 02:47:52,730
division than for most people these are
all chokes yes strangleholds so they

8506
02:47:52,730 --> 02:47:52,740
all chokes yes strangleholds so they
 

8507
02:47:52,740 --> 02:47:55,730
all chokes yes strangleholds so they
specialize in those they adapted a game

8508
02:47:55,730 --> 02:47:55,740
specialize in those they adapted a game

02:47:55,740 --> 02:47:58,250
specialize in those they adapted a game
based around movement

8510
02:47:58,250 --> 02:47:58,260
based around movement
 

8511
02:47:58,260 --> 02:48:01,969
based around movement
which forces opponents not with physical

8512
02:48:01,969 --> 02:48:01,979
which forces opponents not with physical
 

8513
02:48:01,979 --> 02:48:04,610
which forces opponents not with physical
pressure but with tactical pressure into

02:48:04,610 --> 02:48:04,620
pressure but with tactical pressure into
 

8515
02:48:04,620 --> 02:48:07,190

02:48:10,370 --> 02:48:10,380
specialized strangle holes that they use

um

8520
02:48:12,130 --> 02:48:12,140
um
 

8521
02:48:12,140 --> 02:48:15,050
um
traditionally when when we looked at the

8522
02:48:15,050 --> 02:48:15,060
traditionally when when we looked at the
 

8523
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:16,550
traditionally when when we looked at the
ruatologist when they were young we saw

8524
02:48:16,550 --> 02:48:16,560
ruatologist when they were young we saw
 

8525
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:18,110
ruatologist when they were young we saw
that there was a disparity between their

8526
02:48:18,110 --> 02:48:18,120
that there was a disparity between their
 

8527
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:19,730
that there was a disparity between their
top game and their bottom game they were

8528
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:19,740
top game and their bottom game they were
 

8529
02:48:19,740 --> 02:48:20,990
top game and their bottom game they were
generally much better in top position

8530
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:21,000
generally much better in top position
 

8531
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,809
generally much better in top position
than they were in bottom possession

8532
02:48:22,809 --> 02:48:22,819
than they were in bottom possession
 

8533
02:48:22,819 --> 02:48:26,330
than they were in bottom possession
again they saw that as a as a potential

8534
02:48:26,330 --> 02:48:26,340
again they saw that as a as a potential
 

8535
02:48:26,340 --> 02:48:28,670
again they saw that as a as a potential
weakness and they turned it around using

8536
02:48:28,670 --> 02:48:28,680
weakness and they turned it around using
 

8537
02:48:28,680 --> 02:48:32,450
weakness and they turned it around using
again their unique long limbs relative

8538
02:48:32,450 --> 02:48:32,460
again their unique long limbs relative
 

8539
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:35,570
again their unique long limbs relative
to their height and they make use of a

8540
02:48:35,570 --> 02:48:35,580
to their height and they make use of a
 

8541
02:48:35,580 --> 02:48:37,610
to their height and they make use of a
buggy strangle I'm not sure why it's

8542
02:48:37,610 --> 02:48:37,620
buggy strangle I'm not sure why it's
 

8543
02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:39,230
buggy strangle I'm not sure why it's
referred to as a buggy strangle but it's

8544
02:48:39,230 --> 02:48:39,240
referred to as a buggy strangle but it's
 

8545
02:48:39,240 --> 02:48:40,730
referred to as a buggy strangle but it's
in it basically it's a variation of

8546
02:48:40,730 --> 02:48:40,740
in it basically it's a variation of
 

8547
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:42,530
in it basically it's a variation of
karagatama using the legs done from

8548
02:48:42,530 --> 02:48:42,540
karagatama using the legs done from
 

8549
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:45,590
karagatama using the legs done from
disadvantageous positions on bottom and

8550
02:48:45,590 --> 02:48:45,600
disadvantageous positions on bottom and
 

8551
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:47,750
disadvantageous positions on bottom and
they both made brilliant use of that to

8552
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:47,760
they both made brilliant use of that to
 

8553
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:49,730
they both made brilliant use of that to
not so much as a strangle weapon

8554
02:48:49,730 --> 02:48:49,740
not so much as a strangle weapon
 

8555
02:48:49,740 --> 02:48:51,230
not so much as a strangle weapon
occasionally they'll strangle some of it

8556
02:48:51,230 --> 02:48:51,240
occasionally they'll strangle some of it
 

8557
02:48:51,240 --> 02:48:52,670
occasionally they'll strangle some of it
but they mostly use it to create

8558
02:48:52,670 --> 02:48:52,680
but they mostly use it to create
 

8559
02:48:52,680 --> 02:48:55,309
but they mostly use it to create
pressure to make people back off and as

8560
02:48:55,309 --> 02:48:55,319
pressure to make people back off and as
 

8561
02:48:55,319 --> 02:48:58,130
pressure to make people back off and as
a result they're able to uh they

8562
02:48:58,130 --> 02:48:58,140
a result they're able to uh they
 

8563
02:48:58,140 --> 02:49:00,770
a result they're able to uh they
overcame the disparity between their top

8564
02:49:00,770 --> 02:49:00,780
overcame the disparity between their top
 

8565
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:02,389
overcame the disparity between their top
game and their bottom game now their

8566
02:49:02,389 --> 02:49:02,399
game and their bottom game now their
 

8567
02:49:02,399 --> 02:49:04,429
game and their bottom game now their
bottom game is part of their offense and

8568
02:49:04,429 --> 02:49:04,439
bottom game is part of their offense and
 

8569
02:49:04,439 --> 02:49:05,929
bottom game is part of their offense and
they're very very successful from there

8570
02:49:05,929 --> 02:49:05,939
they're very very successful from there
 

8571
02:49:05,939 --> 02:49:08,809
they're very very successful from there
and so again you hit that that really

8572
02:49:08,809 --> 02:49:08,819
and so again you hit that that really
 

8573
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:10,550
and so again you hit that that really
impressive sense in which they

8574
02:49:10,550 --> 02:49:10,560
impressive sense in which they
 

8575
02:49:10,560 --> 02:49:12,170
impressive sense in which they
identified their weaknesses and leg

8576
02:49:12,170 --> 02:49:12,180
identified their weaknesses and leg
 

8577
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:14,030
identified their weaknesses and leg
locks and bottom position turned it

8578
02:49:14,030 --> 02:49:14,040
locks and bottom position turned it
 

8579
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:16,670
locks and bottom position turned it
around and made it into strengths and at

8580
02:49:16,670 --> 02:49:16,680
around and made it into strengths and at
 

8581
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:18,710
around and made it into strengths and at
the same time they identified okay what

8582
02:49:18,710 --> 02:49:18,720
the same time they identified okay what
 

8583
02:49:18,720 --> 02:49:20,870
the same time they identified okay what

8585
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:23,270
what are our physical gifts and how can
we maximize their use and they created a

8586
02:49:23,270 --> 02:49:23,280
we maximize their use and they created a
 

8587
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:24,770
we maximize their use and they created a
program of initiating movement that

8588
02:49:24,770 --> 02:49:24,780
program of initiating movement that
 

8589
02:49:24,780 --> 02:49:26,270
program of initiating movement that
created tactical rather than physical

8590
02:49:26,270 --> 02:49:26,280

02:51:08,090 --> 02:51:08,100
wrestling is that because this upper
 

8677
02:51:08,100 --> 02:51:10,610
wrestling is that because this upper
body connection during the throw and

8678
02:51:10,610 --> 02:51:10,620
body connection during the throw and
 

8679
02:51:10,620 --> 02:51:12,830
body connection during the throw and
after the throw it's much harder for an

8680
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:12,840
after the throw it's much harder for an
 

8681
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:14,750
after the throw it's much harder for an
opponent to scramble away from you and

8682
02:51:14,750 --> 02:51:14,760
opponent to scramble away from you and
 

8683
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:16,309
opponent to scramble away from you and
even Tai Rotolo is one of the best

8684
02:51:16,309 --> 02:51:16,319
even Tai Rotolo is one of the best
 

8685
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:17,870
even Tai Rotolo is one of the best
scramblers in the sport

8686
02:51:17,870 --> 02:51:17,880
scramblers in the sport
 

8687
02:51:17,880 --> 02:51:21,349
scramblers in the sport
it has to stop scrambling here and just

8688
02:51:21,349 --> 02:51:21,359
it has to stop scrambling here and just
 

8689
02:51:21,359 --> 02:51:23,990
it has to stop scrambling here and just
uh go back to guard position and enable

8690
02:51:23,990 --> 02:51:24,000
uh go back to guard position and enable
 

8691
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,270
uh go back to guard position and enable
Nicholas to to hold top position I mean

8692
02:51:26,270 --> 02:51:26,280
Nicholas to to hold top position I mean
 

8693
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:28,910
Nicholas to to hold top position I mean
some of it is also the surprise there is

8694
02:51:28,910 --> 02:51:28,920
some of it is also the surprise there is
 

8695
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:30,889
some of it is also the surprise there is
something less understandable about Judo

8696
02:51:30,889 --> 02:51:30,899
something less understandable about Judo
 

8697
02:51:30,899 --> 02:51:34,010
something less understandable about Judo
techniques because there's less data

8698
02:51:34,010 --> 02:51:34,020
techniques because there's less data
 

8699
02:51:34,020 --> 02:51:36,710
techniques because there's less data
it feels like the root holders also have

8700
02:51:36,710 --> 02:51:36,720
it feels like the root holders also have
 

8701
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:38,270
it feels like the root holders also have
a good range I think they're very

8702
02:51:38,270 --> 02:51:38,280
a good range I think they're very
 

8703
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:39,429
a good range I think they're very
familiar with it

8704
02:51:39,429 --> 02:51:39,439
familiar with it
 

8705
02:51:39,439 --> 02:51:41,929
familiar with it
how often do you think are they in the

8706
02:51:41,929 --> 02:51:41,939
how often do you think are they in the
 

8707
02:51:41,939 --> 02:51:44,210
how often do you think are they in the
receiving end of it that's a good point

8708
02:51:44,210 --> 02:51:44,220
receiving end of it that's a good point
 

8709
02:51:44,220 --> 02:51:46,130
receiving end of it that's a good point
yeah so I just feel like they have more

8710
02:51:46,130 --> 02:51:46,140
yeah so I just feel like they have more
 

8711
02:51:46,140 --> 02:51:48,410
yeah so I just feel like they have more
data in terms of Defending

8712
02:51:48,410 --> 02:51:48,420
data in terms of Defending
 

8713
02:51:48,420 --> 02:51:49,790
data in terms of Defending
um would I mean of course there is

8714
02:51:49,790 --> 02:51:49,800
um would I mean of course there is
 

8715
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:51,710
um would I mean of course there is
fundamentals to the gemada that make it

8716
02:51:51,710 --> 02:51:51,720
fundamentals to the gemada that make it
 

8717
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:54,590
fundamentals to the gemada that make it
difficult to scramble around but

8718
02:51:54,590 --> 02:51:54,600
difficult to scramble around but
 

8719
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:56,929
difficult to scramble around but
this is a good example of someone who

8720
02:51:56,929 --> 02:51:56,939
this is a good example of someone who
 

8721
02:51:56,939 --> 02:51:58,490
this is a good example of someone who
literally didn't have a single takedown

8722
02:51:58,490 --> 02:51:58,500
literally didn't have a single takedown
 

8723
02:51:58,500 --> 02:52:00,650
literally didn't have a single takedown
six months ago now he's throwing one of

8724
02:52:00,650 --> 02:52:00,660
six months ago now he's throwing one of
 

8725
02:52:00,660 --> 02:52:02,630
six months ago now he's throwing one of
the toughest guys in the sport with one

8726
02:52:02,630 --> 02:52:02,640
the toughest guys in the sport with one
 

8727
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:04,010
the toughest guys in the sport with one
of the more difficult throws of Judah

8728
02:52:04,010 --> 02:52:04,020
of the more difficult throws of Judah
 

8729
02:52:04,020 --> 02:52:06,830
of the more difficult throws of Judah
now you're a judo man yeah you'll back

8730
02:52:06,830 --> 02:52:06,840
now you're a judo man yeah you'll back
 

8731
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:09,530
now you're a judo man yeah you'll back
me up it's not an easy throw to learn it

8732
02:52:09,530 --> 02:52:09,540
me up it's not an easy throw to learn it
 

8733
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:10,969
me up it's not an easy throw to learn it
takes some time you're hopping on one

8734
02:52:10,969 --> 02:52:10,979
takes some time you're hopping on one
 

8735
02:52:10,979 --> 02:52:12,469
takes some time you're hopping on one
foot with both of your body weight

8736
02:52:12,469 --> 02:52:12,479
foot with both of your body weight
 

8737
02:52:12,479 --> 02:52:13,570
foot with both of your body weight
Supply

8738
02:52:13,570 --> 02:52:13,580
Supply
 

8739
02:52:13,580 --> 02:52:16,490
Supply
yeah it's a lot of the really uh it's

8740
02:52:16,490 --> 02:52:16,500
yeah it's a lot of the really uh it's
 

8741
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:18,230
yeah it's a lot of the really uh it's
one of the more difficult throws let go

8742
02:52:18,230 --> 02:52:18,240
one of the more difficult throws let go
 

8743
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:21,650
one of the more difficult throws let go
of your understanding of uh takedowns of

8744
02:52:21,650 --> 02:52:21,660
of your understanding of uh takedowns of
 

8745
02:52:21,660 --> 02:52:23,690
of your understanding of uh takedowns of
maybe wrestling style takedowns or more

8746
02:52:23,690 --> 02:52:23,700
maybe wrestling style takedowns or more
 

8747
02:52:23,700 --> 02:52:25,730
maybe wrestling style takedowns or more
intuitive kind of takedowns to

8748
02:52:25,730 --> 02:52:25,740
intuitive kind of takedowns to
 

8749
02:52:25,740 --> 02:52:28,010
intuitive kind of takedowns to
understand it there's many throws like

8750
02:52:28,010 --> 02:52:28,020
understand it there's many throws like
 

8751
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:30,590
understand it there's many throws like
this which agaris like this uh sort of

8752
02:52:30,590 --> 02:52:30,600
this which agaris like this uh sort of
 

8753
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:32,630
this which agaris like this uh sort of
guy is like this shimata is like this

8754
02:52:32,630 --> 02:52:32,640
guy is like this shimata is like this
 

8755
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:35,570
guy is like this shimata is like this
it's weird what I'm on one foot I'm

8756
02:52:35,570 --> 02:52:35,580
it's weird what I'm on one foot I'm
 

8757
02:52:35,580 --> 02:52:37,550
it's weird what I'm on one foot I'm
hopping around this makes no sense yeah

8758
02:52:37,550 --> 02:52:37,560
hopping around this makes no sense yeah
 

8759
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:39,889
hopping around this makes no sense yeah
but it works foot sweeps are also weird

8760
02:52:39,889 --> 02:52:39,899
but it works foot sweeps are also weird
 

8761
02:52:39,899 --> 02:52:41,389
but it works foot sweeps are also weird
in that way they're a little bit more

8762
02:52:41,389 --> 02:52:41,399
in that way they're a little bit more
 

8763
02:52:41,399 --> 02:52:43,849
in that way they're a little bit more
intuitive but like you get very good at

8764
02:52:43,849 --> 02:52:43,859
intuitive but like you get very good at
 

8765
02:52:43,859 --> 02:52:45,530
intuitive but like you get very good at
foot sweeps you have to understand

8766
02:52:45,530 --> 02:52:45,540
foot sweeps you have to understand
 

8767
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:48,710
foot sweeps you have to understand
timing weight distribution there it's uh

8768
02:52:48,710 --> 02:52:48,720
timing weight distribution there it's uh
 

8769
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:51,410
timing weight distribution there it's uh
it's a dynamic thing that's weird you

8770
02:52:51,410 --> 02:52:51,420
it's a dynamic thing that's weird you
 

8771
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:54,110
it's a dynamic thing that's weird you
have to I always uh laugh and I talk to

8772
02:52:54,110 --> 02:52:54,120
have to I always uh laugh and I talk to
 

8773
02:52:54,120 --> 02:52:55,910
have to I always uh laugh and I talk to
Nicholas say you know

8774
02:52:55,910 --> 02:52:55,920
Nicholas say you know
 

8775
02:52:55,920 --> 02:52:58,550
Nicholas say you know
I try to teach them a single leg which

8776
02:52:58,550 --> 02:52:58,560
I try to teach them a single leg which
 

8777
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:00,950
I try to teach them a single leg which
is traditionally most you know like a

8778
02:53:00,950 --> 02:53:00,960
is traditionally most you know like a
 

8779
02:53:00,960 --> 02:53:02,269
is traditionally most you know like a
high single leg is one of the easier

8780
02:53:02,269 --> 02:53:02,279
high single leg is one of the easier
 

8781
02:53:02,279 --> 02:53:03,830
high single leg is one of the easier
takedowns to perform in terms of

8782
02:53:03,830 --> 02:53:03,840
takedowns to perform in terms of
 

8783
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:07,190
takedowns to perform in terms of
mechanical difficulty and uh Nicholas

8784
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:07,200
mechanical difficulty and uh Nicholas
 

8785
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:08,929
mechanical difficulty and uh Nicholas
always struggles with it and then I

8786
02:53:08,929 --> 02:53:08,939
always struggles with it and then I
 

8787
02:53:08,939 --> 02:53:10,750
always struggles with it and then I
teach him one of the more difficult

8788
02:53:10,750 --> 02:53:10,760
teach him one of the more difficult
 

8789
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:13,070
teach him one of the more difficult
takedownsimata and he

8790
02:53:13,070 --> 02:53:13,080
takedownsimata and he
 

8791
02:53:13,080 --> 02:53:14,870
takedownsimata and he
does it flawlessly you never know

8792
02:53:14,870 --> 02:53:14,880
does it flawlessly you never know
 

8793
02:53:14,880 --> 02:53:16,730
does it flawlessly you never know
certain things get attached I mean you

8794
02:53:16,730 --> 02:53:16,740
certain things get attached I mean you
 

8795
02:53:16,740 --> 02:53:17,990
certain things get attached I mean you
see this in Judo it's kind of

8796
02:53:17,990 --> 02:53:18,000
see this in Judo it's kind of
 

8797
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,809
see this in Judo it's kind of
interesting to see um

8798
02:53:19,809 --> 02:53:19,819
interesting to see um
 

8799
02:53:19,819 --> 02:53:23,269
interesting to see um
there's classes of takedowns and certain

8800
02:53:23,269 --> 02:53:23,279
there's classes of takedowns and certain
 

8801
02:53:23,279 --> 02:53:25,550
there's classes of takedowns and certain
people just gravitate

8802
02:53:25,550 --> 02:53:25,560
people just gravitate
 

8803
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:28,010
people just gravitate
in their philosophical intuitive

8804
02:53:28,010 --> 02:53:28,020
in their philosophical intuitive
 

8805
02:53:28,020 --> 02:53:29,690
in their philosophical intuitive
understanding of body mechanics or

8806
02:53:29,690 --> 02:53:29,700
understanding of body mechanics or
 

8807
02:53:29,700 --> 02:53:31,670
understanding of body mechanics or
something like this it's like say Nagi

8808
02:53:31,670 --> 02:53:31,680
something like this it's like say Nagi
 

8809
02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:33,769
something like this it's like say Nagi
versus ichimada you very clearly see

8810
02:53:33,769 --> 02:53:33,779
versus ichimada you very clearly see
 

8811
02:53:33,779 --> 02:53:37,070
versus ichimada you very clearly see
there's some people that understand they

8812
02:53:37,070 --> 02:53:37,080
there's some people that understand they
 

8813
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:38,929
there's some people that understand they
like to have both their feet planted on

8814
02:53:38,929 --> 02:53:38,939
like to have both their feet planted on
 

8815
02:53:38,939 --> 02:53:40,010
like to have both their feet planted on
the ground

8816
02:53:40,010 --> 02:53:40,020
the ground
 

8817
02:53:40,020 --> 02:53:42,830
the ground
and there's some people that are okay

8818
02:53:42,830 --> 02:53:42,840
and there's some people that are okay
 

8819
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:45,710
and there's some people that are okay
with this one foot on the ground and the

8820
02:53:45,710 --> 02:53:45,720
with this one foot on the ground and the
 

8821
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:47,809
with this one foot on the ground and the
other one is doing something else and I

8822
02:53:47,809 --> 02:53:47,819
other one is doing something else and I
 

8823
02:53:47,819 --> 02:53:49,490
other one is doing something else and I
think that I don't know what that

8824
02:53:49,490 --> 02:53:49,500
think that I don't know what that
 

8825
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:50,990
think that I don't know what that
what is that I don't know it's what

8826
02:53:50,990 --> 02:53:51,000
what is that I don't know it's what
 

8827
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:52,309
what is that I don't know it's what
makes you fall in love with one field

8828

makes you fall in love with one field
 

8829
02:53:52,319 --> 02:53:53,530
makes you fall in love with one field
versus another

8830
02:53:53,530 --> 02:53:53,540
versus another
 

8831

02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:25,130
are much longer than the magazine
wrestling

8908
02:55:25,130 --> 02:55:25,140
wrestling
 

8909
02:55:25,140 --> 02:55:26,690
wrestling
um in addition there are many kinds of

8910
02:55:26,690 --> 02:55:26,700
um in addition there are many kinds of
 

8911
02:55:26,700 --> 02:55:28,969
um in addition there are many kinds of
submission threat which are not there in

favor generally a very low Crouch
 

8919
02:55:34,979 --> 02:55:37,429
favor generally a very low Crouch
because the vast majority of attacks are

8920
02:55:37,429 --> 02:55:37,439
because the vast majority of attacks are
 

8921
02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:40,429
because the vast majority of attacks are
tackles to the legs so anyone who stands

8922
02:55:40,429 --> 02:55:40,439
tackles to the legs so anyone who stands
 

8923
02:55:40,439 --> 02:55:41,690
tackles to the legs so anyone who stands
upright and wrestling tends to get

8924

upright and wrestling tends to get
heavily punished by being taken down

heavily punished by being taken down
 

8927
02:55:44,040 --> 02:55:46,670
heavily punished by being taken down
immediately with a leg tackle

8928
02:55:46,670 --> 02:55:46,680
immediately with a leg tackle
 

8929
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:49,370
immediately with a leg tackle
um in Jiu Jitsu the matches are so much

8930
02:55:49,370 --> 02:55:49,380
um in Jiu Jitsu the matches are so much
 

8931
02:55:49,380 --> 02:55:51,050
um in Jiu Jitsu the matches are so much
longer it would be difficult in a

8932
02:55:51,050 --> 02:55:51,060
longer it would be difficult in a
 

8933
02:55:51,060 --> 02:55:53,269
longer it would be difficult in a
40-minute match for example to maintain

8934
02:55:53,269 --> 02:55:53,279
40-minute match for example to maintain
 

8935
02:55:53,279 --> 02:55:55,690
40-minute match for example to maintain
a bent over crowd should be exhausted

8936
02:55:55,690 --> 02:55:55,700
a bent over crowd should be exhausted
 

8937
02:55:55,700 --> 02:55:58,070
a bent over crowd should be exhausted
there's also problems associated with

8938
02:55:58,070 --> 02:55:58,080
there's also problems associated with
 

8939
02:55:58,080 --> 02:55:59,809
there's also problems associated with
submission holes there are many forms of

8940
02:55:59,809 --> 02:55:59,819
submission holes there are many forms of
 

8941
02:55:59,819 --> 02:56:02,210
submission holes there are many forms of
submission hold Guillotines tasks Etc

8942
02:56:02,210 --> 02:56:02,220
submission hold Guillotines tasks Etc
 

8943

where if your head comes down too low

8944
02:56:03,590 --> 02:56:03,600
where if your head comes down too low
 

8945
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:05,750
where if your head comes down too low
you become a little vulnerable to this

8946
02:56:05,750 --> 02:56:05,760
you become a little vulnerable to this
 

8947
02:56:05,760 --> 02:56:09,290
you become a little vulnerable to this
and so the the stances in uh Jiu Jitsu

8948
02:56:09,290 --> 02:56:09,300
and so the the stances in uh Jiu Jitsu
 

8949
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:10,910
and so the the stances in uh Jiu Jitsu
competition tend to be much more upright

8950
02:56:10,910 --> 02:56:10,920
competition tend to be much more upright
 

8951
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:13,790
competition tend to be much more upright
more like Judo and Greco so right off

8952
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:13,800
more like Judo and Greco so right off
 

8953
02:56:13,800 --> 02:56:15,230
more like Judo and Greco so right off
the bat you see The Stance is different

8954
02:56:15,230 --> 02:56:15,240
the bat you see The Stance is different
 

8955
02:56:15,240 --> 02:56:17,450
the bat you see The Stance is different
the motion tends to be much slower and

8956
02:56:17,450 --> 02:56:17,460
the motion tends to be much slower and
 

8957
02:56:17,460 --> 02:56:18,950
the motion tends to be much slower and
more evenly paced because you've got to

8958
02:56:18,950 --> 02:56:18,960
more evenly paced because you've got to
 

8959
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:20,389
more evenly paced because you've got to
be able to do this for long periods of

8960
02:56:20,389 --> 02:56:20,399
be able to do this for long periods of
 

8961
02:56:20,399 --> 02:56:23,330
be able to do this for long periods of
time so the the number of fakes per

8962
02:56:23,330 --> 02:56:23,340
time so the the number of fakes per
 

8963
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:25,130
time so the the number of fakes per
minute the number of shots attempted to

8964
02:56:25,130 --> 02:56:25,140
minute the number of shots attempted to
 

8965
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:28,790
minute the number of shots attempted to
per minute is usually much lower

8966
02:56:28,790 --> 02:56:28,800
per minute is usually much lower
 

8967
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:29,809
per minute is usually much lower
um

8968
02:56:29,809 --> 02:56:29,819
um
 

8969
02:56:29,819 --> 02:56:32,870
um
so these are obvious differences

8970
02:56:32,870 --> 02:56:32,880
so these are obvious differences
 

8971
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:35,030
so these are obvious differences
uh the biggest difference however has

8972
02:56:35,030 --> 02:56:35,040
uh the biggest difference however has
 

8973
02:56:35,040 --> 02:56:36,230
uh the biggest difference however has
nothing to do with that it has to do

8974
02:56:36,230 --> 02:56:36,240
nothing to do with that it has to do
 

8975
02:56:36,240 --> 02:56:39,190
nothing to do with that it has to do
with tactics in jiu jitsu

8976
02:56:39,190 --> 02:56:39,200
with tactics in jiu jitsu
 

8977
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:42,290
with tactics in jiu jitsu
these scores

8978
02:56:42,290 --> 02:56:42,300
these scores
 

8979
02:56:42,300 --> 02:56:45,230
these scores
will be judged by what happens after the

8980
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:45,240
will be judged by what happens after the
 

8981
02:56:45,240 --> 02:56:46,610
will be judged by what happens after the
takedown

8982
02:56:46,610 --> 02:56:46,620
takedown
 

8983
02:56:46,620 --> 02:56:49,010
takedown
in the case of ADCC

8984
02:56:49,010 --> 02:56:49,020
in the case of ADCC
 

8985
02:56:49,020 --> 02:56:52,370
in the case of ADCC
you can take someone down in ways that

8986
02:56:52,370 --> 02:56:52,380
you can take someone down in ways that
 

8987
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:55,070
you can take someone down in ways that
would score in both wrestling and Judo

8988
02:56:55,070 --> 02:56:55,080
would score in both wrestling and Judo
 

8989
02:56:55,080 --> 02:56:57,110
would score in both wrestling and Judo
and possibly even win the match in the

8990
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:57,120
and possibly even win the match in the
 

8991
02:56:57,120 --> 02:56:58,429
and possibly even win the match in the
case of Judah

8992
02:56:58,429 --> 02:56:58,439
case of Judah
 

8993
02:56:58,439 --> 02:57:01,610
case of Judah
and it would score zero in ADCC because

8994
02:57:01,610 --> 02:57:01,620
and it would score zero in ADCC because
 

8995
02:57:01,620 --> 02:57:03,950
and it would score zero in ADCC because
of the the nature of the rules

8996
02:57:03,950 --> 02:57:03,960
of the the nature of the rules
 

8997
02:57:03,960 --> 02:57:07,510
of the the nature of the rules
the whole idea of ADCC scoring is to

8998
02:57:07,510 --> 02:57:07,520
the whole idea of ADCC scoring is to
 

8999
02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:10,309
the whole idea of ADCC scoring is to
demonstrate control after the takedown

9000
02:57:10,309 --> 02:57:10,319
demonstrate control after the takedown
 

9001
02:57:10,319 --> 02:57:11,809
demonstrate control after the takedown
it's what happens in the critical three

9002
02:57:11,809 --> 02:57:11,819
it's what happens in the critical three
 

9003
02:57:11,819 --> 02:57:14,570
it's what happens in the critical three
seconds after the takedown that creates

9004
02:57:14,570 --> 02:57:14,580
seconds after the takedown that creates
 

9005
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:19,450
seconds after the takedown that creates
the score in Judo and in wrestling

9006
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:19,460
the score in Judo and in wrestling
 

9007
02:57:19,460 --> 02:57:22,190
the score in Judo and in wrestling
the emphasis is based on the takedown

9008
02:57:22,190 --> 02:57:22,200
the emphasis is based on the takedown
 

9009
02:57:22,200 --> 02:57:25,250
the emphasis is based on the takedown
itself in Jiu Jitsu the emphasis is

9010
02:57:25,250 --> 02:57:25,260
itself in Jiu Jitsu the emphasis is
 

9011
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:27,469
itself in Jiu Jitsu the emphasis is
placed on the aftermath of the takedown

9012
02:57:27,469 --> 02:57:27,479
placed on the aftermath of the takedown
 

9013
02:57:27,479 --> 02:57:30,349
placed on the aftermath of the takedown
that's where the score is allocated

9014
02:57:30,349 --> 02:57:30,359
that's where the score is allocated
 

9015
02:57:30,359 --> 02:57:32,510
that's where the score is allocated
and that can be a period of up to three

9016
02:57:32,510 --> 02:57:32,520
and that can be a period of up to three
 

9017
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:34,250
and that can be a period of up to three
seconds now three seconds doesn't sound

9018
02:57:34,250 --> 02:57:34,260
seconds now three seconds doesn't sound
 

9019
02:57:34,260 --> 02:57:36,349
seconds now three seconds doesn't sound
like much but in a scramble after I take

9020
02:57:36,349 --> 02:57:36,359
like much but in a scramble after I take
 

9021
02:57:36,359 --> 02:57:38,269
like much but in a scramble after I take
down three seconds is a [\h__\h] eternity

9022
02:57:38,269 --> 02:57:38,279
down three seconds is a [\h__\h] eternity
 

9023
02:57:38,279 --> 02:57:41,090
down three seconds is a [\h__\h] eternity
it goes on forever and so you will see

9024
02:57:41,090 --> 02:57:41,100
it goes on forever and so you will see
 

9025
02:57:41,100 --> 02:57:45,050
it goes on forever and so you will see
many examples of takedowns that as I

9026
02:57:45,050 --> 02:57:45,060
many examples of takedowns that as I
 

9027
02:57:45,060 --> 02:57:47,990
many examples of takedowns that as I
said would score very well and and Judo

9028
02:57:47,990 --> 02:57:48,000
said would score very well and and Judo
 

9029
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,630
said would score very well and and Judo
and wrestling but don't score at all on

9030
02:57:50,630 --> 02:57:50,640
and wrestling but don't score at all on
 

9031
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:52,010
and wrestling but don't score at all on
80cc

9032

80cc
 

9033
02:57:52,020 --> 02:57:55,309
80cc
and so the whole skill becomes packaging

9034
02:57:55,309 --> 02:57:55,319
and so the whole skill becomes packaging
 

9035
02:57:55,319 --> 02:57:57,710
and so the whole skill becomes packaging
the standing position in terms of the

9036
02:57:57,710 --> 02:57:57,720
the standing position in terms of the
 

9037
02:57:57,720 --> 02:58:00,250
the standing position in terms of the

02:58:05,210 --> 02:58:05,220
three seconds after the takedown that's
 

9043
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:07,190
three seconds after the takedown that's
why many people who have very fine

what makes GSB so good at takedowns I've
 

9053
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:21,469
what makes GSB so good at takedowns I've
got a chance to even recently watch them

what you find is that the wrestling

enable you to finish the takedown
 

9101
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:20,050
enable you to finish the takedown
but getting to the takedown is

9102
02:59:20,050 --> 02:59:20,060
but getting to the takedown is
 

9103
02:59:20,060 --> 02:59:22,370
but getting to the takedown is
massively different in the context of

02:59:22,370 --> 02:59:22,380
massively different in the context of
 

9105
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:24,650

02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:30,960
distancing is different there's the idea
 

9113
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:33,230
distancing is different there's the idea
of positioning within a cage like how

9114

of positioning within a cage like how
 

9115
02:59:33,240 --> 02:59:35,210

the of the cage changes radically how
 

9119
02:59:37,740 --> 02:59:39,950
the of the cage changes radically how
you approach the takedown

9120
02:59:39,950 --> 02:59:39,960
you approach the takedown
 

9121
02:59:39,960 --> 02:59:42,590
you approach the takedown
um the sit-ups are literally night and

9122
02:59:42,590 --> 02:59:42,600
um the sit-ups are literally night and
 

9123
02:59:42,600 --> 02:59:44,690
um the sit-ups are literally night and
day different it's the setups are almost

9124
02:59:44,690 --> 02:59:44,700
day different it's the setups are almost
 

9125
02:59:44,700 --> 02:59:47,450
day different it's the setups are almost
entirely comprised composed of striking

9126
02:59:47,450 --> 02:59:47,460
entirely comprised composed of striking
 

9127
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:50,510

setups rather than grappling setups
 

9129
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:52,550
setups rather than grappling setups
and so the act of getting to the

9130
02:59:52,550 --> 02:59:52,560
and so the act of getting to the
 

9131
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:53,690
and so the act of getting to the
takedown

9132
02:59:53,690 --> 02:59:53,700
takedown
 

9133
02:59:53,700 --> 02:59:57,410
takedown
is like a completely different sport now

9134
02:59:57,410 --> 02:59:57,420
is like a completely different sport now

that actually like they they fit there's
 

9449
03:06:34,859 --> 03:06:36,710
that actually like they they fit there's
a sense in which that it had to start

9450
03:06:36,710 --> 03:06:36,720
a sense in which that it had to start
 

9451
03:06:36,720 --> 03:06:38,750
a sense in which that it had to start
with a paradigm shift and then a

with a paradigm shift and then a
 

9453
03:06:38,760 --> 03:06:41,090
with a paradigm shift and then a
research program began after that you

9454
03:06:41,090 --> 03:06:41,100
research program began after that you
 

9455
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:42,769
research program began after that you
don't start with research you start with

don't start with research you start with
 

9457
03:06:42,779 --> 03:06:44,210
don't start with research you start with
the paradigm shift and then went to

9458
03:06:44,210 --> 03:06:44,220
the paradigm shift and then went to
 

9459
03:06:44,220 --> 03:06:46,490
the paradigm shift and then went to

I do to make sure that that
 

10407
03:25:28,319 --> 03:25:31,849
I do to make sure that that
two hour period is used maximally

two hour period is used maximally
 

10409

don't follow it
let's say for example

10442
03:26:09,969 --> 03:26:09,979

 

10443
03:26:09,979 --> 03:26:12,410

we start with the program that goes like

03:26:12,410 --> 03:26:12,420
we start with the program that goes like
 

10445
03:26:12,420 --> 03:26:13,429
we start with the program that goes like
this

10446

will undoubtedly improve
you will also have to make sure that you

10558
03:28:29,570 --> 03:28:29,580
you will also have to make sure that you
 

10559
03:28:29,580 --> 03:28:33,650
you will also have to make sure that you
take time during class to actively work

10560

take time during class to actively work
 

10561

on these things
now sometimes in class you don't get a

03:28:37,020 --> 03:28:38,809
now sometimes in class you don't get a
choice the instructor sometimes says

10566
03:28:38,809 --> 03:28:38,819
choice the instructor sometimes says
 

10567
03:28:38,819 --> 03:28:40,429
choice the instructor sometimes says
okay today we're working this this and

10568
03:28:40,429 --> 03:28:40,439
okay today we're working this this and
 

10569
03:28:40,439 --> 03:28:43,130
okay today we're working this this and
this but there's always time after and

10570
03:28:43,130 --> 03:28:43,140
this but there's always time after and
 

10571
03:28:43,140 --> 03:28:44,990
this but there's always time after and
before class where you can do your own

10572
03:28:44,990 --> 03:28:45,000
before class where you can do your own
 

10573
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:46,550
before class where you can do your own
drilling where you can make your own

10574
03:28:46,550 --> 03:28:46,560
drilling where you can make your own
 

10575
03:28:46,560 --> 03:28:49,570
drilling where you can make your own
inquiries and during sparring

10576
03:28:49,570 --> 03:28:49,580
inquiries and during sparring
 

10577
03:28:49,580 --> 03:28:52,130
inquiries and during sparring
there's no rigorous control over what

10578
03:28:52,130 --> 03:28:52,140
there's no rigorous control over what
 

10579
03:28:52,140 --> 03:28:54,469
there's no rigorous control over what
you do you can try to work the game into

10580
03:28:54,469 --> 03:28:54,479
you do you can try to work the game into
 

10581
03:28:54,479 --> 03:28:57,349
you do you can try to work the game into
the areas of focus so for example if you

10582
03:28:57,349 --> 03:28:57,359
the areas of focus so for example if you
 

10583
03:28:57,359 --> 03:28:59,690
the areas of focus so for example if you
want to work on front triangles it would

10584
03:28:59,690 --> 03:28:59,700
want to work on front triangles it would
 

10585
03:28:59,700 --> 03:29:00,889
want to work on front triangles it would
be wise for you to do most of your

10586
03:29:00,889 --> 03:29:00,899
be wise for you to do most of your
 

10587
03:29:00,899 --> 03:29:03,889
be wise for you to do most of your
sparring from bottom guard positions

10588
03:29:03,889 --> 03:29:03,899
sparring from bottom guard positions
 

10589
03:29:03,899 --> 03:29:06,590
sparring from bottom guard positions
that'll give you the most opportunity

10590
03:29:06,590 --> 03:29:06,600
that'll give you the most opportunity
 

10591
03:29:06,600 --> 03:29:07,250
that'll give you the most opportunity
um

10592
03:29:07,250 --> 03:29:07,260
um
 

10593
03:29:07,260 --> 03:29:10,370
um
uh and in this sense it always begins

10594
03:29:10,370 --> 03:29:10,380
uh and in this sense it always begins
 

10595
03:29:10,380 --> 03:29:12,710
uh and in this sense it always begins
with

10596
03:29:12,710 --> 03:29:12,720

 

10597
03:29:12,720 --> 03:29:14,809

an accurate assessment of your current

10598
03:29:14,809 --> 03:29:14,819
an accurate assessment of your current
 

10599
03:29:14,819 --> 03:29:17,590
an accurate assessment of your current
skill level you've got to start there

10600
03:29:17,590 --> 03:29:17,600
skill level you've got to start there
 

10601
03:29:17,600 --> 03:29:20,570
skill level you've got to start there
then I I always encourage people to use

10602
03:29:20,570 --> 03:29:20,580
then I I always encourage people to use
 

10603
03:29:20,580 --> 03:29:23,030
then I I always encourage people to use
video camera to make the most honest

10604
03:29:23,030 --> 03:29:23,040
video camera to make the most honest
 

10605
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:25,790
video camera to make the most honest
honest appraisal you can yeah because

10606
03:29:25,790 --> 03:29:25,800
honest appraisal you can yeah because
 

10607
03:29:25,800 --> 03:29:30,550
honest appraisal you can yeah because
your own mind is not dishonest but it's

10608
03:29:30,550 --> 03:29:30,560
your own mind is not dishonest but it's
 

10609
03:29:30,560 --> 03:29:32,870
your own mind is not dishonest but it's
understandably inaccurate you tend to

10610
03:29:32,870 --> 03:29:32,880
understandably inaccurate you tend to
 

10611
03:29:32,880 --> 03:29:34,729
understandably inaccurate you tend to
feel things rather than see them when

10612
03:29:34,729 --> 03:29:34,739
feel things rather than see them when
 

10613
03:29:34,739 --> 03:29:37,010
feel things rather than see them when
you're performing jiu jitsu

10614
03:29:37,010 --> 03:29:37,020
you're performing jiu jitsu
 

10615
03:29:37,020 --> 03:29:40,190
you're performing jiu jitsu
then make a

10616
03:29:40,190 --> 03:29:40,200
then make a
 

10617
03:29:40,200 --> 03:29:42,769
then make a
a program for yourself based around what

10618
03:29:42,769 --> 03:29:42,779
a program for yourself based around what
 

10619
03:29:42,779 --> 03:29:45,769
a program for yourself based around what
you see as excellence

10620
03:29:45,769 --> 03:29:45,779
you see as excellence
 

10621
03:29:45,779 --> 03:29:46,670
you see as excellence
um

10622
03:29:46,670 --> 03:29:46,680
um
 

10623
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:49,729

look at the people in the sport who's uh
in in the area you want to work on

10626
03:29:51,290 --> 03:29:51,300
in in the area you want to work on
 

10627
03:29:51,300 --> 03:29:53,150
in in the area you want to work on
people who are renowned for skill in

10628
03:29:53,150 --> 03:29:53,160
people who are renowned for skill in
 

10629
03:29:53,160 --> 03:29:54,769
people who are renowned for skill in
that area

10630
03:29:54,769 --> 03:29:54,779
that area
 

10631
03:29:54,779 --> 03:29:57,530
that area
if possible narrow it down to people who

10632
03:29:57,530 --> 03:29:57,540
if possible narrow it down to people who
 

10633
03:29:57,540 --> 03:29:59,690
if possible narrow it down to people who
have excellence in that area and their

10634
03:29:59,690 --> 03:29:59,700
have excellence in that area and their
 

10635
03:29:59,700 --> 03:30:02,870
have excellence in that area and their
body type corresponds with your own

10636
03:30:02,870 --> 03:30:02,880
body type corresponds with your own
 

10637
03:30:02,880 --> 03:30:05,570
body type corresponds with your own
and then try to take lessons learned

10638
03:30:05,570 --> 03:30:05,580
and then try to take lessons learned
 

10639
03:30:05,580 --> 03:30:07,429
and then try to take lessons learned
from observing the Excellence in these

10640
03:30:07,429 --> 03:30:07,439
from observing the Excellence in these
 

10641
03:30:07,439 --> 03:30:09,710
from observing the Excellence in these
Elite athletes and bring elements of

10642
03:30:09,710 --> 03:30:09,720
Elite athletes and bring elements of
 

10643
03:30:09,720 --> 03:30:11,389
Elite athletes and bring elements of
them into your game

10644

them into your game
 

10645
03:30:11,399 --> 03:30:14,750
them into your game
never try to bring an elite athlete's

10646
03:30:14,750 --> 03:30:14,760
never try to bring an elite athlete's
 

10647
03:30:14,760 --> 03:30:17,570
never try to bring an elite athlete's
entire game to your game that will

10648
03:30:17,570 --> 03:30:17,580
entire game to your game that will
 

10649
03:30:17,580 --> 03:30:19,670
entire game to your game that will
create an inauthentic game on your part

10650
03:30:19,670 --> 03:30:19,680
create an inauthentic game on your part
 

10651
03:30:19,680 --> 03:30:22,250
create an inauthentic game on your part
which will always be a poor copy of what

10652
03:30:22,250 --> 03:30:22,260
which will always be a poor copy of what
 

10653
03:30:22,260 --> 03:30:25,070
which will always be a poor copy of what
you're trying to watch rather bring very

10654
03:30:25,070 --> 03:30:25,080
you're trying to watch rather bring very
 

10655
03:30:25,080 --> 03:30:27,590
you're trying to watch rather bring very
specific areas and skills that you see

10656
03:30:27,590 --> 03:30:27,600
specific areas and skills that you see
 

10657
03:30:27,600 --> 03:30:30,710
specific areas and skills that you see
and import them from different people

10658
03:30:30,710 --> 03:30:30,720
and import them from different people
 

10659
03:30:30,720 --> 03:30:32,929
and import them from different people
until eventually you find something for

10660
03:30:32,929 --> 03:30:32,939
until eventually you find something for
 

10661
03:30:32,939 --> 03:30:34,150
until eventually you find something for
yourself

10662
03:30:34,150 --> 03:30:34,160
yourself
 

10663
03:30:34,160 --> 03:30:37,190
yourself
experiment a lot okay

10664
03:30:37,190 --> 03:30:37,200
experiment a lot okay
 

10665
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:40,070
experiment a lot okay
everyone's different and so you will

10666
03:30:40,070 --> 03:30:40,080
everyone's different and so you will
 

10667
03:30:40,080 --> 03:30:43,250
everyone's different and so you will
don't see the video research as the

10668
03:30:43,250 --> 03:30:43,260
don't see the video research as the
 

10669
03:30:43,260 --> 03:30:47,389
don't see the video research as the
final word see video research the way a

10670
03:30:47,389 --> 03:30:47,399
final word see video research the way a
 

10671
03:30:47,399 --> 03:30:49,670
final word see video research the way a
writer will see a muse

10672
03:30:49,670 --> 03:30:49,680
writer will see a muse
 

10673
03:30:49,680 --> 03:30:52,969
writer will see a muse
as some someone who initiates discussion

10674
03:30:52,969 --> 03:30:52,979
as some someone who initiates discussion
 

10675
03:30:52,979 --> 03:30:58,490
as some someone who initiates discussion
opens inquiries for your own research

10676
03:30:58,490 --> 03:30:58,500

 

10677
03:30:58,500 --> 03:31:00,710

the most powerful moments you will have

10678
03:31:00,710 --> 03:31:00,720
the most powerful moments you will have
 

10679
03:31:00,720 --> 03:31:03,229
the most powerful moments you will have
on the mat come from making discoveries

10680
03:31:03,229 --> 03:31:03,239
on the mat come from making discoveries
 

10681
03:31:03,239 --> 03:31:05,929
on the mat come from making discoveries
for yourself not being told what to do

10682
03:31:05,929 --> 03:31:05,939
for yourself not being told what to do
 

10683
03:31:05,939 --> 03:31:07,670
for yourself not being told what to do
not observing someone else doing

10684
03:31:07,670 --> 03:31:07,680
not observing someone else doing
 

10685
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:11,570
not observing someone else doing
something but self-discoveries

10686
03:31:11,570 --> 03:31:11,580
something but self-discoveries
 

10687
03:31:11,580 --> 03:31:14,150
something but self-discoveries
those are the ones that will last inside

10688
03:31:14,150 --> 03:31:14,160
those are the ones that will last inside
 

10689
03:31:14,160 --> 03:31:19,010
those are the ones that will last inside
you so use video research not as the

10690
03:31:19,010 --> 03:31:19,020
you so use video research not as the
 

10691
03:31:19,020 --> 03:31:21,469
you so use video research not as the
definitive answer to your problems but

10692
03:31:21,469 --> 03:31:21,479
definitive answer to your problems but
 

10693
03:31:21,479 --> 03:31:24,290
definitive answer to your problems but
as initiating research for yourself on

10694
03:31:24,290 --> 03:31:24,300
as initiating research for yourself on
 

10695
03:31:24,300 --> 03:31:25,130
as initiating research for yourself on
the mat

10696
03:31:25,130 --> 03:31:25,140
the mat
 

10697
03:31:25,140 --> 03:31:27,530
the mat
and as time goes by and you do this more

10698
03:31:27,530 --> 03:31:27,540
and as time goes by and you do this more
 

10699
03:31:27,540 --> 03:31:28,969
and as time goes by and you do this more
and more often and more and more areas

10700
03:31:28,969 --> 03:31:28,979
and more often and more and more areas
 

10701
03:31:28,979 --> 03:31:31,010
and more often and more and more areas
of the sport I promise you you'll

10702
03:31:31,010 --> 03:31:31,020
of the sport I promise you you'll
 

10703
03:31:31,020 --> 03:31:34,370
of the sport I promise you you'll
improve yeah and I I guess when you have

10704
03:31:34,370 --> 03:31:34,380
improve yeah and I I guess when you have
 

10705
03:31:34,380 --> 03:31:37,190
improve yeah and I I guess when you have
the plan have a plan that carries across

10706
03:31:37,190 --> 03:31:37,200
the plan have a plan that carries across
 

10707
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:40,070
the plan have a plan that carries across
many training sessions so I just

10708
03:31:40,070 --> 03:31:40,080
many training sessions so I just
 

10709
03:31:40,080 --> 03:31:44,210
many training sessions so I just
remember I know this is perhaps dumb but

10710
03:31:44,210 --> 03:31:44,220
remember I know this is perhaps dumb but
 

10711
03:31:44,220 --> 03:31:47,450
remember I know this is perhaps dumb but
I I saw in my own game early on a lot of

10712
03:31:47,450 --> 03:31:47,460
I I saw in my own game early on a lot of
 

10713
03:31:47,460 --> 03:31:50,750
I I saw in my own game early on a lot of
growth it's by self-identifying a

10714
03:31:50,750 --> 03:31:50,760
growth it's by self-identifying a
 

10715
03:31:50,760 --> 03:31:51,710
growth it's by self-identifying a
problem

10716
03:31:51,710 --> 03:31:51,720
problem
 

10717
03:31:51,720 --> 03:31:54,349
problem
and coming up by myself with the

10718
03:31:54,349 --> 03:31:54,359
and coming up by myself with the
 

10719
03:31:54,359 --> 03:31:56,809
and coming up by myself with the
solution by watching uh in that case

10720
03:31:56,809 --> 03:31:56,819
solution by watching uh in that case
 

10721
03:31:56,819 --> 03:31:59,389
solution by watching uh in that case
Marcel Garcia I just thought my

10722
03:31:59,389 --> 03:31:59,399
Marcel Garcia I just thought my
 

10723
03:31:59,399 --> 03:32:02,450
Marcel Garcia I just thought my
butterfly guard was very weak and so I

10724
03:32:02,450 --> 03:32:02,460
butterfly guard was very weak and so I
 

10725
03:32:02,460 --> 03:32:05,090
butterfly guard was very weak and so I
thought okay what's the solution here I

10726
03:32:05,090 --> 03:32:05,100
thought okay what's the solution here I
 

10727
03:32:05,100 --> 03:32:08,269
thought okay what's the solution here I
I thought maybe this escort thing double

10728
03:32:08,269 --> 03:32:08,279
I thought maybe this escort thing double
 

10729
03:32:08,279 --> 03:32:09,349
I thought maybe this escort thing double
X Card

10730
03:32:09,349 --> 03:32:09,359
X Card
 

10731
03:32:09,359 --> 03:32:11,330
X Card
okay so I watched a bunch of video let

10732
03:32:11,330 --> 03:32:11,340
okay so I watched a bunch of video let
 

10733
03:32:11,340 --> 03:32:13,190
okay so I watched a bunch of video let
me try to work on this and then all I

10734
03:32:13,190 --> 03:32:13,200
me try to work on this and then all I
 

10735
03:32:13,200 --> 03:32:16,849
me try to work on this and then all I
did just this is self but uh when I

10736
03:32:16,849 --> 03:32:16,859
did just this is self but uh when I
 

10737
03:32:16,859 --> 03:32:20,150
did just this is self but uh when I
could get time by myself meaning like

10738
03:32:20,150 --> 03:32:20,160
could get time by myself meaning like
 

10739
03:32:20,160 --> 03:32:22,729
could get time by myself meaning like
not instructor guided classes but in

10740
03:32:22,729 --> 03:32:22,739
not instructor guided classes but in
 

10741
03:32:22,739 --> 03:32:24,670
not instructor guided classes but in
training I would just

10742
03:32:24,670 --> 03:32:24,680
training I would just
 

10743
03:32:24,680 --> 03:32:27,349
training I would just
every everything I would put myself into

10744
03:32:27,349 --> 03:32:27,359
every everything I would put myself into
 

10745
03:32:27,359 --> 03:32:29,809
every everything I would put myself into
butterfly and ask card and then just let

10746
03:32:29,809 --> 03:32:29,819
butterfly and ask card and then just let
 

10747
03:32:29,819 --> 03:32:33,590
butterfly and ask card and then just let
go like don't progress sweep and figure

10748
03:32:33,590 --> 03:32:33,600
go like don't progress sweep and figure
 

10749
03:32:33,600 --> 03:32:35,450
go like don't progress sweep and figure
out a way to get swept to get right back

10750
03:32:35,450 --> 03:32:35,460
out a way to get swept to get right back
 

10751
03:32:35,460 --> 03:32:37,250
out a way to get swept to get right back
to it back to and everything it was

10752
03:32:37,250 --> 03:32:37,260
to it back to and everything it was
 

10753
03:32:37,260 --> 03:32:38,870
to it back to and everything it was
annoying probably to train with me

10754
03:32:38,870 --> 03:32:38,880
annoying probably to train with me
 

10755
03:32:38,880 --> 03:32:40,729
annoying probably to train with me
because that's all I did and that's all

10756
03:32:40,729 --> 03:32:40,739
because that's all I did and that's all
 

10757
03:32:40,739 --> 03:32:42,290
because that's all I did and that's all
I thought about I bet you learned

10758
03:32:42,290 --> 03:32:42,300
I thought about I bet you learned
 

10759
03:32:42,300 --> 03:32:43,790
I thought about I bet you learned
quickly yeah I learned it's the most

10760
03:32:43,790 --> 03:32:43,800
quickly yeah I learned it's the most
 

10761
03:32:43,800 --> 03:32:46,309
quickly yeah I learned it's the most
progress I've ever made now you could

10762
03:32:46,309 --> 03:32:46,319
progress I've ever made now you could
 

10763
03:32:46,319 --> 03:32:48,769
progress I've ever made now you could
say that xguard wasn't the right

10764
03:32:48,769 --> 03:32:48,779
say that xguard wasn't the right
 

10765
03:32:48,779 --> 03:32:51,469
say that xguard wasn't the right
solution for me that maybe that wasn't

10766
03:32:51,469 --> 03:32:51,479
solution for me that maybe that wasn't
 

10767
03:32:51,479 --> 03:32:55,010
solution for me that maybe that wasn't
the weakest point for me to work on if I

10768
03:32:55,010 --> 03:32:55,020
the weakest point for me to work on if I
 

10769
03:32:55,020 --> 03:32:56,870
the weakest point for me to work on if I
were to look back now it's still to this

10770
03:32:56,870 --> 03:32:56,880
were to look back now it's still to this
 

10771
03:32:56,880 --> 03:32:59,269
were to look back now it's still to this
day sadly the week the obvious weakest

10772
03:32:59,269 --> 03:32:59,279
day sadly the week the obvious weakest
 

10773
03:32:59,279 --> 03:33:03,110
day sadly the week the obvious weakest
point of for me is escapes from much

10774
03:33:03,110 --> 03:33:03,120
point of for me is escapes from much
 

10775
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:04,490
point of for me is escapes from much
worse positions

10776
03:33:04,490 --> 03:33:04,500
worse positions
 

10777
03:33:04,500 --> 03:33:06,530
worse positions
that that should be worth them that

10778
03:33:06,530 --> 03:33:06,540
that that should be worth them that
 

10779
03:33:06,540 --> 03:33:07,670
that that should be worth them that
should have been worked on from the very

10780
03:33:07,670 --> 03:33:07,680
should have been worked on from the very
 

10781
03:33:07,680 --> 03:33:09,530
should have been worked on from the very
beginning yeah that's still today if I

10782
03:33:09,530 --> 03:33:09,540
beginning yeah that's still today if I
 

10783
03:33:09,540 --> 03:33:10,910
beginning yeah that's still today if I
were to say what's the weakest thing

10784
03:33:10,910 --> 03:33:10,920
were to say what's the weakest thing
 

10785
03:33:10,920 --> 03:33:14,210
were to say what's the weakest thing
that I should work on absolutely is even

10786
03:33:14,210 --> 03:33:14,220
that I should work on absolutely is even
 

10787
03:33:14,220 --> 03:33:14,929
that I should work on absolutely is even
um

10788
03:33:14,929 --> 03:33:14,939
um
 

10789
03:33:14,939 --> 03:33:17,450
um
even with one day a week

10790
03:33:17,450 --> 03:33:17,460
even with one day a week
 

10791
03:33:17,460 --> 03:33:20,389
even with one day a week
is escapes but yeah a lot of that has to

10792
03:33:20,389 --> 03:33:20,399
is escapes but yeah a lot of that has to
 

10793
03:33:20,399 --> 03:33:22,030
is escapes but yeah a lot of that has to
do with just uh

10794
03:33:22,030 --> 03:33:22,040
do with just uh
 

10795
03:33:22,040 --> 03:33:24,769
do with just uh
carrying like focusing on the one thing

10796
03:33:24,769 --> 03:33:24,779
carrying like focusing on the one thing
 

10797
03:33:24,779 --> 03:33:26,750
carrying like focusing on the one thing
over and over and over and over across

10798
03:33:26,750 --> 03:33:26,760
over and over and over and over across
 

10799
03:33:26,760 --> 03:33:29,809
over and over and over and over across
training sessions now it also um

10800
03:33:29,809 --> 03:33:29,819
training sessions now it also um
 

10801
03:33:29,819 --> 03:33:31,969
training sessions now it also um
I would write down on a sheet of paper

10802
03:33:31,969 --> 03:33:31,979
I would write down on a sheet of paper
 

10803
03:33:31,979 --> 03:33:33,830
I would write down on a sheet of paper
the number of times I would get an

10804
03:33:33,830 --> 03:33:33,840
the number of times I would get an
 

10805
03:33:33,840 --> 03:33:35,150
the number of times I would get an
x-card sweep

10806
03:33:35,150 --> 03:33:35,160
x-card sweep
 

10807
03:33:35,160 --> 03:33:39,550
x-card sweep
foreign

10808
03:33:39,550 --> 03:33:39,560

 

10809
03:33:39,560 --> 03:33:42,110

whatever it was like 500 sweeps a week

10810
03:33:42,110 --> 03:33:42,120
whatever it was like 500 sweeps a week
 

10811
03:33:42,120 --> 03:33:44,809
whatever it was like 500 sweeps a week
so I'll have to and then like the closer

10812
03:33:44,809 --> 03:33:44,819
so I'll have to and then like the closer
 

10813
03:33:44,819 --> 03:33:46,429
so I'll have to and then like the closer
you get to the end of the week the more

10814
03:33:46,429 --> 03:33:46,439
you get to the end of the week the more
 

10815
03:33:46,439 --> 03:33:48,889
you get to the end of the week the more
you like just pick up a small white 100

10816
03:33:48,889 --> 03:33:48,899
you like just pick up a small white 100
 

10817
03:33:48,899 --> 03:33:51,530
you like just pick up a small white 100
in a week yes your trading partners must

10818
03:33:51,530 --> 03:33:51,540
in a week yes your trading partners must
 

10819
03:33:51,540 --> 03:33:55,010
in a week yes your trading partners must
suck bro no no you start with with good

10820
03:33:55,010 --> 03:33:55,020
suck bro no no you start with with good
 

10821
03:33:55,020 --> 03:33:56,990
suck bro no no you start with with good
ones and then just get more and more

10822
03:33:56,990 --> 03:33:57,000
ones and then just get more and more
 

10823
03:33:57,000 --> 03:34:00,650
ones and then just get more and more
desperate start like finding the the kid

10824
03:34:00,650 --> 03:34:00,660
desperate start like finding the the kid
 

10825
03:34:00,660 --> 03:34:02,929
desperate start like finding the the kid
right that you can just sweep over and

10826
03:34:02,929 --> 03:34:02,939
right that you can just sweep over and
 

10827
03:34:02,939 --> 03:34:04,130
right that you can just sweep over and
over

10828
03:34:04,130 --> 03:34:04,140
over
 

10829
03:34:04,140 --> 03:34:06,050
over
um but like that number for me the

10830
03:34:06,050 --> 03:34:06,060
um but like that number for me the
 

10831
03:34:06,060 --> 03:34:08,389
um but like that number for me the
numbers for some reason were like set a

10832
03:34:08,389 --> 03:34:08,399
numbers for some reason were like set a
 

10833
03:34:08,399 --> 03:34:12,229
numbers for some reason were like set a
goal to pull off a technique

10834
03:34:12,229 --> 03:34:12,239

 

10835
03:34:12,239 --> 03:34:14,990

um it it enforced like we're staying

10836
03:34:14,990 --> 03:34:15,000
um it it enforced like we're staying
 

10837
03:34:15,000 --> 03:34:17,030
um it it enforced like we're staying
with this for a while this is a journey

10838
03:34:17,030 --> 03:34:17,040
with this for a while this is a journey
 

10839
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:18,830
with this for a while this is a journey
we're doing and then for some reason for

10840
03:34:18,830 --> 03:34:18,840
we're doing and then for some reason for
 

10841
03:34:18,840 --> 03:34:21,710
we're doing and then for some reason for
me that helped me Focus the study

10842
03:34:21,710 --> 03:34:21,720
me that helped me Focus the study
 

10843
03:34:21,720 --> 03:34:24,050
me that helped me Focus the study
to understand the Deep complexities of

10844
03:34:24,050 --> 03:34:24,060
to understand the Deep complexities of
 

10845
03:34:24,060 --> 03:34:25,490
to understand the Deep complexities of
this thing that

10846
03:34:25,490 --> 03:34:25,500
this thing that
 

10847
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:27,410
this thing that
um at least for me other people like

10848
03:34:27,410 --> 03:34:27,420
um at least for me other people like
 

10849
03:34:27,420 --> 03:34:29,330
um at least for me other people like
nobody at the gym was doing x-guard or

10850
03:34:29,330 --> 03:34:29,340
nobody at the gym was doing x-guard or
 

10851
03:34:29,340 --> 03:34:31,070
nobody at the gym was doing x-guard or
anything of that so you have to kind of

10852
03:34:31,070 --> 03:34:31,080
anything of that so you have to kind of
 

10853
03:34:31,080 --> 03:34:33,650
anything of that so you have to kind of
figure everything out yourself I'm sure

10854
03:34:33,650 --> 03:34:33,660
figure everything out yourself I'm sure
 

10855
03:34:33,660 --> 03:34:35,389
figure everything out yourself I'm sure
there's there's better ways to do that

10856
03:34:35,389 --> 03:34:35,399
there's there's better ways to do that
 

10857
03:34:35,399 --> 03:34:38,450
there's there's better ways to do that
but at least that Focus helps uh from a

10858
03:34:38,450 --> 03:34:38,460
but at least that Focus helps uh from a
 

10859
03:34:38,460 --> 03:34:40,910
but at least that Focus helps uh from a
hobbyist perspective uh what's the day

10860
03:34:40,910 --> 03:34:40,920
hobbyist perspective uh what's the day
 

10861
03:34:40,920 --> 03:34:43,370
hobbyist perspective uh what's the day
what's the perfect day in the life of

10862
03:34:43,370 --> 03:34:43,380
what's the perfect day in the life of
 

10863
03:34:43,380 --> 03:34:46,070
what's the perfect day in the life of
John donoher if we're talking about a

10864
03:34:46,070 --> 03:34:46,080
John donoher if we're talking about a
 

10865
03:34:46,080 --> 03:34:48,650
John donoher if we're talking about a
basic non-agcc

10866
03:34:48,650 --> 03:34:48,660
basic non-agcc
 

10867
03:34:48,660 --> 03:34:50,389
basic non-agcc
now your

10868
03:34:50,389 --> 03:34:50,399
now your
 

10869
03:34:50,399 --> 03:34:52,910
now your
uh I'm really grateful that you sit down

10870
03:34:52,910 --> 03:34:52,920
uh I'm really grateful that you sit down
 

10871
03:34:52,920 --> 03:34:55,550
uh I'm really grateful that you sit down
with me on a Sunday uh

10872
03:34:55,550 --> 03:34:55,560
with me on a Sunday uh
 

10873
03:34:55,560 --> 03:34:58,790
with me on a Sunday uh

in my life the monk like existence so I

11198
03:41:22,429 --> 03:41:22,439
in my life the monk like existence so I
 

11199
03:41:22,439 --> 03:41:24,710
in my life the monk like existence so I
would be amiss not to ask you one of the

11200
03:41:24,710 --> 03:41:24,720
would be amiss not to ask you one of the
 

11201
03:41:24,720 --> 03:41:27,170
would be amiss not to ask you one of the
most important questions one can

11202
03:41:27,170 --> 03:41:27,180
most important questions one can
 

11203
03:41:27,180 --> 03:41:30,769
most important questions one can
possibly ask John donaher which is on

11204
03:41:30,769 --> 03:41:30,779
possibly ask John donaher which is on
 

11205

possibly ask John donaher which is on
the topic of animal combat who wins

lion or uh one of the flavors of tiger I
 

11221
03:41:54,120 --> 03:41:55,130
lion or uh one of the flavors of tiger I
don't know who you think is more

11222
03:41:55,130 --> 03:41:55,140
don't know who you think is more
 

11223
03:41:55,140 --> 03:41:57,410
don't know who you think is more
ferocious what are the parameters to

11224
03:41:57,410 --> 03:41:57,420
ferocious what are the parameters to
 

11225
03:41:57,420 --> 03:41:59,030
ferocious what are the parameters to
consider here maybe I can throw a few

11226
03:41:59,030 --> 03:41:59,040
consider here maybe I can throw a few
 

11227
03:41:59,040 --> 03:42:01,250
consider here maybe I can throw a few
out and maybe you can give me

11228
03:42:01,250 --> 03:42:01,260
out and maybe you can give me
 

11229
03:42:01,260 --> 03:42:04,070
out and maybe you can give me
some thoughts about how much of these

11230
03:42:04,070 --> 03:42:04,080
some thoughts about how much of these
 

11231
03:42:04,080 --> 03:42:06,050
some thoughts about how much of these
parameters matter so first of all

11232
03:42:06,050 --> 03:42:06,060
parameters matter so first of all
 

11233
03:42:06,060 --> 03:42:07,790
parameters matter so first of all
intelligence

11234
03:42:07,790 --> 03:42:07,800
intelligence
 

11235
03:42:07,800 --> 03:42:11,150
intelligence
uh I do believe the gorilla is the most

11236
03:42:11,150 --> 03:42:11,160
uh I do believe the gorilla is the most
 

11237
03:42:11,160 --> 03:42:14,269
uh I do believe the gorilla is the most
intelligent I've did research for this

11238
03:42:14,269 --> 03:42:14,279
intelligent I've did research for this
 

11239
03:42:14,279 --> 03:42:14,950
intelligent I've did research for this
as you can imagine

11240
03:42:14,950 --> 03:42:14,960
as you can imagine
 

11241
03:42:14,960 --> 03:42:18,309
as you can imagine

in captivity gorillas have been

11250
03:42:31,550 --> 03:42:31,560
in captivity gorillas have been
 

11251
03:42:31,560 --> 03:42:34,550
in captivity gorillas have been
documented to show complex emotions from

11252
03:42:34,550 --> 03:42:34,560
documented to show complex emotions from
 

11253
03:42:34,560 --> 03:42:38,530
documented to show complex emotions from
family bonds the ability to use tools

11254
03:42:38,530 --> 03:42:38,540
family bonds the ability to use tools
 

11255
03:42:38,540 --> 03:42:41,690
family bonds the ability to use tools
and to be able to reason about the past

11256
03:42:41,690 --> 03:42:41,700
and to be able to reason about the past
 

11257
03:42:41,700 --> 03:42:44,389
and to be able to reason about the past
and the future that's impressive so that

11258
03:42:44,389 --> 03:42:44,399
and the future that's impressive so that
 

11259
03:42:44,399 --> 03:42:46,309
and the future that's impressive so that
that's something that at least in

11260
03:42:46,309 --> 03:42:46,319
that's something that at least in
 

11261
03:42:46,319 --> 03:42:47,990
that's something that at least in
captivity the other animals have not

11262
03:42:47,990 --> 03:42:48,000
captivity the other animals have not
 

11263
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:49,729
captivity the other animals have not
been able to do they already sound much

11264
03:42:49,729 --> 03:42:49,739
been able to do they already sound much
 

11265
03:42:49,739 --> 03:42:53,210
been able to do they already sound much
more advanced than I am

11266
03:42:53,210 --> 03:42:53,220

 

11267
03:42:53,220 --> 03:42:54,130

um

11268
03:42:54,130 --> 03:42:54,140
um
 

11269
03:42:54,140 --> 03:42:56,450
um
yeah so

11270
03:42:56,450 --> 03:42:56,460
yeah so
 

11271
03:42:56,460 --> 03:43:00,590
yeah so
that's intelligence then there is weight

11272
03:43:00,590 --> 03:43:00,600
that's intelligence then there is weight
 

11273
03:43:00,600 --> 03:43:02,150
that's intelligence then there is weight
I think that's something that you think

11274
03:43:02,150 --> 03:43:02,160
I think that's something that you think
 

11275
03:43:02,160 --> 03:43:05,630
I think that's something that you think
of at first uh the lion let's go with

11276
03:43:05,630 --> 03:43:05,640
of at first uh the lion let's go with
 

11277
03:43:05,640 --> 03:43:08,090
of at first uh the lion let's go with
the big ones that I took notes Here 550

11278
03:43:08,090 --> 03:43:08,100
the big ones that I took notes Here 550
 

11279
03:43:08,100 --> 03:43:10,429
the big ones that I took notes Here 550
pounds for big lion that's exceptionally

11280
03:43:10,429 --> 03:43:10,439
pounds for big lion that's exceptionally
 

11281
03:43:10,439 --> 03:43:12,410
pounds for big lion that's exceptionally
large like most male lines are around

11282
03:43:12,410 --> 03:43:12,420
large like most male lines are around
 

11283
03:43:12,420 --> 03:43:14,690
large like most male lines are around
450 pounds that's an exceptional Beast

11284
03:43:14,690 --> 03:43:14,700
450 pounds that's an exceptional Beast
 

11285
03:43:14,700 --> 03:43:16,570
450 pounds that's an exceptional Beast
then

11286
03:43:16,570 --> 03:43:16,580
then
 

11287
03:43:16,580 --> 03:43:18,650
then
thank you

11288
03:43:18,650 --> 03:43:18,660
thank you
 

11289
03:43:18,660 --> 03:43:20,570
thank you
um the the tiger can be larger than that

11290
03:43:20,570 --> 03:43:20,580
um the the tiger can be larger than that
 

11291
03:43:20,580 --> 03:43:22,550
um the the tiger can be larger than that
yeah much much larger

11292
03:43:22,550 --> 03:43:22,560
yeah much much larger
 

11293
03:43:22,560 --> 03:43:24,650
yeah much much larger
so we got the grizzly bear which is

11294
03:43:24,650 --> 03:43:24,660
so we got the grizzly bear which is
 

11295
03:43:24,660 --> 03:43:26,929
so we got the grizzly bear which is
probably the biggest of the bunch at uh

11296
03:43:26,929 --> 03:43:26,939
probably the biggest of the bunch at uh
 

11297
03:43:26,939 --> 03:43:29,990
probably the biggest of the bunch at uh
the large ones get to uh 1500 pounds

11298
03:43:29,990 --> 03:43:30,000
the large ones get to uh 1500 pounds
 

11299
03:43:30,000 --> 03:43:31,729
the large ones get to uh 1500 pounds
correct me some of this numbers I

11300
03:43:31,729 --> 03:43:31,739
correct me some of this numbers I
 

11301
03:43:31,739 --> 03:43:34,670
correct me some of this numbers I
believe most Grizzlies around a thousand

11302
03:43:34,670 --> 03:43:34,680
believe most Grizzlies around a thousand
 

11303
03:43:34,680 --> 03:43:37,250
believe most Grizzlies around a thousand
pounds big big beast I was looking up

11304
03:43:37,250 --> 03:43:37,260
pounds big big beast I was looking up
 

11305
03:43:37,260 --> 03:43:39,290
pounds big big beast I was looking up
the biggest but I didn't want to do the

11306
03:43:39,290 --> 03:43:39,300
the biggest but I didn't want to do the
 

11307
03:43:39,300 --> 03:43:40,610
the biggest but I didn't want to do the
biggest ever

11308
03:43:40,610 --> 03:43:40,620
biggest ever
 

11309
03:43:40,620 --> 03:43:43,130
biggest ever
I just wanted the big like the top of

11310
03:43:43,130 --> 03:43:43,140
I just wanted the big like the top of
 

11311
03:43:43,140 --> 03:43:44,570
I just wanted the big like the top of
the range because there's always the

11312
03:43:44,570 --> 03:43:44,580
the range because there's always the
 

11313
03:43:44,580 --> 03:43:46,370
the range because there's always the
range you can put it in at roughly

11314
03:43:46,370 --> 03:43:46,380
range you can put it in at roughly
 

11315
03:43:46,380 --> 03:43:49,490
range you can put it in at roughly
double that of even a very big lion

11316
03:43:49,490 --> 03:43:49,500
double that of even a very big lion
 

11317
03:43:49,500 --> 03:43:51,349
double that of even a very big lion
of course how that weight is used is

11318
03:43:51,349 --> 03:43:51,359
of course how that weight is used is
 

11319
03:43:51,359 --> 03:43:54,650
of course how that weight is used is
very important uh so there's also things

11320
03:43:54,650 --> 03:43:54,660
very important uh so there's also things
 

11321
03:43:54,660 --> 03:43:56,570
very important uh so there's also things
which I find is interesting as Anaconda

11322
03:43:56,570 --> 03:43:56,580
which I find is interesting as Anaconda
 

11323
03:43:56,580 --> 03:43:58,010
which I find is interesting as Anaconda
would just let me throw that in there

11324
03:43:58,010 --> 03:43:58,020
would just let me throw that in there
 

11325
03:43:58,020 --> 03:44:01,190
would just let me throw that in there
because there is 200 pounds what I

11326
03:44:01,190 --> 03:44:01,200
because there is 200 pounds what I
 

11327
03:44:01,200 --> 03:44:03,530
because there is 200 pounds what I
really like about that is it's not just

11328
03:44:03,530 --> 03:44:03,540
really like about that is it's not just
 

11329
03:44:03,540 --> 03:44:06,050
really like about that is it's not just
the way it's the form factor and I think

11330
03:44:06,050 --> 03:44:06,060
the way it's the form factor and I think
 

11331
03:44:06,060 --> 03:44:08,450
the way it's the form factor and I think
out of all of these the anacondas the

11332
03:44:08,450 --> 03:44:08,460
out of all of these the anacondas the
 

11333
03:44:08,460 --> 03:44:09,309
out of all of these the anacondas the
most

11334
03:44:09,309 --> 03:44:09,319
most
 

11335
03:44:09,319 --> 03:44:12,769
most
non-standard form factor which I totally

11336
03:44:12,769 --> 03:44:12,779
non-standard form factor which I totally
 

11337
03:44:12,779 --> 03:44:15,469
non-standard form factor which I totally
agree with that yeah it's like the the

11338
03:44:15,469 --> 03:44:15,479
agree with that yeah it's like the the
 

11339
03:44:15,479 --> 03:44:17,450
agree with that yeah it's like the the
uh the Knight on the chessboard it comes

11340
03:44:17,450 --> 03:44:17,460
uh the Knight on the chessboard it comes
 

11341
03:44:17,460 --> 03:44:19,429
uh the Knight on the chessboard it comes
in from a completely different angle so

11342
03:44:19,429 --> 03:44:19,439
in from a completely different angle so
 

11343
03:44:19,439 --> 03:44:23,050
in from a completely different angle so
we got that we got also uh

11344
03:44:23,050 --> 03:44:23,060
we got that we got also uh
 

11345
03:44:23,060 --> 03:44:25,849
we got that we got also uh
strength in which could be measured in

11346
03:44:25,849 --> 03:44:25,859
strength in which could be measured in
 

11347
03:44:25,859 --> 03:44:28,309
strength in which could be measured in
ability to carry stuff so this was

11348
03:44:28,309 --> 03:44:28,319
ability to carry stuff so this was
 

11349
03:44:28,319 --> 03:44:30,650
ability to carry stuff so this was
surprising to me I did look into this

11350
03:44:30,650 --> 03:44:30,660
surprising to me I did look into this
 

11351
03:44:30,660 --> 03:44:33,830
surprising to me I did look into this
carefully the grizzly bear at a thousand

11352
03:44:33,830 --> 03:44:33,840
carefully the grizzly bear at a thousand
 

11353
03:44:33,840 --> 03:44:36,170
carefully the grizzly bear at a thousand
or 1500 pounds can only carry at most

11354
03:44:36,170 --> 03:44:36,180
or 1500 pounds can only carry at most
 

11355
03:44:36,180 --> 03:44:38,389
or 1500 pounds can only carry at most
its body weight which is a lot

11356
03:44:38,389 --> 03:44:38,399
its body weight which is a lot
 

11357
03:44:38,399 --> 03:44:42,229
its body weight which is a lot
but a gorilla can carry 10 times his

11358
03:44:42,229 --> 03:44:42,239
but a gorilla can carry 10 times his
 

11359
03:44:42,239 --> 03:44:45,469
but a gorilla can carry 10 times his
body weight a gorilla can lift over 2

11360
03:44:45,469 --> 03:44:45,479
body weight a gorilla can lift over 2
 

11361
03:44:45,479 --> 03:44:48,110
body weight a gorilla can lift over 2
000 kilograms that's over 4 000 pounds

11362
03:44:48,110 --> 03:44:48,120
000 kilograms that's over 4 000 pounds
 

11363
03:44:48,120 --> 03:44:50,690
000 kilograms that's over 4 000 pounds
and gorillas themselves and adult male

11364
03:44:50,690 --> 03:44:50,700
and gorillas themselves and adult male
 

11365
03:44:50,700 --> 03:44:53,570
and gorillas themselves and adult male
weighs in around 350 to 400 400 pounds

11366
03:44:53,570 --> 03:44:53,580
weighs in around 350 to 400 400 pounds
 

11367
03:44:53,580 --> 03:44:56,630
weighs in around 350 to 400 400 pounds
yes that's so I like how in this

11368
03:44:56,630 --> 03:44:56,640
yes that's so I like how in this
 

11369
03:44:56,640 --> 03:44:59,330
yes that's so I like how in this
particular place where I found this to 2

11370
03:44:59,330 --> 03:44:59,340
particular place where I found this to 2
 

11371
03:44:59,340 --> 03:45:01,729
particular place where I found this to 2
000 kilograms is as heavy as 30 average

11372
03:45:01,729 --> 03:45:01,739
000 kilograms is as heavy as 30 average
 

11373
03:45:01,739 --> 03:45:04,670
000 kilograms is as heavy as 30 average
humans so gorillas

11374
03:45:04,670 --> 03:45:04,680
humans so gorillas
 

11375
03:45:04,680 --> 03:45:07,370
humans so gorillas
30 humans so that's carrying string and

11376
03:45:07,370 --> 03:45:07,380
30 humans so that's carrying string and
 

11377
03:45:07,380 --> 03:45:10,250
30 humans so that's carrying string and
then of course uh bite force because

11378
03:45:10,250 --> 03:45:10,260
then of course uh bite force because
 

11379
03:45:10,260 --> 03:45:12,290
then of course uh bite force because
that's one of the weapons in question

11380
03:45:12,290 --> 03:45:12,300
that's one of the weapons in question
 

11381
03:45:12,300 --> 03:45:15,229
that's one of the weapons in question
here so now this is really surprising to

11382
03:45:15,229 --> 03:45:15,239
here so now this is really surprising to
 

11383
03:45:15,239 --> 03:45:17,510
here so now this is really surprising to
me I the gorilla has worn me over

11384
03:45:17,510 --> 03:45:17,520
me I the gorilla has worn me over
 

11385
03:45:17,520 --> 03:45:19,910
me I the gorilla has worn me over
through this by the way uh intelligence

11386
03:45:19,910 --> 03:45:19,920
through this by the way uh intelligence
 

11387
03:45:19,920 --> 03:45:22,190
through this by the way uh intelligence
sucker for intelligence but the gorilla

11388
03:45:22,190 --> 03:45:22,200
sucker for intelligence but the gorilla
 

11389
03:45:22,200 --> 03:45:24,349
sucker for intelligence but the gorilla
bite force is the highest of all these

11390
03:45:24,349 --> 03:45:24,359
bite force is the highest of all these
 

11391
03:45:24,359 --> 03:45:27,769
bite force is the highest of all these
with 1300 PSI bear a second with 1200

11392
03:45:27,769 --> 03:45:27,779
with 1300 PSI bear a second with 1200
 

11393
03:45:27,779 --> 03:45:32,690
with 1300 PSI bear a second with 1200
PSI tiger is uh a third I think tiger

11394
03:45:32,690 --> 03:45:32,700
PSI tiger is uh a third I think tiger
 

11395
03:45:32,700 --> 03:45:34,790
PSI tiger is uh a third I think tiger
and Lions third with a thousand PSI

11396
03:45:34,790 --> 03:45:34,800
and Lions third with a thousand PSI
 

11397
03:45:34,800 --> 03:45:37,550
and Lions third with a thousand PSI
that's comparable and a bear is uh

11398
03:45:37,550 --> 03:45:37,560
that's comparable and a bear is uh
 

11399
03:45:37,560 --> 03:45:40,429
that's comparable and a bear is uh
anywhere from 900 to a thousand PSI

11400
03:45:40,429 --> 03:45:40,439
anywhere from 900 to a thousand PSI
 

11401
03:45:40,439 --> 03:45:42,410
anywhere from 900 to a thousand PSI
they're close but gorilla I would not

11402
03:45:42,410 --> 03:45:42,420
they're close but gorilla I would not
 

11403
03:45:42,420 --> 03:45:44,269
they're close but gorilla I would not
have expected now gorilla is not a

11404
03:45:44,269 --> 03:45:44,279
have expected now gorilla is not a
 

11405
03:45:44,279 --> 03:45:47,690
have expected now gorilla is not a
carnivore but apparently you chews it's

11406
03:45:47,690 --> 03:45:47,700
carnivore but apparently you chews it's
 

11407
03:45:47,700 --> 03:45:50,450
carnivore but apparently you chews it's
mostly it's grassy stuff right but it

11408
03:45:50,450 --> 03:45:50,460
mostly it's grassy stuff right but it
 

11409
03:45:50,460 --> 03:45:51,889
mostly it's grassy stuff right but it
like

11410
03:45:51,889 --> 03:45:51,899
like
 

11411
03:45:51,899 --> 03:45:53,929
like
it's difficult to explain why it has

11412
03:45:53,929 --> 03:45:53,939
it's difficult to explain why it has
 

11413
03:45:53,939 --> 03:45:55,849
it's difficult to explain why it has
such a powerful bite and it also of

11414
03:45:55,849 --> 03:45:55,859
such a powerful bite and it also of
 

11415
03:45:55,859 --> 03:45:57,650
such a powerful bite and it also of
course has very large in size of teeth

11416
03:45:57,650 --> 03:45:57,660
course has very large in size of teeth
 

11417
03:45:57,660 --> 03:46:01,610
course has very large in size of teeth
as well as chewing teeth so um also no

11418
03:46:01,610 --> 03:46:01,620
as well as chewing teeth so um also no
 

11419
03:46:01,620 --> 03:46:03,429
as well as chewing teeth so um also no
neck yeah

11420
03:46:03,429 --> 03:46:03,439
neck yeah
 

11421
03:46:03,439 --> 03:46:06,110
neck yeah
so because Nick begins at the top of his

11422
03:46:06,110 --> 03:46:06,120
so because Nick begins at the top of his
 

11423
03:46:06,120 --> 03:46:07,429
so because Nick begins at the top of his
head and this goes down to the shoulders

11424
03:46:07,429 --> 03:46:07,439
head and this goes down to the shoulders
 

11425
03:46:07,439 --> 03:46:09,769
head and this goes down to the shoulders
well a lot of the way they use their

11426
03:46:09,769 --> 03:46:09,779
well a lot of the way they use their
 

11427
03:46:09,779 --> 03:46:10,570
well a lot of the way they use their
teeth

11428
03:46:10,570 --> 03:46:10,580
teeth
 

11429
03:46:10,580 --> 03:46:13,429
teeth
all of these animals they the the

11430
03:46:13,429 --> 03:46:13,439
all of these animals they the the
 

11431
03:46:13,439 --> 03:46:15,290
all of these animals they the the
ultimate kill is to go for the neck the

11432
03:46:15,290 --> 03:46:15,300
ultimate kill is to go for the neck the
 

11433
03:46:15,300 --> 03:46:16,910
ultimate kill is to go for the neck the
bite in the neck I don't know exactly

11434
03:46:16,910 --> 03:46:16,920
bite in the neck I don't know exactly
 

11435
03:46:16,920 --> 03:46:19,309
bite in the neck I don't know exactly
why that is probably

11436
03:46:19,309 --> 03:46:19,319
why that is probably
 

11437
03:46:19,319 --> 03:46:20,990
why that is probably
has to do

11438
03:46:20,990 --> 03:46:21,000
has to do
 

11439
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:22,550
has to do
why is that because it's a very strong

11440
03:46:22,550 --> 03:46:22,560
why is that because it's a very strong
 

11441
03:46:22,560 --> 03:46:25,309
why is that because it's a very strong
controlled position not just that it's a

11442
03:46:25,309 --> 03:46:25,319
controlled position not just that it's a
 

11443
03:46:25,319 --> 03:46:27,410
controlled position not just that it's a
is it the same as Jiu-Jitsu you think

11444
03:46:27,410 --> 03:46:27,420
is it the same as Jiu-Jitsu you think
 

11445
03:46:27,420 --> 03:46:28,670
is it the same as Jiu-Jitsu you think
because they get to also choke them out

11446
03:46:28,670 --> 03:46:28,680
because they get to also choke them out
 

11447
03:46:28,680 --> 03:46:31,010
because they get to also choke them out
it's very much in line with Jitsu like

11448
03:46:31,010 --> 03:46:31,020
it's very much in line with Jitsu like
 

11449
03:46:31,020 --> 03:46:32,809
it's very much in line with Jitsu like
lions are famous for using strangulation

11450
03:46:32,809 --> 03:46:32,819
lions are famous for using strangulation
 

11451
03:46:32,819 --> 03:46:34,490
lions are famous for using strangulation
as their primary method of killing they

11452
03:46:34,490 --> 03:46:34,500
as their primary method of killing they
 

11453
03:46:34,500 --> 03:46:36,290
as their primary method of killing they
they get a hold of the neck and hold

11454
03:46:36,290 --> 03:46:36,300
they get a hold of the neck and hold
 

11455
03:46:36,300 --> 03:46:37,250
they get a hold of the neck and hold
until

11456
03:46:37,250 --> 03:46:37,260
until
 

11457
03:46:37,260 --> 03:46:41,150
until
um the animal drops plus uh claws

11458
03:46:41,150 --> 03:46:41,160
um the animal drops plus uh claws
 

11459
03:46:41,160 --> 03:46:43,910
um the animal drops plus uh claws
I believe the tiger and the bear use

11460
03:46:43,910 --> 03:46:43,920
I believe the tiger and the bear use
 

11461
03:46:43,920 --> 03:46:46,429
I believe the tiger and the bear use
their claws and the lion too the lion

11462
03:46:46,429 --> 03:46:46,439
their claws and the lion too the lion
 

11463
03:46:46,439 --> 03:46:49,250
their claws and the lion too the lion
right and the lion uh

11464
03:46:49,250 --> 03:46:49,260
right and the lion uh
 

11465
03:46:49,260 --> 03:46:51,590
right and the lion uh
this is something that the gorilla

11466
03:46:51,590 --> 03:46:51,600
this is something that the gorilla
 

11467
03:46:51,600 --> 03:46:53,290
this is something that the gorilla
doesn't do

11468
03:46:53,290 --> 03:46:53,300
doesn't do
 

11469
03:46:53,300 --> 03:46:56,889
doesn't do
and uh Anaconda obviously doesn't yeah

11470
03:46:56,889 --> 03:46:56,899
and uh Anaconda obviously doesn't yeah
 

11471
03:46:56,899 --> 03:46:59,090
and uh Anaconda obviously doesn't yeah
so what what do you think how do we

11472
03:46:59,090 --> 03:46:59,100
so what what do you think how do we
 

11473
03:46:59,100 --> 03:47:01,490
so what what do you think how do we
think about this also there is uh I'm

11474
03:47:01,490 --> 03:47:01,500
think about this also there is uh I'm
 

11475
03:47:01,500 --> 03:47:02,750
think about this also there is uh I'm
just not letting you talk apparently

11476
03:47:02,750 --> 03:47:02,760
just not letting you talk apparently
 

11477
03:47:02,760 --> 03:47:06,469
just not letting you talk apparently
there's uh levels of aggression in terms

11478
03:47:06,469 --> 03:47:06,479
there's uh levels of aggression in terms
 

11479
03:47:06,479 --> 03:47:08,090
there's uh levels of aggression in terms
of these are also very important

11480
03:47:08,090 --> 03:47:08,100
of these are also very important
 

11481
03:47:08,100 --> 03:47:11,510
of these are also very important
considerations yeah what what is um all

11482
03:47:11,510 --> 03:47:11,520
considerations yeah what what is um all
 

11483
03:47:11,520 --> 03:47:13,130
considerations yeah what what is um all
the considerations you've raised are

11484
03:47:13,130 --> 03:47:13,140
the considerations you've raised are
 

11485
03:47:13,140 --> 03:47:15,769
the considerations you've raised are
very important and we we would have to

11486
03:47:15,769 --> 03:47:15,779
very important and we we would have to
 

11487
03:47:15,779 --> 03:47:16,729
very important and we we would have to
address them if we're going to go

11488
03:47:16,729 --> 03:47:16,739
address them if we're going to go
 

11489
03:47:16,739 --> 03:47:18,349
address them if we're going to go

on those levels

on those levels
pushback to this analysis because the

03:50:16,680 --> 03:50:19,010
mental attributes so it's skills
attributes those are the two primary

11650
03:50:19,010 --> 03:50:19,020
attributes those are the two primary
 

11651
03:50:19,020 --> 03:50:21,290
attributes those are the two primary
ones and there's a third

11652
03:50:21,290 --> 03:50:21,300
ones and there's a third
 

11653
03:50:21,300 --> 03:50:25,250
ones and there's a third
which is your experience in using those

11654
03:50:25,250 --> 03:50:25,260
which is your experience in using those
 

11655
03:50:25,260 --> 03:50:26,929
which is your experience in using those
skills and attributes and real world

11656
03:50:26,929 --> 03:50:26,939
skills and attributes and real world
 

11657
03:50:26,939 --> 03:50:30,229
skills and attributes and real world
scenarios okay so whenever two we'll

11658
03:50:30,229 --> 03:50:30,239
scenarios okay so whenever two we'll
 

11659
03:50:30,239 --> 03:50:32,030
scenarios okay so whenever two we'll
start with two humans when two humans

11660
03:50:32,030 --> 03:50:32,040
start with two humans when two humans
 

11661
03:50:32,040 --> 03:50:34,370
start with two humans when two humans
get into a fight ask yourself what is

11662
03:50:34,370 --> 03:50:34,380
get into a fight ask yourself what is
 

11663
03:50:34,380 --> 03:50:35,830
get into a fight ask yourself what is
their skill set

11664
03:50:35,830 --> 03:50:35,840
their skill set
 

11665
03:50:35,840 --> 03:50:37,969
their skill set
what are their physical and mental

11666
03:50:37,969 --> 03:50:37,979
what are their physical and mental
 

11667
03:50:37,979 --> 03:50:40,969
what are their physical and mental
attributes and what is their experience

11668
03:50:40,969 --> 03:50:40,979
attributes and what is their experience
 

11669
03:50:40,979 --> 03:50:42,650
attributes and what is their experience
and using those in real world

11670
03:50:42,650 --> 03:50:42,660
and using those in real world
 

11671
03:50:42,660 --> 03:50:45,229
and using those in real world
applications and that will give you your

11672
03:50:45,229 --> 03:50:45,239
applications and that will give you your
 

11673
03:50:45,239 --> 03:50:46,969
applications and that will give you your
first

11674
03:50:46,969 --> 03:50:46,979
first
 

11675
03:50:46,979 --> 03:50:49,429
first
look at uh okay who's going to be the

11676
03:50:49,429 --> 03:50:49,439
look at uh okay who's going to be the
 

11677
03:50:49,439 --> 03:50:51,110
look at uh okay who's going to be the
more successful

11678
03:50:51,110 --> 03:50:51,120
more successful
 

11679
03:50:51,120 --> 03:50:51,830
more successful
um

11680
03:50:51,830 --> 03:50:51,840
um
 

11681
03:50:51,840 --> 03:50:54,229
um
then in addition to those

11682
03:50:54,229 --> 03:50:54,239
then in addition to those
 

11683
03:50:54,239 --> 03:50:56,929
then in addition to those
three General elements there's also four

11684
03:50:56,929 --> 03:50:56,939
three General elements there's also four
 

11685
03:50:56,939 --> 03:51:01,429
three General elements there's also four
more specific elements

11686
03:51:01,429 --> 03:51:01,439

 

11687
03:51:01,439 --> 03:51:03,530

what is the ability

11688
03:51:03,530 --> 03:51:03,540
what is the ability
 

11689
03:51:03,540 --> 03:51:06,769
what is the ability
of the combatants to initiate combat

11690
03:51:06,769 --> 03:51:06,779
of the combatants to initiate combat
 

11691
03:51:06,779 --> 03:51:09,769
of the combatants to initiate combat
because initiation is a big deal in

11692
03:51:09,769 --> 03:51:09,779
because initiation is a big deal in
 

11693
03:51:09,779 --> 03:51:12,349
because initiation is a big deal in
fighting the one who sees the enemy

11694
03:51:12,349 --> 03:51:12,359
fighting the one who sees the enemy
 

11695
03:51:12,359 --> 03:51:15,410
fighting the one who sees the enemy
first and can create Ambush conditions

11696
03:51:15,410 --> 03:51:15,420
first and can create Ambush conditions
 

11697
03:51:15,420 --> 03:51:16,809
first and can create Ambush conditions
or

11698
03:51:16,809 --> 03:51:16,819
or
 

11699
03:51:16,819 --> 03:51:20,510
or
initiate compact combat in an area or a

11700
03:51:20,510 --> 03:51:20,520
initiate compact combat in an area or a
 

11701
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:22,550
initiate compact combat in an area or a
Terrain which is favorable to them this

11702
03:51:22,550 --> 03:51:22,560
Terrain which is favorable to them this
 

11703
03:51:22,560 --> 03:51:25,250
Terrain which is favorable to them this
is huge in determining the uh the

11704
03:51:25,250 --> 03:51:25,260
is huge in determining the uh the
 

11705
03:51:25,260 --> 03:51:27,290
is huge in determining the uh the
outcome of battles

11706
03:51:27,290 --> 03:51:27,300
outcome of battles
 

11707
03:51:27,300 --> 03:51:29,030
outcome of battles
second

11708
03:51:29,030 --> 03:51:29,040
second
 

11709
03:51:29,040 --> 03:51:31,250
second
not only is initiation important but

11710
03:51:31,250 --> 03:51:31,260
not only is initiation important but
 

11711
03:51:31,260 --> 03:51:32,990
not only is initiation important but
disengagement is important a lot of

11712
03:51:32,990 --> 03:51:33,000
disengagement is important a lot of
 

11713
03:51:33,000 --> 03:51:34,729
disengagement is important a lot of
battles don't go according to plan and

11714
03:51:34,729 --> 03:51:34,739
battles don't go according to plan and
 

11715
03:51:34,739 --> 03:51:37,550
battles don't go according to plan and
so your ability to disengage at will and

11716
03:51:37,550 --> 03:51:37,560
so your ability to disengage at will and
 

11717
03:51:37,560 --> 03:51:40,490
so your ability to disengage at will and
break off and away from a battle is key

11718
03:51:40,490 --> 03:51:40,500
break off and away from a battle is key
 

11719
03:51:40,500 --> 03:51:43,849
break off and away from a battle is key
to success so initiation and

11720
03:51:43,849 --> 03:51:43,859
to success so initiation and
 

11721
03:51:43,859 --> 03:51:46,670
to success so initiation and
disengagement are big

11722
03:51:46,670 --> 03:51:46,680
disengagement are big
 

11723
03:51:46,680 --> 03:51:48,650
disengagement are big
the third big element

11724
03:51:48,650 --> 03:51:48,660
the third big element
 

11725
03:51:48,660 --> 03:51:52,070
the third big element
what is your ability to end a fight

11726
03:51:52,070 --> 03:51:52,080
what is your ability to end a fight
 

11727
03:51:52,080 --> 03:51:54,590
what is your ability to end a fight
okay do you have an efficient method of

11728
03:51:54,590 --> 03:51:54,600
okay do you have an efficient method of
 

11729
03:51:54,600 --> 03:51:56,690
okay do you have an efficient method of
ending conflict

11730
03:51:56,690 --> 03:51:56,700
ending conflict
 

11731
03:51:56,700 --> 03:51:58,490
ending conflict
without that

11732
03:51:58,490 --> 03:51:58,500
without that
 

11733
03:51:58,500 --> 03:52:00,229
without that
the conflict could go on to a point

11734
03:52:00,229 --> 03:52:00,239
the conflict could go on to a point
 

11735
03:52:00,239 --> 03:52:02,290
the conflict could go on to a point
where you no longer have the ability to

11736
03:52:02,290 --> 03:52:02,300
where you no longer have the ability to
 

11737
03:52:02,300 --> 03:52:06,170
where you no longer have the ability to
uh to continue it if you have some

11738
03:52:06,170 --> 03:52:06,180
uh to continue it if you have some
 

11739
03:52:06,180 --> 03:52:08,990
uh to continue it if you have some
succinct method of finishing this is

11740
03:52:08,990 --> 03:52:09,000
succinct method of finishing this is
 

11741
03:52:09,000 --> 03:52:11,510
succinct method of finishing this is
huge in combat and determining winner or

11742
03:52:11,510 --> 03:52:11,520
huge in combat and determining winner or
 

11743
03:52:11,520 --> 03:52:13,610
huge in combat and determining winner or
loser so both from a winning and a

11744
03:52:13,610 --> 03:52:13,620
loser so both from a winning and a
 

11745
03:52:13,620 --> 03:52:15,050
loser so both from a winning and a
losing position so if you don't have one

11746
03:52:15,050 --> 03:52:15,060
losing position so if you don't have one
 

11747
03:52:15,060 --> 03:52:16,610
losing position so if you don't have one
there's a much higher chance you'll lose

11748
03:52:16,610 --> 03:52:16,620
there's a much higher chance you'll lose
 

11749
03:52:16,620 --> 03:52:18,830
there's a much higher chance you'll lose
but if you have an ability to finish an

11750
03:52:18,830 --> 03:52:18,840
but if you have an ability to finish an
 

11751
03:52:18,840 --> 03:52:21,950
but if you have an ability to finish an
opponent in the conflict uh reliably

11752
03:52:21,950 --> 03:52:21,960
opponent in the conflict uh reliably
 

11753
03:52:21,960 --> 03:52:24,830
opponent in the conflict uh reliably
this is very very important in

11754
03:52:24,830 --> 03:52:24,840
this is very very important in
 

11755
03:52:24,840 --> 03:52:26,809
this is very very important in
determining success or failure

11756
03:52:26,809 --> 03:52:26,819
determining success or failure
 

11757
03:52:26,819 --> 03:52:29,570
determining success or failure
and third is your ability to endure a

11758
03:52:29,570 --> 03:52:29,580
and third is your ability to endure a
 

11759
03:52:29,580 --> 03:52:31,790
and third is your ability to endure a
conflict longer than the person you're

11760
03:52:31,790 --> 03:52:31,800
conflict longer than the person you're
 

11761
03:52:31,800 --> 03:52:34,370
conflict longer than the person you're
you're engaged in okay so engaged with

11762
03:52:34,370 --> 03:52:34,380
you're engaged in okay so engaged with
 

11763
03:52:34,380 --> 03:52:37,370
you're engaged in okay so engaged with
sorry and so you get these four more

11764
03:52:37,370 --> 03:52:37,380
sorry and so you get these four more
 

11765
03:52:37,380 --> 03:52:39,349
sorry and so you get these four more
specific elements now do you have the

11766
03:52:39,349 --> 03:52:39,359
specific elements now do you have the
 

11767
03:52:39,359 --> 03:52:42,530
specific elements now do you have the
ability to initiate contact at will do

11768
03:52:42,530 --> 03:52:42,540
ability to initiate contact at will do
 

11769
03:52:42,540 --> 03:52:44,330
ability to initiate contact at will do
you have the ability to break contact

11770
03:52:44,330 --> 03:52:44,340
you have the ability to break contact
 

11771
03:52:44,340 --> 03:52:46,670
you have the ability to break contact
and disengage at will

11772
03:52:46,670 --> 03:52:46,680
and disengage at will
 

11773
03:52:46,680 --> 03:52:49,309
and disengage at will
do you have the ability to finish your

11774
03:52:49,309 --> 03:52:49,319
do you have the ability to finish your
 

11775
03:52:49,319 --> 03:52:51,830
do you have the ability to finish your
opponent efficiently and do you have the

11776
03:52:51,830 --> 03:52:51,840
opponent efficiently and do you have the
 

11777
03:52:51,840 --> 03:52:53,630
opponent efficiently and do you have the
ability to endure longer than your

11778
03:52:53,630 --> 03:52:53,640
ability to endure longer than your
 

11779
03:52:53,640 --> 03:52:55,309
ability to endure longer than your
opponent does if you have all four of

11780
03:52:55,309 --> 03:52:55,319
opponent does if you have all four of
 

11781
03:52:55,319 --> 03:52:56,210
opponent does if you have all four of
those

those
 

11783
03:52:56,220 --> 03:52:59,929
those
that's huge for for combat that probably

11784
03:52:59,929 --> 03:52:59,939
that's huge for for combat that probably
 

11785
03:52:59,939 --> 03:53:02,389
that's huge for for combat that probably
applies to human on human everything

11786
03:53:02,389 --> 03:53:02,399
applies to human on human everything

um
 

11793
03:53:07,500 --> 03:53:09,950
um
also ask yourself

11794
03:53:09,950 --> 03:53:09,960
also ask yourself
 

11795
03:53:09,960 --> 03:53:15,729
also ask yourself
what are the most efficient

11796
03:53:15,729 --> 03:53:15,739

 

11797
03:53:15,739 --> 03:53:18,530

methods of combat

11798
03:53:18,530 --> 03:53:18,540
methods of combat
 

11799
03:53:18,540 --> 03:53:22,070
methods of combat
across the globe across all species all

11800

times
 

11803
03:53:23,279 --> 03:53:26,570
times
etc etc and you'll see that ultimately

11804
03:53:26,570 --> 03:53:26,580
etc etc and you'll see that ultimately
 

11805
03:53:26,580 --> 03:53:30,170
etc etc and you'll see that ultimately
they always come down to

11806
03:53:30,170 --> 03:53:30,180
they always come down to
 

11807
03:53:30,180 --> 03:53:32,750
they always come down to
three things

11808
03:53:32,750 --> 03:53:32,760
three things
 

11809
03:53:32,760 --> 03:53:35,870
three things
the first is concentration of force

11810
03:53:35,870 --> 03:53:35,880
the first is concentration of force
 

11811
03:53:35,880 --> 03:53:38,750
the first is concentration of force
okay one of the most successful

11812
03:53:38,750 --> 03:53:38,760
okay one of the most successful
 

11813
03:53:38,760 --> 03:53:40,849
okay one of the most successful
combat strategies of all time is the

11814
03:53:40,849 --> 03:53:40,859
combat strategies of all time is the
 

11815
03:53:40,859 --> 03:53:42,250
combat strategies of all time is the
ability to take

11816
03:53:42,250 --> 03:53:42,260
ability to take
 

11817
03:53:42,260 --> 03:53:44,870
ability to take
concentrated Force against the zone of

11818
03:53:44,870 --> 03:53:44,880
concentrated Force against the zone of
 

11819
03:53:44,880 --> 03:53:47,150
concentrated Force against the zone of
weakness in your opponent and if you can

11820
03:53:47,150 --> 03:53:47,160
weakness in your opponent and if you can
 

11821
03:53:47,160 --> 03:53:48,229
weakness in your opponent and if you can
do this

11822
03:53:48,229 --> 03:53:48,239
do this
 

11823
03:53:48,239 --> 03:53:50,750
do this
you will often break through to a point

11824
03:53:50,750 --> 03:53:50,760
you will often break through to a point
 

11825
03:53:50,760 --> 03:53:52,190
you will often break through to a point
of vulnerability attack that

11826
03:53:52,190 --> 03:53:52,200
of vulnerability attack that
 

11827
03:53:52,200 --> 03:53:53,510
of vulnerability attack that
vulnerability in a way where your

11828
03:53:53,510 --> 03:53:53,520
vulnerability in a way where your
 

11829
03:53:53,520 --> 03:53:55,550
vulnerability in a way where your
opponent cannot respond and cannot

11830
03:53:55,550 --> 03:53:55,560
opponent cannot respond and cannot
 

11831
03:53:55,560 --> 03:53:57,290
opponent cannot respond and cannot
recover from that vulnerable point being

11832
03:53:57,290 --> 03:53:57,300
recover from that vulnerable point being
 

11833
03:53:57,300 --> 03:53:59,690
recover from that vulnerable point being
broken do a high amount of damage with

11834
03:53:59,690 --> 03:53:59,700
broken do a high amount of damage with
 

11835
03:53:59,700 --> 03:54:02,210
broken do a high amount of damage with
Precision yes so this is one of the

11836
03:54:02,210 --> 03:54:02,220
Precision yes so this is one of the
 

11837
03:54:02,220 --> 03:54:04,670
Precision yes so this is one of the
great combat strategies in across the

11838
03:54:04,670 --> 03:54:04,680
great combat strategies in across the
 

11839
03:54:04,680 --> 03:54:09,349
great combat strategies in across the
animal kingdom across human history Etc

11840
03:54:09,349 --> 03:54:09,359

 

11841
03:54:09,359 --> 03:54:14,870

the second would be Ambush tactics

11842
03:54:14,870 --> 03:54:14,880

 

11843
03:54:14,880 --> 03:54:17,510

if you can Ambush an opponent with the

11844
03:54:17,510 --> 03:54:17,520
if you can Ambush an opponent with the
 

11845
03:54:17,520 --> 03:54:20,690
if you can Ambush an opponent with the
element of surprise this is huge for

11846
03:54:20,690 --> 03:54:20,700
element of surprise this is huge for
 

11847
03:54:20,700 --> 03:54:23,750
element of surprise this is huge for
success in combat they're almost all of

11848
03:54:23,750 --> 03:54:23,760
success in combat they're almost all of
 

11849
03:54:23,760 --> 03:54:25,910
success in combat they're almost all of
the truly successful Predators on this

11850
03:54:25,910 --> 03:54:25,920
the truly successful Predators on this
 

11851
03:54:25,920 --> 03:54:28,090
the truly successful Predators on this
planet are Ambush Predators

11852
03:54:28,090 --> 03:54:28,100
planet are Ambush Predators
 

11853
03:54:28,100 --> 03:54:31,910
planet are Ambush Predators
the ability to get off to a good start

11854
03:54:31,910 --> 03:54:31,920
the ability to get off to a good start
 

11855
03:54:31,920 --> 03:54:33,889
the ability to get off to a good start
in a way where opponents simply can't

11856
03:54:33,889 --> 03:54:33,899
in a way where opponents simply can't
 

11857
03:54:33,899 --> 03:54:36,170
in a way where opponents simply can't
recover is huge for combat are we

11858
03:54:36,170 --> 03:54:36,180
recover is huge for combat are we
 

11859
03:54:36,180 --> 03:54:39,349
recover is huge for combat are we
allowing ambush in our discussion

11860
03:54:39,349 --> 03:54:39,359
allowing ambush in our discussion
 

11861
03:54:39,359 --> 03:54:43,309
allowing ambush in our discussion
because humans would call this cheating

11862
03:54:43,309 --> 03:54:43,319
because humans would call this cheating
 

11863
03:54:43,319 --> 03:54:46,269
because humans would call this cheating
perhaps yes we would and

11864
03:54:46,269 --> 03:54:46,279
perhaps yes we would and
 

11865
03:54:46,279 --> 03:54:50,389
perhaps yes we would and
humans are pretty damn good at it too so

11866
03:54:50,389 --> 03:54:50,399
humans are pretty damn good at it too so
 

11867
03:54:50,399 --> 03:54:52,670
humans are pretty damn good at it too so
um uh and then the third is endurance

11868
03:54:52,670 --> 03:54:52,680
um uh and then the third is endurance
 

11869
03:54:52,680 --> 03:54:55,270
um uh and then the third is endurance
okay some uh

11870
03:54:55,270 --> 03:54:55,280
okay some uh
 

11871
03:54:55,280 --> 03:54:56,809
okay some uh
[Music]

11872
03:54:56,809 --> 03:54:56,819
[Music]
 

11873
03:54:56,819 --> 03:54:59,809
[Music]
species some people uh humans actually

11874
03:54:59,809 --> 03:54:59,819
species some people uh humans actually
 

11875
03:54:59,819 --> 03:55:01,610
species some people uh humans actually
are pretty good at this

11876
03:55:01,610 --> 03:55:01,620
are pretty good at this
 

11877
03:55:01,620 --> 03:55:04,130
are pretty good at this
um use endurance as a weapon and they

11878
03:55:04,130 --> 03:55:04,140
um use endurance as a weapon and they
 

11879
03:55:04,140 --> 03:55:06,110
um use endurance as a weapon and they
simply wear an opponent down over time

11880
03:55:06,110 --> 03:55:06,120
simply wear an opponent down over time
 

11881
03:55:06,120 --> 03:55:09,830
simply wear an opponent down over time
and break them and internationally this

11882
03:55:09,830 --> 03:55:09,840
and break them and internationally this
 

11883
03:55:09,840 --> 03:55:12,469
and break them and internationally this
can be done economically

11884
03:55:12,469 --> 03:55:12,479
can be done economically
 

11885
03:55:12,479 --> 03:55:15,889
can be done economically
um through numbers etc etc and uh and

11886
03:55:15,889 --> 03:55:15,899
um through numbers etc etc and uh and
 

11887
03:55:15,899 --> 03:55:17,809
um through numbers etc etc and uh and
you can destroy someone with just sheer

11888
03:55:17,809 --> 03:55:17,819
you can destroy someone with just sheer
 

11889
03:55:17,819 --> 03:55:19,610
you can destroy someone with just sheer
endurance yeah a lot of words throughout

11890
03:55:19,610 --> 03:55:19,620
endurance yeah a lot of words throughout
 

11891
03:55:19,620 --> 03:55:21,290
endurance yeah a lot of words throughout
human history has been Siege Warfare

11892
03:55:21,290 --> 03:55:21,300
human history has been Siege Warfare
 

11893
03:55:21,300 --> 03:55:23,990
human history has been Siege Warfare
yeah and so when you ask yourself okay

11894
03:55:23,990 --> 03:55:24,000
yeah and so when you ask yourself okay
 

11895
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:26,950
yeah and so when you ask yourself okay
which one of these animals are going to

11896
03:55:26,950 --> 03:55:26,960
which one of these animals are going to
 

11897
03:55:26,960 --> 03:55:29,389
which one of these animals are going to
be the most successful in combat ask

11898
03:55:29,389 --> 03:55:29,399
be the most successful in combat ask
 

11899
03:55:29,399 --> 03:55:31,490
be the most successful in combat ask
yourself well there's these three

11900
03:55:31,490 --> 03:55:31,500
yourself well there's these three
 

11901
03:55:31,500 --> 03:55:33,590
yourself well there's these three
Elements which tend to determine

11902
03:55:33,590 --> 03:55:33,600
Elements which tend to determine
 

11903
03:55:33,600 --> 03:55:36,170
Elements which tend to determine
Successful Failure and warfare

11904
03:55:36,170 --> 03:55:36,180
Successful Failure and warfare
 

11905
03:55:36,180 --> 03:55:38,269
Successful Failure and warfare
um which animals exhibit these three

11906
03:55:38,269 --> 03:55:38,279
um which animals exhibit these three
 

11907
03:55:38,279 --> 03:55:40,550
um which animals exhibit these three
principles the best and we'll discuss

11908
03:55:40,550 --> 03:55:40,560
principles the best and we'll discuss
 

11909
03:55:40,560 --> 03:55:43,910
principles the best and we'll discuss
this but as far as um

11910
03:55:43,910 --> 03:55:43,920
this but as far as um
 

11911
03:55:43,920 --> 03:55:47,990
this but as far as um
uh generalities go uh whenever you ask a

11912
03:55:47,990 --> 03:55:48,000
uh generalities go uh whenever you ask a
 

11913
03:55:48,000 --> 03:55:49,969
uh generalities go uh whenever you ask a
question who will win between a and b

11914
03:55:49,969 --> 03:55:49,979
question who will win between a and b
 

11915
03:55:49,979 --> 03:55:51,590
question who will win between a and b
ask yourself

11916
03:55:51,590 --> 03:55:51,600
ask yourself
 

11917
03:55:51,600 --> 03:55:53,570
ask yourself
in terms of the light of what we've just

11918
03:55:53,570 --> 03:55:53,580
in terms of the light of what we've just
 

11919
03:55:53,580 --> 03:55:56,150
in terms of the light of what we've just
discussed

11920
03:55:56,150 --> 03:55:56,160

 

11921
03:55:56,160 --> 03:55:58,010

what is their skill set

11922
03:55:58,010 --> 03:55:58,020
what is their skill set
 

11923
03:55:58,020 --> 03:56:00,349
what is their skill set
what are their attributes both mental

11924
03:56:00,349 --> 03:56:00,359
what are their attributes both mental
 

11925
03:56:00,359 --> 03:56:03,349
what are their attributes both mental
and physical what is their experience in

11926
03:56:03,349 --> 03:56:03,359
and physical what is their experience in
 

11927
03:56:03,359 --> 03:56:05,210
and physical what is their experience in
utilizing these in real world situations

11928
03:56:05,210 --> 03:56:05,220
utilizing these in real world situations
 

11929
03:56:05,220 --> 03:56:08,090
utilizing these in real world situations
and then the four uh more technical

11930
03:56:08,090 --> 03:56:08,100
and then the four uh more technical
 

11931
03:56:08,100 --> 03:56:09,710
and then the four uh more technical
elements who gets to initiate contact

11932
03:56:09,710 --> 03:56:09,720
elements who gets to initiate contact
 

11933
03:56:09,720 --> 03:56:12,229
elements who gets to initiate contact
can you break off contact at any given

11934
03:56:12,229 --> 03:56:12,239
can you break off contact at any given
 

11935
03:56:12,239 --> 03:56:15,229
can you break off contact at any given
time uh what is your endurance can you

11936
03:56:15,229 --> 03:56:15,239
time uh what is your endurance can you
 

11937
03:56:15,239 --> 03:56:16,330
time uh what is your endurance can you
keep going

11938
03:56:16,330 --> 03:56:16,340
keep going
 

11939
03:56:16,340 --> 03:56:19,429
keep going
longer than your opponent does so a

11940
03:56:19,429 --> 03:56:19,439
longer than your opponent does so a
 

11941
03:56:19,439 --> 03:56:21,889
longer than your opponent does so a
skill set I wonder if a big component of

11942
03:56:21,889 --> 03:56:21,899
skill set I wonder if a big component of
 

11943
03:56:21,899 --> 03:56:23,990
skill set I wonder if a big component of
that of how much practice there is off

11944
03:56:23,990 --> 03:56:24,000
that of how much practice there is off
 

11945
03:56:24,000 --> 03:56:25,689
that of how much practice there is off
off the battle exactly so how much

11946
03:56:25,689 --> 03:56:25,699
off the battle exactly so how much
 

11947
03:56:25,699 --> 03:56:28,010
off the battle exactly so how much
quote-unquote you would probably call it

11948
03:56:28,010 --> 03:56:28,020
quote-unquote you would probably call it
 

11949
03:56:28,020 --> 03:56:28,910
quote-unquote you would probably call it
play

11950
03:56:28,910 --> 03:56:28,920
play
 

11951
03:56:28,920 --> 03:56:30,769
play
like play fighting let's start going

11952
03:56:30,769 --> 03:56:30,779
like play fighting let's start going
 

11953
03:56:30,779 --> 03:56:32,990
like play fighting let's start going
through our animals okay when you look

11954
03:56:32,990 --> 03:56:33,000
through our animals okay when you look
 

11955
03:56:33,000 --> 03:56:34,309
through our animals okay when you look
at the gorilla

11956
03:56:34,309 --> 03:56:34,319
at the gorilla
 

11957
03:56:34,319 --> 03:56:36,229
at the gorilla
you will see immediately that almost

11958
03:56:36,229 --> 03:56:36,239
you will see immediately that almost
 

11959
03:56:36,239 --> 03:56:39,229
you will see immediately that almost
every experience a gorilla has of combat

11960
03:56:39,229 --> 03:56:39,239
every experience a gorilla has of combat
 

11961
03:56:39,239 --> 03:56:41,450
every experience a gorilla has of combat
is theatrical

11962
03:56:41,450 --> 03:56:41,460
is theatrical
 

11963
03:56:41,460 --> 03:56:45,650
is theatrical
yes they don't engage in killing things

11964

and it does have the like the force the

practice it doesn't have the experience
 

12233
04:02:29,520 --> 04:02:32,750
practice it doesn't have the experience
but don't you think

12234
04:02:32,750 --> 04:02:32,760
but don't you think

least a little bit here there's a reason
why humans this is like evidence that

why humans this is like evidence that
 

12249
04:02:50,460 --> 04:02:53,929
why humans this is like evidence that
you know humans have spread all across

why okay intelligence is a huge huge

12254
04:03:00,410 --> 04:03:00,420
why okay intelligence is a huge huge

04:03:02,880 --> 04:03:05,929
asset humanity is positive proof that it
is the most important asset but it takes

is the most important asset but it takes
 

12259
04:03:05,939 --> 04:03:08,809
is the most important asset but it takes

um and gorillas have a lot of work to do

12270
04:03:19,189 --> 04:03:19,199
um and gorillas have a lot of work to do
 

12271
04:03:19,199 --> 04:03:22,189
um and gorillas have a lot of work to do
before they get to that level uh humans

12272
04:03:22,189 --> 04:03:22,199
before they get to that level uh humans
 

12273
04:03:22,199 --> 04:03:24,650
before they get to that level uh humans
can use it you said in theory gorillas

12274
04:03:24,650 --> 04:03:24,660
can use it you said in theory gorillas
 

12275
04:03:24,660 --> 04:03:25,790
can use it you said in theory gorillas
could do this but let's talk about

12276
04:03:25,790 --> 04:03:25,800
could do this but let's talk about
 

12277
04:03:25,800 --> 04:03:28,630
could do this but let's talk about
practice now first off there are many

12278
04:03:28,630 --> 04:03:28,640

not there's a bunch of bitch-ass
gorillas walking around we know this

gorillas walking around we know this
 

12289
04:03:38,939 --> 04:03:41,750
gorillas walking around we know this
we're asking not anecdotal it was

we're asking not anecdotal it was
 

12291
04:03:41,760 --> 04:03:43,849
we're asking not anecdotal it was
observed by a group of people who

observed by a group of people who
 

12293
04:03:43,859 --> 04:03:45,889
observed by a group of people who
specialized in in observing gorillas

12295
04:03:45,899 --> 04:03:48,410

over a 12-year period they regularly

12296
04:03:48,410 --> 04:03:48,420
over a 12-year period they regularly
 

12297
04:03:48,420 --> 04:03:53,929
over a 12-year period they regularly
found gorilla toes in lipidification

12298
04:03:53,929 --> 04:03:53,939
found gorilla toes in lipidification
 

12299
04:03:53,939 --> 04:03:57,170
found gorilla toes in lipidification
um they also saw that over a certain

12300
04:03:57,170 --> 04:03:57,180
um they also saw that over a certain
 

12301
04:03:57,180 --> 04:03:59,870
um they also saw that over a certain
period some 36 gorillas have been killed

12302
04:03:59,870 --> 04:03:59,880
period some 36 gorillas have been killed
 

12303

and evidence strongly suggested leopard

and evidence strongly suggested leopard
 

12305
04:04:03,420 --> 04:04:05,870

predation was the reason apparently the

predation was the reason apparently the
 

12307
04:04:05,880 --> 04:04:08,330
predation was the reason apparently the
leopards had figured out that there is a

12308
04:04:08,330 --> 04:04:08,340
leopards had figured out that there is a
 

12309
04:04:08,340 --> 04:04:09,769
leopards had figured out that there is a
femoral artery

12310
04:04:09,769 --> 04:04:09,779
femoral artery
 

12311
04:04:09,779 --> 04:04:12,349
femoral artery
and gorilla's legs and we're doing a

12312
04:04:12,349 --> 04:04:12,359
and gorilla's legs and we're doing a
 

12313
04:04:12,359 --> 04:04:13,910
and gorilla's legs and we're doing a
move which from the sounds of it sounds

12314
04:04:13,910 --> 04:04:13,920
move which from the sounds of it sounds
 

12315
04:04:13,920 --> 04:04:15,769
move which from the sounds of it sounds
a lot like a baron bolo where they were

12316
04:04:15,769 --> 04:04:15,779
a lot like a baron bolo where they were
 

12317
04:04:15,779 --> 04:04:17,389
a lot like a baron bolo where they were
spinning underneath gorillas and biting

12318
04:04:17,389 --> 04:04:17,399
spinning underneath gorillas and biting
 

12319
04:04:17,399 --> 04:04:19,309
spinning underneath gorillas and biting
the femoral artery and then disengaging

12320
04:04:19,309 --> 04:04:19,319
the femoral artery and then disengaging
 

12321
04:04:19,319 --> 04:04:20,809
the femoral artery and then disengaging
and watching them bleed out and die and

12322
04:04:20,809 --> 04:04:20,819
and watching them bleed out and die and
 

12323
04:04:20,819 --> 04:04:24,530
and watching them bleed out and die and
then eating them now a leopard

12324
04:04:24,530 --> 04:04:24,540
then eating them now a leopard
 

12325
04:04:24,540 --> 04:04:28,429
then eating them now a leopard
is no match for a lion it the only

04:04:28,429 --> 04:04:28,439
is no match for a lion it the only
 

12327
04:04:28,439 --> 04:04:30,110
is no match for a lion it the only
defense it has to align is to run up a

12328
04:04:30,110 --> 04:04:30,120
defense it has to align is to run up a
 

12329
04:04:30,120 --> 04:04:32,570
defense it has to align is to run up a
tree it cannot engage with a lion on

12330
04:04:32,570 --> 04:04:32,580
tree it cannot engage with a lion on
 

12331
04:04:32,580 --> 04:04:35,330

anything close to equal terms it may

12332
04:04:35,330 --> 04:04:35,340
anything close to equal terms it may
 

12333
04:04:35,340 --> 04:04:36,710
anything close to equal terms it may
seem like we're going out of tangents

12334
04:04:36,710 --> 04:04:36,720
seem like we're going out of tangents
 

12335
04:04:36,720 --> 04:04:38,389
seem like we're going out of tangents
but we're not just because of the foot

12336
04:04:38,389 --> 04:04:38,399
but we're not just because of the foot
 

12337
04:04:38,399 --> 04:04:40,490
but we're not just because of the foot
the attack of the artery and the foot

12338
04:04:40,490 --> 04:04:40,500
the attack of the artery and the foot
 

12339
04:04:40,500 --> 04:04:43,429
the attack of the artery and the foot
is there weaknesses that the lion might

04:04:43,429 --> 04:04:43,439
is there weaknesses that the lion might
 

12341
04:04:43,439 --> 04:04:45,650
is there weaknesses that the lion might
have of that what I'm saying is I I know

04:04:45,650 --> 04:04:45,660
have of that what I'm saying is I I know
 

12343
04:04:45,660 --> 04:04:47,929
have of that what I'm saying is I I know
it's not equivalent but the the fact

12344
04:04:47,929 --> 04:04:47,939
it's not equivalent but the the fact
 

12345
04:04:47,939 --> 04:04:50,389
it's not equivalent but the the fact
that a leopard does so well against even

12346
04:04:50,389 --> 04:04:50,399
that a leopard does so well against even
 

12347

suspicious of a gorilla's ability to

suspicious of a gorilla's ability to

fair enough let's also go further into

this let's talk about concentration of

this let's talk about concentration of
 

12359
04:05:01,020 --> 04:05:02,150
this let's talk about concentration of
force

12360
04:05:02,150 --> 04:05:02,160
force
 

12361
04:05:02,160 --> 04:05:04,610
force
the lion has the quintessential

12362
04:05:04,610 --> 04:05:04,620
the lion has the quintessential
 

12363
04:05:04,620 --> 04:05:06,889
the lion has the quintessential
concentration of force which is fangs

12364
04:05:06,889 --> 04:05:06,899
concentration of force which is fangs
 

12365
04:05:06,899 --> 04:05:10,189
concentration of force which is fangs
and claws

12366
04:05:10,189 --> 04:05:10,199

 

12367
04:05:10,199 --> 04:05:12,889

the gorilla is the exact opposite it

12368
04:05:12,889 --> 04:05:12,899
the gorilla is the exact opposite it
 

12369
04:05:12,899 --> 04:05:14,809
the gorilla is the exact opposite it
can't even make a fist

12370
04:05:14,809 --> 04:05:14,819
can't even make a fist
 

12371
04:05:14,819 --> 04:05:17,269
can't even make a fist
and so it can only throw open-handed

12372
04:05:17,269 --> 04:05:17,279
and so it can only throw open-handed
 

12373
04:05:17,279 --> 04:05:19,969
and so it can only throw open-handed
slaps and grab things so it it has no

12374
04:05:19,969 --> 04:05:19,979
slaps and grab things so it it has no
 

12375
04:05:19,979 --> 04:05:21,830
slaps and grab things so it it has no
ability with its with its arms to

ability with its with its arms to
 

12377
04:05:21,840 --> 04:05:23,809
ability with its with its arms to
concentrate force in any kind of

12378
04:05:23,809 --> 04:05:23,819
concentrate force in any kind of
 

12379
04:05:23,819 --> 04:05:27,349
concentrate force in any kind of
efficient way when a lion or a tiger

at you it's got four Claws from four to

12384
04:05:32,330 --> 04:05:32,340
at you it's got four Claws from four to
 

12385
04:05:32,340 --> 04:05:35,330
at you it's got four Claws from four to
six inches long it's like four blades

12386
04:05:35,330 --> 04:05:35,340
six inches long it's like four blades

going into you they can retract their
 

12389
04:05:36,960 --> 04:05:38,750
going into you they can retract their
claws so they're always sharp but the

04:05:38,750 --> 04:05:38,760
claws so they're always sharp but the
 

12391
04:05:38,760 --> 04:05:40,969
claws so they're always sharp but the
reach is significantly longer for the

reach is significantly longer for the
 

12393
04:05:40,979 --> 04:05:43,790
reach is significantly longer for the
gorilla the length of the the ability to

gorilla the length of the the ability to
 

12395

12397
04:05:45,840 --> 04:05:48,530
engage with speed on the part of the the
cats is is far far greater and also

Barbados this is the bear has the same

04:05:55,389 --> 04:05:55,399
Barbados this is the bear has the same
 

12405
04:05:55,399 --> 04:05:58,969
Barbados this is the bear has the same
no impact humans will bipedal and lions

12406
04:05:58,969 --> 04:05:58,979
no impact humans will bipedal and lions

no impact humans will bipedal and lions
kill 240 humans a year on average

kill 240 humans a year on average
 

12409
04:06:01,380 --> 04:06:02,870
kill 240 humans a year on average
hmm

12410
04:06:02,870 --> 04:06:02,880
hmm
 

12411
04:06:02,880 --> 04:06:06,290
hmm
so okay okay okay what about bear no

12412
04:06:06,290 --> 04:06:06,300
so okay okay okay what about bear no
 

12413
04:06:06,300 --> 04:06:08,150
so okay okay okay what about bear no
because there beer is a difference for

12414
04:06:08,150 --> 04:06:08,160
because there beer is a difference for
 

12415
04:06:08,160 --> 04:06:10,550
because there beer is a difference for
all the same things that a lion has

12416
04:06:10,550 --> 04:06:10,560
all the same things that a lion has
 

12417
04:06:10,560 --> 04:06:13,849
all the same things that a lion has
the claws the teeth yeah has more weight

12418
04:06:13,849 --> 04:06:13,859
the claws the teeth yeah has more weight
 

12419
04:06:13,859 --> 04:06:18,830
the claws the teeth yeah has more weight
it has more strength has more power

12420
04:06:18,830 --> 04:06:18,840
it has more strength has more power
 

12421
04:06:18,840 --> 04:06:20,870
it has more strength has more power
okay now this is an interesting question

12422
04:06:20,870 --> 04:06:20,880
okay now this is an interesting question
 

12423
04:06:20,880 --> 04:06:23,269
okay now this is an interesting question
okay you get a fully grown North

12424
04:06:23,269 --> 04:06:23,279
okay you get a fully grown North
 

12425
04:06:23,279 --> 04:06:25,370
okay you get a fully grown North
American Grizzly this is an African lion

12426
04:06:25,370 --> 04:06:25,380
American Grizzly this is an African lion
 

12427
04:06:25,380 --> 04:06:27,110
American Grizzly this is an African lion
this is an interesting fact I also have

12428
04:06:27,110 --> 04:06:27,120
this is an interesting fact I also have
 

12429
04:06:27,120 --> 04:06:29,030
this is an interesting fact I also have
questions about polar bears it's unclear

12430
04:06:29,030 --> 04:06:29,040
questions about polar bears it's unclear
 

12431
04:06:29,040 --> 04:06:30,650
questions about polar bears it's unclear
to me because they're big they're bigger

12432
04:06:30,650 --> 04:06:30,660
to me because they're big they're bigger
 

12433
04:06:30,660 --> 04:06:33,889
to me because they're big they're bigger
in every way than than a Grizzly yes but

12434
04:06:33,889 --> 04:06:33,899
in every way than than a Grizzly yes but
 

12435
04:06:33,899 --> 04:06:35,030
in every way than than a Grizzly yes but
they probably don't get the experience

12436
04:06:35,030 --> 04:06:35,040
they probably don't get the experience
 

12437
04:06:35,040 --> 04:06:36,950
they probably don't get the experience
in the practice yeah also they have a

12438
04:06:36,950 --> 04:06:36,960
in the practice yeah also they have a
 

12439
04:06:36,960 --> 04:06:40,790
in the practice yeah also they have a
much more limited set of uh animals that

12440
04:06:40,790 --> 04:06:40,800
much more limited set of uh animals that
 

12441
04:06:40,800 --> 04:06:43,670
much more limited set of uh animals that
they've they Prey Upon so I'm pretty

12442
04:06:43,670 --> 04:06:43,680
they've they Prey Upon so I'm pretty
 

12443
04:06:43,680 --> 04:06:45,229
they've they Prey Upon so I'm pretty
sure Grizzly is going to be tough to

12444
04:06:45,229 --> 04:06:45,239
sure Grizzly is going to be tough to
 

12445
04:06:45,239 --> 04:06:48,229
sure Grizzly is going to be tough to
beat as far as Top beer goes

12446
04:06:48,229 --> 04:06:48,239
beat as far as Top beer goes
 

12447
04:06:48,239 --> 04:06:50,450
beat as far as Top beer goes
um

12448
04:06:50,450 --> 04:06:50,460

 

12449
04:06:50,460 --> 04:06:52,250

a grizzly bear

12450
04:06:52,250 --> 04:06:52,260
a grizzly bear
 

12451
04:06:52,260 --> 04:06:54,650
a grizzly bear
I believe would be a formidable

12452
04:06:54,650 --> 04:06:54,660
I believe would be a formidable
 

12453
04:06:54,660 --> 04:06:57,650
I believe would be a formidable
adversary even for a for a male lion

12454
04:06:57,650 --> 04:06:57,660
adversary even for a for a male lion
 

12455
04:06:57,660 --> 04:07:00,170
adversary even for a for a male lion
um they're literally twice their size

12456
04:07:00,170 --> 04:07:00,180
um they're literally twice their size
 

12457
04:07:00,180 --> 04:07:03,530
um they're literally twice their size
they have an ability to get away from

12458
04:07:03,530 --> 04:07:03,540
they have an ability to get away from
 

12459
04:07:03,540 --> 04:07:05,689
they have an ability to get away from
strangleholds by standing up on two legs

12460
04:07:05,689 --> 04:07:05,699
strangleholds by standing up on two legs
 

12461
04:07:05,699 --> 04:07:07,849
strangleholds by standing up on two legs
so the Lion's primary method of killing

12462
04:07:07,849 --> 04:07:07,859
so the Lion's primary method of killing
 

12463
04:07:07,859 --> 04:07:09,830
so the Lion's primary method of killing
which is the strangle would be very

12464
04:07:09,830 --> 04:07:09,840
which is the strangle would be very
 

12465
04:07:09,840 --> 04:07:13,189
which is the strangle would be very
difficult for them to employ upon a bear

12466
04:07:13,189 --> 04:07:13,199
difficult for them to employ upon a bear
 

12467
04:07:13,199 --> 04:07:14,030
difficult for them to employ upon a bear
um

12468
04:07:14,030 --> 04:07:14,040
um
 

12469
04:07:14,040 --> 04:07:16,250
um
interestingly the Bear's primary method

12470
04:07:16,250 --> 04:07:16,260
interestingly the Bear's primary method
 

12471
04:07:16,260 --> 04:07:19,250
interestingly the Bear's primary method
of killing is to pin it pins animals and

12472
04:07:19,250 --> 04:07:19,260
of killing is to pin it pins animals and
 

12473
04:07:19,260 --> 04:07:20,570
of killing is to pin it pins animals and
then just slowly eats them while they're

12474
04:07:20,570 --> 04:07:20,580
then just slowly eats them while they're
 

12475
04:07:20,580 --> 04:07:22,849
then just slowly eats them while they're
still alive they have a rather barbaric

12476
04:07:22,849 --> 04:07:22,859
still alive they have a rather barbaric
 

12477
04:07:22,859 --> 04:07:25,309
still alive they have a rather barbaric
means of killing lions are much more

12478
04:07:25,309 --> 04:07:25,319
means of killing lions are much more
 

12479
04:07:25,319 --> 04:07:27,710
means of killing lions are much more
Humane in the way they kill

12480
04:07:27,710 --> 04:07:27,720
Humane in the way they kill
 

12481
04:07:27,720 --> 04:07:29,630
Humane in the way they kill
um

12482
04:07:29,630 --> 04:07:29,640
um
 

12483
04:07:29,640 --> 04:07:32,030
um
I what I see is the primary problem is

12484
04:07:32,030 --> 04:07:32,040
I what I see is the primary problem is
 

12485
04:07:32,040 --> 04:07:33,650
I what I see is the primary problem is
that neither one would ever be able to

12486
04:07:33,650 --> 04:07:33,660
that neither one would ever be able to
 

12487
04:07:33,660 --> 04:07:35,929
that neither one would ever be able to
kill the other uh that finishing thing

12488
04:07:35,929 --> 04:07:35,939
kill the other uh that finishing thing
 

12489
04:07:35,939 --> 04:07:38,809
kill the other uh that finishing thing
yeah they both fail on the finishing

12490
04:07:38,809 --> 04:07:38,819
yeah they both fail on the finishing
 

12491
04:07:38,819 --> 04:07:39,950
yeah they both fail on the finishing
criteria

12492
04:07:39,950 --> 04:07:39,960
criteria
 

12493
04:07:39,960 --> 04:07:41,870
criteria
the lion would not be able to strangle a

12494
04:07:41,870 --> 04:07:41,880
the lion would not be able to strangle a
 

12495
04:07:41,880 --> 04:07:43,490
the lion would not be able to strangle a
bear even in the best case scenario

12496
04:07:43,490 --> 04:07:43,500
bear even in the best case scenario
 

12497
04:07:43,500 --> 04:07:45,950
bear even in the best case scenario
where he got his teeth into the neck the

12498
04:07:45,950 --> 04:07:45,960
where he got his teeth into the neck the
 

12499
04:07:45,960 --> 04:07:47,809
where he got his teeth into the neck the
bear can stand up and and presumably

12500
04:07:47,809 --> 04:07:47,819
bear can stand up and and presumably
 

12501
04:07:47,819 --> 04:07:49,670
bear can stand up and and presumably
Shake him off

12502
04:07:49,670 --> 04:07:49,680
Shake him off
 

12503
04:07:49,680 --> 04:07:55,010
Shake him off
um uh the uh the the the the bear would

12504
04:07:55,010 --> 04:07:55,020
um uh the uh the the the the bear would
 

12505
04:07:55,020 --> 04:07:57,590
um uh the uh the the the the bear would
never be able to pin a line for long

12506
04:07:57,590 --> 04:07:57,600
never be able to pin a line for long
 

12507
04:07:57,600 --> 04:07:58,969
never be able to pin a line for long
enough to better hold it down and and

12508
04:07:58,969 --> 04:07:58,979
enough to better hold it down and and
 

12509
04:07:58,979 --> 04:08:01,250
enough to better hold it down and and
slowly Maul it over time the way it can

12510
04:08:01,250 --> 04:08:01,260
slowly Maul it over time the way it can
 

12511
04:08:01,260 --> 04:08:04,790
slowly Maul it over time the way it can
with an elk or a caribou so I don't

12512
04:08:04,790 --> 04:08:04,800
with an elk or a caribou so I don't
 

12513
04:08:04,800 --> 04:08:06,290
with an elk or a caribou so I don't
believe either would be able to finish

12514
04:08:06,290 --> 04:08:06,300
believe either would be able to finish
 

12515
04:08:06,300 --> 04:08:08,330
believe either would be able to finish
the other they'll just become exhausted

12516
04:08:08,330 --> 04:08:08,340
the other they'll just become exhausted
 

12517
04:08:08,340 --> 04:08:09,769
the other they'll just become exhausted
it would be it would come down to

12518
04:08:09,769 --> 04:08:09,779
it would be it would come down to
 

12519
04:08:09,779 --> 04:08:11,630
it would be it would come down to
endurance now that's where things get

12520
04:08:11,630 --> 04:08:11,640
endurance now that's where things get
 

12521
04:08:11,640 --> 04:08:13,670
endurance now that's where things get
interesting because the bear is much

12522
04:08:13,670 --> 04:08:13,680
interesting because the bear is much
 

12523
04:08:13,680 --> 04:08:15,830
interesting because the bear is much
more of an endurance Hunter and the line

12524
04:08:15,830 --> 04:08:15,840
more of an endurance Hunter and the line
 

12525
04:08:15,840 --> 04:08:17,809
more of an endurance Hunter and the line
is much more of an ambush Hunter

12526
04:08:17,809 --> 04:08:17,819
is much more of an ambush Hunter
 

12527
04:08:17,819 --> 04:08:21,290
is much more of an ambush Hunter
lines quick explosive much higher top

12528
04:08:21,290 --> 04:08:21,300
lines quick explosive much higher top
 

12529
04:08:21,300 --> 04:08:23,090
lines quick explosive much higher top
speed they've got a top speed of 45 to

12530
04:08:23,090 --> 04:08:23,100
speed they've got a top speed of 45 to
 

12531

50 miles an hour a beer can do up to 35

12532
04:08:25,670 --> 04:08:25,680
50 miles an hour a beer can do up to 35
 

12533
04:08:25,680 --> 04:08:28,370
50 miles an hour a beer can do up to 35
but it can run for long periods at up to

12534
04:08:28,370 --> 04:08:28,380
but it can run for long periods at up to
 

12535
04:08:28,380 --> 04:08:30,769
but it can run for long periods at up to
25 miles an hour very long periods

12536
04:08:30,769 --> 04:08:30,779
25 miles an hour very long periods
 

12537
04:08:30,779 --> 04:08:34,490
25 miles an hour very long periods
they're mostly a uh an endurance Hunter

12538
04:08:34,490 --> 04:08:34,500
they're mostly a uh an endurance Hunter
 

12539
04:08:34,500 --> 04:08:35,990
they're mostly a uh an endurance Hunter
they just run

12540
04:08:35,990 --> 04:08:36,000
they just run
 

12541
04:08:36,000 --> 04:08:38,210
they just run
uh elk and moose down until they're

12542
04:08:38,210 --> 04:08:38,220
uh elk and moose down until they're
 

12543
04:08:38,220 --> 04:08:40,130
uh elk and moose down until they're
exhausted and then pin them and kill

12544
04:08:40,130 --> 04:08:40,140
exhausted and then pin them and kill
 

12545
04:08:40,140 --> 04:08:43,010
exhausted and then pin them and kill
them so if it came down to endurance

12546
04:08:43,010 --> 04:08:43,020
them so if it came down to endurance
 

12547
04:08:43,020 --> 04:08:45,469
them so if it came down to endurance
might go the way of the beer if there

12548
04:08:45,469 --> 04:08:45,479
might go the way of the beer if there
 

12549
04:08:45,479 --> 04:08:48,250
might go the way of the beer if there
were if they were caged up together

12550
04:08:48,250 --> 04:08:48,260
were if they were caged up together
 

12551
04:08:48,260 --> 04:08:52,389
were if they were caged up together
however there is very strong evidence

12552
04:08:52,389 --> 04:08:52,399
however there is very strong evidence
 

12553
04:08:52,399 --> 04:08:56,870
however there is very strong evidence
from both hunters and video

12554
04:08:56,870 --> 04:08:56,880
from both hunters and video
 

12555
04:08:56,880 --> 04:09:00,229
from both hunters and video
which shows on many occasions beer is

12556
04:09:00,229 --> 04:09:00,239
which shows on many occasions beer is
 

12557
04:09:00,239 --> 04:09:02,990
which shows on many occasions beer is
being chased off by

12558
04:09:02,990 --> 04:09:03,000
being chased off by
 

12559
04:09:03,000 --> 04:09:04,370
being chased off by
cougar

12560
04:09:04,370 --> 04:09:04,380
cougar
 

12561
04:09:04,380 --> 04:09:06,530
cougar
and Wolverines

12562
04:09:06,530 --> 04:09:06,540
and Wolverines
 

12563
04:09:06,540 --> 04:09:09,349
and Wolverines
now what's that that's fear what is that

12564
04:09:09,349 --> 04:09:09,359
now what's that that's fear what is that
 

12565
04:09:09,359 --> 04:09:11,389
now what's that that's fear what is that
what do you mean chased off uh if they

12566
04:09:11,389 --> 04:09:11,399
what do you mean chased off uh if they
 

12567
04:09:11,399 --> 04:09:16,189
what do you mean chased off uh if they
fight over uh uh meat which uh and say

12568
04:09:16,189 --> 04:09:16,199
fight over uh uh meat which uh and say
 

12569
04:09:16,199 --> 04:09:17,630
fight over uh uh meat which uh and say
for example a cougar has killed

12570
04:09:17,630 --> 04:09:17,640
for example a cougar has killed
 

12571
04:09:17,640 --> 04:09:19,010
for example a cougar has killed
something and the bear wants the meat

12572
04:09:19,010 --> 04:09:19,020
something and the bear wants the meat
 

12573
04:09:19,020 --> 04:09:22,370
something and the bear wants the meat
the cougar will come there risk aversion

12574
04:09:22,370 --> 04:09:22,380
the cougar will come there risk aversion
 

12575
04:09:22,380 --> 04:09:24,530
the cougar will come there risk aversion
exactly exactly the Bears are risk

12576
04:09:24,530 --> 04:09:24,540
exactly exactly the Bears are risk
 

12577
04:09:24,540 --> 04:09:26,450
exactly exactly the Bears are risk
averse what I would say is this the

12578
04:09:26,450 --> 04:09:26,460
averse what I would say is this the
 

12579
04:09:26,460 --> 04:09:29,150
averse what I would say is this the
beers are very very powerful in their

12580
04:09:29,150 --> 04:09:29,160
beers are very very powerful in their
 

12581
04:09:29,160 --> 04:09:31,010
beers are very very powerful in their
domain but they don't have the battle

12582
04:09:31,010 --> 04:09:31,020
domain but they don't have the battle
 

12583
04:09:31,020 --> 04:09:33,830
domain but they don't have the battle
experience of a lion they don't take on

12584
04:09:33,830 --> 04:09:33,840
experience of a lion they don't take on
 

12585
04:09:33,840 --> 04:09:35,990
experience of a lion they don't take on
animals as tough as a cape buffalo they

12586
04:09:35,990 --> 04:09:36,000
animals as tough as a cape buffalo they
 

12587
04:09:36,000 --> 04:09:38,210
animals as tough as a cape buffalo they
don't take on elephant what the toughest

12588
04:09:38,210 --> 04:09:38,220
don't take on elephant what the toughest
 

12589
04:09:38,220 --> 04:09:39,469
don't take on elephant what the toughest
thing it would probably take on would

12590
04:09:39,469 --> 04:09:39,479
thing it would probably take on would
 

12591
04:09:39,479 --> 04:09:43,729
thing it would probably take on would
probably be a a bull moose and uh a bull

12592
04:09:43,729 --> 04:09:43,739
probably be a a bull moose and uh a bull
 

12593
04:09:43,739 --> 04:09:46,729
probably be a a bull moose and uh a bull
moose is a formidable animal but it's

12594
04:09:46,729 --> 04:09:46,739
moose is a formidable animal but it's
 

12595
04:09:46,739 --> 04:09:48,769
moose is a formidable animal but it's
nothing like a cape buffalo it's nothing

12596
04:09:48,769 --> 04:09:48,779
nothing like a cape buffalo it's nothing
 

12597
04:09:48,779 --> 04:09:50,990
nothing like a cape buffalo it's nothing
like an elephant an elephant or a

12598
04:09:50,990 --> 04:09:51,000
like an elephant an elephant or a
 

12599
04:09:51,000 --> 04:09:52,189
like an elephant an elephant or a
hippopotamus

12600
04:09:52,189 --> 04:09:52,199
hippopotamus
 

12601
04:09:52,199 --> 04:09:55,429
hippopotamus
so what I would suggest is this

12602
04:09:55,429 --> 04:09:55,439
so what I would suggest is this
 

12603
04:09:55,439 --> 04:09:58,070
so what I would suggest is this
in the wild I don't believe either one

12604
04:09:58,070 --> 04:09:58,080
in the wild I don't believe either one
 

12605
04:09:58,080 --> 04:10:00,110
in the wild I don't believe either one
is capable of killing the other but I do

12606
04:10:00,110 --> 04:10:00,120
is capable of killing the other but I do
 

12607
04:10:00,120 --> 04:10:01,910
is capable of killing the other but I do
believe based on video evidence of

12608
04:10:01,910 --> 04:10:01,920
believe based on video evidence of
 

12609
04:10:01,920 --> 04:10:04,309
believe based on video evidence of
cougars and Wolverines chasing off beers

12610
04:10:04,309 --> 04:10:04,319
cougars and Wolverines chasing off beers
 

12611
04:10:04,319 --> 04:10:07,010
cougars and Wolverines chasing off beers
that a lion would provide

12612
04:10:07,010 --> 04:10:07,020
that a lion would provide
 

12613
04:10:07,020 --> 04:10:09,650
that a lion would provide
enough threat

12614
04:10:09,650 --> 04:10:09,660
enough threat
 

12615
04:10:09,660 --> 04:10:12,290
enough threat
in a brief fight that a bear would back

12616
04:10:12,290 --> 04:10:12,300
in a brief fight that a bear would back
 

12617
04:10:12,300 --> 04:10:15,050
in a brief fight that a bear would back
away if you put them in a cage however

12618
04:10:15,050 --> 04:10:15,060
away if you put them in a cage however
 

12619
04:10:15,060 --> 04:10:17,510
away if you put them in a cage however
where neither one could back away I

12620
04:10:17,510 --> 04:10:17,520
where neither one could back away I
 

12621
04:10:17,520 --> 04:10:19,189
where neither one could back away I
would slightly favor the bear

12622
04:10:19,189 --> 04:10:19,199
would slightly favor the bear
 

12623
04:10:19,199 --> 04:10:21,590
would slightly favor the bear
based on the fact that it neither one

12624
04:10:21,590 --> 04:10:21,600
based on the fact that it neither one
 

12625
04:10:21,600 --> 04:10:22,969
based on the fact that it neither one
can kill each other would come down to

12626
04:10:22,969 --> 04:10:22,979
can kill each other would come down to
 

12627
04:10:22,979 --> 04:10:25,130
can kill each other would come down to
endurance you mean like an octagon yeah

12628
04:10:25,130 --> 04:10:25,140
endurance you mean like an octagon yeah
 

12629
04:10:25,140 --> 04:10:27,050
endurance you mean like an octagon yeah
that's got to be the next UFC by the way

12630
04:10:27,050 --> 04:10:27,060
that's got to be the next UFC by the way
 

12631
04:10:27,060 --> 04:10:28,570
that's got to be the next UFC by the way
beer versus

12632
04:10:28,570 --> 04:10:28,580
beer versus
 

12633
04:10:28,580 --> 04:10:31,070
beer versus
things change Joe Rogan's a big fan of

12634
04:10:31,070 --> 04:10:31,080
things change Joe Rogan's a big fan of
 

12635
04:10:31,080 --> 04:10:33,170
things change Joe Rogan's a big fan of
the idea of fighting in a stadium for

12636
04:10:33,170 --> 04:10:33,180
the idea of fighting in a stadium for
 

12637
04:10:33,180 --> 04:10:35,510
the idea of fighting in a stadium for
humans fighting in a stadium hmm

12638
04:10:35,510 --> 04:10:35,520
humans fighting in a stadium hmm
 

12639
04:10:35,520 --> 04:10:38,689
humans fighting in a stadium hmm
um so in the stadium of bear I would I

12640
04:10:38,689 --> 04:10:38,699
um so in the stadium of bear I would I
 

12641
04:10:38,699 --> 04:10:41,450
um so in the stadium of bear I would I
would slightly favor beer now I still

12642
04:10:41,450 --> 04:10:41,460
would slightly favor beer now I still
 

12643
04:10:41,460 --> 04:10:43,010
would slightly favor beer now I still
think that the lion would have a chance

12644
04:10:43,010 --> 04:10:43,020
think that the lion would have a chance
 

12645
04:10:43,020 --> 04:10:45,110
think that the lion would have a chance
but I would favor the Bear in a betting

12646
04:10:45,110 --> 04:10:45,120
but I would favor the Bear in a betting
 

12647
04:10:45,120 --> 04:10:46,370
but I would favor the Bear in a betting
match

12648
04:10:46,370 --> 04:10:46,380
match
 

12649
04:10:46,380 --> 04:10:48,530
match
um some of the best evidence we have for

12650
04:10:48,530 --> 04:10:48,540
um some of the best evidence we have for
 

12651
04:10:48,540 --> 04:10:50,090
um some of the best evidence we have for
animal versus animal fights come from

12652
04:10:50,090 --> 04:10:50,100
animal versus animal fights come from
 

12653
04:10:50,100 --> 04:10:51,769
animal versus animal fights come from
the ancient Romans who actually used to

12654
04:10:51,769 --> 04:10:51,779
the ancient Romans who actually used to
 

12655
04:10:51,779 --> 04:10:56,689
the ancient Romans who actually used to
put animals in gladiatorial combat and

12656
04:10:56,689 --> 04:10:56,699
put animals in gladiatorial combat and
 

12657
04:10:56,699 --> 04:10:58,010
put animals in gladiatorial combat and
um

12658
04:10:58,010 --> 04:10:58,020
um
 

12659
04:10:58,020 --> 04:11:00,349
um
they for example had several incidents

12660
04:11:00,349 --> 04:11:00,359
they for example had several incidents
 

12661
04:11:00,359 --> 04:11:03,110
they for example had several incidents
where they wrote about tiger vs lion

12662
04:11:03,110 --> 04:11:03,120
where they wrote about tiger vs lion
 

12663
04:11:03,120 --> 04:11:07,610
where they wrote about tiger vs lion
uh conflict and uh in one famous passage

12664
04:11:07,610 --> 04:11:07,620
uh conflict and uh in one famous passage
 

12665
04:11:07,620 --> 04:11:10,130
uh conflict and uh in one famous passage
they described a lion

12666
04:11:10,130 --> 04:11:10,140
they described a lion
 

12667
04:11:10,140 --> 04:11:14,330
they described a lion
getting destroyed by a a female tiger

12668
04:11:14,330 --> 04:11:14,340
getting destroyed by a a female tiger
 

12669
04:11:14,340 --> 04:11:16,250
getting destroyed by a a female tiger
um so there's there's some evidence to

12670
04:11:16,250 --> 04:11:16,260
um so there's there's some evidence to
 

12671
04:11:16,260 --> 04:11:19,610
um so there's there's some evidence to
suggest that they had more expertise of

12672
04:11:19,610 --> 04:11:19,620
suggest that they had more expertise of
 

12673
04:11:19,620 --> 04:11:22,309
suggest that they had more expertise of
this than we do because they had a big

12674
04:11:22,309 --> 04:11:22,319
this than we do because they had a big
 

12675
04:11:22,319 --> 04:11:24,349
this than we do because they had a big
population of wild animals which they

12676
04:11:24,349 --> 04:11:24,359
population of wild animals which they
 

12677
04:11:24,359 --> 04:11:27,229
population of wild animals which they
just put to fight each other

12678
04:11:27,229 --> 04:11:27,239
just put to fight each other
 

12679
04:11:27,239 --> 04:11:29,929
just put to fight each other
um unfortunately there's nothing that

12680
04:11:29,929 --> 04:11:29,939
um unfortunately there's nothing that
 

12681
04:11:29,939 --> 04:11:33,290
um unfortunately there's nothing that
they wrote about beers versus lion they

12682
04:11:33,290 --> 04:11:33,300
they wrote about beers versus lion they
 

12683
04:11:33,300 --> 04:11:38,030
they wrote about beers versus lion they
did talk about uh bears versus bulls uh

12684
04:11:38,030 --> 04:11:38,040
did talk about uh bears versus bulls uh
 

12685
04:11:38,040 --> 04:11:41,389
did talk about uh bears versus bulls uh
they did talk about Lions versus Tigers

12686
04:11:41,389 --> 04:11:41,399
they did talk about Lions versus Tigers
 

12687
04:11:41,399 --> 04:11:43,429
they did talk about Lions versus Tigers
um but they never mentioned bear vs lion

12688
04:11:43,429 --> 04:11:43,439
um but they never mentioned bear vs lion
 

12689
04:11:43,439 --> 04:11:44,929
um but they never mentioned bear vs lion
so we don't have any evidence for that

12690
04:11:44,929 --> 04:11:44,939
so we don't have any evidence for that
 

12691
04:11:44,939 --> 04:11:46,550
so we don't have any evidence for that
so we have to be a little bit more

12692
04:11:46,550 --> 04:11:46,560
so we have to be a little bit more
 

12693
04:11:46,560 --> 04:11:48,830
so we have to be a little bit more
speculative now given that bears do get

12694
04:11:48,830 --> 04:11:48,840
speculative now given that bears do get
 

12695
04:11:48,840 --> 04:11:51,650
speculative now given that bears do get
chased off by cougar and cougar is weak

12696
04:11:51,650 --> 04:11:51,660
chased off by cougar and cougar is weak
 

12697
04:11:51,660 --> 04:11:54,170
chased off by cougar and cougar is weak
compared with a male lion they'll listen

12698
04:11:54,170 --> 04:11:54,180
compared with a male lion they'll listen
 

12699
04:11:54,180 --> 04:11:55,910
compared with a male lion they'll listen
to you draw from that by the way I would

12700
04:11:55,910 --> 04:11:55,920
to you draw from that by the way I would
 

12701
04:11:55,920 --> 04:11:58,070
to you draw from that by the way I would
suggest that is it about the Bears yeah

12702
04:11:58,070 --> 04:11:58,080
suggest that is it about the Bears yeah
 

12703
04:11:58,080 --> 04:12:00,410
suggest that is it about the Bears yeah
it's more about the bear like in theory

12704
04:12:00,410 --> 04:12:00,420
it's more about the bear like in theory
 

12705
04:12:00,420 --> 04:12:01,849
it's more about the bear like in theory
a bear should be able to crush a cougar

12706
04:12:01,849 --> 04:12:01,859
a bear should be able to crush a cougar
 

12707
04:12:01,859 --> 04:12:04,610
a bear should be able to crush a cougar
but it seems to be the beer is a scene

12708
04:12:04,610 --> 04:12:04,620
but it seems to be the beer is a scene
 

12709
04:12:04,620 --> 04:12:06,950
but it seems to be the beer is a scene
uh this thing could hurt me so I'm not

12710
04:12:06,950 --> 04:12:06,960
uh this thing could hurt me so I'm not
 

12711
04:12:06,960 --> 04:12:09,830
uh this thing could hurt me so I'm not
gonna risk injury and backs away I think

12712
04:12:09,830 --> 04:12:09,840
gonna risk injury and backs away I think
 

12713
04:12:09,840 --> 04:12:12,410
gonna risk injury and backs away I think
it would back away in the wild from a

12714
04:12:12,410 --> 04:12:12,420
it would back away in the wild from a
 

12715
04:12:12,420 --> 04:12:15,229
it would back away in the wild from a
lion but put him in a cage and I

12716
04:12:15,229 --> 04:12:15,239
lion but put him in a cage and I
 

12717
04:12:15,239 --> 04:12:17,570
lion but put him in a cage and I
slightly favor them the grizzly based on

12718
04:12:17,570 --> 04:12:17,580
slightly favor them the grizzly based on
 

12719
04:12:17,580 --> 04:12:19,630
slightly favor them the grizzly based on
endurance

12720
04:12:19,630 --> 04:12:19,640
endurance
 

12721
04:12:19,640 --> 04:12:22,550
endurance
so the final conclusion

12722
04:12:22,550 --> 04:12:22,560
so the final conclusion
 

12723
04:12:22,560 --> 04:12:24,769
so the final conclusion
if you had to just bet everything you

12724
04:12:24,769 --> 04:12:24,779
if you had to just bet everything you
 

12725
04:12:24,779 --> 04:12:27,950
if you had to just bet everything you
own so you got uh let's say we got the

12726
04:12:27,950 --> 04:12:27,960
own so you got uh let's say we got the
 

12727
04:12:27,960 --> 04:12:31,250
own so you got uh let's say we got the
Octagon we bring in a bear

12728
04:12:31,250 --> 04:12:31,260
Octagon we bring in a bear
 

12729
04:12:31,260 --> 04:12:34,309
Octagon we bring in a bear
now this is like legendary bear okay

12730
04:12:34,309 --> 04:12:34,319
now this is like legendary bear okay
 

12731
04:12:34,319 --> 04:12:36,889
now this is like legendary bear okay
full grown Grizzly full grown Grizzly

12732
04:12:36,889 --> 04:12:36,899
full grown Grizzly full grown Grizzly
 

12733
04:12:36,899 --> 04:12:39,710
full grown Grizzly full grown Grizzly
but not only that that Grizzly is seeing

12734
04:12:39,710 --> 04:12:39,720
but not only that that Grizzly is seeing
 

12735
04:12:39,720 --> 04:12:41,689
but not only that that Grizzly is seeing
some [\h__\h] what's the most it could have

12736
04:12:41,689 --> 04:12:41,699
some [\h__\h] what's the most it could have
 

12737
04:12:41,699 --> 04:12:43,550
some [\h__\h] what's the most it could have
seen a bull moose

12738
04:12:43,550 --> 04:12:43,560

criteria
 

12837
04:14:31,439 --> 04:14:33,950
criteria
um but Lions can almost always initiate

um but Lions can almost always initiate
 

12839
04:14:33,960 --> 04:14:36,590

able to have the advantage of Ambush
 

12855
04:14:53,160 --> 04:14:54,710
able to have the advantage of Ambush
um the great advantage that bears have

12856
04:14:54,710 --> 04:14:54,720
um the great advantage that bears have
 

12857
04:14:54,720 --> 04:14:57,290
um the great advantage that bears have
is endurance uh but bears are very

12858
04:14:57,290 --> 04:14:57,300
is endurance uh but bears are very
 

12859
04:14:57,300 --> 04:14:58,849
is endurance uh but bears are very
risk-averse and they're not used to

12860
04:14:58,849 --> 04:14:58,859
risk-averse and they're not used to
 

12861

04:15:01,429 --> 04:15:01,439
fighting like the toughest toughest
 

12863
04:15:01,439 --> 04:15:03,050
fighting like the toughest toughest
animals the toughest animal they fight

12864
04:15:03,050 --> 04:15:03,060
animals the toughest animal they fight
 

12865
04:15:03,060 --> 04:15:05,630
animals the toughest animal they fight
is a moose or a caribou these are not

12866
04:15:05,630 --> 04:15:05,640
is a moose or a caribou these are not
 

12867
04:15:05,640 --> 04:15:08,630
is a moose or a caribou these are not
not even close to the animals that Lions

12868
04:15:08,630 --> 04:15:08,640
not even close to the animals that Lions
 

12869
04:15:08,640 --> 04:15:10,250
not even close to the animals that Lions
have to go up against on a regular basis

12870
04:15:10,250 --> 04:15:10,260
have to go up against on a regular basis
 

12871
04:15:10,260 --> 04:15:11,990
have to go up against on a regular basis
so if somebody wins it's going to be the

12872
04:15:11,990 --> 04:15:12,000
so if somebody wins it's going to be the
 

12873
04:15:12,000 --> 04:15:15,349
so if somebody wins it's going to be the
lion for you I still think that the size

12874
04:15:15,349 --> 04:15:15,359
lion for you I still think that the size
 

12875
04:15:15,359 --> 04:15:17,750
lion for you I still think that the size
and endurance of the bear if they were

12876
04:15:17,750 --> 04:15:17,760
and endurance of the bear if they were
 

12877
04:15:17,760 --> 04:15:19,550
and endurance of the bear if they were
locked in a cage together I would still

12878
04:15:19,550 --> 04:15:19,560
locked in a cage together I would still
 

12879
04:15:19,560 --> 04:15:21,110
locked in a cage together I would still
favor the beer under those circumstances

12880

favor the beer under those circumstances
 

12881
04:15:21,120 --> 04:15:23,030
favor the beer under those circumstances
but in the wild I believe the beer will

12882
04:15:23,030 --> 04:15:23,040
but in the wild I believe the beer will
 

12883
04:15:23,040 --> 04:15:25,790
but in the wild I believe the beer will
back away in the cage no time limit you

12884
04:15:25,790 --> 04:15:25,800
back away in the cage no time limit you
 

12885

think then I would go with a lion

12890
04:15:30,050 --> 04:15:30,060
think then I would go with a lion
 

12891
04:15:30,060 --> 04:15:31,309
think then I would go with a lion
because the lion has a huge speed

12892
04:15:31,309 --> 04:15:31,319
because the lion has a huge speed
 

12893
04:15:31,319 --> 04:15:33,889
because the lion has a huge speed
Advantage so it's gonna it's gonna

12894
04:15:33,889 --> 04:15:33,899
Advantage so it's gonna it's gonna
 

12895
04:15:33,899 --> 04:15:36,830
Advantage so it's gonna it's gonna
injure it tear it up and uh and do

12896
04:15:36,830 --> 04:15:36,840
injure it tear it up and uh and do
 

12897
04:15:36,840 --> 04:15:38,510
injure it tear it up and uh and do
immediate damage like I put it this way

12898
04:15:38,510 --> 04:15:38,520
immediate damage like I put it this way
 

12899
04:15:38,520 --> 04:15:40,670
immediate damage like I put it this way

goes by that size and weight is gonna
and endurance is going to have an effect

glad I'm not an expert on that imagine
 

13819
04:34:08,100 --> 04:34:09,709
glad I'm not an expert on that imagine
what it would be

13820

once you develop an expertise about
something you can start to predict how

04:34:22,250 --> 04:34:22,260
something you can start to predict how
 

13833
04:34:22,260 --> 04:34:23,689
something you can start to predict how
things are going to unfold you get

things are going to unfold you get
 

13835
04:34:23,699 --> 04:34:27,590
things are going to unfold you get
answers before events even occur you see

13836
04:34:27,590 --> 04:34:27,600
answers before events even occur you see
 

13837

04:34:40,250 --> 04:34:40,260
systematizing something in order to
 

13849
04:34:40,260 --> 04:34:41,750
systematizing something in order to
achieve Excellence might destroy the

achieve Excellence might destroy the
 

13851
04:34:41,760 --> 04:34:44,510

very yeah and I think that the the magic

13852
04:34:44,510 --> 04:34:44,520
very yeah and I think that the the magic
 

13853
04:34:44,520 --> 04:34:45,949
very yeah and I think that the the magic
of a romantic love is the fact that

13854
04:34:45,949 --> 04:34:45,959
of a romantic love is the fact that
 

13855
04:34:45,959 --> 04:34:48,170
of a romantic love is the fact that
we're all beginners at it and the minute

13856
04:34:48,170 --> 04:34:48,180
we're all beginners at it and the minute
 

13857
04:34:48,180 --> 04:34:50,390
we're all beginners at it and the minute
you try to gain expertise in it

13858
04:34:50,390 --> 04:34:50,400
you try to gain expertise in it
 

13859
04:34:50,400 --> 04:34:52,189
you try to gain expertise in it
what does that even mean like what would

13860
04:34:52,189 --> 04:34:52,199
what does that even mean like what would
 

13861
04:34:52,199 --> 04:34:53,990
what does that even mean like what would
it mean to it would be good I didn't

13862
04:34:53,990 --> 04:34:54,000
it mean to it would be good I didn't
 

13863
04:34:54,000 --> 04:34:56,150
it mean to it would be good I didn't
think it would I think you're better off

13864
04:34:56,150 --> 04:34:56,160
think it would I think you're better off
 

13865
04:34:56,160 --> 04:34:56,990
think it would I think you're better off
just

13866
04:34:56,990 --> 04:34:57,000
just
 

13867
04:34:57,000 --> 04:34:59,029
just
having fun with it and plowing through

13868
04:34:59,029 --> 04:34:59,039
having fun with it and plowing through
 

13869
04:34:59,039 --> 04:35:00,470
having fun with it and plowing through
and making dumb mistakes and looking

13870
04:35:00,470 --> 04:35:00,480
and making dumb mistakes and looking
 

13871
04:35:00,480 --> 04:35:02,209
and making dumb mistakes and looking
like a fool and

13872
04:35:02,209 --> 04:35:02,219
like a fool and
 

13873
04:35:02,219 --> 04:35:05,750
like a fool and
um uh and then whatever

13874
04:35:05,750 --> 04:35:05,760
um uh and then whatever
 

13875
04:35:05,760 --> 04:35:08,810
um uh and then whatever
success whatever that means comes in a

13876
04:35:08,810 --> 04:35:08,820
success whatever that means comes in a
 

13877
04:35:08,820 --> 04:35:10,609
success whatever that means comes in a
kind of light-hearted frivolous kind of

13878
04:35:10,609 --> 04:35:10,619
kind of light-hearted frivolous kind of
 

13879
04:35:10,619 --> 04:35:12,109
kind of light-hearted frivolous kind of
way and

13880
04:35:12,109 --> 04:35:12,119
way and
 

13881
04:35:12,119 --> 04:35:14,510
way and
um and that I think is

13882
04:35:14,510 --> 04:35:14,520
um and that I think is
 

13883
04:35:14,520 --> 04:35:16,609
um and that I think is
over the course of a lifetime far more

13884
04:35:16,609 --> 04:35:16,619
over the course of a lifetime far more
 

13885
04:35:16,619 --> 04:35:19,551
over the course of a lifetime far more
desirable than having you know expertise

13886
04:35:19,551 --> 04:35:19,561
desirable than having you know expertise
 

13887
04:35:19,561 --> 04:35:21,890
desirable than having you know expertise
and and Affairs of love so I don't think

13888
04:35:21,890 --> 04:35:21,900
and and Affairs of love so I don't think
 

13889
04:35:21,900 --> 04:35:23,689
and and Affairs of love so I don't think
it's even a good thing to study too much

13890
04:35:23,689 --> 04:35:23,699
it's even a good thing to study too much
 

13891
04:35:23,699 --> 04:35:26,209
it's even a good thing to study too much
and I think if you did you would

13892
04:35:26,209 --> 04:35:26,219
and I think if you did you would
 

13893
04:35:26,219 --> 04:35:28,730
and I think if you did you would
actually take something good out of your

13894
04:35:28,730 --> 04:35:28,740
actually take something good out of your
 

13895
04:35:28,740 --> 04:35:29,990
actually take something good out of your
life

13896
04:35:29,990 --> 04:35:30,000
life
 

13897
04:35:30,000 --> 04:35:31,970
life
yeah there's there's communities that

13898
04:35:31,970 --> 04:35:31,980
yeah there's there's communities that
 

13899
04:35:31,980 --> 04:35:33,830
yeah there's there's communities that
people call pickup artists that try to

13900
04:35:33,830 --> 04:35:33,840
people call pickup artists that try to
 

13901
04:35:33,840 --> 04:35:35,209
people call pickup artists that try to
optimize

13902
04:35:35,209 --> 04:35:35,219
optimize
 

13903
04:35:35,219 --> 04:35:37,250
optimize
this particular aspect which is of

13904
04:35:37,250 --> 04:35:37,260
this particular aspect which is of
 

13905
04:35:37,260 --> 04:35:40,551
this particular aspect which is of
dating of of guys picking up girls and

13906
04:35:40,551 --> 04:35:40,561
dating of of guys picking up girls and
 

13907
04:35:40,561 --> 04:35:42,289
dating of of guys picking up girls and
turning that into a system and seeing

13908
04:35:42,289 --> 04:35:42,299
turning that into a system and seeing
 

13909
04:35:42,299 --> 04:35:43,609
turning that into a system and seeing
what's the most successful I think that

13910
04:35:43,609 --> 04:35:43,619
what's the most successful I think that
 

13911
04:35:43,619 --> 04:35:45,410
what's the most successful I think that
would be

13912
04:35:45,410 --> 04:35:45,420
would be
 

13913
04:35:45,420 --> 04:35:48,051
would be
I mean maybe the first few months would

13914
04:35:48,051 --> 04:35:48,061
I mean maybe the first few months would
 

13915
04:35:48,061 --> 04:35:49,490
I mean maybe the first few months would
be good and then after that I think it

13916
04:35:49,490 --> 04:35:49,500
be good and then after that I think it
 

13917
04:35:49,500 --> 04:35:51,470
be good and then after that I think it
would be a disaster

13918
04:35:51,470 --> 04:35:51,480
would be a disaster
 

13919
04:35:51,480 --> 04:35:53,631
would be a disaster
um uh I mean

13920
04:35:53,631 --> 04:35:53,641
um uh I mean
 

13921
04:35:53,641 --> 04:35:55,730
um uh I mean
given that

13922
04:35:55,730 --> 04:35:55,740
given that
 

13923
04:35:55,740 --> 04:36:00,170
given that
humans have to feel easy to study from a

13924
04:36:00,170 --> 04:36:00,180
humans have to feel easy to study from a
 

13925
04:36:00,180 --> 04:36:03,590
humans have to feel easy to study from a
from the standpoint of psychology I'm

13926
04:36:03,590 --> 04:36:03,600
from the standpoint of psychology I'm
 

13927
04:36:03,600 --> 04:36:05,570
from the standpoint of psychology I'm
sure it's not that difficult to gain

13928
04:36:05,570 --> 04:36:05,580
sure it's not that difficult to gain
 

13929
04:36:05,580 --> 04:36:07,070
sure it's not that difficult to gain
expertise and

13930
04:36:07,070 --> 04:36:07,080
expertise and
 

13931
04:36:07,080 --> 04:36:09,529
expertise and
things like picking people up the same

13932
04:36:09,529 --> 04:36:09,539
things like picking people up the same
 

13933
04:36:09,539 --> 04:36:11,150
things like picking people up the same
way advertisers can pick up your

13934
04:36:11,150 --> 04:36:11,160
way advertisers can pick up your
 

13935
04:36:11,160 --> 04:36:12,830
way advertisers can pick up your
attention to sell a product you can do

13936
04:36:12,830 --> 04:36:12,840
attention to sell a product you can do
 

13937
04:36:12,840 --> 04:36:15,170
attention to sell a product you can do
the same thing presumably with romance

13938
04:36:15,170 --> 04:36:15,180
the same thing presumably with romance
 

13939
04:36:15,180 --> 04:36:17,570
the same thing presumably with romance
and sex but

13940
04:36:17,570 --> 04:36:17,580
and sex but
 

13941
04:36:17,580 --> 04:36:20,330
and sex but
I don't know I feel like

13942
04:36:20,330 --> 04:36:20,340
I don't know I feel like
 

13943
04:36:20,340 --> 04:36:23,570
I don't know I feel like
if if you became very good at it

13944
04:36:23,570 --> 04:36:23,580
if if you became very good at it
 

13945
04:36:23,580 --> 04:36:25,310
if if you became very good at it
you would end up being very disappointed

13946
04:36:25,310 --> 04:36:25,320
you would end up being very disappointed
 

13947
04:36:25,320 --> 04:36:27,769
you would end up being very disappointed
by the results and

13948
04:36:27,769 --> 04:36:27,779
by the results and
 

13949
04:36:27,779 --> 04:36:29,631
by the results and
um so as I said I think there's there's

13950
04:36:29,631 --> 04:36:29,641
um so as I said I think there's there's
 

13951
04:36:29,641 --> 04:36:31,070
um so as I said I think there's there's
some things in life where it's better to

13952
04:36:31,070 --> 04:36:31,080
some things in life where it's better to
 

13953
04:36:31,080 --> 04:36:32,449
some things in life where it's better to
be a beginner and this is one of those

13954
04:36:32,449 --> 04:36:32,459
be a beginner and this is one of those
 

13955
04:36:32,459 --> 04:36:35,570
be a beginner and this is one of those
yeah enjoy the chaos the push and pull

13956
04:36:35,570 --> 04:36:35,580
yeah enjoy the chaos the push and pull
 

13957
04:36:35,580 --> 04:36:37,789
yeah enjoy the chaos the push and pull
the beginner and make that a lifelong

13958
04:36:37,789 --> 04:36:37,799
the beginner and make that a lifelong
 

13959
04:36:37,799 --> 04:36:39,709
the beginner and make that a lifelong
journey that's really inspiring to hear

13960
04:36:39,709 --> 04:36:39,719
journey that's really inspiring to hear
 

13961
04:36:39,719 --> 04:36:41,689
journey that's really inspiring to hear
you say that and there's a deep truth to

13962
04:36:41,689 --> 04:36:41,699
you say that and there's a deep truth to
 

13963
04:36:41,699 --> 04:36:43,670
you say that and there's a deep truth to
that that also justifies the fact that I

13964
04:36:43,670 --> 04:36:43,680
that that also justifies the fact that I
 

13965
04:36:43,680 --> 04:36:46,849
that that also justifies the fact that I
suck at it

13966
04:36:46,849 --> 04:36:46,859

 

13967
04:36:46,859 --> 04:36:48,650

um I think it also justifies and it

13968
04:36:48,650 --> 04:36:48,660
um I think it also justifies and it
 

13969
04:36:48,660 --> 04:36:50,631
um I think it also justifies and it
would sell very well that John Donner I

13970
04:36:50,631 --> 04:36:50,641
would sell very well that John Donner I
 

13971
04:36:50,641 --> 04:36:53,209
would sell very well that John Donner I
should write a book on dating and that

13995
04:37:27,600 --> 04:37:29,990
water which is the anaconda's preferred
domain so

13996
04:37:29,990 --> 04:37:30,000
domain so
 

13997
04:37:30,000 --> 04:37:31,490
domain so
given that

13998
04:37:31,490 --> 04:37:31,500

below lion you have to go with the idea

14002
04:37:37,010 --> 04:37:37,020
below lion you have to go with the idea
 

14003
04:37:37,020 --> 04:37:39,429
below lion you have to go with the idea
that a lion would utterly decimate

14004

that a lion would utterly decimate
Anaconda so it's probably good that we

14006
04:37:41,869 --> 04:37:41,879
Anaconda so it's probably good that we
 

14007
04:37:41,879 --> 04:37:44,029
Anaconda so it's probably good that we
did skip over it and I think uh going

14008
04:37:44,029 --> 04:37:44,039
did skip over it and I think uh going
 

14009
04:37:44,039 --> 04:37:46,131
did skip over it and I think uh going
back to the original thought that you

14010
04:37:46,131 --> 04:37:46,141
back to the original thought that you
 

14011
04:37:46,141 --> 04:37:48,650
back to the original thought that you
had about this don't trust your first

Tools in all of human history without
which human civilization could never

14284
04:43:19,310 --> 04:43:19,320
which human civilization could never
 

14285
04:43:19,320 --> 04:43:21,830
which human civilization could never
have even begun it's what separated

14286
04:43:21,830 --> 04:43:21,840
have even begun it's what separated
 

14287
04:43:21,840 --> 04:43:24,050
have even begun it's what separated
humans and took us from the bottom of

14288
04:43:24,050 --> 04:43:24,060
humans and took us from the bottom of
 

14289
04:43:24,060 --> 04:43:26,090
humans and took us from the bottom of
the food chain and began our gradual

14290
04:43:26,090 --> 04:43:26,100
the food chain and began our gradual
 

14291
04:43:26,100 --> 04:43:27,770
the food chain and began our gradual
rise towards the top of the food chain

14292
04:43:27,770 --> 04:43:27,780
rise towards the top of the food chain
 

14293
04:43:27,780 --> 04:43:30,470
rise towards the top of the food chain
so it has immense historical and

14294
04:43:30,470 --> 04:43:30,480
so it has immense historical and
 

14295
04:43:30,480 --> 04:43:33,110
so it has immense historical and
cultural value but it has this

14296
04:43:33,110 --> 04:43:33,120
cultural value but it has this
 

14297
04:43:33,120 --> 04:43:35,570
cultural value but it has this
metaphorical value insofar as the

14298
04:43:35,570 --> 04:43:35,580
metaphorical value insofar as the
 

14299
04:43:35,580 --> 04:43:37,730
metaphorical value insofar as the
martial artist begins as a Wipeout like

14300
04:43:37,730 --> 04:43:37,740
martial artist begins as a Wipeout like
 

14301
04:43:37,740 --> 04:43:41,208
martial artist begins as a Wipeout like
iron ore but over time transforms into

14302
04:43:41,208 --> 04:43:41,218
iron ore but over time transforms into
 

14303
04:43:41,218 --> 04:43:44,150
iron ore but over time transforms into
some beautiful shining Steel

14304
04:43:44,150 --> 04:43:44,160
some beautiful shining Steel
 

14305
04:43:44,160 --> 04:43:47,750
some beautiful shining Steel
which can have immense value

14306
04:43:47,750 --> 04:43:47,760
which can have immense value
 

14307
04:43:47,760 --> 04:43:48,430
which can have immense value
um

14308
04:43:48,430 --> 04:43:48,440
um
 

14309
04:43:48,440 --> 04:43:50,868
um
in addition there's a sense of of

14310
04:43:50,868 --> 04:43:50,878
in addition there's a sense of of
 

14311
04:43:50,878 --> 04:43:55,310
in addition there's a sense of of
Maintenance as remarkable as steel is

14312
04:43:55,310 --> 04:43:55,320
Maintenance as remarkable as steel is
 

14313
04:43:55,320 --> 04:43:58,010
Maintenance as remarkable as steel is
it is in need of constant maintenance it

14314
04:43:58,010 --> 04:43:58,020
it is in need of constant maintenance it
 

14315
04:43:58,020 --> 04:44:01,190
it is in need of constant maintenance it
will fall apart through rust and neglect

14316
04:44:01,190 --> 04:44:01,200
will fall apart through rust and neglect
 

14317
04:44:01,200 --> 04:44:03,230
will fall apart through rust and neglect
will destroy a blade both in terms of

14318
04:44:03,230 --> 04:44:03,240
will destroy a blade both in terms of
 

14319
04:44:03,240 --> 04:44:06,708
will destroy a blade both in terms of
rust and the edge falling apart and so

14320
04:44:06,708 --> 04:44:06,718
rust and the edge falling apart and so
 

14321
04:44:06,718 --> 04:44:08,990
rust and the edge falling apart and so
just as the martial artist it's not good

14322
04:44:08,990 --> 04:44:09,000
just as the martial artist it's not good
 

14323
04:44:09,000 --> 04:44:10,970
just as the martial artist it's not good
enough just to to learn the techniques

14324
04:44:10,970 --> 04:44:10,980
enough just to to learn the techniques
 

14325
04:44:10,980 --> 04:44:13,368
enough just to to learn the techniques
you need to maintain them over time

14326
04:44:13,368 --> 04:44:13,378
you need to maintain them over time
 

14327
04:44:13,378 --> 04:44:16,010
you need to maintain them over time
and just as steel as perishable so too

14328
04:44:16,010 --> 04:44:16,020
and just as steel as perishable so too
 

14329
04:44:16,020 --> 04:44:18,350
and just as steel as perishable so too
are the skills of martial arts and that

14330
04:44:18,350 --> 04:44:18,360
are the skills of martial arts and that
 

14331
04:44:18,360 --> 04:44:20,390
are the skills of martial arts and that
when I give a gift of a knife to a

14332
04:44:20,390 --> 04:44:20,400
when I give a gift of a knife to a
 

14333
04:44:20,400 --> 04:44:22,670
when I give a gift of a knife to a
student these metaphorical elements

14334
04:44:22,670 --> 04:44:22,680
student these metaphorical elements
 

14335
04:44:22,680 --> 04:44:25,490
student these metaphorical elements
start to emerge they see okay I began as

14336
04:44:25,490 --> 04:44:25,500
start to emerge they see okay I began as
 

14337
04:44:25,500 --> 04:44:27,530
start to emerge they see okay I began as
iron ore and I want to become the

14338
04:44:27,530 --> 04:44:27,540
iron ore and I want to become the
 

14339
04:44:27,540 --> 04:44:30,110
iron ore and I want to become the
finished blade

14340
04:44:30,110 --> 04:44:30,120
finished blade
 

14341
04:44:30,120 --> 04:44:31,310
finished blade
um

14342
04:44:31,310 --> 04:44:31,320
um
 

14343
04:44:31,320 --> 04:44:34,128
um
there's another sense in which

14344
04:44:34,128 --> 04:44:34,138
there's another sense in which
 

14345
04:44:34,138 --> 04:44:38,530
there's another sense in which
a knife is morally neutral

14346
04:44:38,530 --> 04:44:38,540
a knife is morally neutral
 

14347
04:44:38,540 --> 04:44:41,690
a knife is morally neutral
a knife can be used to Save a Life it

14348
04:44:41,690 --> 04:44:41,700
a knife can be used to Save a Life it
 

14349
04:44:41,700 --> 04:44:43,970
a knife can be used to Save a Life it
can be used to cook a meal

14350
04:44:43,970 --> 04:44:43,980
can be used to cook a meal
 

14351
04:44:43,980 --> 04:44:46,250
can be used to cook a meal
but it can also be used for murder for

14352
04:44:46,250 --> 04:44:46,260
but it can also be used for murder for
 

14353
04:44:46,260 --> 04:44:49,250
but it can also be used for murder for
the worst possible purposes

14354
04:44:49,250 --> 04:44:49,260
the worst possible purposes
 

14355
04:44:49,260 --> 04:44:51,590
the worst possible purposes
um Jiu Jitsu is the same way

14356
04:44:51,590 --> 04:44:51,600
um Jiu Jitsu is the same way
 

14357
04:44:51,600 --> 04:44:53,390
um Jiu Jitsu is the same way
Jiu Jitsu can make you a better person

14358
04:44:53,390 --> 04:44:53,400
Jiu Jitsu can make you a better person
 

14359
04:44:53,400 --> 04:44:55,368
Jiu Jitsu can make you a better person
it can make you a worse person Judas was

14360
04:44:55,368 --> 04:44:55,378
it can make you a worse person Judas was
 

14361
04:44:55,378 --> 04:44:57,050
it can make you a worse person Judas was
just a power it's not a particularly

14362
04:44:57,050 --> 04:44:57,060
just a power it's not a particularly
 

14363
04:44:57,060 --> 04:45:00,288
just a power it's not a particularly
great power but it is a power and like

14364
04:45:00,288 --> 04:45:00,298
great power but it is a power and like
 

14365
04:45:00,298 --> 04:45:01,788
great power but it is a power and like
all power it can be used for both good

14366
04:45:01,788 --> 04:45:01,798
all power it can be used for both good
 

14367
04:45:01,798 --> 04:45:03,708
all power it can be used for both good
and bad it's morally neutral in itself

14368
04:45:03,708 --> 04:45:03,718
and bad it's morally neutral in itself
 

14369
04:45:03,718 --> 04:45:06,288
and bad it's morally neutral in itself
and it's up to us to make sure that just

14370
04:45:06,288 --> 04:45:06,298
and it's up to us to make sure that just
 

14371
04:45:06,298 --> 04:45:08,990
and it's up to us to make sure that just
as the knife gets used for good purposes

14372
04:45:08,990 --> 04:45:09,000
as the knife gets used for good purposes
 

14373
04:45:09,000 --> 04:45:12,110
as the knife gets used for good purposes
rather than bad so to let Jiu Jitsu be

14374
04:45:12,110 --> 04:45:12,120
rather than bad so to let Jiu Jitsu be
 

14375
04:45:12,120 --> 04:45:13,990
rather than bad so to let Jiu Jitsu be
used for good purposes rather than bad

14376
04:45:13,990 --> 04:45:14,000
used for good purposes rather than bad
 

14377
04:45:14,000 --> 04:45:17,150
used for good purposes rather than bad
there's also an element where

14378
04:45:17,150 --> 04:45:17,160
there's also an element where
 

14379
04:45:17,160 --> 04:45:21,490
there's also an element where
the basis of the knife is steel

14380
04:45:21,490 --> 04:45:21,500
the basis of the knife is steel
 

14381
04:45:21,500 --> 04:45:24,470
the basis of the knife is steel
and historically there's always been a

14382
04:45:24,470 --> 04:45:24,480
and historically there's always been a
 

14383
04:45:24,480 --> 04:45:27,230
and historically there's always been a
riddle of Steel which is

14384
04:45:27,230 --> 04:45:27,240
riddle of Steel which is
 

14385
04:45:27,240 --> 04:45:31,368
riddle of Steel which is
still has the property of both

14386
04:45:31,368 --> 04:45:31,378
still has the property of both
 

14387
04:45:31,378 --> 04:45:35,030
still has the property of both
hardness and suppleness

14388
04:45:35,030 --> 04:45:35,040
hardness and suppleness
 

14389
04:45:35,040 --> 04:45:37,490
hardness and suppleness
the harder you make steel

14390
04:45:37,490 --> 04:45:37,500
the harder you make steel
 

14391
04:45:37,500 --> 04:45:40,610
the harder you make steel
the better it's Edge retention becomes

14392
04:45:40,610 --> 04:45:40,620
the better it's Edge retention becomes
 

14393
04:45:40,620 --> 04:45:42,890
the better it's Edge retention becomes
the longer that edge will stay sharp

14394
04:45:42,890 --> 04:45:42,900
the longer that edge will stay sharp
 

14395
04:45:42,900 --> 04:45:46,190
the longer that edge will stay sharp
this is good but it comes at a price

14396
04:45:46,190 --> 04:45:46,200
this is good but it comes at a price
 

14397
04:45:46,200 --> 04:45:47,990
this is good but it comes at a price
the harder you make steel the more

14398
04:45:47,990 --> 04:45:48,000
the harder you make steel the more
 

14399
04:45:48,000 --> 04:45:49,850
the harder you make steel the more
brittle it becomes

14400
04:45:49,850 --> 04:45:49,860
brittle it becomes
 

14401
04:45:49,860 --> 04:45:51,708
brittle it becomes
and now that edge

14402
04:45:51,708 --> 04:45:51,718
and now that edge
 

14403
04:45:51,718 --> 04:45:56,390
and now that edge
can be damaged easily

14404
04:45:56,390 --> 04:45:56,400

 

14405
04:45:56,400 --> 04:45:58,190

so the solution is to make the steel

14406
04:45:58,190 --> 04:45:58,200
so the solution is to make the steel
 

14407
04:45:58,200 --> 04:46:01,430
so the solution is to make the steel
softer more malleable that will prevent

14408
04:46:01,430 --> 04:46:01,440
softer more malleable that will prevent
 

14409
04:46:01,440 --> 04:46:03,288
softer more malleable that will prevent
breakage of the blade and

14410
04:46:03,288 --> 04:46:03,298
breakage of the blade and
 

14411
04:46:03,298 --> 04:46:05,930
breakage of the blade and
chipping of the edge

14412
04:46:05,930 --> 04:46:05,940
chipping of the edge
 

14413
04:46:05,940 --> 04:46:07,850
chipping of the edge
but when you make the steel softer that

14414
04:46:07,850 --> 04:46:07,860
but when you make the steel softer that
 

14415
04:46:07,860 --> 04:46:10,070
but when you make the steel softer that
comes at a price and that price is now

14416
04:46:10,070 --> 04:46:10,080
comes at a price and that price is now
 

14417
04:46:10,080 --> 04:46:14,330
comes at a price and that price is now
the edge loses its uh its its sharpness

14418
04:46:14,330 --> 04:46:14,340
the edge loses its uh its its sharpness
 

14419
04:46:14,340 --> 04:46:15,830
the edge loses its uh its its sharpness
very easily

14420
04:46:15,830 --> 04:46:15,840
very easily
 

14421
04:46:15,840 --> 04:46:17,208
very easily
and so

14422
04:46:17,208 --> 04:46:17,218
and so
 

14423
04:46:17,218 --> 04:46:20,030
and so
the riddle of Steel is how to

14424
04:46:20,030 --> 04:46:20,040
the riddle of Steel is how to
 

14425
04:46:20,040 --> 04:46:22,430
the riddle of Steel is how to
work with these two to the greatest

14426
04:46:22,430 --> 04:46:22,440
work with these two to the greatest
 

14427
04:46:22,440 --> 04:46:25,610
work with these two to the greatest
degree possible and create an edge which

14428
04:46:25,610 --> 04:46:25,620
degree possible and create an edge which
 

14429
04:46:25,620 --> 04:46:27,770
degree possible and create an edge which
is hard enough to stay sharp for long

14430
04:46:27,770 --> 04:46:27,780
is hard enough to stay sharp for long
 

14431
04:46:27,780 --> 04:46:29,990
is hard enough to stay sharp for long
periods of time but without making the

14432
04:46:29,990 --> 04:46:30,000
periods of time but without making the
 

14433
04:46:30,000 --> 04:46:33,170
periods of time but without making the
steel so brittle that the blade overall

14434
04:46:33,170 --> 04:46:33,180
steel so brittle that the blade overall
 

14435
04:46:33,180 --> 04:46:34,730
steel so brittle that the blade overall
is compromised

14436
04:46:34,730 --> 04:46:34,740
is compromised
 

14437
04:46:34,740 --> 04:46:37,010
is compromised
so too in Jiu-Jitsu

14438
04:46:37,010 --> 04:46:37,020
so too in Jiu-Jitsu
 

14439
04:46:37,020 --> 04:46:40,368
so too in Jiu-Jitsu
your task and training is to make the

training competitive enough that you
 

14443
04:46:42,900 --> 04:46:44,570
training competitive enough that you
actually get used to the rigors of of

14444
04:46:44,570 --> 04:46:44,580
actually get used to the rigors of of

04:46:46,128 --> 04:46:46,138
real Combat

real Combat
but on the other hand it can't be so

14448
04:46:47,990 --> 04:46:48,000
but on the other hand it can't be so
 

14449
04:46:48,000 --> 04:46:51,288
but on the other hand it can't be so
brutal that the athletes get broken down

14450
04:46:51,288 --> 04:46:51,298
brutal that the athletes get broken down
 

14451
04:46:51,298 --> 04:46:52,788
brutal that the athletes get broken down
on the gym to a point where they're no

04:46:58,190 --> 04:46:58,200
and so this duality of hardness and
 

14457
04:46:58,200 --> 04:47:00,890
and so this duality of hardness and
softness which we see in the case of

14458
04:47:00,890 --> 04:47:00,900
softness which we see in the case of
 

14459
04:47:00,900 --> 04:47:04,310
softness which we see in the case of
blades is there in the training of the
