15
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,630
I went called for like a fraction of a
second but that meant that just my

second but that meant that just my
 

17
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,510
second but that meant that just my

adrenaline started to kick in and it was
 

19
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,370
adrenaline started to kick in and it was
a very very strange experience because

you start to list the kind of thing you
 

105
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,690
you start to list the kind of thing you
need to answer

need to answer
 

107
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,069

of know the places where you need to go
 

113
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,510

to do that as far as science is

00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,520
to do that as far as science is
 

115
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,809
to do that as far as science is
concerned started with analyzing data

concerned started with analyzing data
 

117
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,410
concerned started with analyzing data
from the Mars missions and I had written

118
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:15,420
from the Mars missions and I had written
 

119
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,470

a PhD about water on Mars first looking

120
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
a PhD about water on Mars first looking
 

121
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,490
a PhD about water on Mars first looking
at channels and the history evolution of

at channels and the history evolution of
 

123
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,710
at channels and the history evolution of
of water but then during my postdoc I

124
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:27,720
of water but then during my postdoc I
 

125
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,110
of water but then during my postdoc I
started to look where that water was

126
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,120
started to look where that water was
 

127
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,449
started to look where that water was
spawning interestingly enough everybody

128
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:32,459
spawning interestingly enough everybody
 

129
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,790
spawning interestingly enough everybody
was about channels and water and whether

130
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
was about channels and water and whether
 

131
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,089
was about channels and water and whether
catastrophic or whatnot or seepage but

132
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:38,099
catastrophic or whatnot or seepage but
 

133
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,369
catastrophic or whatnot or seepage but
when you are talking about pounding

134
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:40,379
when you are talking about pounding
 

135
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,970
when you are talking about pounding
water like lakes or ocean people were

136
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:43,980
water like lakes or ocean people were

138
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
studied waving their arms a little bit
 

139
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,290
studied waving their arms a little bit
so it was a little bit of a ill battle

140
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:48,300
so it was a little bit of a ill battle
 

141
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,229
so it was a little bit of a ill battle
interestingly enough yeah but that got

142
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:51,239
interestingly enough yeah but that got
 

143
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,229
interestingly enough yeah but that got
us on track with my husband uh we were

144
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
us on track with my husband uh we were
 

145
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,809
us on track with my husband uh we were
working together and we started

146
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:56,819
working together and we started
 

147
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,630
working together and we started
developing the idea the concept of lakes

148
00:02:59,630 --> 00:02:59,640
developing the idea the concept of lakes
 

149
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,430

in impact craters
 

151
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,850
in impact craters
so why an impact crater is just because

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:03,860
so why an impact crater is just because

157
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,649
what we were working with the resolution
and the topography were so poor that

and the topography were so poor that
 

159
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,990
and the topography were so poor that
there was really no way of telling where

160
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000
there was really no way of telling where
 

161
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,930
there was really no way of telling where
you had a real low in the topography the

162

you had a real low in the topography the
 

163
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,750
you had a real low in the topography the
only thing you knew was a hole in the

ground was an impact crater so when you

166
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:22,980
ground was an impact crater so when you
 

167
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,309
ground was an impact crater so when you
sell valleys what was the Viking Mission

168
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:25,319
sell valleys what was the Viking Mission
 

169
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,130
sell valleys what was the Viking Mission
the Viking Mission landed on Mars in

170
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,140
the Viking Mission landed on Mars in
 

171
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,430
the Viking Mission landed on Mars in
1976 and there were two lenders and two

172
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
1976 and there were two lenders and two
 

173
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,910
1976 and there were two lenders and two
orbiters so they were really our first

174
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:34,920
orbiters so they were really our first
 

175
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,309
orbiters so they were really our first
fit on the ground on Mars but they were

176
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:37,319
fit on the ground on Mars but they were
 

177
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,990
fit on the ground on Mars but they were
under they were not moving they were not

178
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,000
under they were not moving they were not
 

179
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,430
under they were not moving they were not
going and that was the data you were

180
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,440
going and that was the data you were
 

181
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,670
going and that was the data you were
looking at it was already in the 90s but

182
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
looking at it was already in the 90s but
 

183
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,070
looking at it was already in the 90s but
we didn't have yet the Mars Global

184
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
we didn't have yet the Mars Global
 

185
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,890
we didn't have yet the Mars Global
surveyor and whatnot we still work for

186
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:48,900
surveyor and whatnot we still work for
 

187
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,869
surveyor and whatnot we still work for
20 years we worked on that I did my

188
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
20 years we worked on that I did my
 

189
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,030
20 years we worked on that I did my
master and my PhD thesis on bike

190
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
master and my PhD thesis on bike
 

191
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,949
master and my PhD thesis on bike
ignitions you mentioned that the places

192
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
ignitions you mentioned that the places
 

193
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,930
ignitions you mentioned that the places
you go to are defined by the questions

194
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:56,940
you go to are defined by the questions
 

195
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,610
you go to are defined by the questions
you want to ask

196
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:58,620
you want to ask
 

197
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,550
you want to ask
let's just step back what questions have

198
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:01,560
let's just step back what questions have
 

199
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,070
let's just step back what questions have
always tugged at your heart well that's

200
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
always tugged at your heart well that's
 

201
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,070
always tugged at your heart well that's
the thing that's why I was looking at

202
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,080
the thing that's why I was looking at
 

203
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,970
the thing that's why I was looking at
those images and saw some likes and then

204
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:10,980
those images and saw some likes and then
 

205
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,570
those images and saw some likes and then
came time where we started talking about

206
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:13,580
came time where we started talking about
 

207
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,849
came time where we started talking about
sending lenders and and Rovers on Mars

208
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:16,859
sending lenders and and Rovers on Mars
 

209
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,789
sending lenders and and Rovers on Mars
and looking maybe at the possibility

210
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:19,799
and looking maybe at the possibility
 

211
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,030
and looking maybe at the possibility
that Mars was habitable and lakes are

212
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
that Mars was habitable and lakes are
 

213
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,370
that Mars was habitable and lakes are
particularly good places to look for

214
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:25,380
particularly good places to look for
 

215
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,530
particularly good places to look for
those questions so this is how it all

216
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:27,540
those questions so this is how it all
 

217
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,510
those questions so this is how it all
ties up so you were always curious about

218
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
ties up so you were always curious about
 

219
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,550
ties up so you were always curious about
life out there I have been always

220
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:31,560
life out there I have been always
 

221
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,770
life out there I have been always
curious about life in the universe and

222
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:33,780
curious about life in the universe and
 

223
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,890
curious about life in the universe and
about questions on how we got to be here

224
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:36,900
about questions on how we got to be here
 

225
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,010
about questions on how we got to be here
and and the bigger question now with 25

226
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,020
and and the bigger question now with 25
 

227
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,469
and and the bigger question now with 25
years more and you know in in that

228
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
years more and you know in in that
 

229
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,570
years more and you know in in that
business

230
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:43,580
business
 

231
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,670
business
it's more about understanding the origin

232
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:46,680
it's more about understanding the origin
 

233
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,010
it's more about understanding the origin
and nature of life rather than whether

234
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,020
and nature of life rather than whether
 

235
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,010
and nature of life rather than whether
there is life or not on Mars I mean this

236
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,020
there is life or not on Mars I mean this
 

237
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,749
there is life or not on Mars I mean this
was really for me a stepping stone to

238
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
was really for me a stepping stone to
 

239
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,310
was really for me a stepping stone to
bigger questions but they were

240
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,320
bigger questions but they were
 

241
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,550
bigger questions but they were
definitely important because they helped

242
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
definitely important because they helped
 

243
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,350
definitely important because they helped
me frame

244
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,360
me frame
 

245
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,050
me frame
my way of thinking about this question

246
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,060
my way of thinking about this question
 

247
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,450
my way of thinking about this question
and so looking at Mars Alex

248
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:05,460
and so looking at Mars Alex
 

249
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,090
and so looking at Mars Alex
understanding what the conditions were

250
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,100
understanding what the conditions were
 

251
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,430
understanding what the conditions were
3.5 billion years ago or close to 4

252
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,440
3.5 billion years ago or close to 4
 

253
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,129
3.5 billion years ago or close to 4
billion years ago then I knew the type

254
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:13,139
billion years ago then I knew the type
 

255
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,830
billion years ago then I knew the type
of environment I needed to explore here

256
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
of environment I needed to explore here
 

257
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,990
of environment I needed to explore here
on Earth as analogous

258
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
on Earth as analogous
 

259
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,990
on Earth as analogous
to be able to understand what type of

260
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,000
to be able to understand what type of
 

261
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,310
to be able to understand what type of
life

262
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
life
 

263
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,770
life
still survives in those environment and

264
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:24,780
still survives in those environment and
 

265
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,390
still survives in those environment and
what kind of instrument and what kind of

266
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
what kind of instrument and what kind of
 

267
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,249
what kind of instrument and what kind of
resolution do I need

268
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:28,259
resolution do I need
 

269
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,150
resolution do I need
to actually detect it so this is how the

270
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
to actually detect it so this is how the
 

271
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,550
to actually detect it so this is how the
whole thing started and it started with

272
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
whole thing started and it started with
 

273
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,670
whole thing started and it started with
a small Grant literally 40K it was a

274
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
a small Grant literally 40K it was a
 

275
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,890
a small Grant literally 40K it was a
discretionary fund and this is how I got

276
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:39,900
discretionary fund and this is how I got
 

277
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,590
discretionary fund and this is how I got
started in my in my career and so many

278
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:42,600
started in my in my career and so many
 

279
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,090
started in my in my career and so many
of these questions you can answer by

280
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,100
of these questions you can answer by
 

281
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,830
of these questions you can answer by
looking at life in extreme conditions

282
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
looking at life in extreme conditions
 

283
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,770
looking at life in extreme conditions
here on Earth but let's let's step back

284
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:48,780
here on Earth but let's let's step back
 

285
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,710
here on Earth but let's let's step back
a little bit and look at Mars

286
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:51,720
a little bit and look at Mars
 

287
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,710
a little bit and look at Mars
and lakes on Mars just going back to

288
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
and lakes on Mars just going back to
 

289
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,770
and lakes on Mars just going back to
your PhD and before and maybe today what

290
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:57,780
your PhD and before and maybe today what
 

291
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,010
your PhD and before and maybe today what
do we understand about life on Mars

292
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,020
do we understand about life on Mars
 

293
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,170
do we understand about life on Mars
what do we understand about Lakes on

294
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,180
what do we understand about Lakes on
 

295
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,330
what do we understand about Lakes on
Mars is there water on Mars what do we

296
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,340
Mars is there water on Mars what do we
 

297
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,590
Mars is there water on Mars what do we
understand about the conditions from

298
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:06,600
understand about the conditions from
 

299
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,629
understand about the conditions from
four billion years ago on Mars well

300
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
four billion years ago on Mars well
 

301
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,150
four billion years ago on Mars well
we've gone a long way remember from from

302
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,160
we've gone a long way remember from from
 

303
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,890
we've gone a long way remember from from
the Viking where we had no resolution

304
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:12,900
the Viking where we had no resolution
 

305
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,150
the Viking where we had no resolution
well we'll had a little bit more

306
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
well we'll had a little bit more
 

307
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,430
well we'll had a little bit more
resolution with than with Mariners what

308
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,440
resolution with than with Mariners what
 

309
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,689
resolution with than with Mariners what
did you think at that time sorry to

310
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:17,699
did you think at that time sorry to
 

311
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,430
did you think at that time sorry to
interrupt it was just take us back to

312
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
interrupt it was just take us back to
 

313
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,110
interrupt it was just take us back to
that mindset it was really the

314
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
that mindset it was really the
 

315
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,770
that mindset it was really the
exploration like the your first look at

316
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:24,780
exploration like the your first look at
 

317
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,770
exploration like the your first look at
a planet you have to remember that the

318
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:27,780
a planet you have to remember that the
 

319
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,650
a planet you have to remember that the
first mission that successfully snapped

320
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:30,660
first mission that successfully snapped
 

321
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,830
first mission that successfully snapped
some pictures of Martha was Mariner for

322
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
some pictures of Martha was Mariner for
 

323
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,529
some pictures of Martha was Mariner for
and then everybody at that time was

324
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:36,539
and then everybody at that time was
 

325
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,409
and then everybody at that time was
still under the spell of you know it's

326
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:39,419
still under the spell of you know it's
 

327
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,129
still under the spell of you know it's
Wells and and the idea that Mars looked

328
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:43,139
Wells and and the idea that Mars looked
 

329
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,390
Wells and and the idea that Mars looked
with telescope so similar to the Earth

330
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400
with telescope so similar to the Earth
 

331
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,150
with telescope so similar to the Earth
polar caps we could see them with a

332
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
polar caps we could see them with a
 

333
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,390
polar caps we could see them with a
telescope and we knew it had season the

334
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,400
telescope and we knew it had season the
 

335
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,850
telescope and we knew it had season the
actual tilt is pretty much the same as

336
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:55,860
actual tilt is pretty much the same as
 

337
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,870
actual tilt is pretty much the same as
the one for Earth so when Mariner 4 left

338
00:06:59,870 --> 00:06:59,880
the one for Earth so when Mariner 4 left
 

339
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,930
the one for Earth so when Mariner 4 left
everybody pre not everybody but a lot of

340
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:02,940
everybody pre not everybody but a lot of
 

341
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,370
everybody pre not everybody but a lot of
people thought that we would see the

342
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,380
people thought that we would see the
 

343
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,830
people thought that we would see the
crystal cities and domes and stuff that

344
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:06,840
crystal cities and domes and stuff that
 

345
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,590
crystal cities and domes and stuff that
another civilization might have evolved

346
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:09,600
another civilization might have evolved
 

347
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,450
another civilization might have evolved
in parallel to us in the solar system

348
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,460
in parallel to us in the solar system
 

349
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,210
in parallel to us in the solar system
and of course when the first images came

350
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:14,220
and of course when the first images came
 

351
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,309
and of course when the first images came
back and Mars looked with that kind of

352
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
back and Mars looked with that kind of
 

353
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,670
back and Mars looked with that kind of
resolution it I had uh like the Moon it

354
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
resolution it I had uh like the Moon it
 

355
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,670
resolution it I had uh like the Moon it
was a huge disappointment then minor 9

356
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:22,680
was a huge disappointment then minor 9
 

357
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,529
was a huge disappointment then minor 9
came

358
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:24,539
came
 

359
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,990
came
and that changed everything there is

360
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,000
and that changed everything there is
 

361
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,950
and that changed everything there is
there was a little bit of drama because

362
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:29,960
there was a little bit of drama because
 

363
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,390
there was a little bit of drama because
Mars started the one of the biggest

364
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
Mars started the one of the biggest
 

365
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,170
Mars started the one of the biggest
storm it ever experienced and so for

366
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,180
storm it ever experienced and so for
 

367
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,150
storm it ever experienced and so for
three months we had an orbiters circling

368
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
three months we had an orbiters circling
 

369
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,150
three months we had an orbiters circling
around Mars and not seeing anything

370
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,160
around Mars and not seeing anything
 

371
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,870
around Mars and not seeing anything
but then when the dust cleared all of a

372
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
but then when the dust cleared all of a
 

373
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,350
but then when the dust cleared all of a
sudden we started discovering volcanoes

374
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
sudden we started discovering volcanoes
 

375
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,870
sudden we started discovering volcanoes

polar caps and see what I'm talking to

378
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:53,340
polar caps and see what I'm talking to
 

379
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,270
polar caps and see what I'm talking to
you I don't need to invent any words

380
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,280
you I don't need to invent any words
 

381
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,330
you I don't need to invent any words
to describe Mars

382
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:58,340
to describe Mars
 

383
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,510
to describe Mars
and although the myth of

384
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
and although the myth of
 

385
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,550
and although the myth of
extraterrestrial civilization on Mars

386
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
extraterrestrial civilization on Mars
 

387
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,390
extraterrestrial civilization on Mars
was gone all of a sudden

388
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
was gone all of a sudden
 

389
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,309
was gone all of a sudden
the imagination of the scientists

390
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
the imagination of the scientists
 

391
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,110
the imagination of the scientists
started to pick up because right away we

392
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,120
started to pick up because right away we
 

393
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,969
started to pick up because right away we
were seeing something that was familiar

394
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:13,979
were seeing something that was familiar
 

395
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,469
were seeing something that was familiar
that we could describe so right away

396
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:17,479
that we could describe so right away
 

397
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,290
that we could describe so right away
Viking would put on The Fast Track and

398
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:21,300
Viking would put on The Fast Track and
 

399
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,990
Viking would put on The Fast Track and
the idea was so Mars looks so much like

400
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
the idea was so Mars looks so much like
 

401
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,210
the idea was so Mars looks so much like
Earth could have been although it's arid

402
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,220
Earth could have been although it's arid
 

403
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,510
Earth could have been although it's arid
and there is little atmosphere Etc

404
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
and there is little atmosphere Etc
 

405
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,630
and there is little atmosphere Etc
could there be life and of course behind

406
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
could there be life and of course behind
 

407
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,570
could there be life and of course behind
this at the time there were people like

408
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:35,580
this at the time there were people like
 

409
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,889
this at the time there were people like
a Klein and Sagan called Sagan uh just

410
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:39,899
a Klein and Sagan called Sagan uh just
 

411
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,670
a Klein and Sagan called Sagan uh just
you know uh thinking about how can we

412
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
you know uh thinking about how can we
 

413
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,790
you know uh thinking about how can we
test the idea of biology of Life on Mars

414
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
test the idea of biology of Life on Mars
 

415
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,490
test the idea of biology of Life on Mars
so this is what Viking did but of course

416
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:49,500
so this is what Viking did but of course
 

417
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,370
so this is what Viking did but of course
at the time when the two lenders arrived

418
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:52,380
at the time when the two lenders arrived
 

419
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,570
at the time when the two lenders arrived
on Mars

420
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:53,580
on Mars
 

421
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,690
on Mars
we didn't have the context of the

422
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:56,700
we didn't have the context of the
 

423
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,310
we didn't have the context of the
geology of the environment we didn't

424
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
geology of the environment we didn't
 

425
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,490
geology of the environment we didn't
have much data at all so the data that

426
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:01,500
have much data at all so the data that
 

427
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,810
have much data at all so the data that
Viking

428
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:02,820
Viking
 

429
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,170
Viking
send back was very confusing some people

430
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,180
send back was very confusing some people
 

431
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,790
send back was very confusing some people
still think today that we discovered

432
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:07,800
still think today that we discovered
 

433
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,150
still think today that we discovered
Life on Mars at the time because some of

434
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,160
Life on Mars at the time because some of
 

435
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,250
Life on Mars at the time because some of
the experiment turned out to show a

436
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,260
the experiment turned out to show a
 

437
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,889
the experiment turned out to show a
strange signal but most of the community

438
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:15,899
strange signal but most of the community
 

439
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,930
strange signal but most of the community
think that it can be explained by a

440
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:17,940
think that it can be explained by a
 

441
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,389
think that it can be explained by a
chemical reaction that we see today so

442
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
chemical reaction that we see today so
 

443
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,670
chemical reaction that we see today so
it was so confusing that NASA decided to

444
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:22,680
it was so confusing that NASA decided to
 

445
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,009
it was so confusing that NASA decided to
say okay if we want to be serious about

446
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:25,019
say okay if we want to be serious about
 

447
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,290
say okay if we want to be serious about
looking for Life on Mars we have to

448
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
looking for Life on Mars we have to
 

449
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,170
looking for Life on Mars we have to
understand the environment because life

450
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:30,180
understand the environment because life
 

451
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,389
understand the environment because life
and environment co-evolve

452
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
and environment co-evolve
 

453
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,230
and environment co-evolve
so as cause or effect a planet is going

454
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
so as cause or effect a planet is going
 

455
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,610
so as cause or effect a planet is going
to give you the physical chemical

456
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:37,620
to give you the physical chemical
 

457
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,790
to give you the physical chemical
environment for life to happen these are

458
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
environment for life to happen these are
 

459
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,769
environment for life to happen these are
the boundaries but once life is here

460
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:42,779
the boundaries but once life is here
 

461
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,650
the boundaries but once life is here
it's going to change everything one of

462
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,660
it's going to change everything one of
 

463
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,910
it's going to change everything one of
the biggest impact of life was to inject

464
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
the biggest impact of life was to inject
 

465
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,430
the biggest impact of life was to inject
oxygen into the atmosphere of the earth

466
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:52,440
oxygen into the atmosphere of the earth
 

467
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,250
oxygen into the atmosphere of the earth
three two billion years ago and that

468
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,260
three two billion years ago and that
 

469
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,750
three two billion years ago and that
changed everything including our

470
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:56,760
changed everything including our
 

471
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,370
changed everything including our
signature in space

472
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:58,380
signature in space
 

473
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,730
signature in space
so there is this coevolution so if you

474
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:01,740
so there is this coevolution so if you
 

475
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,290
so there is this coevolution so if you
want to understand one you have to

476
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,300
want to understand one you have to
 

477
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,910
want to understand one you have to
remove the other from the equation this

478
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:04,920
remove the other from the equation this
 

479
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,550
remove the other from the equation this
kind of a two unknown equation so even

480
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,560
kind of a two unknown equation so even
 

481
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,650
kind of a two unknown equation so even
though oxygen changes our signature

482
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:09,660
though oxygen changes our signature
 

483
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,610
though oxygen changes our signature
today

484
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,620
today
 

485
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,150
today
what if all life on Earth died and now

486
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
what if all life on Earth died and now
 

487
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,370
what if all life on Earth died and now
we fast forward a billion years

488
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,380
we fast forward a billion years
 

489

we fast forward a billion years
what would be the traces left it so the

490
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:19,620
what would be the traces left it so the
 

491
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,350
what would be the traces left it so the
question I'm trying to ask is

492
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
question I'm trying to ask is
 

493
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,769
question I'm trying to ask is
if life had existed on Mars what would

494
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:24,779
if life had existed on Mars what would
 

495
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,750
if life had existed on Mars what would
be the signs we would look for that's a

496
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:26,760
be the signs we would look for that's a
 

497
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,870
be the signs we would look for that's a
very good question the thing is that if

498
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:29,880
very good question the thing is that if
 

499
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,570
very good question the thing is that if
you draw the parallel with Earth it took

500
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:32,580
you draw the parallel with Earth it took
 

501
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,650
you draw the parallel with Earth it took
82 percent of Earth's history

502
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:35,660
82 percent of Earth's history
 

503
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,930
82 percent of Earth's history
geological history to go from very

geological history to go from very
 

505
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,930
geological history to go from very
simple life microbial life to complexity

simple life microbial life to complexity
 

507
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,550
simple life microbial life to complexity
and when I'm saying complexity I'm not

508

life also

518
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,220
life also
 

519
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,850
life also
appeared on Earth very fast so the

520
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:58,860
appeared on Earth very fast so the
 

521
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,530
appeared on Earth very fast so the
condition being quite similar at that

522
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:00,540
condition being quite similar at that
 

523
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,850
condition being quite similar at that
time between the Earth and Mars it's

524
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:01,860
time between the Earth and Mars it's
 

525
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,889
time between the Earth and Mars it's
assumed for a moment that life appeared

526
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:03,899
assumed for a moment that life appeared
 

527
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,590
assumed for a moment that life appeared
on Mars it would have been Simple Life

528
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:06,600
on Mars it would have been Simple Life
 

529
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,949
on Mars it would have been Simple Life
when conditions started to degrade which

530
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:09,959
when conditions started to degrade which
 

531
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,350

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,360
was less than a billion year after the
 

533
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,170
was less than a billion year after the
planet had formed so everything at the

surface
 

537
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,910

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:30,899
stromatolites these are rock formation
 

547
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,949
stromatolites these are rock formation
that are built by microbes so we know

548
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:33,959
that are built by microbes so we know
 

549
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,350
that are built by microbes so we know
that we we know how to recognize them

550
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,360
that we we know how to recognize them

you could have chemical traces as well

552
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:39,540
you could have chemical traces as well
 

553
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,990
you could have chemical traces as well
there is some interesting question marks

554
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
there is some interesting question marks
 

555
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,530
there is some interesting question marks
right now about carbon Isotopes at

556
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:44,540
right now about carbon Isotopes at
 

557
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,710
right now about carbon Isotopes at
Crater because we found an abundance of

558
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
Crater because we found an abundance of
 

559
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,130
Crater because we found an abundance of
C12 which normally is used by life on

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,140
C12 which normally is used by life on
 

561
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,110
C12 which normally is used by life on
Earth but it can produce be produced by

562
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,120
Earth but it can produce be produced by
 

563
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,790
Earth but it can produce be produced by
other things so it's not that it's a

564
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:55,800
other things so it's not that it's a
 

565
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,610
other things so it's not that it's a
real bio signature in itself but it's

566
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:58,620
real bio signature in itself but it's
 

567
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,829
real bio signature in itself but it's
intriguing we have now the C12 and we

568
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:00,839
intriguing we have now the C12 and we
 

569
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,630
intriguing we have now the C12 and we
have methane but uh going back it's a

you have lots of distractions where you

574
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:09,899
you have lots of distractions where you
 

575
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,829
you have lots of distractions where you
have lots of impact cratering Etc so but

576
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:12,839
have lots of impact cratering Etc so but
 

577
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,310
have lots of impact cratering Etc so but
we still have very old rocks that are

578
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
we still have very old rocks that are
 

579
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,650
we still have very old rocks that are
that survive from that time so these are

580
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:18,660
that survive from that time so these are
 

581
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,690
that survive from that time so these are
good uh good places that's why we're

582
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:20,700
good uh good places that's why we're
 

583
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,310
good uh good places that's why we're
sending the Rovers in those places

584
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
sending the Rovers in those places

ancient lakes and impact craters and and
 

587
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,230
ancient lakes and impact craters and and
places where you have very old rocks So

588
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,240
places where you have very old rocks So
 

589
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,970
places where you have very old rocks So
when you say ancient lakes and impact

590
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:28,980
when you say ancient lakes and impact
 

591
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,970
when you say ancient lakes and impact
craters the simple question so impact

592
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:31,980
craters the simple question so impact
 

593
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,090

be a comet as well mostly eyes so is

600
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:43,019
be a comet as well mostly eyes so is
 

601
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,889
be a comet as well mostly eyes so is
that good for life or bad for life

602
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:47,899

 

603
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,389

it's actually both

on our planet they were built in just
 

617
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,269
on our planet they were built in just
because our planet is made of this kind

618

comes there is a lot of Destruction

626
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,360
comes there is a lot of Destruction
 

627

going on but at the same time those
 

629
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,069
going on but at the same time those

and if the environment around is
 

635
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,389
and if the environment around is
favorable you might possibly be have

636
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:35,399
favorable you might possibly be have
 

637
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,690
favorable you might possibly be have
some sitting going on that's one of the

some sitting going on that's one of the
 

639
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,690
some sitting going on that's one of the
aspect of what we call panspermia which

640
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:41,700
aspect of what we call panspermia which
 

641
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,970
aspect of what we call panspermia which
is the fact that comets and asteroid

642
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:43,980
is the fact that comets and asteroid
 

643
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,190
is the fact that comets and asteroid
have the building blocks of life and

644
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:46,200
have the building blocks of life and
 

645
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,530
have the building blocks of life and

to see planets this is a theory what

to see planets this is a theory what
percent of you

percent of you
 

653
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,150
percent of you
when you're looking up at the stars and

654
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
when you're looking up at the stars and

past Premier has is what happened on
 

659
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,230
past Premier has is what happened on

mars or or on Earth
 

661
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,449
mars or or on Earth
which is the building blocks of life

662
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:05,459
which is the building blocks of life
 

663
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,030
which is the building blocks of life
came from elsewhere well but you know

664
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,040
came from elsewhere well but you know
 

665
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,370
came from elsewhere well but you know
that's the thing panspermia is a vector

666
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:10,380
that's the thing panspermia is a vector
 

667
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,310
that's the thing panspermia is a vector
potential Vector which means that it

668
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,320
potential Vector which means that it
 

669
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,710
potential Vector which means that it
actually distributes the stuff of life

670
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:15,720
actually distributes the stuff of life
 

671
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,410
actually distributes the stuff of life
left and right but it doesn't explain

672
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:18,420
left and right but it doesn't explain
 

673
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,750
left and right but it doesn't explain
the origin of life it does it's not the

674
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:20,760
the origin of life it does it's not the
 

675
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,750
the origin of life it does it's not the
environment itself it just promotes

676
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
environment itself it just promotes
 

677
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,790
environment itself it just promotes
maybe and we still have to prove this

678
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:25,800
maybe and we still have to prove this
 

679
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,430
maybe and we still have to prove this
but what we know is that the stuff we

680
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:28,440
but what we know is that the stuff we
 

681
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,069
but what we know is that the stuff we
are made of is very abundant all over

682
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:31,079
are made of is very abundant all over
 

683
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,530
are made of is very abundant all over
the place including in interstellar

684
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:33,540
the place including in interstellar
 

685
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,129
the place including in interstellar
medium so it's all over it's all over

686
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:37,139
medium so it's all over it's all over
 

687
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,370
medium so it's all over it's all over
the idea is that maybe it just waits to

688
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:40,380
the idea is that maybe it just waits to
 

689
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,009
the idea is that maybe it just waits to
have the proper environment and we know

690
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:43,019
have the proper environment and we know
 

691
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,930
have the proper environment and we know
what it needs here on Earth it needs

692
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:44,940
what it needs here on Earth it needs
 

693
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,689
what it needs here on Earth it needs
water it needs energy shelter and

694
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:47,699
water it needs energy shelter and
 

695
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,449
water it needs energy shelter and
nutrient so you're fundamentally

696
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:50,459
nutrient so you're fundamentally
 

697
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,970
nutrient so you're fundamentally
interested in the origin of life

698
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:52,980
interested in the origin of life
 

699
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,850
interested in the origin of life
and the big leaps

700
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:55,860
and the big leaps
 

701
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,970
and the big leaps
that in evolutionary history that could

702
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:58,980
that in evolutionary history that could
 

703
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,550
that in evolutionary history that could
be like an origin of something origin of

704
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:01,560
be like an origin of something origin of
 

705
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,090
be like an origin of something origin of
eucharia's origin of

706
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:04,100
eucharia's origin of
 

707
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,430
eucharia's origin of
photosynthesis origin of whatever I just

708
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
photosynthesis origin of whatever I just
 

709
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,110
photosynthesis origin of whatever I just
think if we're a civilization here on

710
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
think if we're a civilization here on
 

711
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,910
think if we're a civilization here on
Earth and we survive another few hundred

712
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:10,920
Earth and we survive another few hundred
 

713
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,710
Earth and we survive another few hundred
years

714
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
years
 

715
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,449
years
I think it would be a good idea to take

716
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:14,459
I think it would be a good idea to take
 

717
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,030
I think it would be a good idea to take
a big gun and just shoot life out there

718
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
a big gun and just shoot life out there
 

719
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,670
a big gun and just shoot life out there
like a lifegun basically try to create

720
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
like a lifegun basically try to create
 

721
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,769
like a lifegun basically try to create
panspermia that's a good backup solution

722
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:21,779
panspermia that's a good backup solution
 

723
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,730
panspermia that's a good backup solution
so one way is to actually uh copy our

724
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:25,740
so one way is to actually uh copy our
 

725
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,850
so one way is to actually uh copy our
brains and actual humans some complex

726
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:28,860
brains and actual humans some complex
 

727
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,530
brains and actual humans some complex
information and send it out there

728
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:30,540
information and send it out there
 

729
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,350
information and send it out there
another way to preserve life is just to

730
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
another way to preserve life is just to
 

731
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,069
another way to preserve life is just to
like

732
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
like
 

733
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,410
like
send the basic building blocks send them

734
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:36,420
send the basic building blocks send them
 

735
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,230
send the basic building blocks send them
a bacteria a bunch of

736
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,240
a bacteria a bunch of
 

737
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,150
a bacteria a bunch of
whatever the rugged organisms are on

738
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,160
whatever the rugged organisms are on
 

739
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,590
whatever the rugged organisms are on
earth just send a bunch of those these

740
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,600
earth just send a bunch of those these
 

741
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,329
earth just send a bunch of those these
are not the building blocks they are

742
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:44,339
are not the building blocks they are
 

743
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,790
are not the building blocks they are
actual organism so what is that a nice

744
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
actual organism so what is that a nice
 

745
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,069
actual organism so what is that a nice
shortcut or do we want to because you

746
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:49,079
shortcut or do we want to because you
 

747
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,110
shortcut or do we want to because you
said building blocks are everywhere yeah

748
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
said building blocks are everywhere yeah
 

749
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,269
said building blocks are everywhere yeah
freaks of Life the carbon hydrogen Etc

750
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
freaks of Life the carbon hydrogen Etc
 

751
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,710
freaks of Life the carbon hydrogen Etc
uh they they wear uh produced by the

752
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:57,720
uh they they wear uh produced by the
 

753
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,810
uh they they wear uh produced by the
death of precious Stars so this is how

754
00:15:59,810 --> 00:15:59,820
death of precious Stars so this is how
 

755
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,930
death of precious Stars so this is how
they were produced and um stars like

756
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:02,940
they were produced and um stars like
 

757
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,870
they were produced and um stars like
arson uh started to form 10 billion

758
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:05,880
arson uh started to form 10 billion
 

759
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,569
arson uh started to form 10 billion
years ago that doesn't mean that the the

760
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:08,579
years ago that doesn't mean that the the
 

761
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,790
years ago that doesn't mean that the the
sun is the only kind of star that

762
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
sun is the only kind of star that
 

763
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,290
sun is the only kind of star that
produce you know life or an evil life

764
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:14,300
produce you know life or an evil life
 

765
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,629
produce you know life or an evil life
but actually was produced in uh 10

766
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:17,639
but actually was produced in uh 10
 

767
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,310
but actually was produced in uh 10
billion years ago now what you're

768
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,320
billion years ago now what you're
 

769
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,530
billion years ago now what you're
talking about is is a little different

770
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:21,540
talking about is is a little different
 

771
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,990
talking about is is a little different
right now there are many

772
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
right now there are many
 

773
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,949
right now there are many
um

774
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
um
 

775
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,629
um
many efforts to do the type of thing you

776
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:29,639
many efforts to do the type of thing you
 

777
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,290
many efforts to do the type of thing you
are talking about which is to put our

778
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:33,300
are talking about which is to put our
 

779
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,870
are talking about which is to put our
DNA on whatever kind of substrate and

780
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:35,880
DNA on whatever kind of substrate and
 

781
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,629
DNA on whatever kind of substrate and
preserve it involves either in different

782
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
preserve it involves either in different
 

783
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,870
preserve it involves either in different
place on Earth or on the moon some

784
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:41,880
place on Earth or on the moon some
 

785
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,069
place on Earth or on the moon some
people are already thinking about

786
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:43,079
people are already thinking about
 

787
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,850
people are already thinking about
putting DNA on the moon as far as brain

788
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:46,860
putting DNA on the moon as far as brain
 

789
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,030
putting DNA on the moon as far as brain
is concerned and it's drawing towards

790
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,040
is concerned and it's drawing towards
 

791
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,970
is concerned and it's drawing towards
transhumanism which is uh the

792
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:52,980
transhumanism which is uh the
 

793
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,910
transhumanism which is uh the
enhancement of who we are through Ai and

794
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
enhancement of who we are through Ai and
 

795
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,310
enhancement of who we are through Ai and
machine learning of course having

796
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
machine learning of course having
 

797
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,030
machine learning of course having
backups is a good thing for me I would

798
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,040
backups is a good thing for me I would
 

799
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,130
backups is a good thing for me I would
say that taking care of our planets and

800
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,140
say that taking care of our planets and
 

801
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,829
say that taking care of our planets and
going back to a place where we are in

802
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:06,839
going back to a place where we are in
 

803
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,809
going back to a place where we are in
equilibrium with our environment would

804
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:08,819
equilibrium with our environment would
 

805
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,110
equilibrium with our environment would
be also maybe the best backup possible

806
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,120
be also maybe the best backup possible
 

807
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,110
be also maybe the best backup possible
and let Evolution do its things right

808
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
and let Evolution do its things right
 

809
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,870
and let Evolution do its things right
now we are like teenagers with enough

810
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:17,880
now we are like teenagers with enough
 

811
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,510
now we are like teenagers with enough
brain to create Cool Tools

812
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:20,520
brain to create Cool Tools
 

813
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,730
brain to create Cool Tools
but we don't have enough brain to

814
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:22,740
but we don't have enough brain to
 

815
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,829
but we don't have enough brain to
understand yet the consequences of what

816
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:24,839
understand yet the consequences of what
 

817
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,289
understand yet the consequences of what
we are doing and right now we are paying

818
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:27,299
we are doing and right now we are paying
 

819
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:31,310
we are doing and right now we are paying
for this so uh the question is whether

820
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,320
for this so uh the question is whether
 

821
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,130
for this so uh the question is whether
we are going to be able to move

822
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,140
we are going to be able to move
 

823
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,970
we are going to be able to move
forward and learn from the mistakes we

824
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:37,980
forward and learn from the mistakes we
 

825
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,070
forward and learn from the mistakes we
are making to become a mature

826
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
are making to become a mature
 

827
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,190
are making to become a mature
civilization you probably heard of the

828
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
civilization you probably heard of the
 

829
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,950
civilization you probably heard of the
Drake equation that would be the L at

830
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:45,960
Drake equation that would be the L at
 

831
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,010
Drake equation that would be the L at
the very end the duration the duration

832
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,020
the very end the duration the duration
 

833
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,710
the very end the duration the duration
of intelligent civilization exactly and

834
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:51,720
of intelligent civilization exactly and
 

835
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,510
of intelligent civilization exactly and
and or at least uh the length of time a

836
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:56,520
and or at least uh the length of time a
 

837
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,870
and or at least uh the length of time a
civilization remains detectable it can

838
00:17:59,870 --> 00:17:59,880
civilization remains detectable it can
 

839
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,370
civilization remains detectable it can
disappear from the radar screen

840
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:01,380
disappear from the radar screen
 

841
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,529
disappear from the radar screen
literally for a number of reasons the

842
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:03,539
literally for a number of reasons the
 

843
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,289
literally for a number of reasons the
first one is

844
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:05,299
first one is
 

845
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:08,270
first one is
destroy itself or being destroyed by

destroy itself or being destroyed by
 

847
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,650
destroy itself or being destroyed by
external uh events or it can become so

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:17,460
and with the universe and so Advanced

that it disappears because it melts

854
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,380
that it disappears because it melts
 

855
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,350
that it disappears because it melts
really in the background and it's not

856
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
really in the background and it's not
 

857
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,470
really in the background and it's not
visible anymore uh there are some wild

858
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
visible anymore uh there are some wild
 

859
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,110
visible anymore uh there are some wild
theories out there saying that

860
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
theories out there saying that
 

861
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,450
theories out there saying that
um civilization might be so Advanced

862
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:29,460
um civilization might be so Advanced
 

863
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,909
um civilization might be so Advanced
that you cannot distinguish them from

864
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
that you cannot distinguish them from
 

865
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,510
that you cannot distinguish them from
physical processes and uh that was an

866
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
physical processes and uh that was an
 

867
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,070
physical processes and uh that was an
example doesn't say that this is the

868
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,080
example doesn't say that this is the
 

869
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,230
example doesn't say that this is the
case but some people say imagine that in

870
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,240
case but some people say imagine that in
 

871
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,110
case but some people say imagine that in
fact all the dark matter that we we see

872
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,120
fact all the dark matter that we we see
 

873
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,169
fact all the dark matter that we we see
or we we theorized about is in fact some

874
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:45,179
or we we theorized about is in fact some
 

875
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,430
or we we theorized about is in fact some
sort of a biological uh process so you

876
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
sort of a biological uh process so you
 

877
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,770
sort of a biological uh process so you
can think about a number of things

878
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:50,780
can think about a number of things
 

879
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,650
can think about a number of things
personally I believe that

880
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:54,660
personally I believe that
 

881
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,650
personally I believe that
what you talk about about preserving our

882
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:57,660
what you talk about about preserving our
 

883
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,710
what you talk about about preserving our
information is kind of what life does we

884
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
information is kind of what life does we
 

885
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,010
information is kind of what life does we
we need to look at ourselves uh as not

886
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,020
we need to look at ourselves uh as not
 

887
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,150
we need to look at ourselves uh as not
different

888
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,160
different
 

889
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,850
different
of what the little cell that started off

890
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:07,860
of what the little cell that started off
 

891
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,610
of what the little cell that started off
was and this is what tells you not about

892
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:10,620
was and this is what tells you not about
 

893
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,529
was and this is what tells you not about
the origin of life but in fact the

894
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:12,539
the origin of life but in fact the
 

895
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:13,970
the origin of life but in fact the
nature of life which is a lot more

896
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:13,980
nature of life which is a lot more
 

897
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,549
nature of life which is a lot more
interesting to me because it is the

898
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
interesting to me because it is the
 

899
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,010
interesting to me because it is the
nature of life is really what is going

900
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,020
nature of life is really what is going
 

901
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,770
nature of life is really what is going
to give you some Universal signature to

902
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:21,780
to give you some Universal signature to
 

903
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,810
to give you some Universal signature to
look for it all over the place and not

904
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:23,820
look for it all over the place and not
 

905
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,110
look for it all over the place and not
only around ponds of water for Life as

906
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
only around ponds of water for Life as
 

907
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,110
only around ponds of water for Life as
we know it but the nature of life is

908
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,120
we know it but the nature of life is
 

909
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,130
we know it but the nature of life is
telling you that life wants to

910
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,140
telling you that life wants to
 

911
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,070
telling you that life wants to
get the most information possible around

912
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,080
get the most information possible around
 

913
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,350
get the most information possible around
its surroundings and complexities in

914
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
its surroundings and complexities in
 

915
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,570
its surroundings and complexities in
fact the ability to

916
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:41,580
fact the ability to
 

917
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,409
fact the ability to
gather and exchange and preserve the

918
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:45,419
gather and exchange and preserve the
 

919
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,529
gather and exchange and preserve the
most information possible and and so

920
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:48,539
most information possible and and so
 

921
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,350
most information possible and and so
what you're saying is kind of preserving

922
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
what you're saying is kind of preserving
 

923
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,950
what you're saying is kind of preserving
the kind of information we have

924
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:53,960
the kind of information we have
 

925
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,310
the kind of information we have
so in the things that we are doing

926
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
so in the things that we are doing
 

927
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,850
so in the things that we are doing
as life happened

928
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:01,860
as life happened
 

929
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,650
as life happened
and I say happen because we don't know

930
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:03,660
and I say happen because we don't know
 

931
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,010
and I say happen because we don't know
what life is uh we have 123 definitions

932
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,020
what life is uh we have 123 definitions
 

933
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,750
what life is uh we have 123 definitions
of life and some people are saying we

934
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:08,760
of life and some people are saying we
 

935
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,310
of life and some people are saying we
don't have any definition we only have

936
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
don't have any definition we only have
 

937
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,289
don't have any definition we only have
descriptions of life

938
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:12,299
descriptions of life
 

939
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:15,230
descriptions of life
and and that's true and that's true so

940
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,240
and and that's true and that's true so
 

941
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,450
and and that's true and that's true so
think about it for two minutes we are

942
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:17,460
think about it for two minutes we are
 

943
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,710
think about it for two minutes we are
looking for something we don't know it

944
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
looking for something we don't know it
 

945
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,930
looking for something we don't know it
is but we have a few clues about the

946
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:20,940
is but we have a few clues about the
 

947
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,510
is but we have a few clues about the
nature of life there are some really

948
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
nature of life there are some really
 

949
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,130
nature of life there are some really
good theories the first one was

950
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:25,140
good theories the first one was
 

951
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,830
good theories the first one was
Schrodinger right uh in the 40s right

952
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
Schrodinger right uh in the 40s right
 

953
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,990
Schrodinger right uh in the 40s right
now there is a guy named Jeremy England

954
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000
now there is a guy named Jeremy England
 

955
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,870
now there is a guy named Jeremy England
it's another biophysical theory of life

956
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
it's another biophysical theory of life
 

957
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,190
it's another biophysical theory of life
it says life is the inevitable resolve

958
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
it says life is the inevitable resolve
 

959
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,830
it says life is the inevitable resolve
of thermophysics

960
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840
of thermophysics
 

961
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,710
of thermophysics
this is the best way to beat entropy to

962
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
this is the best way to beat entropy to
 

963
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,770
this is the best way to beat entropy to
fight entropy but when you look at what

964
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:45,780
fight entropy but when you look at what
 

965
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,169
fight entropy but when you look at what
we are doing if you want to know what

966
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:48,179
we are doing if you want to know what
 

967
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,330
we are doing if you want to know what
the nature of life is look at our

968
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:50,340
the nature of life is look at our
 

969
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,190
the nature of life is look at our
languages and they can be very different

970
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,200
languages and they can be very different
 

971
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,350
languages and they can be very different
languages but they all have the same

972
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,360
languages but they all have the same
 

973
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,770
languages but they all have the same
purpose right exchange information

974
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:56,780
purpose right exchange information
 

975
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,110
purpose right exchange information
understand you know store information

976
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
understand you know store information
 

977
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,390
understand you know store information
and and uh also whether it is with

978
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
and and uh also whether it is with
 

979
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,150
and and uh also whether it is with
somebody at the outside

980
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:04,160
somebody at the outside
 

981
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,130
somebody at the outside
or thought in yourself

982
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,140
or thought in yourself
 

983
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,230
or thought in yourself
that's the same thing the cell was doing

984
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,240
that's the same thing the cell was doing
 

985
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,470
that's the same thing the cell was doing
but now when you're looking at life and

986
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
but now when you're looking at life and
 

987
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,650
but now when you're looking at life and
at the structure of our languages

988
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:15,660
at the structure of our languages
 

989
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,490
at the structure of our languages
life started with anatom so it's an atom

990
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:19,500
life started with anatom so it's an atom
 

991
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,370
life started with anatom so it's an atom
they get together to create inorganic

992
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:22,380
they get together to create inorganic
 

993
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,529
they get together to create inorganic
molecules then you have complex

994
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:24,539
molecules then you have complex
 

995
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,470
molecules then you have complex
inorganic molecules then you get to

996
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:27,480
inorganic molecules then you get to
 

997
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,830
inorganic molecules then you get to
organic molecules complex in organic

998
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:30,840
organic molecules complex in organic
 

999
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,130
organic molecules complex in organic
molecules and then you have RNA DNA Etc

1000
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,140
molecules and then you have RNA DNA Etc
 

1001
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,649
molecules and then you have RNA DNA Etc
look at the structure of our language

1002
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:36,659
look at the structure of our language
 

1003
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,690
look at the structure of our language
we created alphabets

1004
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:38,700
we created alphabets
 

1005
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,490
we created alphabets
letters

1006
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:40,500
letters
 

1007
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,430
letters
that's your anthem then we put them

1008
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
that's your anthem then we put them
 

1009
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,370
that's your anthem then we put them
together to create syllables right those

1010
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:46,380
together to create syllables right those
 

1011
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,770
together to create syllables right those
syllables get together to create words

1012
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:48,780
syllables get together to create words
 

1013
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,990
syllables get together to create words
tell you something

1014
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,000
tell you something
 

1015
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,810
tell you something
but they are nothing without a verb that

1016
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:53,820
but they are nothing without a verb that
 

1017
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,529
but they are nothing without a verb that
gives the direction that's RNA and DNA

1018
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:56,539
gives the direction that's RNA and DNA
 

1019
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:59,210
gives the direction that's RNA and DNA
and and then you can put all the

1020
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,220
and and then you can put all the
 

1021
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,909
and and then you can put all the
complements you want our languages are

1022
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
complements you want our languages are
 

1023
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,510
complements you want our languages are
built exactly as life is built we are

1024
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
built exactly as life is built we are
 

1025
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,029
built exactly as life is built we are
repeating patterns I call this the

1026
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:08,039
repeating patterns I call this the
 

1027
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,010
repeating patterns I call this the
mandelbrot universe and the fractal

1028
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,020
mandelbrot universe and the fractal
 

1029
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,169
mandelbrot universe and the fractal
Universe because this is exactly what it

1030
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:12,179
Universe because this is exactly what it
 

1031
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,770
Universe because this is exactly what it
is uh I I would say that as much as I do

1032
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:15,780
is uh I I would say that as much as I do
 

1033
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,470
is uh I I would say that as much as I do
believe to sending probes to explore the

1034
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
believe to sending probes to explore the
 

1035
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,690
believe to sending probes to explore the
Universe I say we should also look

1036
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:20,700
Universe I say we should also look
 

1037
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,610
Universe I say we should also look
inward to find the uh the answer to some

1038
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:25,620
inward to find the uh the answer to some
 

1039
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,289
inward to find the uh the answer to some
of the profound question of who we are

1040
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:27,299
of the profound question of who we are
 

1041
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,149
of the profound question of who we are
what's life what's the nature of life

1042
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:29,159
what's life what's the nature of life
 

1043
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,029
what's life what's the nature of life
because we are expressing life so

1044
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:32,039
because we are expressing life so
 

1045
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,190
because we are expressing life so
searching not for life

1046
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,200
searching not for life
 

1047
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,710
searching not for life
but for the nature of Life the nature of

1048
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
but for the nature of Life the nature of
 

1049
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,870
but for the nature of Life the nature of
absolutely I am more interested in that

1050
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
absolutely I am more interested in that
 

1051
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,810
absolutely I am more interested in that
because the day we understand the nature

1052
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:41,820
because the day we understand the nature
 

1053
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,169
because the day we understand the nature
of life then we have a universal

1054
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:45,179
of life then we have a universal
 

1055
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,270
of life then we have a universal
um by your signature and it doesn't

1056
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
um by your signature and it doesn't
 

1057
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,350
um by your signature and it doesn't
matter whether this life respond to the

1058
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
matter whether this life respond to the
 

1059
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,289
matter whether this life respond to the
same kind of biochemical processes as we

1060
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:54,299
same kind of biochemical processes as we
 

1061
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,630
same kind of biochemical processes as we
do although it makes sense I I told you

1062
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
do although it makes sense I I told you
 

1063
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,049
do although it makes sense I I told you
about the generational aspect of the

1064
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:00,059
about the generational aspect of the
 

1065
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,970
about the generational aspect of the
bricks of Life the stuff we are made of

1066
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:01,980
bricks of Life the stuff we are made of
 

1067
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,010
bricks of Life the stuff we are made of
the sun is part of the youngest

1068
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,020
the sun is part of the youngest
 

1069
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,830
the sun is part of the youngest
generation of stars and the first two

1070
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840
generation of stars and the first two
 

1071
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,990
generation of stars and the first two
generations of stars didn't produce the

1072
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,000
generations of stars didn't produce the
 

1073
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,990
generations of stars didn't produce the
kind of elements we are made of they

1074
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
kind of elements we are made of they
 

1075
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,330
kind of elements we are made of they
were stars that were either

1076
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,340
were stars that were either
 

1077
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,770
were stars that were either
uh without metal just made of allium and

1078
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:18,780
uh without metal just made of allium and
 

1079
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,370
uh without metal just made of allium and
hydrogen or poor in metals

1080
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:22,380
hydrogen or poor in metals
 

1081
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,730
hydrogen or poor in metals
so the stars died off

1082
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:25,740
so the stars died off
 

1083
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,970
so the stars died off
and stars like the sun were born from

1084
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:28,980
and stars like the sun were born from
 

1085
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,470
and stars like the sun were born from
those and this is why we have elements

1086
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:33,480
those and this is why we have elements
 

1087
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,409
those and this is why we have elements
like carbon hydrogen oxygen that is

1088
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:36,419
like carbon hydrogen oxygen that is
 

1089
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:37,970
like carbon hydrogen oxygen that is
running now

1090
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:37,980
running now
 

1091
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,190
running now
um and and that's the life we're built

1092
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,200
um and and that's the life we're built
 

1093
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,970
um and and that's the life we're built
on so I I think it's not stupid to be

1094
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:43,980
on so I I think it's not stupid to be
 

1095
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,529
on so I I think it's not stupid to be
looking for something that looks like us

1096
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:45,539
looking for something that looks like us
 

1097
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,210
looking for something that looks like us
because right now in the universe this

1098
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:47,220
because right now in the universe this
 

1099
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,770
because right now in the universe this
is the stuff that's the most abundant

1100
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:48,780
is the stuff that's the most abundant
 

1101
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,130
is the stuff that's the most abundant
and we see with the exoplanet with

1102
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,140
and we see with the exoplanet with
 

1103
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,830
and we see with the exoplanet with
Kepler with tests and and now with gem

1104
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:54,840
Kepler with tests and and now with gem
 

1105
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,890
Kepler with tests and and now with gem
swipe we see that there are many many

1106
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:57,900
swipe we see that there are many many
 

1107
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,510
swipe we see that there are many many
different type of planets that may be

1108
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
different type of planets that may be
 

1109
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,549
different type of planets that may be
habitable in the habitable zone of their

1110
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:01,559
habitable in the habitable zone of their
 

1111
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,430
habitable in the habitable zone of their
stars there are countless stars like the

1112
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:04,440
stars there are countless stars like the
 

1113
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,549
stars there are countless stars like the
Sun but more interestingly enough there

1114
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:07,559
Sun but more interestingly enough there
 

1115
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,890
Sun but more interestingly enough there
are other type of stars where you do

1116
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:09,900
are other type of stars where you do
 

1117
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,409
are other type of stars where you do
have habitable zone as well and where

1118
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:12,419
have habitable zone as well and where
 

1119
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,870
have habitable zone as well and where
the duration of the Stars

1120
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
the duration of the Stars
 

1121
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,390
the duration of the Stars
sometimes a thousand times more than our

1122
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:17,400
sometimes a thousand times more than our
 

1123
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,830
sometimes a thousand times more than our
sun

1124
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:18,840
sun
 

1125
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,110
sun
so you can imagine all sorts of things

1126
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
so you can imagine all sorts of things
 

1127
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,049
so you can imagine all sorts of things
and you can imagine what type of life

1128
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:24,059
and you can imagine what type of life
 

1129
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,529
and you can imagine what type of life
would be on around those Stars the

1130
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:27,539
would be on around those Stars the
 

1131
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,110
would be on around those Stars the
biochemistry might be quite similar in

1132
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,120
biochemistry might be quite similar in
 

1133
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,630
biochemistry might be quite similar in
fact and especially for the simple life

1134
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
fact and especially for the simple life
 

1135
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,909
fact and especially for the simple life
because Simple Life Starts really

1136
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:34,919
because Simple Life Starts really
 

1137
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,750
because Simple Life Starts really
quickly on Earth so my take on this is

1138
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:38,760
quickly on Earth so my take on this is
 

1139
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,830
quickly on Earth so my take on this is
that the universe is full of

1140
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
that the universe is full of
 

1141
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,549
that the universe is full of
cyanobacteria but as far as intelligent

1142
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:43,559
cyanobacteria but as far as intelligent
 

1143
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,750
cyanobacteria but as far as intelligent
life it takes more time so that can take

1144
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
life it takes more time so that can take
 

1145
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,450
life it takes more time so that can take
different you know aspect do you think

1146
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:50,460
different you know aspect do you think
 

1147
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,330
different you know aspect do you think
it's possible that the universe

1148
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,340
it's possible that the universe
 

1149
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,090
it's possible that the universe
it's full of bacteria and even those

1150
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,100
it's full of bacteria and even those
 

1151
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,610
it's full of bacteria and even those
stars that last a thousand times longer

1152
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:58,620
stars that last a thousand times longer
 

1153
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,049
stars that last a thousand times longer
than the Sun

1154
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:00,059
than the Sun
 

1155
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,289
than the Sun
even even on the

1156
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:02,299
even even on the
 

1157
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,690
even even on the
planets that orbit those

1158
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:05,700
planets that orbit those
 

1159
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,070
planets that orbit those
Stars

1160
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,080
Stars
 

1161
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,890
Stars
maybe it's bacteria

1162
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:09,900
maybe it's bacteria
 

1163
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,350
maybe it's bacteria
and four billions and billions and

1164
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,360
and four billions and billions and
 

1165
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,350
and four billions and billions and
billions of years we actually don't know

1166
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
billions of years we actually don't know
 

1167
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,630
billions of years we actually don't know
what triggered the evolution to

1168
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:17,640
what triggered the evolution to
 

1169
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,549
what triggered the evolution to
complexity on Earth that's still a big

1170
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:19,559
complexity on Earth that's still a big
 

1171
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,930
complexity on Earth that's still a big
question mark is that the most

1172
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:20,940
question mark is that the most
 

1173
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,570
question mark is that the most
impressive invention on Earth to you is

1174
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:23,580
impressive invention on Earth to you is
 

1175
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,230
impressive invention on Earth to you is
that Cambrian Revolution is really what

1176
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:27,240
that Cambrian Revolution is really what
 

1177
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,289
that Cambrian Revolution is really what
took us towards what we are and in the

1178
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:30,299
took us towards what we are and in the
 

1179
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,909
took us towards what we are and in the
meantime there were the dinosaurs Etc

1180
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
meantime there were the dinosaurs Etc
 

1181
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,769
meantime there were the dinosaurs Etc
the dinosaurs were wiped out so the

1182
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:33,779
the dinosaurs were wiped out so the
 

1183
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,810
the dinosaurs were wiped out so the
evolution could have taken a completely

1184
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:35,820
evolution could have taken a completely
 

1185
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,330
evolution could have taken a completely
different turn uh it's always I would

1186
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:38,340
different turn uh it's always I would
 

1187
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,190
different turn uh it's always I would
say mass extinction that are going to

1188
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,200
say mass extinction that are going to
 

1189
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,330
say mass extinction that are going to
drive what's the end game but

1190
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:44,340
drive what's the end game but
 

1191
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:44,990
drive what's the end game but
um

1192
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,000
um
 

1193
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,690
um
yeah you take two planets and you change

1194
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:47,700
yeah you take two planets and you change
 

1195
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,990
yeah you take two planets and you change
you know those asteroid impacts all

1196
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,000
you know those asteroid impacts all
 

1197
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,230
you know those asteroid impacts all
those big geological events that wipe

1198
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
those big geological events that wipe
 

1199
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,789
those big geological events that wipe
out like 90 of Life at any time the

1200
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
out like 90 of Life at any time the
 

1201
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,130
out like 90 of Life at any time the
thing that seemed to be

1202
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,140
thing that seemed to be
 

1203
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,370
thing that seemed to be
um interesting there are two things the

1204
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:04,380
um interesting there are two things the
 

1205
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,230
um interesting there are two things the
first one is where you are located on

1206
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
first one is where you are located on
 

1207
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,610
first one is where you are located on
our galaxy uh matters a lot

1208
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:10,620
our galaxy uh matters a lot
 

1209
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,850
our galaxy uh matters a lot
we actually are in the habitable zone of

1210
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:13,860
we actually are in the habitable zone of
 

1211
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,049
we actually are in the habitable zone of
our galaxy

1212
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:15,059
our galaxy
 

1213
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,630
our galaxy
and if you are too close to the center

1214
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:17,640
and if you are too close to the center
 

1215
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,769
and if you are too close to the center
then it's a lot denser and remember we

1216
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:21,779
then it's a lot denser and remember we
 

1217
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,649
then it's a lot denser and remember we
have the Oort cloud around our solar

1218
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:24,659
have the Oort cloud around our solar
 

1219
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,590
have the Oort cloud around our solar
system and if you are in the region of

1220
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
system and if you are in the region of
 

1221
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,230
system and if you are in the region of
the Galaxy that's too populated then you

1222
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
the Galaxy that's too populated then you
 

1223
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,370
the Galaxy that's too populated then you
are going to run interaction

1224
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:31,380
are going to run interaction
 

1225
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,830
are going to run interaction
gravitational interaction with all these

1226
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
gravitational interaction with all these
 

1227
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,310
gravitational interaction with all these
stars and since it's more dense you will

1228
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,320
stars and since it's more dense you will
 

1229
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,010
stars and since it's more dense you will
have more of the Comets that are living

1230
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,020
have more of the Comets that are living
 

1231
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,010
have more of the Comets that are living
in the old Cloud being ejected from the

1232
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,020
in the old Cloud being ejected from the
 

1233
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,430
in the old Cloud being ejected from the
Oort cloud and coming towards the inner

1234
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:46,440
Oort cloud and coming towards the inner
 

1235
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,970
Oort cloud and coming towards the inner
solar system and collide with planets so

1236
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:49,980
solar system and collide with planets so
 

1237
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,130
solar system and collide with planets so
you will have more of these impacts if

1238
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:52,140
you will have more of these impacts if
 

1239
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,750
you will have more of these impacts if
you are too close to the center of the

1240
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
you are too close to the center of the
 

1241
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,850
you are too close to the center of the
Galaxy not to mention the radiation

1242
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:55,860
Galaxy not to mention the radiation
 

1243
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,850
Galaxy not to mention the radiation
there is a place in our galaxy where

1244
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:58,860
there is a place in our galaxy where
 

1245
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,409
there is a place in our galaxy where
it's a really bad neighborhood you don't

1246
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:00,419
it's a really bad neighborhood you don't
 

1247
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,210
it's a really bad neighborhood you don't
want to be there you wouldn't be able to

1248
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:02,220
want to be there you wouldn't be able to
 

1249
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,730
want to be there you wouldn't be able to
have life but what really matters is

1250
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:06,740
have life but what really matters is
 

1251
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,370
have life but what really matters is
extinctions but also

1252
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:10,380
extinctions but also
 

1253
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,769
extinctions but also
um the climate history

1254
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:12,779
um the climate history
 

1255
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,730
um the climate history
of a planet has a role to play and it

1256
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:16,740
of a planet has a role to play and it
 

1257
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,130
of a planet has a role to play and it
seems that

1258
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:19,140
seems that
 

1259
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,710
seems that
it's a theory it still has to be backed

1260
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:21,720
it's a theory it still has to be backed
 

1261
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,810
it's a theory it still has to be backed
up by more observation but there is a

1262
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:23,820
up by more observation but there is a
 

1263
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,190
up by more observation but there is a
good correlation

1264
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
good correlation
 

1265
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,370
good correlation
between not only the passage of the

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:28,380
between not only the passage of the
 

1267
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,350
between not only the passage of the
solar system towards the center of the

1268
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,360
solar system towards the center of the
 

1269
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,450
solar system towards the center of the
Galaxy there is one place where we get

1270
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:32,460
Galaxy there is one place where we get
 

1271
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,490
Galaxy there is one place where we get
hit by asteroid because of the

hit by asteroid because of the
 

1273
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,950
hit by asteroid because of the
interaction I was telling you about but

1274
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
interaction I was telling you about but
 

1275
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,950
interaction I was telling you about but
the other one is the climate with the

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:39,960
the other one is the climate with the
 

1277
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,909
the other one is the climate with the

00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
Evolution seem to be associated with
 

1281
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,470
Evolution seem to be associated with
snowball Earth episodes

00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:56,580
snowball episode
 

1287
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,029
snowball episode
intuitively you would think that they

1288
00:27:59,029 --> 00:27:59,039
intuitively you would think that they
 

1289
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,390
intuitively you would think that they
are connected to a decrease in life

1290
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,400
are connected to a decrease in life
 

1291
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,850
are connected to a decrease in life
because the whole earth is covered in

1292
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:04,860
because the whole earth is covered in
 

1293
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,409
because the whole earth is covered in
ice

1294
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:06,419
ice
 

1295
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,930
ice
but for some reason there were big jumps

1296
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:08,940
but for some reason there were big jumps
 

1297
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,789
but for some reason there were big jumps
in evolution right after

1298
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
in evolution right after
 

1299
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,590
in evolution right after
each of those episodes

1300
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:12,600
each of those episodes
 

1301
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,630
each of those episodes
and and today there are other things

1302
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
and and today there are other things
 

1303
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,669
and and today there are other things
like why all of a sudden you have

1304
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:16,679
like why all of a sudden you have
 

1305
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,769
like why all of a sudden you have
mutation that seems to be responsible

1306
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:18,779
mutation that seems to be responsible
 

1307
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,710
mutation that seems to be responsible
for you know a big jump in evolution we

1308
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:21,720
for you know a big jump in evolution we
 

1309
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,750
for you know a big jump in evolution we
are not clear yet so all of those things

1310
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
are not clear yet so all of those things
 

1311
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,190
are not clear yet so all of those things
when you're thinking about life

1312
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,200
when you're thinking about life
 

1313
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,090
when you're thinking about life
elsewhere are going to come into play

1314
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,100
elsewhere are going to come into play
 

1315
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,990
elsewhere are going to come into play
and I cannot tell you that a planet that

1316
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,000
and I cannot tell you that a planet that
 

1317
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,390
and I cannot tell you that a planet that
remains habitable for much longer than

1318
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,400
remains habitable for much longer than
 

1319
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,169
remains habitable for much longer than
the earth will have an evolutionary path

1320
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:39,179
the earth will have an evolutionary path
 

1321
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,750
the earth will have an evolutionary path
that's the same or different depends on

1322
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:41,760
that's the same or different depends on
 

1323
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,930
that's the same or different depends on
extension depends on climate depends on

1324
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:44,940
extension depends on climate depends on
 

1325
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,210
extension depends on climate depends on
but not it's a little bit surreal there

1326
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:47,220
but not it's a little bit surreal there
 

1327
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,029
but not it's a little bit surreal there
were two descendants of apes

1328
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039

 

1329
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,710

figure out what what the heck is going

1330
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
figure out what what the heck is going
 

1331
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,350
figure out what what the heck is going
on and I mean we're very biased even as

1332
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,360
on and I mean we're very biased even as
 

1333
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,830
on and I mean we're very biased even as
a so you uh we're biased as humans

1334
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:00,840
a so you uh we're biased as humans
 

1335
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,549
a so you uh we're biased as humans
you're less biased as a scientist uh but

1336
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:04,559
you're less biased as a scientist uh but
 

1337
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,549
you're less biased as a scientist uh but
we still love Earth we still don't know

1338
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:07,559
we still love Earth we still don't know
 

1339
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,549
we still love Earth we still don't know
anything but this Earth and so even

1340
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
anything but this Earth and so even
 

1341
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,010
anything but this Earth and so even
though you tried to get escape from

1342
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:13,020
though you tried to get escape from
 

1343
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,830
though you tried to get escape from
thinking of what life is in the search

1344
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
thinking of what life is in the search
 

1345
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,630
thinking of what life is in the search
for the nature of life we still kind of

1346
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:17,640
for the nature of life we still kind of
 

1347
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,730
for the nature of life we still kind of
connected to the way we understand the

1348
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:19,740
connected to the way we understand the
 

1349
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,010
connected to the way we understand the
nature of life here on Earth so

1350
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,020
nature of life here on Earth so
 

1351
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,049
nature of life here on Earth so
I think that it's a little different

1352
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:24,059
I think that it's a little different
 

1353
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,630
I think that it's a little different
than that we are biased when it comes to

1354
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
than that we are biased when it comes to
 

1355
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,930
than that we are biased when it comes to
the origin of Life yes because

1356
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:29,940
the origin of Life yes because
 

1357
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,470
the origin of Life yes because
well we are the only model we know and

1358
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:33,480
well we are the only model we know and
 

1359
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,769
well we are the only model we know and
as I said it makes sense because it

1360
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:36,779
as I said it makes sense because it
 

1361
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,169
as I said it makes sense because it
seems that a lot of

1362
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:39,179
seems that a lot of
 

1363
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,470
seems that a lot of
you know uh stars like the sun appear

1364
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,480
you know uh stars like the sun appear
 

1365
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,750
you know uh stars like the sun appear
till billion years ago and there are

1366
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:44,760
till billion years ago and there are
 

1367
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,630
till billion years ago and there are
lots of words that really resemble the

1368
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:47,640
lots of words that really resemble the
 

1369
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,029
lots of words that really resemble the
Earth and lots of water out there and

1370
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:50,039
Earth and lots of water out there and
 

1371
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,610
Earth and lots of water out there and
lots of condition that could be a repeat

1372
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:52,620
lots of condition that could be a repeat
 

1373
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,370
lots of condition that could be a repeat
of what we know and we know that this

1374
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:55,380
of what we know and we know that this
 

1375
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,090
of what we know and we know that this
biochemistry works so as a again as I

1376
00:29:59,090 --> 00:29:59,100
biochemistry works so as a again as I
 

1377
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,250
biochemistry works so as a again as I
mentioned what is going to change is

1378
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,260
mentioned what is going to change is
 

1379
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,630
mentioned what is going to change is
really the evolution of a planet

1380
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:02,640
really the evolution of a planet
 

1381
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,370
really the evolution of a planet
Extinction geology Etc but our model is

1382
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:07,380
Extinction geology Etc but our model is
 

1383
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,169
Extinction geology Etc but our model is
probably very abundant I'm not saying

1384
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:09,179
probably very abundant I'm not saying
 

1385
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,090
probably very abundant I'm not saying
that the end game is going to resemble

1386
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,100
that the end game is going to resemble
 

1387
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,430
that the end game is going to resemble
us because of all this extensions Etc

1388
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
us because of all this extensions Etc
 

1389
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,450
us because of all this extensions Etc
but this is a good bias it's one that

1390
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:17,460
but this is a good bias it's one that
 

1391
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,149
but this is a good bias it's one that
has the number for it you know the

1392
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:20,159
has the number for it you know the
 

1393
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,090
has the number for it you know the
principle of mediocrity I I think that

1394
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,100
principle of mediocrity I I think that
 

1395
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,950
principle of mediocrity I I think that
in that case it really applies where the

1396
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:27,960
in that case it really applies where the
 

1397
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,049
in that case it really applies where the
Earth is representative

1398
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:30,059
Earth is representative
 

1399
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,529
Earth is representative
of an abundance of other words

1400
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:33,539
of an abundance of other words
 

1401
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,169
of an abundance of other words
now of course there can be other

1402
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:36,179
now of course there can be other
 

1403
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,870
now of course there can be other
biochemistry we have some examples in

1404
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
biochemistry we have some examples in
 

1405
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,510
biochemistry we have some examples in
our own solar system Titan might be a

1406
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
our own solar system Titan might be a
 

1407
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,549
our own solar system Titan might be a
representative of that we are not very

1408
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:43,559
representative of that we are not very
 

1409
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,649
representative of that we are not very
clear of the kind of biochemistry that

1410
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:45,659
clear of the kind of biochemistry that
 

1411
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,470
clear of the kind of biochemistry that
can come out of a world where you have

1412
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,480
can come out of a world where you have
 

1413
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,549
can come out of a world where you have
hydrocarbon likes and rains and and

1414
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
hydrocarbon likes and rains and and
 

1415
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,070
hydrocarbon likes and rains and and
things like that but we are going there

1416
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,080
things like that but we are going there
 

1417
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,909
things like that but we are going there
so we will learn something about this so

1418
00:30:58,909 --> 00:30:58,919
so we will learn something about this so
 

1419
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,789
so we will learn something about this so
the bias is right there the nature of

1420
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:01,799
the bias is right there the nature of
 

1421
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,169
the bias is right there the nature of
life is different

1422
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:03,179
life is different
 

1423
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:08,450
life is different
if really life is the best way the

1424
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:08,460
if really life is the best way the
 

1425
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,789
if really life is the best way the
universe has to fight entropy

1426
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:10,799
universe has to fight entropy
 

1427
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,250
universe has to fight entropy
there is no bias there because physics

1428
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:13,260
there is no bias there because physics
 

1429
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,350
there is no bias there because physics
is the same all across the universe at

1430
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
is the same all across the universe at
 

1431
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,850
is the same all across the universe at
least the universe we know there might

1432
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:16,860
least the universe we know there might
 

1433
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,549
least the universe we know there might
be other universes but the one we know

1434
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:19,559
be other universes but the one we know
 

1435
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,950
be other universes but the one we know
works with the same physics so if life

1436
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:21,960
works with the same physics so if life
 

1437
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,010
works with the same physics so if life
is the the best way to fight entropy

1438
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:25,020
is the the best way to fight entropy
 

1439
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,310
is the the best way to fight entropy
you can imagine life permeates

1440
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
you can imagine life permeates
 

1441
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,010
you can imagine life permeates
the entire universe and then the

1442
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,020
the entire universe and then the
 

1443
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,070
the entire universe and then the
question might change to like flavors of

1444
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080
question might change to like flavors of
 

1445
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,630
question might change to like flavors of
ice cream what are the flavors of

1446
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:35,640
ice cream what are the flavors of
 

1447
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,950
ice cream what are the flavors of
complexity that this process this nature

1448
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:39,960
complexity that this process this nature
 

1449
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,350
complexity that this process this nature
of Life leads to and there we might have

1450
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:42,360
of Life leads to and there we might have
 

1451
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,889
of Life leads to and there we might have
bias about what complexity looks like

1452
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:45,899
bias about what complexity looks like
 

1453
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,930
bias about what complexity looks like
what beautiful complexity looks like

1454
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:47,940
what beautiful complexity looks like
 

1455
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,970
what beautiful complexity looks like
we'll look at humans that operate a

1456
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:49,980
we'll look at humans that operate a
 

1457
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,750
we'll look at humans that operate a
certain physical scale and uh time scale

1458
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
certain physical scale and uh time scale
 

1459
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,389
certain physical scale and uh time scale
and we think this is intelligence we

1460
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
and we think this is intelligence we
 

1461
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,010
and we think this is intelligence we
have another problem we don't know what

1462
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,020
have another problem we don't know what
 

1463
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,870
have another problem we don't know what
life is we don't know what intelligence

1464
00:31:59,870 --> 00:31:59,880
life is we don't know what intelligence
 

1465
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,430
life is we don't know what intelligence
is and we don't know what Consciousness

1466
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,440
is and we don't know what Consciousness
 

1467
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,010
is and we don't know what Consciousness
is but we are trying to tackle the big

1468
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,020
is but we are trying to tackle the big
 

1469
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,289
is but we are trying to tackle the big
question but do you know what complexity

1470
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:06,299
question but do you know what complexity
 

1471
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,409
question but do you know what complexity
is also you know no I I think that we

1472
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:09,419
is also you know no I I think that we
 

1473
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,169
is also you know no I I think that we
have to be honest and as a scientist and

1474
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:12,179
have to be honest and as a scientist and
 

1475
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:13,789
have to be honest and as a scientist and
I'm going to step back and talk about

1476
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:13,799
I'm going to step back and talk about
 

1477
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,350
I'm going to step back and talk about
intelligence for me bacteria that has

1478
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:18,360
intelligence for me bacteria that has
 

1479
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,350
intelligence for me bacteria that has
survived like cyanobacteria

1480
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,360
survived like cyanobacteria
 

1481
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,450
survived like cyanobacteria
that has survived just like us

1482
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:23,460
that has survived just like us
 

1483
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,850
that has survived just like us
4 billion years in one Incarnation or

1484
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:25,860
4 billion years in one Incarnation or
 

1485
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,289
4 billion years in one Incarnation or
another and actually they are very

1486
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:27,299
another and actually they are very
 

1487
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,450
another and actually they are very
similar to the one that they wear 3.5

1488
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:29,460
similar to the one that they wear 3.5
 

1489
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,549
similar to the one that they wear 3.5
billion years ago it has some

1490
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:31,559
billion years ago it has some
 

1491
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,889
billion years ago it has some
intelligence about its environment

1492
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:33,899
intelligence about its environment
 

1493
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:38,510
intelligence about its environment
so for complexity it might be

1494
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:38,520
so for complexity it might be
 

1495
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,850
so for complexity it might be
that we need to take the world literally

1496
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:40,860
that we need to take the world literally
 

1497
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,370
that we need to take the world literally

information maybe this is something like

1502
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:48,720
information maybe this is something like
 

1503
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,630
information maybe this is something like
that or actually use that information to

that or actually use that information to
 

1505
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,690
that or actually use that information to
do something with it

1506
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:52,700
do something with it
 

1507
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,630
do something with it
but I do completely agree with you when

1508
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
but I do completely agree with you when
 

1509
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,389
but I do completely agree with you when
you talk about flavor of ice cream I

1510
00:32:59,389 --> 00:32:59,399
you talk about flavor of ice cream I
 

1511
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:02,810
you talk about flavor of ice cream I
think this is exactly it and

1512
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:02,820
think this is exactly it and
 

1513
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,490
think this is exactly it and
I have a basic education about what

1514
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:07,500
I have a basic education about what
 

1515
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,350
I have a basic education about what
physics is doing right now

1516
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,360
physics is doing right now
 

1517
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,009
physics is doing right now
and I'm look at quantum physics and what

1518
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:13,019
and I'm look at quantum physics and what
 

1519
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,610
and I'm look at quantum physics and what
it says about the universe and about the

1520
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:16,620
it says about the universe and about the
 

1521
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,389
it says about the universe and about the
connection about an atom here and

1522
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
connection about an atom here and
 

1523
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,669

another hair a photon here in the Forum
 

1525
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,870
another hair a photon here in the Forum
there and I am starting to put Maybe

1526
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:25,880
there and I am starting to put Maybe
 

1527
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,029
there and I am starting to put Maybe
wrongfully two and two together but in

1528
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,039
wrongfully two and two together but in
 

1529
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,889
wrongfully two and two together but in
my mind

1530
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:30,899
my mind
 

1531
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,750
my mind
and of course it's nothing until I can

1532
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:32,760
and of course it's nothing until I can
 

1533
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,450
and of course it's nothing until I can
prove it but in my mind the universe is

1534
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:35,460
prove it but in my mind the universe is
 

1535
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,389
prove it but in my mind the universe is
connected everywhere in all different

1536
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
connected everywhere in all different
 

1537
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,450
connected everywhere in all different
places so this life connection is

1538
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:41,460
places so this life connection is
 

1539
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,630
places so this life connection is
something that as you said pyramid the

1540
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,640
something that as you said pyramid the
 

1541
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,750
something that as you said pyramid the
universe and the way to find life

1542
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
universe and the way to find life
 

1543
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,090
universe and the way to find life
might be very different than to look for

1544
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,100
might be very different than to look for
 

1545
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,070
might be very different than to look for
the origins of life I think it's a good

1546
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,080
the origins of life I think it's a good
 

1547
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,810
the origins of life I think it's a good
thing to go out there and look for the

1548
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:53,820
thing to go out there and look for the
 

1549
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,549
thing to go out there and look for the
original glass somewhere else because

1550
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:55,559
original glass somewhere else because
 

1551
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,370
original glass somewhere else because
it's the manifestation of the nature of

1552
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,380
it's the manifestation of the nature of
 

1553
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,769
it's the manifestation of the nature of
life that's all of a sudden becomes

1554
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:00,779
life that's all of a sudden becomes
 

1555
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:04,909
life that's all of a sudden becomes
apparent evident to our eye but

1556
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:04,919
apparent evident to our eye but
 

1557
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,070
apparent evident to our eye but
what I think

1558
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,080
what I think
 

1559
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,589
what I think
would be our greatest achievement is

1560
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:09,599
would be our greatest achievement is
 

1561
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,329
would be our greatest achievement is
that if we can find that process of life

1562
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:14,339
that if we can find that process of life
 

1563
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,730
that if we can find that process of life
because at that point in my mind the

1564
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:16,740
because at that point in my mind the
 

1565
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,909
because at that point in my mind the
universal is sudden is going to

1566
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:18,919
universal is sudden is going to
 

1567
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:22,430
universal is sudden is going to
illuminate itself with actually

1568
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:22,440
illuminate itself with actually

00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:27,780
living Force to me this is what we are
 

1573
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,829
living Force to me this is what we are
looking at a universe that becomes more

1574
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:30,839
looking at a universe that becomes more
 

1575
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,710
looking at a universe that becomes more
and more complex with time more and more

1576
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:33,720
and more complex with time more and more
 

1577

00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:51,849
trying to understand itself and the more
we go the more the universe become alive

00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:51,859
we go the more the universe become alive
 

1589
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:54,589
we go the more the universe become alive

applied to Natural Sciences now more and

1602
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:08,460
applied to Natural Sciences now more and
 

1603
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,230
applied to Natural Sciences now more and
more to physics that the creatures that

1604
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,240
more to physics that the creatures that
 

1605
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,730
more to physics that the creatures that
will solve

1606
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:13,740
will solve
 

1607
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,670
will solve
the question of the origin of the nature

1608
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:16,680
the question of the origin of the nature
 

1609
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,890
the question of the origin of the nature
of life or just the process

1610
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:18,900
of life or just the process
 

1611
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,430
of life or just the process
the nature of life will be AI systems it

1612
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,440
the nature of life will be AI systems it
 

1613
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,609
the nature of life will be AI systems it
makes me a bit sad to I don't think so

1614
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:25,619
makes me a bit sad to I don't think so
 

1615
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:28,670
makes me a bit sad to I don't think so
uh because you think humans will at this

1616
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:28,680
uh because you think humans will at this
 

1617
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,490
uh because you think humans will at this
point in time remember who was behind AI

1618
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:31,500
point in time remember who was behind AI
 

1619
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,130
point in time remember who was behind AI
you know I I'm not buying in the

1620
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:34,140
you know I I'm not buying in the
 

1621
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,349
you know I I'm not buying in the
singularity thing yet

1622
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:36,359
singularity thing yet
 

1623
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:37,010
singularity thing yet
um

1624
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,020
um
 

1625
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,970
um
to AI is not aware AI is being built by

1626
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:40,980
to AI is not aware AI is being built by
 

1627
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,310
to AI is not aware AI is being built by
humans so so

1628
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:43,320
humans so so
 

1629
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,670
humans so so
um AI is a tool an extremely smart tool

1630
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:46,680
um AI is a tool an extremely smart tool
 

1631
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,150
um AI is a tool an extremely smart tool
as long as we build it and as long as we

1632
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,160
as long as we build it and as long as we
 

1633
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,730
as long as we build it and as long as we
use it as a tool it remains a tool and I

1634
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:52,740
use it as a tool it remains a tool and I
 

1635
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,370
use it as a tool it remains a tool and I
think there is a lot of brouhaha and of

1636
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:55,380
think there is a lot of brouhaha and of
 

1637
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,130
think there is a lot of brouhaha and of
course science fiction and movies they

1638
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,140
course science fiction and movies they
 

1639
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,170
course science fiction and movies they
don't help see I got to push back a

1640
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:00,180
don't help see I got to push back a
 

1641
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,670
don't help see I got to push back a
little bit yes I agree with you for the

1642
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:01,680
little bit yes I agree with you for the
 

1643
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,190
little bit yes I agree with you for the
most part in terms of boo haha and

1644
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:04,200
most part in terms of boo haha and
 

1645
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,890
most part in terms of boo haha and
sci-fi

1646
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:05,900
sci-fi
 

1647
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,290
sci-fi
but there is like in the work of Deep

1648
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:09,300
but there is like in the work of Deep
 

1649
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,750
but there is like in the work of Deep
Mind we can look at chess so we can look

1650
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,760
Mind we can look at chess so we can look
 

1651
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,370
Mind we can look at chess so we can look
at protein folding

1652
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:13,380
at protein folding
 

1653
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,010
at protein folding
so chess is a simple one to First Look

1654
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:16,020
so chess is a simple one to First Look
 

1655
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,690
so chess is a simple one to First Look

00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
game playing engine
 

1661
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,849
game playing engine
was able to discover in our stockfish

1662
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:25,859
was able to discover in our stockfish
 

1663
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:29,329
was able to discover in our stockfish
about Chess humbles the best human

1664
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:29,339
about Chess humbles the best human
 

1665
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,810
about Chess humbles the best human
players not just is better than them

1666
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:32,820
players not just is better than them
 

1667
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,329
players not just is better than them
it comes up with ideas that the humans

1668
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:35,339
it comes up with ideas that the humans
 

1669
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,810
it comes up with ideas that the humans
don't understand and so the AI now is

1670
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:38,820
don't understand and so the AI now is
 

1671
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,910
don't understand and so the AI now is
telling you uh even though it's

1672
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:40,920
telling you uh even though it's
 

1673
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,069
telling you uh even though it's
programmed by humans the AI is saying

1674
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:43,079
programmed by humans the AI is saying
 

1675
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:43,870
programmed by humans the AI is saying
like

1676
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:43,880
like
 

1677
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,670
like
sacrificing a pawn here is a good idea

1678
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:46,680
sacrificing a pawn here is a good idea
 

1679
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,010
sacrificing a pawn here is a good idea
sacrificing a queen or a bishop here's a

1680
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,020
sacrificing a queen or a bishop here's a
 

1681
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,170
sacrificing a queen or a bishop here's a
good idea and then you start to kind of

1682
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:51,180
good idea and then you start to kind of
 

1683
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,329
good idea and then you start to kind of
Intuit as a human why but you don't

1684
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:53,339
Intuit as a human why but you don't
 

1685
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,910
Intuit as a human why but you don't
deeply understand and you can say that

1686
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:55,920
deeply understand and you can say that
 

1687
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,770
deeply understand and you can say that
AI is not conscious it doesn't deeply

understand the way humans do but there's

1690
00:36:59,870 --> 00:36:59,880
understand the way humans do but there's
 

1691
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,569
understand the way humans do but there's
still a wisdom and a depth of knowledge

1692
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:02,579
still a wisdom and a depth of knowledge
 

1693
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,490
still a wisdom and a depth of knowledge
in that chess playing program that

1694
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:04,500
in that chess playing program that
 

1695
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,069
in that chess playing program that
humans don't have and the same with the

1696
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:07,079
humans don't have and the same with the
 

1697
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,589
humans don't have and the same with the
alpha fold with protein folding there's

1698
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599
alpha fold with protein folding there's
 

1699
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,390
alpha fold with protein folding there's
a and now they're applying it to physics

1700
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:11,400
a and now they're applying it to physics
 

1701
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,849
a and now they're applying it to physics
to simulating nuclear reactions and so

1702
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:13,859
to simulating nuclear reactions and so
 

1703
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,670
to simulating nuclear reactions and so
on it feels like there might be a way to

1704
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:16,680
on it feels like there might be a way to
 

1705
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,710
on it feels like there might be a way to
understand the nature of life

1706
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,720
understand the nature of life
 

1707
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,349
understand the nature of life
that we can kind of Intuit poetically as

1708
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
that we can kind of Intuit poetically as
 

1709
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,190
that we can kind of Intuit poetically as
humans but the the true understanding

1710
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
humans but the the true understanding
 

1711
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,930
humans but the the true understanding
will come from a system that's much more

1712
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:26,940
will come from a system that's much more
 

1713
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,870
will come from a system that's much more
computational sophisticated again you

1714
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:29,880
computational sophisticated again you
 

1715
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,910
computational sophisticated again you
know I would push back and my turn

1716
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
know I would push back and my turn
 

1717
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,370
know I would push back and my turn
because I still think that you men give

1718
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:34,380
because I still think that you men give
 

1719
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,010
because I still think that you men give
themselves ability

1720
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,020
themselves ability
 

1721
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,970
themselves ability
to do that by building that tool so the

1722
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:40,980
to do that by building that tool so the
 

1723
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,490
to do that by building that tool so the
idea that the tool you know we are

1724
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:43,500
idea that the tool you know we are
 

1725
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,710
idea that the tool you know we are
getting into the Carter shift scale and

1726
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:45,720
getting into the Carter shift scale and
 

1727
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,589
getting into the Carter shift scale and
and the Dark Forest and all these things

1728
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:48,599
and the Dark Forest and all these things
 

1729
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,589
and the Dark Forest and all these things
we can see the world this way uh at this

1730
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
we can see the world this way uh at this
 

1731
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,930
we can see the world this way uh at this
point in time for me

1732
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:53,940
point in time for me
 

1733
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,510
point in time for me
I still see

1734
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:56,520
I still see
 

1735
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,290
I still see
a great tool

1736
00:37:59,290 --> 00:37:59,300
a great tool
 

1737
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,589
a great tool
now uh whether the Sci-Fi scenario is

1738
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:03,599
now uh whether the Sci-Fi scenario is
 

1739
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,250
now uh whether the Sci-Fi scenario is
going to you know uh happen Etc I still

1740
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:07,260
going to you know uh happen Etc I still
 

1741
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,930
going to you know uh happen Etc I still
think that we are far away from from

1742
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:08,940
think that we are far away from from
 

1743
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,030
think that we are far away from from
this but if that tool is capable of

1744
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040
this but if that tool is capable of
 

1745
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,210
this but if that tool is capable of
giving me A New Perspective uh it's just

1746
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:14,220
giving me A New Perspective uh it's just
 

1747
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,510
giving me A New Perspective uh it's just
that we are starting to jump into a

1748
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,520
that we are starting to jump into a
 

1749
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,290
that we are starting to jump into a
deeper uh cognition of of what the

1750
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:21,300
deeper uh cognition of of what the
 

1751
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,410
deeper uh cognition of of what the
universe is whether it's through our

1752
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:24,420
universe is whether it's through our
 

1753
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,390
universe is whether it's through our
brain or through a different way of

1754
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
brain or through a different way of
 

1755
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,430
brain or through a different way of
gathering information remember this is

1756
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:28,440
gathering information remember this is
 

1757
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,470
gathering information remember this is
what we do yeah human variables actually

1758
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:30,480
what we do yeah human variables actually
 

1759
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,010
what we do yeah human variables actually
build tools and then like integrate them

1760
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,020
build tools and then like integrate them
 

1761
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,349
build tools and then like integrate them
enter their way of thinking maybe

1762
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:36,359
enter their way of thinking maybe
 

1763
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,170
enter their way of thinking maybe
another generation has to be born that

1764
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,180
another generation has to be born that
 

1765
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,910
another generation has to be born that
is raised with those tools but we seem

1766
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:40,920
is raised with those tools but we seem
 

1767
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,990
is raised with those tools but we seem
to like

1768
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,000
to like
 

1769
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,210
to like
take for granted all the cool

1770
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,220
take for granted all the cool
 

1771
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,849
take for granted all the cool
Technologies you integrate into your way

1772
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:46,859
Technologies you integrate into your way
 

1773
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,770
Technologies you integrate into your way
of thinking a lot of people are growing

1774
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:48,780
of thinking a lot of people are growing
 

1775
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,470
of thinking a lot of people are growing
up now their mind is integrated with the

1776
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,480
up now their mind is integrated with the
 

1777
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,690
up now their mind is integrated with the
internet

1778
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:52,700
internet
 

1779
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,450
internet
you basically reconfigure the way you

1780
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:56,460
you basically reconfigure the way you
 

1781
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,190
you basically reconfigure the way you
memorize things you no longer have to

1782
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,200
memorize things you no longer have to
 

1783
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,569
memorize things you no longer have to
memorize a lot of facts because you can

1784
00:38:59,569 --> 00:38:59,579
memorize a lot of facts because you can
 

1785
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,609
memorize a lot of facts because you can
look them up really quickly yeah and so

1786
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:01,619
look them up really quickly yeah and so
 

1787
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:04,550
look them up really quickly yeah and so
like uh so you uh reallocate a lot of

1788
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:04,560
like uh so you uh reallocate a lot of
 

1789
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,910
like uh so you uh reallocate a lot of
resources for uh thinking versus memory

1790
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:07,920
resources for uh thinking versus memory
 

1791
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,810
resources for uh thinking versus memory
of just strict facts that kind of stuff

1792
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:11,820
of just strict facts that kind of stuff
 

1793
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,670
of just strict facts that kind of stuff
and we integrate all of that yeah and

1794
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:13,680
and we integrate all of that yeah and
 

1795
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,069
and we integrate all of that yeah and
you know there I would completely agree

1796
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
you know there I would completely agree
 

1797
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,810
you know there I would completely agree
with you in fact I wrote about this

1798
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:17,820
with you in fact I wrote about this
 

1799
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,349
with you in fact I wrote about this
again uh um in this new book that's

1800
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:21,359
again uh um in this new book that's
 

1801
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,270
again uh um in this new book that's
coming out when is the book coming out

1802
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
coming out when is the book coming out
 

1803
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,310
coming out when is the book coming out
in January it's it will be in French

1804
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:25,320
in January it's it will be in French
 

1805
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,470
in January it's it will be in French
actually uh to start with you wrote it

1806
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:27,480
actually uh to start with you wrote it
 

1807
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,450
actually uh to start with you wrote it
in French actually I wrote it first in

1808
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:29,460
in French actually I wrote it first in
 

1809
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,210
in French actually I wrote it first in
English yes and I translated into French

1810
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:32,220
English yes and I translated into French
 

1811
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,250
English yes and I translated into French
so the the English version is already

1812
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:34,260
so the the English version is already
 

1813
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,010
so the the English version is already
pretty much ready to go uh if we found a

1814
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,020
pretty much ready to go uh if we found a
 

1815
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,849
pretty much ready to go uh if we found a
publisher in uh in the US but anyways

1816
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:40,859
publisher in uh in the US but anyways
 

1817
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:44,270
publisher in uh in the US but anyways
um the point uh being here that I looked

1818
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:44,280
um the point uh being here that I looked
 

1819
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,450
um the point uh being here that I looked
at this as a relationship with

1820
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:47,460
at this as a relationship with
 

1821
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,650
at this as a relationship with
technology

1822
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:48,660
technology
 

1823
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,950
technology
as a complete change to me this is the

1824
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:51,960
as a complete change to me this is the
 

1825
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,890
as a complete change to me this is the
singularity more than anything else

1826
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:53,900
singularity more than anything else
 

1827
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,650
singularity more than anything else
which is the co-evolution of human with

1828
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:57,660
which is the co-evolution of human with
 

1829
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,390
which is the co-evolution of human with
technology not anymore with their

1830
00:39:59,390 --> 00:39:59,400
technology not anymore with their
 

1831
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,490
technology not anymore with their
environment while we are messing up the

1832
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:01,500
environment while we are messing up the
 

1833
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,770
environment while we are messing up the
environment right now why we don't

1834
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:03,780
environment right now why we don't
 

1835
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,750
environment right now why we don't
respond to pandemic the way we should

1836
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
respond to pandemic the way we should
 

1837
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,390
respond to pandemic the way we should
because we are disconnected to the

1838
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,400
because we are disconnected to the
 

1839
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,650
because we are disconnected to the
environment we are taking our

1840
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:09,660
environment we are taking our
 

1841
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,510
environment we are taking our
information from and we were adapting

1842
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
information from and we were adapting
 

1843
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,089
information from and we were adapting
from right now exactly as you said we

1844
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:14,099
from right now exactly as you said we
 

1845

take the information from the web from
 

1847
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,310
take the information from the web from
the phones Etc we have no filter over

1848
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:19,320
the phones Etc we have no filter over
 

1849
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,050

that information
 

1851
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,690
that information
before you were out in the environment

1852
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:23,700
before you were out in the environment
 

1853
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,790
before you were out in the environment
the information you get is the one the

1854
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:25,800
the information you get is the one the
 

1855
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,710
the information you get is the one the
planets is sending you now this

1856
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:27,720
planets is sending you now this
 

1857
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,450
planets is sending you now this
information is coming from different way

00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:29,460
information is coming from different way
 

1859
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,950
information is coming from different way
you have no way of knowing and

1860

information is correct or not yeah I
 

1863
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,210
information is correct or not yeah I
gotta push back on that no you look at

1864
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:35,220
gotta push back on that no you look at
 

1865
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,430
gotta push back on that no you look at
this as a nickel system and it explains

1866
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,440
this as a nickel system and it explains
 

1867
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,950
this as a nickel system and it explains
a lot about Behavior see I like the you

1868
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:39,960
a lot about Behavior see I like the you
 

1869
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,490
a lot about Behavior see I like the you
said teenagers so we the technology I

1870
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:43,500
said teenagers so we the technology I
 

1871
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,829
said teenagers so we the technology I
think when we move past the teenager

1872
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
think when we move past the teenager
 

1873
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,069
think when we move past the teenager
stage enriches our ability to sense the

1874
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:49,079
stage enriches our ability to sense the
 

1875
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,410
stage enriches our ability to sense the
Earth to understand what's going on with

1876
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:51,420
Earth to understand what's going on with
 

1877
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,270
Earth to understand what's going on with
the environment it's just that we're

1878
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
the environment it's just that we're
 

1879
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,890
the environment it's just that we're
very so it's not that technology

1880
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:54,900
very so it's not that technology
 

1881
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,470
very so it's not that technology
disconnects us from the environment it

1882
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:57,480
disconnects us from the environment it
 

1883
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,870
disconnects us from the environment it
gives us more tools with which to

1884
00:40:59,870 --> 00:40:59,880
gives us more tools with which to
 

1885
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,430
gives us more tools with which to
understand what's going on with the

1886
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
understand what's going on with the
 

1887
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,870
understand what's going on with the
environment that's true for the people

1888
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
environment that's true for the people
 

1889
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,609
environment that's true for the people
who are building the tools and know how

1890
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:04,619
who are building the tools and know how
 

1891
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,310
who are building the tools and know how
to use it take those tools now put them

1892
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:07,320
to use it take those tools now put them
 

1893
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,710
to use it take those tools now put them
in the general public with no filter

1894
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:09,720
in the general public with no filter

the world even through the pandemic the
 

1917

the world even through the pandemic the
good thing about technology this is also

1918
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
good thing about technology this is also
 

1919
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,210
good thing about technology this is also
something I wrote It's not the tools we

1920

something I wrote It's not the tools we
 

1921
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,730
something I wrote It's not the tools we
create that are bad it's the way we use

00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:40,740
create that are bad it's the way we use
 

1923

them yes and we're learning well this is

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
them yes and we're learning well this is
 

1925
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,530
them yes and we're learning well this is
the cool thing and we hopefully we'll do

1926
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:45,540
the cool thing and we hopefully we'll do
 

1927
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,150
the cool thing and we hopefully we'll do
all their learning before it's too late

all their learning before it's too late
 

1929

in the environment our response to
 

1933
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,530
in the environment our response to
pandemics is deeply connected to this

because there is a fantastic Universe

1942

something absolutely magical around us
 

1945
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,990
something absolutely magical around us
and I'm talking as a scientist I mean

1946
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,000
and I'm talking as a scientist I mean
 

1947
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,630
and I'm talking as a scientist I mean
there is Magic not in sense of you know

1948
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:14,640
there is Magic not in sense of you know
 

1949
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,170
there is Magic not in sense of you know
trickery but in sense of wonder around

1950
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:18,180
trickery but in sense of wonder around
 

1951
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,490
trickery but in sense of wonder around
us and there are so many signs where we

1952
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:22,500
us and there are so many signs where we
 

1953
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,069
us and there are so many signs where we
are getting so close

1954
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:25,079
are getting so close
 

1955
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,750
are getting so close
to Revolutions in cosmology in

1956
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
to Revolutions in cosmology in
 

1957
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,950
to Revolutions in cosmology in
astrobiology in astronomy which I think

1958
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:33,960
astrobiology in astronomy which I think
 

1959
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,829
astrobiology in astronomy which I think
to me this is where the hope lies and

1960
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:36,839
to me this is where the hope lies and
 

1961
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,870
to me this is where the hope lies and
also an Awakening of understanding that

00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:38,880
also an Awakening of understanding that
 

1963
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,569
also an Awakening of understanding that
we need to be in equilibrium with a

we need to be in equilibrium with a

pivot
in our history for for a number of

in our history for for a number of
 

1991
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,890
in our history for for a number of
reasons uh a time where there is a

00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:15,900
reasons uh a time where there is a
 

1993
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,470

bit ahead of us that we have some some

1998
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:22,680
bit ahead of us that we have some some
 

1999
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,010
bit ahead of us that we have some some
difficult time to catching up uh on with

2000
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,020
difficult time to catching up uh on with
 

2001
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,990
difficult time to catching up uh on with
where we have to deal with the

2002
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,000
where we have to deal with the
 

2003
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,470
where we have to deal with the
population that's way uh too big for the

population that's way uh too big for the
 

2005

planet we have we need to really learn a
 

2007
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,790

sense of balance and and a maturity as a
civilization so how is this going to

2010
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:40,859
civilization so how is this going to
 

2011
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:44,809
civilization so how is this going to
unfold right now I have no clue I draw a

2012
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:44,819
unfold right now I have no clue I draw a
 

2013
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:47,809
unfold right now I have no clue I draw a
lot of optimism from the similar things

2014
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:47,819
lot of optimism from the similar things
 

2015
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,309
lot of optimism from the similar things
that happened

2016

that happened
 

2017
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:52,849
that happened
and many decades ago when nuclear

2018
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:52,859
and many decades ago when nuclear
 

2019
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:55,010
and many decades ago when nuclear
weapons were developed

weapons were developed
 

2021
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,829

boy was that at the time even more

2022
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:57,839
boy was that at the time even more
 

2023
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,170
boy was that at the time even more
terrifying you just now created weapons

2024
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:00,180
terrifying you just now created weapons
 

2025
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,730
terrifying you just now created weapons
that could destroy the entirety of life

2026
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:01,740
that could destroy the entirety of life
 

2027
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,150
that could destroy the entirety of life
on Earth or not entirety but a lot of it

2028
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:05,160
on Earth or not entirety but a lot of it
 

2029
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,150
on Earth or not entirety but a lot of it
and we somehow found a balance

2030
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
and we somehow found a balance
 

2031
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,550
and we somehow found a balance
and the threat constantly is out there

2032
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:10,560
and the threat constantly is out there
 

2033
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,010
and the threat constantly is out there
and that threat has been made more

2034
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:13,020
and that threat has been made more
 

2035
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,910
and that threat has been made more
visceral in recent times

2036
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
visceral in recent times
 

2037
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,710
visceral in recent times
because the war in Ukraine

2038
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:18,720
because the war in Ukraine
 

2039
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,910
because the war in Ukraine
but we find a balance somehow so I have

2040
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:22,920
but we find a balance somehow so I have
 

2041
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,069
but we find a balance somehow so I have
a threat of optimism for human

2042
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:25,079
a threat of optimism for human
 

2043
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,829
a threat of optimism for human
civilization that we that we figure it

2044
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:27,839
civilization that we that we figure it
 

2045
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,050
civilization that we that we figure it
out we're clever teenagers I think we

2046
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:30,060
out we're clever teenagers I think we
 

2047
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,270
out we're clever teenagers I think we
are clever teenagers there is definitely

2048

are clever teenagers there is definitely
 

2049
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,730
are clever teenagers there is definitely
a threat of optimism but I think it's

2050
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:34,740
a threat of optimism but I think it's
 

2051
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,630
a threat of optimism but I think it's
thin

um although the threat was terrifying
 

2061
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,349

00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,089
decency
of moral values it was not perfect but

2076
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:11,099
of moral values it was not perfect but
 

2077
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:14,210
of moral values it was not perfect but
it was at least a time where people

2078
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:14,220
it was at least a time where people
 

2079
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,790
it was at least a time where people
could come together from very different

2080
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
could come together from very different
 

2081
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,730
could come together from very different
perspective and agree that something was

2082
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:19,740
perspective and agree that something was
 

2083
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,250
perspective and agree that something was
more important than destroying

2084
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:22,260
more important than destroying
 

2085
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,349
more important than destroying
everything but that's so hilarious you

2086
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:24,359
everything but that's so hilarious you
 

2087
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,329
everything but that's so hilarious you
say that yes you're talking about a

2088
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:26,339
say that yes you're talking about a
 

2089
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,210
say that yes you're talking about a
small Slither of humans which is the

2090
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:29,220
small Slither of humans which is the
 

2091
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,829
small Slither of humans which is the
scientists in the Manhattan Project

2092
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:30,839
scientists in the Manhattan Project
 

2093
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,930
scientists in the Manhattan Project
perhaps no absolutely that was also the

2094
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:32,940
perhaps no absolutely that was also the
 

2095
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,109
perhaps no absolutely that was also the
time when over a hundred million people

2096
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:36,119
time when over a hundred million people
 

2097
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,809
time when over a hundred million people
were tortured or murdered no no I agree

2098
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:38,819
were tortured or murdered no no I agree
 

2099
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,670
were tortured or murdered no no I agree
with that in Europe absolutely

2100
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:40,680
with that in Europe absolutely
 

2101
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,770
with that in Europe absolutely
absolutely I'm not talking about

2102
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:42,780
absolutely I'm not talking about
 

2103
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,569
absolutely I'm not talking about
scientists here actually I'm talking

2104
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:44,579
scientists here actually I'm talking
 

2105
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,690
scientists here actually I'm talking
about politicians we've gone beyond that

2106
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:47,700
about politicians we've gone beyond that
 

2107
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,210
about politicians we've gone beyond that
point now this is what I'm worried about

2108
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:50,220
point now this is what I'm worried about
 

2109
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,890
point now this is what I'm worried about
I mean

2110
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:51,900
I mean
 

2111
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,430
I mean
torture Etc unfortunately well we are

2112
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:55,440
torture Etc unfortunately well we are
 

2113
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,650
torture Etc unfortunately well we are
Apes exactly what you said so I think

2114
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:57,660
Apes exactly what you said so I think
 

2115
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,109
Apes exactly what you said so I think
that you know there is a lot to be not

2116
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:00,119
that you know there is a lot to be not
 

2117
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,809
that you know there is a lot to be not
not to blame Grandpa for that but

2118
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:02,819
not to blame Grandpa for that but
 

2119
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:05,450
not to blame Grandpa for that but
because we can always get better Grandpa

2120
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:05,460
because we can always get better Grandpa
 

2121
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,849
because we can always get better Grandpa
was a wild man

2122
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:07,859
was a wild man
 

2123
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:10,430
was a wild man
but we have to improve a lot on that

2124
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:10,440
but we have to improve a lot on that
 

2125
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,470
but we have to improve a lot on that
side before we can claim that we are a

2126
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,480
side before we can claim that we are a
 

2127
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,050
side before we can claim that we are a
mature civilization when you uh just

2128
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:15,060
mature civilization when you uh just
 

2129
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,670
mature civilization when you uh just
because you mentioned the magic uh when

2130
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:16,680
because you mentioned the magic uh when
 

2131
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,950
because you mentioned the magic uh when
you look out there

2132
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:17,960
you look out there
 

2133
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,849
you look out there
perhaps this is not a scientific

2134
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:19,859
perhaps this is not a scientific
 

2135
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,530
perhaps this is not a scientific
question but

2136
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:21,540
question but
 

2137
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,390
question but
you don't have to be scientific all the

2138
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:23,400
you don't have to be scientific all the
 

2139
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,790
you don't have to be scientific all the
time yeah well this you said magic so

2140
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:25,800
time yeah well this you said magic so
 

2141
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,890
time yeah well this you said magic so
there's a there's a magic to Magic that

2142
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:27,900
there's a there's a magic to Magic that
 

2143
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,170
there's a there's a magic to Magic that
is in part scientific and in part

2144
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:30,180
is in part scientific and in part
 

2145
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,910
is in part scientific and in part
I don't know whatever whatever fills us

2146
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:31,920
I don't know whatever whatever fills us
 

2147
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,069
I don't know whatever whatever fills us
with all as humans when we look up at

2148
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:34,079
with all as humans when we look up at
 

2149
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,309
with all as humans when we look up at
the stars do you think

2150
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:37,319
the stars do you think
 

2151
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:40,069
the stars do you think
the universe is full of life or not like

2152
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
the universe is full of life or not like
 

2153
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,809
the universe is full of life or not like
you know when you're sitting drinking

2154
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:41,819
you know when you're sitting drinking
 

2155
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:43,730
you know when you're sitting drinking
some wine looking up at the stars and

2156
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:43,740
some wine looking up at the stars and
 

2157
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,569
some wine looking up at the stars and
and wandering as a human uh do you think

2158
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:47,579
and wandering as a human uh do you think
 

2159
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,050
and wandering as a human uh do you think
we're alone or do you think

2160
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:51,060
we're alone or do you think
 

2161
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,470
we're alone or do you think
it's life is everywhere I am going to

2162
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
it's life is everywhere I am going to
 

2163
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,829
it's life is everywhere I am going to
make such an unmagical response to that

2164
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:57,839
make such an unmagical response to that
 

2165
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,309
make such an unmagical response to that
my response is that's the scientific

2166
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:01,319
my response is that's the scientific
 

2167
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,030
my response is that's the scientific
response yeah that if we are alone

2168
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,040
response yeah that if we are alone
 

2169
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,309
response yeah that if we are alone
then the universe is a statistical

2170
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:07,319
then the universe is a statistical
 

2171
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:09,230
then the universe is a statistical
absurdity

2172
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:09,240
absurdity
 

2173
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,250
absurdity
yeah and and I have no doubt in my mind

2174
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:13,260
yeah and and I have no doubt in my mind
 

2175
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,370
yeah and and I have no doubt in my mind
and that is an unscientific response as

2176
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:16,380
and that is an unscientific response as
 

2177
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,790
and that is an unscientific response as
well but I have no doubt in my mind that

2178
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:19,800
well but I have no doubt in my mind that
 

2179
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,890
well but I have no doubt in my mind that
the universe is steaming with life

2180
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:21,900
the universe is steaming with life
 

2181
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,109
the universe is steaming with life
what if

2182
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:24,119
what if
 

2183
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,750
what if
it keeps dying

2184
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:26,760
it keeps dying
 

2185
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,670
it keeps dying
this is what life does

2186
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:28,680
this is what life does
 

2187
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,170
this is what life does
but unfortunately so so the

2188
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:32,180
but unfortunately so so the
 

2189
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:36,770
but unfortunately so so the
so me that Extinction is as a process as

2190
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:36,780
so me that Extinction is as a process as
 

2191
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,130
so me that Extinction is as a process as
a part of the process of Life Extinction

2192
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:40,140
a part of the process of Life Extinction
 

2193
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,589
a part of the process of Life Extinction
seems to be a fundamental both negative

2194
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:42,599
seems to be a fundamental both negative
 

2195
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,930
seems to be a fundamental both negative
and positive component

2196
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:44,940
and positive component
 

2197
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,410
and positive component
uh so what if all the complex life out

2198
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:48,420
uh so what if all the complex life out
 

2199
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,050
uh so what if all the complex life out
there just keeps dying and not making a

2200
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:51,060
there just keeps dying and not making a
 

2201
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,630
there just keeps dying and not making a
way for like we're actually uh

2202
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:53,640
way for like we're actually uh
 

2203
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,870
way for like we're actually uh
statistical anomaly in us being able to

2204
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
statistical anomaly in us being able to
 

2205
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,270
statistical anomaly in us being able to
survive that l in the Drake equation

2206
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,280
survive that l in the Drake equation
 

2207
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,609
survive that l in the Drake equation
being able to survive long enough to

2208
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:01,619
being able to survive long enough to
 

2209
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,550
being able to survive long enough to
form complex organisms of the kind like

2210
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:04,560
form complex organisms of the kind like
 

2211
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,569
form complex organisms of the kind like
mammals are things with brains things

2212
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:07,579
mammals are things with brains things
 

2213
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:10,490
mammals are things with brains things
Ellie's not about that L is about how

2214
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:10,500
Ellie's not about that L is about how
 

2215
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,270
Ellie's not about that L is about how
long a civilization is capable of being

2216
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:14,280
long a civilization is capable of being
 

2217
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,770
long a civilization is capable of being
detectable which means that rich

2218
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:15,780
detectable which means that rich
 

2219
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,390
detectable which means that rich
Technologies and you know being

2220
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:17,400
Technologies and you know being
 

2221
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,309
Technologies and you know being
detectable okay so there's a more

2222
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:19,319
detectable okay so there's a more
 

2223
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,870
detectable okay so there's a more
nuanced things to L because you can have

2224
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:20,880
nuanced things to L because you can have
 

2225
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,430
nuanced things to L because you can have
intelligent civilizations that are not

2226
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:22,440
intelligent civilizations that are not
 

2227
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,970
intelligent civilizations that are not
very detectable yeah we had civilization

2228
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:24,980
very detectable yeah we had civilization
 

2229
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,730
very detectable yeah we had civilization
for thousands of years we started to be

2230
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:28,740
for thousands of years we started to be
 

2231
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,130
for thousands of years we started to be
detectable 150 years ago

2232
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:31,140
detectable 150 years ago
 

2233
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,950
detectable 150 years ago
so it's about technology technology that

2234
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:33,960
so it's about technology technology that
 

2235
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,609
so it's about technology technology that
we can actually capture from from space

2236
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:37,619
we can actually capture from from space
 

2237
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:41,690
we can actually capture from from space
you become visible to your neighbors uh

2238
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:41,700
you become visible to your neighbors uh
 

2239
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,670
you become visible to your neighbors uh
and and this is all about the Fermi

2240
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
and and this is all about the Fermi
 

2241
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,849
and and this is all about the Fermi
Paradox right it takes time obviously if

2242
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:46,859
Paradox right it takes time obviously if
 

2243
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:49,910
Paradox right it takes time obviously if
we're taking again ourselves as a model

2244
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:49,920
we're taking again ourselves as a model
 

2245
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,730
we're taking again ourselves as a model
but this is the only one we have

2246
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:52,740
but this is the only one we have
 

2247
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,950
but this is the only one we have
um to get to the point where we become

2248
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
um to get to the point where we become
 

2249
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,250
um to get to the point where we become
detectable but look at the age of the

2250
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:58,260
detectable but look at the age of the
 

2251
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,190
detectable but look at the age of the
universe even if life as we understand

2252
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,200
universe even if life as we understand
 

2253
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,550

it not not saying even as we know it but

2254
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:04,560
it not not saying even as we know it but
 

2255
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,770
it not not saying even as we know it but
as we can understand it started 10

2256
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:06,780
as we can understand it started 10
 

2257
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,650
as we can understand it started 10
billion years ago and it takes four

2258
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:09,660
billion years ago and it takes four
 

2259
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,130
billion years ago and it takes four
billion years to get to uh the point

2260
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:13,140
billion years to get to uh the point
 

2261
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,410
billion years to get to uh the point
where it becomes detectable that means

2262
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:15,420
where it becomes detectable that means
 

2263
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,849
where it becomes detectable that means
that the first planet where those

2264
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:16,859
that the first planet where those

2273
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,010

passing above our heads at that point
 

2275
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,890
passing above our heads at that point
and those civilization when you look at

00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:30,900
and those civilization when you look at
 

2277
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,770

okay in the best case scenario they move

2282
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:40,740
okay in the best case scenario they move
 

2283
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,730
okay in the best case scenario they move
somewhere else and what that means is

00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:43,740
somewhere else and what that means is
 

2285
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,990
somewhere else and what that means is
that Civilization are going to rise die

2286

or move and transform themselves we can
see ourselves changing we know that

2295
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,550
the human being in in a thousand or even
500 years from now might not be looking

2297
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,609
500 years from now might not be looking
a lot like we are doing uh right now who

2298
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:04,619
a lot like we are doing uh right now who
 

2299
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,010
a lot like we are doing uh right now who
knows where where we will be will might

2300
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:07,020
knows where where we will be will might
 

2301
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,410
knows where where we will be will might
be migrating into our planetary system

2302
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:09,420
be migrating into our planetary system
 

2303
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,210
be migrating into our planetary system
we might be migrating somewhere else

2304
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:11,220
we might be migrating somewhere else
 

2305
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,030
we might be migrating somewhere else
well you said migrating but it seems

2306
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:14,040
well you said migrating but it seems
 

2307
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,109
well you said migrating but it seems
when you look at life it doesn't

2308
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:15,119
when you look at life it doesn't
 

2309
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,470
when you look at life it doesn't
necessarily migrate it it expands so

2310
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,480
necessarily migrate it it expands so
 

2311
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,210
necessarily migrate it it expands so
it's not

2312
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:20,220
it's not
 

2313
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,349
it's not
or

2314
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
or
 

2315
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,530
or
place a or or place B is place a and

2316
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:24,540
place a or or place B is place a and
 

2317
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,170
place a or or place B is place a and
plays B it

2318
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:26,180
plays B it
 

2319
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,290
plays B it
could be we are talking about the human

2320
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:29,300
could be we are talking about the human
 

2321
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,630
could be we are talking about the human
civilization here so there are different

2322
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:32,640
civilization here so there are different
 

2323
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,150
civilization here so there are different
factors if you are a cyanobacteria or

2324
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:35,160
factors if you are a cyanobacteria or
 

2325
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,210
factors if you are a cyanobacteria or
any type of even a mammal that doesn't

2326
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:38,220
any type of even a mammal that doesn't
 

2327
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,730
any type of even a mammal that doesn't
have the technology to escape

2328
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:40,740
have the technology to escape
 

2329
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,430
have the technology to escape
the planet we were born on then it's

2330
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,440
the planet we were born on then it's
 

2331
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,770
the planet we were born on then it's
plan a it is right there you know

2332
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:45,780
plan a it is right there you know
 

2333
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,870
plan a it is right there you know
whatever happens to your planet you are

2334
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:47,880
whatever happens to your planet you are
 

2335
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,990
whatever happens to your planet you are
tied to it you cannot Escape it for a

2336
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:51,000
tied to it you cannot Escape it for a
 

2337
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,150
tied to it you cannot Escape it for a
human it's a little different yeah it's

2338
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:53,160
human it's a little different yeah it's
 

2339
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,770
human it's a little different yeah it's
a and b or whatever you know we can so

2340
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:57,780
a and b or whatever you know we can so
 

2341
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,950
a and b or whatever you know we can so
we have to expect that a number of the

2342
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
we have to expect that a number of the
 

2343
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,010
we have to expect that a number of the
civilization

2344
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:03,020

2345
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,569

00:51:05,569 --> 00:51:05,579
extraterrestrial civilization that might
 

2347
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:07,730
extraterrestrial civilization that might
be technologically advanced a number of

00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:07,740
be technologically advanced a number of

them will have disappeared just because

2350
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
them will have disappeared just because
 

2351
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,750
them will have disappeared just because
they run the course of their evolution

2352
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:11,760
they run the course of their evolution
 

2353
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,089
they run the course of their evolution
or because their son run out of fuel and

2354
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:17,099
or because their son run out of fuel and
 

2355
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:20,390
or because their son run out of fuel and
they didn't have a way to escape or they

2356
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400
they didn't have a way to escape or they
 

2357
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,809
they didn't have a way to escape or they
were wiped out by any kind of event and

2358
00:51:23,809 --> 00:51:23,819
were wiped out by any kind of event and
 

2359
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,910
were wiped out by any kind of event and
then they will there will be those that

2360
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920
then they will there will be those that
 

2361
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,829
then they will there will be those that
survive everything I've seen from life

2362
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:27,839
survive everything I've seen from life
 

2363
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,770
survive everything I've seen from life
it seems obvious that there's life

2364
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:30,780
it seems obvious that there's life
 

2365
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,390
it seems obvious that there's life
everywhere out there

2366
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
everywhere out there
 

2367
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,770
everywhere out there
in fact

2368
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:33,780
in fact
 

2369
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,230
in fact
maybe I don't understand the jump from

2370
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:36,240
maybe I don't understand the jump from
 

2371
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,150
maybe I don't understand the jump from
bacteria enough

2372
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,160
bacteria enough
 

2373
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,670
bacteria enough
but it seems obvious that there's

2374
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:40,680
but it seems obvious that there's
 

2375
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,670
but it seems obvious that there's
intelligent civilizations out there

2376
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
intelligent civilizations out there
 

2377
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,770
intelligent civilizations out there
now I don't know what intelligence how

2378
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:45,780
now I don't know what intelligence how
 

2379
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,210
now I don't know what intelligence how
to define intelligence but there's

2380
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:47,220
to define intelligence but there's
 

2381
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,730
to define intelligence but there's
beautiful complexity like when you look

beautiful complexity like when you look
 

2383

00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,730
construction that when you run
complexity emerges I've looked at that

2392
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:01,740
complexity emerges I've looked at that
 

2393
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,230
complexity emerges I've looked at that
enough to know that it just seems like

2394
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:03,240
enough to know that it just seems like
 

2395
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,089
enough to know that it just seems like
there's complexity everywhere out there

2396
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:05,099
there's complexity everywhere out there
 

2397
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,210
there's complexity everywhere out there
so I that's why I'm deeply puzzled by

2398
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:08,220
so I that's why I'm deeply puzzled by
 

2399
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,609
so I that's why I'm deeply puzzled by
the the Fermi Paradox it makes no sense

2400
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:10,619
the the Fermi Paradox it makes no sense
 

2401
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:14,569
the the Fermi Paradox it makes no sense
to me I mean uh that have trivial

2402
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:14,579
to me I mean uh that have trivial
 

2403
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:16,609
to me I mean uh that have trivial
answers to it why haven't aliens at

2404
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:16,619
answers to it why haven't aliens at
 

2405
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,970
answers to it why haven't aliens at
scale not shown up

2406
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:19,980

 

2407
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,670

I think the the two possible options for

2408
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:22,680
I think the the two possible options for
 

2409
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,490
I think the the two possible options for
me is either we're too dumb to see it

2410
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:25,500
me is either we're too dumb to see it
 

2411
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,690
me is either we're too dumb to see it
they're already here they've been

2412
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:26,700
they're already here they've been
 

2413
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,970
they're already here they've been
talking to us through processes we just

2414
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:28,980
talking to us through processes we just
 

2415
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,970
talking to us through processes we just
don't understand like like what we

2416
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:31,980
don't understand like like what we
 

2417
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,390
don't understand like like what we
experience as a life here on Earth is

2418
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:35,400
experience as a life here on Earth is
 

2419
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,589
experience as a life here on Earth is
actually they're everywhere conscious

2420
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:36,599
actually they're everywhere conscious
 

2421
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:38,510
actually they're everywhere conscious
aliens could be consciousness

2422
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:38,520
aliens could be consciousness
 

2423
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,910
aliens could be consciousness
that when we feel love for one another

2424
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:40,920
that when we feel love for one another
 

2425
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,069
that when we feel love for one another
that could be aliens when we I don't

2426
00:52:43,069 --> 00:52:43,079
that could be aliens when we I don't
 

2427
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:45,589
that could be aliens when we I don't
know or feel fear or whatever that could

2428
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:45,599
know or feel fear or whatever that could
 

2429
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,349
know or feel fear or whatever that could
be aliens I have to agree with you none

2430
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:48,359
be aliens I have to agree with you none
 

2431
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:50,750
be aliens I have to agree with you none
of this is scientifically provable right

2432
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:50,760
of this is scientifically provable right
 

2433
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,790
of this is scientifically provable right
now we talked a little bit already about

2434
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,800
now we talked a little bit already about
 

2435
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,690
now we talked a little bit already about
that

2436
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:53,700
that
 

2437
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,329
that
but I would say that I

2438
00:52:56,329 --> 00:52:56,339
but I would say that I
 

2439
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,589
but I would say that I
do not adhere to the Fermi Paradox

2440
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
do not adhere to the Fermi Paradox
 

2441
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,990
do not adhere to the Fermi Paradox
because it's very entreprene morphic

2442
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,000
because it's very entreprene morphic
 

2443
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,089
because it's very entreprene morphic
it's you know it's an interesting

2444
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:05,099
it's you know it's an interesting
 

2445
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,750
it's you know it's an interesting
exercise let's put it that way but it's

2446
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:08,760
exercise let's put it that way but it's
 

2447
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,510
exercise let's put it that way but it's
a typical example of seeing the universe

2448
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:11,520
a typical example of seeing the universe
 

2449
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,890
a typical example of seeing the universe
through our own eyes and this is what

2450
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:15,900
through our own eyes and this is what
 

2451
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,069
through our own eyes and this is what
the limitation is

2452
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
the limitation is
 

2453
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,510
the limitation is
understanding what's going on with

2454
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:20,520
understanding what's going on with
 

2455
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,430
understanding what's going on with
complexity as you said and looking at

2456
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:22,440
complexity as you said and looking at
 

2457
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,910
complexity as you said and looking at
the biophysical model and theories for

2458
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:25,920
the biophysical model and theories for
 

2459
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,490
the biophysical model and theories for
the nature of life I would agree that

2460
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:28,500
the nature of life I would agree that
 

2461
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,049
the nature of life I would agree that
probably

2462
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:30,059
probably
 

2463
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,750
probably
this extraterrestrial message is all

2464
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:32,760
this extraterrestrial message is all
 

2465
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,329
this extraterrestrial message is all
around us we're not yet capable of

2466
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:35,339
around us we're not yet capable of
 

2467
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:36,950
around us we're not yet capable of
picking it up

2468
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:36,960
picking it up
 

2469
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,349
picking it up
but I think unfortunately even though

2470
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:39,359
but I think unfortunately even though
 

2471
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,450
but I think unfortunately even though
that makes me sad the way to pick it up

2472
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:41,460
that makes me sad the way to pick it up
 

2473
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,549
that makes me sad the way to pick it up
is by studying life here on Earth doing

2474
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:43,559
is by studying life here on Earth doing
 

2475
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,349
is by studying life here on Earth doing
some of the science you're doing better

2476
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:45,359
some of the science you're doing better
 

2477
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,510
some of the science you're doing better
understand the nature of life until you

2478
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
understand the nature of life until you
 

2479
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,849
understand the nature of life until you
realize

00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:48,859
realize
 

2481
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:52,790
realize
uh holy crap the thing I was looking for

2482
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
uh holy crap the thing I was looking for
 

2483
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,010
uh holy crap the thing I was looking for
all along has been has been here all

2484
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,020
all along has been has been here all
 

2485
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,990
all along has been has been here all
along right well you know a good example

2486
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:57,000
along right well you know a good example
 

2487
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,589
along right well you know a good example
of that and it doesn't need to be

2488
00:53:59,589 --> 00:53:59,599
of that and it doesn't need to be
 

2489
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,650
of that and it doesn't need to be
an extraterrestrial civilization look at

2490
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:03,660
an extraterrestrial civilization look at
 

2491
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,990
an extraterrestrial civilization look at
something that I really you know whether

2492
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
something that I really you know whether
 

2493
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,710
something that I really you know whether
or not is real I don't care because in

2494
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:09,720
or not is real I don't care because in
 

2495
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,809
or not is real I don't care because in
terms of intellectual exercise I think

2496
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:11,819
terms of intellectual exercise I think
 

2497
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:13,609
terms of intellectual exercise I think
it's fantastic look at the shadow

2498
00:54:13,609 --> 00:54:13,619
it's fantastic look at the shadow
 

2499
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:14,990
it's fantastic look at the shadow
biosphere

2500
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,000
biosphere
 

2501
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,089
biosphere
the idea that life didn't appear

2502
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:20,099
the idea that life didn't appear
 

2503
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:23,750
the idea that life didn't appear
only once on Earth but there were many

2504
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:23,760
only once on Earth but there were many
 

2505
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,490
only once on Earth but there were many
different Pathways of it and

2506
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:27,500
different Pathways of it and
 

2507
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,309
different Pathways of it and
today we know when we study

2508
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:31,319
today we know when we study
 

2509
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:35,089
today we know when we study
the tree of life that led to us

2510
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:35,099
the tree of life that led to us
 

2511
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:37,490
the tree of life that led to us
from Luca to us

2512
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:37,500
from Luca to us
 

2513
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,109
from Luca to us
and

and
 

2515
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,150
and
the shadow biosphere is telling us that

2516
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,160
the shadow biosphere is telling us that
 

2517
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,170
the shadow biosphere is telling us that
there is

2518
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:42,180
there is
 

2519
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,349
there is
or there are other pathways

2520
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
or there are other pathways
 

2521
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,890
or there are other pathways
that came up at the time where life

2522
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:48,900
that came up at the time where life
 

2523
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,410
that came up at the time where life
originated but they are so different

2524
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:51,420
originated but they are so different
 

2525
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,290
originated but they are so different
that we cannot recognize them

2526
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:54,300
that we cannot recognize them
 

2527
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,270
that we cannot recognize them
as being living

2528
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:56,280
as being living
 

2529
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,690
as being living
and we cannot pick them up in our test

2530
00:54:59,690 --> 00:54:59,700
and we cannot pick them up in our test
 

2531
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,990
and we cannot pick them up in our test
because our tests are being built to

2532
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,000
because our tests are being built to
 

2533
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,770
because our tests are being built to
recognize Life as we know it and for me

2534
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:05,780
recognize Life as we know it and for me
 

2535
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:09,470
recognize Life as we know it and for me
again I don't know if this Theory

2536
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:09,480
again I don't know if this Theory
 

2537
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,030
again I don't know if this Theory
will be verified or it would be

2538
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
will be verified or it would be
 

2539
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,370
will be verified or it would be
discredited but what I like about it is

2540
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:16,380
discredited but what I like about it is
 

2541
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,849
discredited but what I like about it is
that it forces me to think on how do I

2542
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:19,859
that it forces me to think on how do I
 

2543
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,970
that it forces me to think on how do I
look for life I don't know

2544
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:22,980
look for life I don't know
 

2545
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,390
look for life I don't know
so that starts here on our planet not

2546
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:26,400
so that starts here on our planet not
 

2547
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,470
so that starts here on our planet not
even with little green man uh it starts

2548
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:30,480
even with little green man uh it starts
 

2549
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,650
even with little green man uh it starts
with very simple life that be can be so

2550
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:33,660
with very simple life that be can be so
 

2551
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,549
with very simple life that be can be so
different

2552
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:34,559
different
 

2553
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,770
different
that it might be just right in front of

2554
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:36,780
that it might be just right in front of
 

2555
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,170
that it might be just right in front of
our nose and we don't see it so that

2556
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:39,180
our nose and we don't see it so that
 

2557
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,030
our nose and we don't see it so that
probably starts with the the scientific

2558
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:41,040
probably starts with the the scientific
 

2559
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,170
probably starts with the the scientific
humility of always

2560
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:44,180
humility of always
 

2561
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,010
humility of always
realizing that

2562
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:46,020
realizing that
 

2563
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,410
realizing that
we might be too biased in understanding

2564
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:48,420
we might be too biased in understanding
 

2565
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,450
we might be too biased in understanding
of what is the phenomena we're trying to

2566
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:50,460
of what is the phenomena we're trying to
 

2567
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,430
of what is the phenomena we're trying to
study yeah I don't like the term bias

2568
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:52,440
study yeah I don't like the term bias
 

2569
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,870
study yeah I don't like the term bias
because it involves some moral

2570
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:53,880
because it involves some moral
 

2571
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,829
because it involves some moral
connotation that you know

2572
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:56,839
connotation that you know
 

2573
00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:00,049
connotation that you know
in terms of scientific pathway

2574
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:00,059
in terms of scientific pathway
 

2575
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:02,329
in terms of scientific pathway
intellectual framework definitely what

2576
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:02,339
intellectual framework definitely what
 

2577
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,430
intellectual framework definitely what
do you think about the

2578
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:04,440
do you think about the
 

2579
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,510
do you think about the
UFO sightings so the widespread

2580
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:08,520
UFO sightings so the widespread
 

2581
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,849
UFO sightings so the widespread
experiences that people have and seeing

2582
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:10,859
experiences that people have and seeing
 

2583
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:14,809
experiences that people have and seeing
different phenomena that they sort of

2584
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:14,819
different phenomena that they sort of
 

2585
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,170
different phenomena that they sort of
that are mysterious that people project

2586
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:17,180
that are mysterious that people project
 

2587
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,790
that are mysterious that people project
ideas about whether it's aliens or not

2588
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:19,800
ideas about whether it's aliens or not
 

2589
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,710
ideas about whether it's aliens or not
but they can't explain it and there's

2590
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:21,720
but they can't explain it and there's
 

2591
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,510
but they can't explain it and there's
pictures and data and then the

2592
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:23,520
pictures and data and then the
 

2593
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,109
pictures and data and then the
government is involved in releasing

2594
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:26,119
government is involved in releasing
 

2595
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,430
government is involved in releasing
footage and all that kind of stuff and

2596
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:28,440
footage and all that kind of stuff and
 

2597
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,230
footage and all that kind of stuff and
that seems to Captivate the public it

2598
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:30,240
that seems to Captivate the public it
 

2599
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,870
that seems to Captivate the public it

actually dinosaurs and aliens still a

2606
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
actually dinosaurs and aliens still a
 

2607
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,710
actually dinosaurs and aliens still a
child yeah we are also child at heart

2608
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
child yeah we are also child at heart
 

2609
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,849
child yeah we are also child at heart
and so about UFOs I am a Scientist and

2610
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:46,859
and so about UFOs I am a Scientist and
 

2611
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:49,430
and so about UFOs I am a Scientist and
I'm a citizen so I'm going to tell you a

2612
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
I'm a citizen so I'm going to tell you a
 

2613
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,290
I'm a citizen so I'm going to tell you a
couple of things first I don't mind

2614
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:51,300
couple of things first I don't mind
 

2615
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,510
couple of things first I don't mind
talking about that at all because I

2616
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:53,520
talking about that at all because I
 

2617
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,670
talking about that at all because I
think as a scientist this is extremely

2618
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
think as a scientist this is extremely
 

2619
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,650
think as a scientist this is extremely
interesting because the thing I don't

2620
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:57,660
interesting because the thing I don't
 

2621
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,349
interesting because the thing I don't
know I want to learn about it this is

2622
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:00,359
know I want to learn about it this is
 

2623
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:02,809
know I want to learn about it this is
more knowledge so we all know the

2624
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:02,819
more knowledge so we all know the
 

2625
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:07,309
more knowledge so we all know the
statistics about UFOs 95 of them are

2626
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:07,319
statistics about UFOs 95 of them are
 

2627
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:09,589
statistics about UFOs 95 of them are
just natural phenom feminine or things

2628
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
just natural phenom feminine or things
 

2629
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,690
just natural phenom feminine or things
that are being misinterpreted we know

2630
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:11,700
that are being misinterpreted we know
 

2631
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,630
that are being misinterpreted we know
that then you have the two percent that

2632
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
that then you have the two percent that
 

2633
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,910
that then you have the two percent that
might be secret programs by whatever

2634
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:16,920
might be secret programs by whatever
 

2635
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,549
might be secret programs by whatever
government it's out there

2636
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:19,559
government it's out there
 

2637
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:22,430
government it's out there
another person say is about natural

2638
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:22,440
another person say is about natural
 

2639
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,589
another person say is about natural
phenomenon that

2640
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:24,599
phenomenon that
 

2641
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:26,870
phenomenon that
we don't know about yet that we cannot

2642
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:26,880
we don't know about yet that we cannot
 

2643
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,549
we don't know about yet that we cannot
explain and then there is this tiny

2644
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
explain and then there is this tiny
 

2645
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,069
explain and then there is this tiny
percentage that don't fall into all

2646
00:57:31,069 --> 00:57:31,079
percentage that don't fall into all
 

2647
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:32,630
percentage that don't fall into all
these categories of thing and I think

2648
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
these categories of thing and I think
 

2649
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,150
these categories of thing and I think
that the re the report about the uaps

2650
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:35,160
that the re the report about the uaps
 

2651
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,790
that the re the report about the uaps
falls into the same kind of scheme

2652
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:37,800
falls into the same kind of scheme
 

2653
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,210
falls into the same kind of scheme
except that now they have at least some

2654
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:41,220
except that now they have at least some
 

2655
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,750
except that now they have at least some
patterns of speed of other things that

2656
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:44,760
patterns of speed of other things that
 

2657
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,750
patterns of speed of other things that
were in the report today we don't know

2658
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
were in the report today we don't know
 

2659
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,750
were in the report today we don't know
if these sightings are

2660
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:50,760
if these sightings are
 

2661
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,290
if these sightings are
part of military program or actual UFOs

2662
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:56,300
part of military program or actual UFOs
 

2663
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,390
part of military program or actual UFOs
I always run into that question because

2664
00:57:59,390 --> 00:57:59,400
I always run into that question because
 

2665
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,010
I always run into that question because
of course as the Director of the car

2666
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:01,020
of course as the Director of the car
 

2667
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,809
of course as the Director of the car
second Center at the study Institute I

2668
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:02,819
second Center at the study Institute I
 

2669
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:04,910
second Center at the study Institute I
received a number of emails about the

2670
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:04,920
received a number of emails about the
 

2671
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,829
received a number of emails about the
subject people actually

2672
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:06,839
subject people actually
 

2673
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,109
subject people actually
confused about what the study Institute

2674
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
confused about what the study Institute
 

2675
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,170
confused about what the study Institute
is we are not studying UFOs we are

2676
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:12,180
is we are not studying UFOs we are
 

2677
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,329
is we are not studying UFOs we are
studying we are actually looking for

2678
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:14,339
studying we are actually looking for
 

2679
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:16,670
studying we are actually looking for
messages the way I put it you know

2680
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:16,680
messages the way I put it you know
 

2681
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,150
messages the way I put it you know
usually is that we are studying

2682
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:19,160
usually is that we are studying
 

2683
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,049
usually is that we are studying
extraterrestrial in their natural

2684
00:58:21,049 --> 00:58:21,059
extraterrestrial in their natural
 

2685
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:25,309
extraterrestrial in their natural
habitat yes and and the UFO people are

2686
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:25,319
habitat yes and and the UFO people are
 

2687
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:26,870
habitat yes and and the UFO people are
trying to understand whether they

2688
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:26,880
trying to understand whether they
 

2689
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,630
trying to understand whether they
invaded our aerial space yes so this is

2690
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:29,640
invaded our aerial space yes so this is
 

2691
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,030
invaded our aerial space yes so this is
very two very different things and

2692
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:32,040
very two very different things and
 

2693
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,569
very two very different things and
unfortunately over the years I actually

unfortunately over the years I actually
 

2695
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:38,510
unfortunately over the years I actually
respect very much people who are trying

respect very much people who are trying
to go to the bottom of what UFO are

to go to the bottom of what UFO are
 

2699
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,870
to go to the bottom of what UFO are
following some very

00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:44,880
following some very
 

2701
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,789
following some very
scientific ways of doing this they are

2702
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
scientific ways of doing this they are
 

2703
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,789
scientific ways of doing this they are
very very credible agencies doing this

2704

very very credible agencies doing this
 

2705

2711
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,930
to the scientific community and this is
why you have been having that much

2712

why you have been having that much
 

2713

pushback for a long time by the
 

2715
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:07,250
pushback for a long time by the
scientific Community because no

2716

and then the city Institute got it
 

2779
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:31,069
and then the city Institute got it
started so but now there is more of a

so much so that the government is

scientific institution and there are
 

2791
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,589
scientific institution and there are
programs to start looking into those

2792

2810
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:17,940
start with what if as a question and
 

2811
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,970
start with what if as a question and
then turns this what if in to the only

then turns this what if in to the only
argument and the only conclusion there

2814
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
argument and the only conclusion there
 

2815
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,430
argument and the only conclusion there
is you understand but still I think it's

2816
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:25,440
is you understand but still I think it's
 

2817
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,030
is you understand but still I think it's
valuable to appreciate the mystery and

01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:29,040
valuable to appreciate the mystery and
 

2819
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,250
valuable to appreciate the mystery and
not deny the mystery so no the mystery

2820
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:31,260
not deny the mystery so no the mystery
 

2821
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,349
not deny the mystery so no the mystery
is there but what I don't want is people

2822
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
is there but what I don't want is people
 

2823

2827
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,309
making money out of folklore well let me
flip that I understand but so there's a

2828
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:40,319
flip that I understand but so there's a
 

2829

all you need to do is this the the

all you need to do is this the the
 

2959
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:25,730
all you need to do is this the the
scientific process the peer review

2960
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:25,740
scientific process the peer review
 

2961
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,910
scientific process the peer review
process the the data and so on but I

2962
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:28,920
process the the data and so on but I
 

2963
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,349
process the the data and so on but I
think communication is actually a

think communication is actually a
 

2965
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:33,170
think communication is actually a
fundamental part of the process

2966

fundamental part of the process
 

2967
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,730
fundamental part of the process
um because it has to do with funding but

2968
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:34,740
um because it has to do with funding but
 

2969
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,950
um because it has to do with funding but
also has to do like where where a bunch

01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:36,960
also has to do like where where a bunch
 

2971
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,930
also has to do like where where a bunch
of humans trying to ask big questions

Presentation at The Institute than

peer-reviewed articles and believe me we

2980
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:49,260
peer-reviewed articles and believe me we
 

2981
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,770
peer-reviewed articles and believe me we
have a lot of peer-reviewed Articles so

2982
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:51,780
have a lot of peer-reviewed Articles so
 

2983
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,510
have a lot of peer-reviewed Articles so
our scientists are out there and they

2984
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:53,520
our scientists are out there and they
 

2985
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,370
our scientists are out there and they
are sharing The Wonder of discoveries

2986
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:55,380
are sharing The Wonder of discoveries
 

2987

and it's so easy these days I mean there

2988
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:58,079
and it's so easy these days I mean there
 

2989
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,230
and it's so easy these days I mean there
is not one day tell me about writing a

2990
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,240
is not one day tell me about writing a
 

2991
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,849
is not one day tell me about writing a
book right now about the search for life

2992
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:01,859
book right now about the search for life
 

2993
01:05:01,859 --> 01:05:04,609
book right now about the search for life
in the universe I mean it's almost every

2994
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:04,619
in the universe I mean it's almost every
 

2995
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:07,609
in the universe I mean it's almost every
single day I had to correct something in

2996
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:07,619
single day I had to correct something in
 

2997
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:10,730
single day I had to correct something in
the chapters I was writing so study in

2998
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:10,740
the chapters I was writing so study in
 

2999
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,130
the chapters I was writing so study in
terms of both signatures and signals is

3000
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:13,140
terms of both signatures and signals is
 

3001
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,890
terms of both signatures and signals is
a pretty active field so it's getting

3002
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:15,900
a pretty active field so it's getting
 

3003
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,250
a pretty active field so it's getting
better right now uh it's getting better

3004
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:18,260
better right now uh it's getting better
 

3005
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,809
better right now uh it's getting better
but remember that the city Institute is

3006
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:20,819
but remember that the city Institute is
 

3007
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:22,430
but remember that the city Institute is
not only about the search for experience

3008

not only about the search for experience

the historical route of the Institute
 

3013
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,690
the historical route of the Institute
but it's about 10 percent of what we do

01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:29,700
but it's about 10 percent of what we do
 

3015
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,270
but it's about 10 percent of what we do
in fact we are searching for life in the

in fact we are searching for life in the

01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,609
in fact we are searching for life in the

percent of everything else is exoplanet
 

3023
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,069
percent of everything else is exoplanet
uh for instance we have a good chunk of

3024
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:43,079
uh for instance we have a good chunk of
 

3025
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:46,849
uh for instance we have a good chunk of
the capital team that is actually with

01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:46,859
the capital team that is actually with
 

3027
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:48,890
the capital team that is actually with
the study Institute and they are working

3028
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:48,900
the study Institute and they are working
 

3029
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,990
the study Institute and they are working
with tests right now some already have

3030
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:51,000
with tests right now some already have
 

3031
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,089
with tests right now some already have
some time on the gems web we have

3032
01:05:53,089 --> 01:05:53,099
some time on the gems web we have
 

3033
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:55,549
some time on the gems web we have
astrobiologists we have astronomers and

3034
01:05:55,549 --> 01:05:55,559
astrobiologists we have astronomers and
 

3035
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:59,329
astrobiologists we have astronomers and
those are looking for data for signals

3036
01:05:59,329 --> 01:05:59,339
those are looking for data for signals
 

3037
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:01,849
those are looking for data for signals
for planets out there go outside of

01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:01,859
for planets out there go outside of
 

3039
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:04,069
for planets out there go outside of
ourselves and yeah go to analog places

01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
ourselves and yeah go to analog places
 

3041
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,809
ourselves and yeah go to analog places
to try and understand the type of life

3042
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:05,819
to try and understand the type of life
 

3043
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:08,630

one or will be flying
we are involved so this is not something

3054
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:22,200
we are involved so this is not something
 

3055
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,770
we are involved so this is not something
that pops in everybody's mind when they

3056
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:24,780
that pops in everybody's mind when they
 

3057
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,329
that pops in everybody's mind when they
are thinking about the the sari

3058
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:26,339
are thinking about the the sari

Institute because we started off as the

3060
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:29,160
Institute because we started off as the
 

3061
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,130
Institute because we started off as the
search for extraterrestrial intelligence

3062
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:31,140
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
 

3063
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,309
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
but the Institute has really blown into

3064
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:34,319
but the Institute has really blown into
 

3065
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,410
but the Institute has really blown into
the search for Life along the Drake

3066
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:36,420
the search for Life along the Drake
 

3067
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,750

equation all the terms of the Drake

3068
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:38,760
equation all the terms of the Drake
 

3069
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,270
equation all the terms of the Drake
equation just to clarify Because by the

3070
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:41,280
equation just to clarify Because by the
 

3071
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,410
equation just to clarify Because by the
way you're saying a bunch of terms

3072
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:42,420
way you're saying a bunch of terms
 

3073
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,390
way you're saying a bunch of terms
sometimes it's good to return to the

3074
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
sometimes it's good to return to the
 

3075
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,609
sometimes it's good to return to the
basics when you're saying whatever's

3076
01:06:46,609 --> 01:06:46,619
basics when you're saying whatever's
 

3077
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:48,430

01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:53,700
flown so we because we're using we
 

3083
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,490

elusive sometimes it's that we humans

3084
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:55,500
elusive sometimes it's that we humans
 

3085
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,770
elusive sometimes it's that we humans
and sometimes we study yeah so the

3086
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:57,780
and sometimes we study yeah so the
 

3087
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,650
and sometimes we study yeah so the
studies is really broadly involved a lot

3088
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:00,660
studies is really broadly involved a lot
 

3089
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,109

missions that will be coming it's the
 

3103
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:21,349
missions that will be coming it's the
search for life we do this all across

3104
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
search for life we do this all across
 

3105
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,230
search for life we do this all across
the Drake equation so uh studies part of

3106
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:24,240
the Drake equation so uh studies part of
 

3107
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,789
the Drake equation so uh studies part of
it and it's a root and it's expanding a

3108
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
it and it's a root and it's expanding a
 

3109
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,349
it and it's a root and it's expanding a
little bit right now we hope it will

3110
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:30,359
little bit right now we hope it will
 

3111
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,630
little bit right now we hope it will
continue to expand so this is this is a

3112
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
continue to expand so this is this is a
 

3113
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,510
continue to expand so this is this is a
good time uh for the Institute and it

3114
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,520
good time uh for the Institute and it
 

3115
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,270
good time uh for the Institute and it
also uh in my mind was the very first

3116
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:38,280
also uh in my mind was the very first
 

3117
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,490
also uh in my mind was the very first
astrobiology Institute because we have

3118
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:40,500
astrobiology Institute because we have
 

3119
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,329
astrobiology Institute because we have
this multi disciplinary approach where I

3120
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:44,339
this multi disciplinary approach where I
 

3121
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:46,609
this multi disciplinary approach where I
can bring many of these scientists from

3122
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:46,619
can bring many of these scientists from
 

3123
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:49,190
can bring many of these scientists from
different domains and disciplines to

3124
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:49,200
different domains and disciplines to
 

3125
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,309
different domains and disciplines to
think about the question and as you know

3126
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:51,319
think about the question and as you know
 

3127
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:54,230
think about the question and as you know
discoveries happen at the Nexus of

3128
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:54,240
discoveries happen at the Nexus of
 

3129
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,809
discoveries happen at the Nexus of
disciplines and it's really a privilege

3130
01:07:56,809 --> 01:07:56,819
disciplines and it's really a privilege
 

3131
01:07:56,819 --> 01:07:58,549
disciplines and it's really a privilege
when when you are in an Institute like

3132
01:07:58,549 --> 01:07:58,559
when when you are in an Institute like
 

3133
01:07:58,559 --> 01:07:59,450
when when you are in an Institute like
that

3134
01:07:59,450 --> 01:07:59,460
that
 

3135
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:03,349
that
you've dived in volcanic Lakes at high

3136
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:03,359
you've dived in volcanic Lakes at high
 

3137
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,210
you've dived in volcanic Lakes at high
altitudes to study the creatures within

3138
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:05,220
altitudes to study the creatures within
 

3139
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,390
altitudes to study the creatures within
can you tell me the technical the fun

3140
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
can you tell me the technical the fun
 

3141
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,970
can you tell me the technical the fun
the human story of that effort the the

3142
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:10,980
the human story of that effort the the
 

3143
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,010
the human story of that effort the the
image that is associated with the

3144
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:13,020
image that is associated with the
 

3145
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,049
image that is associated with the
scientist is the person with the white

3146
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:15,059
scientist is the person with the white
 

3147
01:08:15,059 --> 01:08:16,910
scientist is the person with the white
coat in the lab

3148
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:16,920
coat in the lab
 

3149
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,590
coat in the lab
in fact

3150
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:18,600
in fact
 

3151
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,110
in fact
um a number of us at Institute are

3152
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
um a number of us at Institute are
 

3153
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,990
um a number of us at Institute are
athletes doing extremes what would be

3154
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,000
athletes doing extremes what would be
 

3155
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,950
athletes doing extremes what would be
considered extreme stuff uh uh and not I

3156
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:27,960
considered extreme stuff uh uh and not I
 

3157
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,809
considered extreme stuff uh uh and not I
mean it's fun it's a little dangerous

3158
01:08:29,809 --> 01:08:29,819
mean it's fun it's a little dangerous
 

3159
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:32,630
mean it's fun it's a little dangerous
too but it's to get data and more

3160
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,640
too but it's to get data and more
 

3161
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,450
too but it's to get data and more
knowledge so there are so many stories I

3162
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:35,460
knowledge so there are so many stories I
 

3163
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,709
knowledge so there are so many stories I
don't even know it was the first time

3164
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:36,719
don't even know it was the first time
 

3165
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,950
don't even know it was the first time
you did a dangerous thing with a volcano

3166
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:39,960
you did a dangerous thing with a volcano
 

3167
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,470
you did a dangerous thing with a volcano
oh so the the first one Associated to uh

3168
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:45,480
oh so the the first one Associated to uh
 

3169
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,410
oh so the the first one Associated to uh
the search for Life understanding was in

3170
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:48,420
the search for Life understanding was in
 

3171
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,590
the search for Life understanding was in
2002 uh where I started climbing those

3172
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:51,600
2002 uh where I started climbing those
 

3173
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,169
2002 uh where I started climbing those

I is so hilarious at spending almost no
 

3181
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,450
I is so hilarious at spending almost no
time on some epic things I love this

3182
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:05,460
time on some epic things I love this
 

3183
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:08,269
time on some epic things I love this
okay with this volcano okay how tall

3184
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:08,279
okay with this volcano okay how tall
 

3185
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:09,829
okay with this volcano okay how tall
these volcanoes what are you doing with

3186
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:09,839
these volcanoes what are you doing with
 

3187
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,450
these volcanoes what are you doing with
the volcano what's required to prepare

3188
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:11,460
the volcano what's required to prepare
 

3189
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,309
the volcano what's required to prepare
for that what does a mission look like

3190
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:13,319
for that what does a mission look like
 

3191
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:15,709
for that what does a mission look like
that look like I mean how do I mean that

3192
01:09:15,709 --> 01:09:15,719
that look like I mean how do I mean that
 

3193
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:19,130
that look like I mean how do I mean that
is true that this is science embodied

3194
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:19,140
is true that this is science embodied
 

3195
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:21,229
is true that this is science embodied
it's like Athletics and it's science and

3196
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:21,239
it's like Athletics and it's science and
 

3197
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:23,209
it's like Athletics and it's science and
you're studying the extreme conditions

3198
01:09:23,209 --> 01:09:23,219
you're studying the extreme conditions
 

3199
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:26,209
you're studying the extreme conditions
of life on Earth extreme beauty of life

3200
01:09:26,209 --> 01:09:26,219
of life on Earth extreme beauty of life
 

3201
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:27,890
of life on Earth extreme beauty of life
on Earth in those conditions so what

3202
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:27,900
on Earth in those conditions so what
 

3203
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,169
on Earth in those conditions so what
what was what was them what are we

3204
01:09:30,169 --> 01:09:30,179
what was what was them what are we
 

3205
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:32,030
what was what was them what are we
talking about with this volcano what how

3206
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:32,040
talking about with this volcano what how
 

3207
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,769
talking about with this volcano what how
big is it remember when we were talking

3208
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:33,779
big is it remember when we were talking
 

3209
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:36,349
big is it remember when we were talking
about how do I understand how I search

3210
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:36,359
about how do I understand how I search
 

3211
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:38,209
about how do I understand how I search
for Life on Mars this is how it started

3212
01:09:38,209 --> 01:09:38,219
for Life on Mars this is how it started
 

3213
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:40,669
for Life on Mars this is how it started
for me and then I looked at environment

3214
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:40,679
for me and then I looked at environment
 

3215
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,590
for me and then I looked at environment
in my head started you know going

3216
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:42,600
in my head started you know going
 

3217
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,229
in my head started you know going
through the environment on Earth that

3218
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:45,239
through the environment on Earth that
 

3219
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:47,749
through the environment on Earth that
would be good analysis and then you only

3220
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:47,759
would be good analysis and then you only
 

3221
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,030
would be good analysis and then you only
have a few and the Andes in that case

3222
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,040
have a few and the Andes in that case
 

3223
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,209
have a few and the Andes in that case
are some of the best in the world just

3224
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:53,219
are some of the best in the world just
 

3225
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:56,689
are some of the best in the world just
because of the aridity of the place and

3226
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:56,699
because of the aridity of the place and
 

3227
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:58,729
because of the aridity of the place and
the higher you go

3228
01:09:58,729 --> 01:09:58,739
the higher you go
 

3229
01:09:58,739 --> 01:10:01,610
the higher you go
the least atmosphere you have the more

3230
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:01,620
the least atmosphere you have the more
 

3231
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:05,330
the least atmosphere you have the more
UV radiation you have and the Andes are

3232
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:05,340
UV radiation you have and the Andes are
 

3233
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:08,090
UV radiation you have and the Andes are
volcanic hydrothermal plus you have the

3234
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:08,100
volcanic hydrothermal plus you have the
 

3235
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,830
volcanic hydrothermal plus you have the
climate change that's coming you have

3236
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:09,840
climate change that's coming you have
 

3237
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,030
climate change that's coming you have
evaporation

3238
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:11,040
evaporation
 

3239
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,030
evaporation
it's a picture of Mars 3.5 billion years

3240
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:14,040
it's a picture of Mars 3.5 billion years
 

3241
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:18,410
it's a picture of Mars 3.5 billion years
ago and so now you are actually entering

3242
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:18,420
ago and so now you are actually entering
 

3243
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,169
ago and so now you are actually entering
a time machine basically

3244
01:10:21,169 --> 01:10:21,179
a time machine basically
 

3245
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:22,610
a time machine basically
so

3246
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:22,620
so
 

3247
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,709
so
um remember I'm a diver

3248
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
um remember I'm a diver
 

3249
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,030
um remember I'm a diver
and the first time I got in 2002 to the

3250
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,040
and the first time I got in 2002 to the
 

3251
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,450
and the first time I got in 2002 to the
places uh we wanted to explore

3252
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:32,460
places uh we wanted to explore
 

3253
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,350
places uh we wanted to explore
all of a sudden I was standing at 14 000

3254
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,360
all of a sudden I was standing at 14 000
 

3255
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,870
all of a sudden I was standing at 14 000
foot looking at twenty thousand feet and

3256
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:38,880
foot looking at twenty thousand feet and
 

3257
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,729
foot looking at twenty thousand feet and
saying okay

3258
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:40,739
saying okay
 

3259
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:42,729
saying okay
well I need to get up there

3260
01:10:42,729 --> 01:10:42,739
well I need to get up there
 

3261
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:46,790
well I need to get up there
are you scared no no because we are

3262
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
are you scared no no because we are
 

3263
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,070
are you scared no no because we are
prepared and the only thing I didn't

3264
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:49,080
prepared and the only thing I didn't
 

3265
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,990
prepared and the only thing I didn't
know is if I was going to be able to

3266
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:51,000
know is if I was going to be able to
 

3267
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,370
know is if I was going to be able to
make it to the top because now you're

3268
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:52,380
make it to the top because now you're
 

3269
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,229
make it to the top because now you're
dealing with high altitude you can deal

3270
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:54,239
dealing with high altitude you can deal
 

3271
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,090
dealing with high altitude you can deal
with high altitude sickness you can deal

3272
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:56,100
with high altitude sickness you can deal
 

3273
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,649
with high altitude sickness you can deal
with a number of thing and for God's

3274
01:10:57,649 --> 01:10:57,659
with a number of thing and for God's
 

3275
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:59,090
with a number of thing and for God's
sake these are volcanoes and they are

3276
01:10:59,090 --> 01:10:59,100
sake these are volcanoes and they are
 

3277
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,970
sake these are volcanoes and they are
dorm and they are not extinct that can

3278
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:01,980
dorm and they are not extinct that can
 

3279
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,610
dorm and they are not extinct that can
buy to buy toast a couple of times what

3280
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:04,620
buy to buy toast a couple of times what
 

3281
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,770
buy to buy toast a couple of times what
was your preparation for that kind of I

3282
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:06,780
was your preparation for that kind of I
 

3283
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,229
was your preparation for that kind of I
mean this is there is a lot of uh you

3284
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:09,239
mean this is there is a lot of uh you
 

3285
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:11,810
mean this is there is a lot of uh you
know hiking and trekking and I altitude

3286
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:11,820
know hiking and trekking and I altitude
 

3287
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:13,610
know hiking and trekking and I altitude
around here but not so high because we

3288
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:13,620
around here but not so high because we
 

3289
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,950
around here but not so high because we
don't have anything closer to those

3290
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:15,960
don't have anything closer to those
 

3291
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,390
don't have anything closer to those
elevations around here in the U.S but in

3292
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,400
elevations around here in the U.S but in
 

3293
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,950
elevations around here in the U.S but in
in volcanic environment climbing

3294
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:21,960
in volcanic environment climbing
 

3295
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,890
in volcanic environment climbing
volcanoes here we have plenty of those

3296
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:23,900
volcanoes here we have plenty of those
 

3297
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,990
volcanoes here we have plenty of those
diving as well I am a free diver so this

3298
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:27,000
diving as well I am a free diver so this
 

3299
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,669
diving as well I am a free diver so this
is where it's going to be hilarious

3300
01:11:28,669 --> 01:11:28,679
is where it's going to be hilarious
 

3301
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:32,209
is where it's going to be hilarious
because I started with a completely

3302
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:32,219
because I started with a completely
 

3303
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:34,729
because I started with a completely
rational fear of pressurized vessels

3304
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:34,739
rational fear of pressurized vessels
 

3305
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:37,790
rational fear of pressurized vessels
that comes from an incident in my

3306
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:37,800
that comes from an incident in my
 

3307
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,149
that comes from an incident in my
childhood and so I became a freediver to

3308
01:11:41,149 --> 01:11:41,159
childhood and so I became a freediver to
 

3309
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:44,149
childhood and so I became a freediver to
avoid having to carry oxygen tanks on my

3310
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
avoid having to carry oxygen tanks on my
 

3311
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,430
avoid having to carry oxygen tanks on my
back free diving is diving without

3312
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:46,440
back free diving is diving without
 

3313
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,890
back free diving is diving without
without anything just your lungs right

3314
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:48,900
without anything just your lungs right
 

3315
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,930
without anything just your lungs right
that was that started from childhood

3316
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:50,940
that was that started from childhood
 

3317
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,110
that was that started from childhood
yeah no it was to the point where when I

3318
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:54,120
yeah no it was to the point where when I
 

3319
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,470
yeah no it was to the point where when I
I saw a pressure vessel like a metal

3320
01:11:57,470 --> 01:11:57,480
I saw a pressure vessel like a metal
 

3321
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,630
I saw a pressure vessel like a metal
tanks or anything I would be you know

3322
01:11:59,630 --> 01:11:59,640
tanks or anything I would be you know
 

3323
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,350
tanks or anything I would be you know
going around and put a lot of distance

3324
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
going around and put a lot of distance
 

3325
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,750
going around and put a lot of distance
between me and that tank so I was not

3326
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:05,760
between me and that tank so I was not
 

3327
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,570
between me and that tank so I was not
going to carry any oxygen tank

3328
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:08,580
going to carry any oxygen tank
 

3329
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,510
going to carry any oxygen tank
um and in the first time I actually died

3330
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
um and in the first time I actually died
 

3331
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,669
um and in the first time I actually died
at the summit of that like was free

3332
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:13,679
at the summit of that like was free
 

3333
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:16,370
at the summit of that like was free
diving people look at me like I'm nuts

3334
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:16,380
diving people look at me like I'm nuts
 

3335
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,649
diving people look at me like I'm nuts
well maybe I am a little bit people that

3336
01:12:18,649 --> 01:12:18,659
well maybe I am a little bit people that
 

3337
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:20,330
well maybe I am a little bit people that
work with you as well I mean that that

3338
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:20,340
work with you as well I mean that that
 

3339
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,450
work with you as well I mean that that
kind of seems kind of nuts no uh we deal

3340
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:23,460
kind of seems kind of nuts no uh we deal
 

3341
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,610
kind of seems kind of nuts no uh we deal
with the risk actually it's a lot of

3342
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:25,620
with the risk actually it's a lot of
 

3343
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,330
with the risk actually it's a lot of
less of a risk than uh getting with

3344
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:29,340
less of a risk than uh getting with
 

3345
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,169
less of a risk than uh getting with
conventional air and I can explain that

3346
01:12:32,169 --> 01:12:32,179
conventional air and I can explain that
 

3347
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:35,570
conventional air and I can explain that
but uh ultimately what decided me to

3348
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:35,580
but uh ultimately what decided me to
 

3349
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,189
but uh ultimately what decided me to
certify Scuba

3350
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
certify Scuba
 

3351
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:41,090
certify Scuba
and go over my fear was that as a

3352
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:41,100
and go over my fear was that as a
 

3353
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,649
and go over my fear was that as a
scientist I needed more time at the

3354
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:42,659
scientist I needed more time at the
 

3355
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:46,370
scientist I needed more time at the
bottom of the lake to sample you know

3356
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:46,380
bottom of the lake to sample you know
 

3357
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,209
bottom of the lake to sample you know
rationally take my time to think and

3358
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:50,219
rationally take my time to think and
 

3359
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:53,810
rationally take my time to think and
I can stay quite long enough

3360
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:53,820
I can stay quite long enough
 

3361
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,090
I can stay quite long enough
as a free diver and the water

3362
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:56,100
as a free diver and the water
 

3363
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,950
as a free diver and the water
but the last thing you want to do at

3364
01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:57,960
but the last thing you want to do at
 

3365
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,410
but the last thing you want to do at
twenty thousand feet is to come up at

3366
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:00,420
twenty thousand feet is to come up at
 

3367
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,510
twenty thousand feet is to come up at
the surface with empty lungs because

3368
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:02,520
the surface with empty lungs because
 

3369
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,370
the surface with empty lungs because
there is not much you can breathe out

3370
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:04,380
there is not much you can breathe out
 

3371
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,630
there is not much you can breathe out
there to replenish your oxygen so

3372
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:07,640
there to replenish your oxygen so
 

3373
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,490
there to replenish your oxygen so
definitely your time in the water is cut

3374
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:10,500
definitely your time in the water is cut
 

3375
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,790
definitely your time in the water is cut
short just for safety and I realized

3376
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:13,800
short just for safety and I realized
 

3377
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,070
short just for safety and I realized
that it was not a good trade-off for me

3378
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:16,080
that it was not a good trade-off for me
 

3379
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,550
that it was not a good trade-off for me
at some point so I I certified scuba and

3380
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:19,560
at some point so I I certified scuba and
 

3381
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,850
at some point so I I certified scuba and
after three years of exploring that Lake

3382
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:22,860
after three years of exploring that Lake
 

3383
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,970
after three years of exploring that Lake
free diving we finally came up with a

3384
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:25,980
free diving we finally came up with a
 

3385
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,610
free diving we finally came up with a
full scuba diving Expedition but we were

3386
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:28,620
full scuba diving Expedition but we were
 

3387
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,030
full scuba diving Expedition but we were
diving with rebreathers which means that

3388
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:32,040
diving with rebreathers which means that
 

3389
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,870
diving with rebreathers which means that
we dived with pure oxygen

3390
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:35,880
we dived with pure oxygen
 

3391
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,610
we dived with pure oxygen
so Rivers give you a bag

3392
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:39,620
so Rivers give you a bag
 

3393
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:43,850
so Rivers give you a bag
with stuff that looks like cat leaders

3394
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:43,860
with stuff that looks like cat leaders
 

3395
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:46,010
with stuff that looks like cat leaders
in it which is basically to absorb the

3396
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:46,020
in it which is basically to absorb the
 

3397
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:49,550
in it which is basically to absorb the
CO2 uh that you are expelling when

3398
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:49,560
CO2 uh that you are expelling when
 

3399
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,709
CO2 uh that you are expelling when
you're breathing and their recycling

3400
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:51,719
you're breathing and their recycling
 

3401
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:54,770
you're breathing and their recycling
oxygen this way so basically you are

3402
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:54,780
oxygen this way so basically you are
 

3403
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:57,050
oxygen this way so basically you are
rebreathing your own

3404
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:57,060
rebreathing your own
 

3405
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,870
rebreathing your own
respiration wow yeah how long can you do

3406
01:13:59,870 --> 01:13:59,880
respiration wow yeah how long can you do
 

3407
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,310
respiration wow yeah how long can you do
that so what's what's the what's

3408
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:01,320
that so what's what's the what's
 

3409
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,229
that so what's what's the what's
interesting about the technology so it's

3410
01:14:03,229 --> 01:14:03,239
interesting about the technology so it's
 

3411
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,350
interesting about the technology so it's
very interesting because then that

3412
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:06,360
very interesting because then that
 

3413
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,669
very interesting because then that
completely avoids the potential issues

3414
01:14:10,669 --> 01:14:10,679
completely avoids the potential issues
 

3415
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:13,490
completely avoids the potential issues
you may have with the binds when you are

3416
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:13,500
you may have with the binds when you are
 

3417
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,550
you may have with the binds when you are
diving the risk of bubbles uh trapped in

3418
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:16,560
diving the risk of bubbles uh trapped in
 

3419
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,649
diving the risk of bubbles uh trapped in
your lungs because of different

3420
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:18,659
your lungs because of different
 

3421
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,590
your lungs because of different
pressures and different gases oh so

3422
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
pressures and different gases oh so
 

3423
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,209
pressures and different gases oh so
there's there's a complexity to the flow

3424
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:23,219
there's there's a complexity to the flow
 

3425
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:24,850
there's there's a complexity to the flow
of oxygen

3426
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:24,860
of oxygen
 

3427
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,990
of oxygen
underwater when you are breathing

3428
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:27,000
underwater when you are breathing
 

3429
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,510
underwater when you are breathing
regular air when you are scuba diving

3430
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
regular air when you are scuba diving
 

3431
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,390
regular air when you are scuba diving
here you know that you have to do some

3432
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400
here you know that you have to do some
 

3433
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,250
here you know that you have to do some
uh different when you're coming back

3434
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:34,260
uh different when you're coming back
 

3435
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,470
uh different when you're coming back
when you are diving deep and you have

3436
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
when you are diving deep and you have
 

3437
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,830
when you are diving deep and you have
conventional air then you need to stop

3438
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:38,840
conventional air then you need to stop
 

3439
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,550
conventional air then you need to stop
so that you can equalize the gases in

3440
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:43,560
so that you can equalize the gases in
 

3441
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,689
so that you can equalize the gases in
your lungs if you come back too fast

3442
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:46,699
your lungs if you come back too fast
 

3443
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:51,229
your lungs if you come back too fast
then you can have air bubbles stuck and

3444
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:51,239
then you can have air bubbles stuck and
 

3445
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,390
then you can have air bubbles stuck and
then you can raise the binds which you

3446
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:53,400
then you can raise the binds which you
 

3447
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,189
then you can raise the binds which you
can wish to be paralyzed you can reach a

3448
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:55,199
can wish to be paralyzed you can reach a
 

3449
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,530
can wish to be paralyzed you can reach a
number of nasty issues and we want it

3450
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:57,540
number of nasty issues and we want it
 

3451
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,870
number of nasty issues and we want it
absolutely to avoid that so diving with

3452
01:14:59,870 --> 01:14:59,880
absolutely to avoid that so diving with
 

3453
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,110
absolutely to avoid that so diving with
pure oxygen avoids this completely

3454
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:03,120
pure oxygen avoids this completely
 

3455
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:08,330
pure oxygen avoids this completely
and it has a another uh benefit and I

3456
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:08,340
and it has a another uh benefit and I
 

3457
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,910
and it has a another uh benefit and I
altitude is that well

3458
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:10,920
altitude is that well
 

3459
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,250
altitude is that well
the greater risk when you are at high

3460
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:13,260
the greater risk when you are at high
 

3461
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:16,130
the greater risk when you are at high
altitude is altitude sickness what is

3462
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:16,140
altitude is altitude sickness what is
 

3463
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,709
altitude is altitude sickness what is
altitude sickness is just you not having

3464
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
altitude sickness is just you not having
 

3465
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,250
altitude sickness is just you not having
enough oxygen in your blood so these you

3466
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:22,260
enough oxygen in your blood so these you
 

3467
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:23,990
enough oxygen in your blood so these you
know this was a good benefit it was a

3468
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,000
know this was a good benefit it was a
 

3469
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,330
know this was a good benefit it was a
good trade-off we were lucky enough to

3470
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:26,340
good trade-off we were lucky enough to
 

3471
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,750
good trade-off we were lucky enough to
be also trained by the military so we

3472
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:29,760
be also trained by the military so we
 

3473
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,870
be also trained by the military so we
came up with not the civilian rebreather

3474
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:32,880
came up with not the civilian rebreather
 

3475
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,030
came up with not the civilian rebreather
which is the big thing on on the back

3476
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:35,040
which is the big thing on on the back
 

3477
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,450
which is the big thing on on the back
that you carry on your back we actually

3478
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:37,460
that you carry on your back we actually
 

3479
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:41,090
that you carry on your back we actually
uh we're given Navy Seals Commando

3480
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:41,100
uh we're given Navy Seals Commando
 

3481
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,130
uh we're given Navy Seals Commando
rebrievers you worked with Navy Seals

3482
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:43,140
rebrievers you worked with Navy Seals
 

3483
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,229
rebrievers you worked with Navy Seals
for this the director of military

3484
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:45,239
for this the director of military
 

3485
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:48,290
for this the director of military
operations yes we were trained we were

3486
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:48,300
operations yes we were trained we were
 

3487
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,530
operations yes we were trained we were
trained like astronauts for three months

3488
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:51,540
trained like astronauts for three months
 

3489
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,290
trained like astronauts for three months
I spend more time I had a joke that if

3490
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:54,300
I spend more time I had a joke that if
 

3491
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,750
I spend more time I had a joke that if
somebody wanted to reach me they better

3492
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:56,760
somebody wanted to reach me they better
 

3493
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,850
somebody wanted to reach me they better
put a phone line at the bottom of the

3494
01:15:58,850 --> 01:15:58,860
put a phone line at the bottom of the
 

3495
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,290
put a phone line at the bottom of the
swimming pool because this is where I

3496
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:00,300
swimming pool because this is where I
 

3497
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,630
swimming pool because this is where I
was so we trained and we trained and our

3498
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
was so we trained and we trained and our
 

3499
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,990
was so we trained and we trained and our
manual about the safety was about that

3500
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
manual about the safety was about that
 

3501
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,830
manual about the safety was about that
thick

3502
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:06,840
thick
 

3503
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,950
thick
so it was a real operation

3504
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:09,960
so it was a real operation
 

3505
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,290
so it was a real operation
that was three years into into it

3506
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:12,300
that was three years into into it
 

3507
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,090
that was three years into into it
because when you are free diving in the

3508
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:14,100
because when you are free diving in the
 

3509
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,370
because when you are free diving in the
Years prior there is no risk you don't

3510
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:16,380
Years prior there is no risk you don't
 

3511
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,830
Years prior there is no risk you don't
have any other gas in your lung that

3512
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:18,840
have any other gas in your lung that
 

3513
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,810
have any other gas in your lung that
what you're breathing the only Rises

3514
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:20,820
what you're breathing the only Rises
 

3515
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,330
what you're breathing the only Rises
come short of air and then you're in

3516
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:23,340
come short of air and then you're in
 

3517
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,790
come short of air and then you're in
trouble which happened to me uh one time

3518
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:25,800
trouble which happened to me uh one time
 

3519
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,790
trouble which happened to me uh one time
seriously so tell me about that time I

3520
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800
seriously so tell me about that time I
 

3521
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,470
seriously so tell me about that time I
got to ask you about free diving before

3522
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
got to ask you about free diving before
 

3523
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,630
got to ask you about free diving before
we return to the rebreathers well all

3524
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:32,640
we return to the rebreathers well all
 

3525
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,910
we return to the rebreathers well all
these legs I had altitude they are

3526
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:34,920
these legs I had altitude they are
 

3527
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,290
these legs I had altitude they are
called they are at the minimum

3528
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:36,300
called they are at the minimum
 

3529
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,390
called they are at the minimum
temperature that you can have on bodies

3530
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
temperature that you can have on bodies
 

3531
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,910
temperature that you can have on bodies
of water uh clear bodies of water which

3532
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:40,920
of water uh clear bodies of water which
 

3533
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,390
of water uh clear bodies of water which
is for degree C it's very very cold and

3534
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:44,400
is for degree C it's very very cold and
 

3535
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,830
is for degree C it's very very cold and
so you can take a nice bath yeah

3536
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:47,840
so you can take a nice bath yeah
 

3537
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,630
so you can take a nice bath yeah
so you cannot

3538
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
so you cannot
 

3539
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,250
so you cannot
um

3540
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:51,260
um
 

3541
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:55,070
um
just dive with a wetsuit

3542
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:55,080
just dive with a wetsuit
 

3543
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:00,950
just dive with a wetsuit
so the idea was to take a dry suit and I

3544
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:00,960
so the idea was to take a dry suit and I
 

3545
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,890
so the idea was to take a dry suit and I
learned how to free dive with a dry suit

3546
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:03,900
learned how to free dive with a dry suit
 

3547
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,169
learned how to free dive with a dry suit
which is really the worst thing you can

3548
01:17:06,169 --> 01:17:06,179
which is really the worst thing you can
 

3549
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:08,810
which is really the worst thing you can
do what's a wetsuit what's address so a

3550
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:08,820
do what's a wetsuit what's address so a
 

3551
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:11,750
do what's a wetsuit what's address so a
dry suit a wetsuit is usually what you

3552
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:11,760
dry suit a wetsuit is usually what you
 

3553
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,430
dry suit a wetsuit is usually what you
use in the ocean when it's not too cold

3554
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
use in the ocean when it's not too cold
 

3555
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,050
use in the ocean when it's not too cold
you can use also dry suit but the

3556
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:15,060
you can use also dry suit but the
 

3557
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,149
you can use also dry suit but the
wetsuit basically is going to keep you

3558
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:17,159
wetsuit basically is going to keep you
 

3559
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:19,729
wetsuit basically is going to keep you
warm because water is getting into the

3560
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:19,739
warm because water is getting into the
 

3561
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:23,090
warm because water is getting into the
suit and at the contact of your skin is

3562
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,100
suit and at the contact of your skin is
 

3563
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,970
suit and at the contact of your skin is
getting to body temperature and so for a

3564
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:25,980
getting to body temperature and so for a
 

3565
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:28,370
getting to body temperature and so for a
while you can you know dive like that

3566
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:28,380
while you can you know dive like that
 

3567
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,550
while you can you know dive like that
and need in the ocean here that's fine

3568
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:31,560
and need in the ocean here that's fine
 

3569
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,790
and need in the ocean here that's fine
that that that's fine the dry suit is

3570
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:34,800
that that that's fine the dry suit is
 

3571
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,189
that that that's fine the dry suit is
the opposite it's completely closed

3572
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:37,199
the opposite it's completely closed
 

3573
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,010
the opposite it's completely closed
which means that you don't have any

3574
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:40,020
which means that you don't have any
 

3575
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:42,350
which means that you don't have any
contact with the water outside and you

3576
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:42,360
contact with the water outside and you
 

3577
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,470
contact with the water outside and you
keep your warmth through your body

3578
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:45,480
keep your warmth through your body
 

3579
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,810
keep your warmth through your body
temperature and even clothing that you

3580
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:47,820
temperature and even clothing that you
 

3581
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,570
temperature and even clothing that you
can put into it so this dry suit they

3582
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:50,580
can put into it so this dry suit they
 

3583
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,689
can put into it so this dry suit they
are used by either go really deep in

3584
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:53,699
are used by either go really deep in
 

3585
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:56,209
are used by either go really deep in
very cold water and need to stay a long

3586
01:17:56,209 --> 01:17:56,219
very cold water and need to stay a long
 

3587
01:17:56,219 --> 01:17:58,610
very cold water and need to stay a long
time underwater so what's the bad part

3588
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:58,620
time underwater so what's the bad part
 

3589
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:02,270
time underwater so what's the bad part
the bad part is that

3590
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:02,280
the bad part is that
 

3591
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:06,310
the bad part is that
when you have those uh dry suit

3592
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:06,320
when you have those uh dry suit
 

3593
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,290
when you have those uh dry suit
you have a lot of air that can be

3594
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:09,300
you have a lot of air that can be
 

3595
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,950
you have a lot of air that can be
trapped in it usually we do what we call

3596
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
trapped in it usually we do what we call
 

3597
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,050
trapped in it usually we do what we call
burping the suit it's not very pleasant

3598
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:15,060
burping the suit it's not very pleasant
 

3599
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,810
burping the suit it's not very pleasant
expression but you get in the water and

3600
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:17,820
expression but you get in the water and
 

3601
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,310
expression but you get in the water and
as soon as you get in the water you can

3602
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:19,320
as soon as you get in the water you can
 

3603
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,649
as soon as you get in the water you can
see the air pockets all over the place

3604
01:18:21,649 --> 01:18:21,659
see the air pockets all over the place
 

3605
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:23,630
see the air pockets all over the place
right so you burp the suit you open the

3606
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:23,640
right so you burp the suit you open the
 

3607
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,689
right so you burp the suit you open the
valve and the air comes out once you

3608
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:26,699
valve and the air comes out once you
 

3609
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:29,030
valve and the air comes out once you
have done that then you look with your

3610
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
have done that then you look with your
 

3611
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,910
have done that then you look with your
lead belt and and you know when you're

3612
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:31,920
lead belt and and you know when you're
 

3613
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,770
lead belt and and you know when you're
ready to go down and so what happened

3614
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:33,780
ready to go down and so what happened
 

3615
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:36,890
ready to go down and so what happened
that day is that I actually did verb the

3616
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:36,900
that day is that I actually did verb the
 

3617
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,830
that day is that I actually did verb the
suit but didn't realize that worked it

3618
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:39,840
suit but didn't realize that worked it
 

3619
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,270
suit but didn't realize that worked it
completely and so I went down

3620
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:44,280
completely and so I went down
 

3621
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,450
completely and so I went down
and immediately I felt an air pocket

3622
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:47,460
and immediately I felt an air pocket
 

3623
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:51,229
and immediately I felt an air pocket
going to my legs so basically air was

3624
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:51,239
going to my legs so basically air was
 

3625
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:54,229
going to my legs so basically air was
trapped in the suit and went on my legs

3626
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:54,239
trapped in the suit and went on my legs
 

3627
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,050
trapped in the suit and went on my legs
as I was diving like that and so I

3628
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:57,060
as I was diving like that and so I
 

3629
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,669
as I was diving like that and so I
didn't pay too much attention to that

3630
01:18:58,669 --> 01:18:58,679
didn't pay too much attention to that
 

3631
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:00,649
didn't pay too much attention to that
because you're diving down yeah I was

3632
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:00,659
because you're diving down yeah I was
 

3633
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:03,050
because you're diving down yeah I was
driving down and so didn't pay too much

3634
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:03,060
driving down and so didn't pay too much
 

3635
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,229
driving down and so didn't pay too much
attention about that as I was you know

3636
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:06,239
attention about that as I was you know
 

3637
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,430
attention about that as I was you know
busy at just an awkward position but

3638
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:10,440
busy at just an awkward position but
 

3639
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,750
busy at just an awkward position but
um then I wanted to turn and go up

3640

of realized I was in trouble and the
fifth time I say okay now you better

01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,530
gonna be big trouble
um and you're this is free diving I was

3658
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:39,540
um and you're this is free diving I was
 

3659
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,590
um and you're this is free diving I was
free diving and then you can and I

3660
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:42,600
free diving and then you can and I
 

3661
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,330
free diving and then you can and I
cannot what are you feeling I mean is

3662
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:44,340
cannot what are you feeling I mean is
 

3663
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:46,669
cannot what are you feeling I mean is
there a panic or no there is no panic

3664
01:19:46,669 --> 01:19:46,679
there a panic or no there is no panic
 

3665
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:49,370
there a panic or no there is no panic
because you can't you cannot afford to

3666
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:49,380
because you can't you cannot afford to
 

3667
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,229
because you can't you cannot afford to
be panicking in fact you are always

3668
01:19:51,229 --> 01:19:51,239
be panicking in fact you are always
 

3669
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:53,090
be panicking in fact you are always
thinking because there is training this

3670
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:53,100
thinking because there is training this
 

3671
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,830
thinking because there is training this
is the best part about training your

3672
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:54,840
is the best part about training your
 

3673
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,530
is the best part about training your
training allows you that space to keep

3674
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:57,540
training allows you that space to keep
 

3675
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:58,430
training allows you that space to keep
you cool

3676
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:58,440
you cool
 

3677
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,770
you cool
and and compose which you need to be in

3678
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:00,780
and and compose which you need to be in
 

3679
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:04,189
and and compose which you need to be in
that kind of situation and so finally

3680
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:04,199
that kind of situation and so finally
 

3681
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,770
that kind of situation and so finally
after the fifth time I was able to

3682
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:06,780
after the fifth time I was able to
 

3683
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:09,530
after the fifth time I was able to
rectify the position and get myself up

3684
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:09,540
rectify the position and get myself up
 

3685
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:13,610
rectify the position and get myself up
but when I got up my lungs were empty I

3686
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:13,620
but when I got up my lungs were empty I
 

3687
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,410
but when I got up my lungs were empty I
had been in the water for quite some

3688
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:15,420
had been in the water for quite some
 

3689
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,250
had been in the water for quite some
time

3690
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:16,260
time
 

3691
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:20,270
time
and I of I knew what was going to happen

3692
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:20,280
and I of I knew what was going to happen
 

3693
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:23,149
and I of I knew what was going to happen
so I decided to just be the plank you

3694
01:20:23,149 --> 01:20:23,159
so I decided to just be the plank you
 

3695
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:25,370
so I decided to just be the plank you
know not move and don't do anything just

3696
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:25,380
know not move and don't do anything just
 

3697
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,250
know not move and don't do anything just
open my mouth and try to suck oxygen but

3698
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:28,260
open my mouth and try to suck oxygen but
 

3699
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,830
open my mouth and try to suck oxygen but
obviously oxygen at six thousand meters

3700
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:30,840
obviously oxygen at six thousand meters
 

3701
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,130
obviously oxygen at six thousand meters
20 000 feet there is not that much it's

3702
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:34,140
20 000 feet there is not that much it's
 

3703
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:37,490
20 000 feet there is not that much it's
about a little it's a 48 of what you

3704
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:37,500
about a little it's a 48 of what you
 

3705
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,350
about a little it's a 48 of what you
breathe at sea level

3706
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
breathe at sea level
 

3707
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,169
breathe at sea level
so although it was noon at that time

3708
01:20:44,169 --> 01:20:44,179
so although it was noon at that time
 

3709
01:20:44,179 --> 01:20:49,510
so although it was noon at that time
the skies that pretty dark and starry

oh my God yes
 

3713
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,550
oh my God yes
uh the funny thing was and that's the

3714
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:55,560
uh the funny thing was and that's the
 

3715
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,110
uh the funny thing was and that's the
first time you've experienced that kind

3716
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:57,120
first time you've experienced that kind
 

3717
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,810
first time you've experienced that kind
of uh I mean do you can you possibly

3718
01:20:59,810 --> 01:20:59,820
of uh I mean do you can you possibly
 

3719
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,330
of uh I mean do you can you possibly
train for that like because can you also

3720
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:02,340
train for that like because can you also
 

3721
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,970
train for that like because can you also
pass out oh you could I mean the fact

3722
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:04,980
pass out oh you could I mean the fact
 

3723
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,729
pass out oh you could I mean the fact
that I was already seeing dark was a

3724
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:07,739
that I was already seeing dark was a
 

3725
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:10,189
that I was already seeing dark was a
real sign that my brain was starved of

3726
01:21:10,189 --> 01:21:10,199
real sign that my brain was starved of
 

3727
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:14,870
real sign that my brain was starved of
oxygen and I had one of my uh friends or

3728
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:14,880
oxygen and I had one of my uh friends or

3747
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:40,490
no uh because I knew I was going to be
okay but it took me to be still just for

3748
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:40,500
okay but it took me to be still just for
 

3749
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,689
okay but it took me to be still just for
a few minutes

3750
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:41,699
a few minutes
 

3751
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:43,610
a few minutes
well can you talk about free diving I

3752
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:43,620
well can you talk about free diving I
 

3753
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,189
well can you talk about free diving I
mean what's the technical skill involved

3754
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:46,199
mean what's the technical skill involved
 

3755
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:49,070
mean what's the technical skill involved
here it just seems um

3756
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:49,080
here it just seems um
 

3757
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,810
here it just seems um
it seems exceptionally difficult like

3758
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:50,820
it seems exceptionally difficult like
 

3759
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,310
it seems exceptionally difficult like
for most people that swim you go

3760
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:52,320
for most people that swim you go
 

3761
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,430
for most people that swim you go
underwater it's it's hard so what what's

3762
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:55,440
underwater it's it's hard so what what's
 

3763
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,130
underwater it's it's hard so what what's
the skill there you know I think

3764
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:58,140
the skill there you know I think
 

3765
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,709
the skill there you know I think
you probably can get good or better at

3766
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
you probably can get good or better at
 

3767
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,890
you probably can get good or better at
freediving by training so you have

3768
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:03,900
freediving by training so you have
 

3769
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,169
freediving by training so you have
different techniques uh you can train in

3770
01:22:06,169 --> 01:22:06,179
different techniques uh you can train in
 

3771
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:07,970
different techniques uh you can train in
swimming pool and you can say you know

3772
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:07,980
swimming pool and you can say you know
 

3773
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:09,890
swimming pool and you can say you know
frankly for me

3774
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:09,900
frankly for me
 

3775
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,390
frankly for me
um I go at the bottom of the swimming

3776
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:11,400
um I go at the bottom of the swimming
 

3777
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,689
um I go at the bottom of the swimming
pool and I sit there and then you have

3778
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:14,699
pool and I sit there and then you have
 

3779
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:17,930
pool and I sit there and then you have
relaxation uh techniques some people

3780
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:17,940
relaxation uh techniques some people
 

3781

01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:55,560
pretty brilliant so I removed
 

3953
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,430
pretty brilliant so I removed
the Lifesavers that I had and I just

3954
01:25:58,430 --> 01:25:58,440
the Lifesavers that I had and I just
 

3955
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,350
the Lifesavers that I had and I just
went in the water my mom said before she

3956
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:00,360
went in the water my mom said before she
 

3957
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,950
went in the water my mom said before she
could do anything I was under and it was

3958
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:03,960
could do anything I was under and it was
 

3959
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,590
could do anything I was under and it was
like a natural thing and for me I felt

3960
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:06,600
like a natural thing and for me I felt
 

3961
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,830
like a natural thing and for me I felt
immediately at home and and you know as

3962
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:09,840
immediately at home and and you know as
 

3963
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,010
immediately at home and and you know as
little as I was completely and it goes

3964
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:13,020
little as I was completely and it goes
 

3965
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:15,229
little as I was completely and it goes
beyond that and you know this sense of

3966
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:15,239
beyond that and you know this sense of
 

3967
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:18,229
beyond that and you know this sense of
connectiveness or Oneness or whatever I

3968
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:18,239
connectiveness or Oneness or whatever I
 

3969
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,910
connectiveness or Oneness or whatever I
always felt

3970
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:19,920
always felt
 

3971
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,629
always felt
good and and uh underwater so it doesn't

3972
01:26:23,629 --> 01:26:23,639
good and and uh underwater so it doesn't
 

3973
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:25,970
good and and uh underwater so it doesn't
matter really if it's 20 000 feet that

3974
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:25,980
matter really if it's 20 000 feet that
 

3975
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,490
matter really if it's 20 000 feet that
the thing that's better at that point is

3976
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:28,500
the thing that's better at that point is
 

3977
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,950
the thing that's better at that point is
that you need to get there so you need

3978
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:30,960
that you need to get there so you need
 

3979
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,970
that you need to get there so you need
to get with all the gears with your

3980
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:33,980
to get with all the gears with your
 

3981
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:37,610
to get with all the gears with your
hiking tracking equipment High

3982
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:37,620
hiking tracking equipment High
 

3983
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,250
hiking tracking equipment High
mountaineering gears and when you get on

3984
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:40,260
mountaineering gears and when you get on
 

3985
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:42,290
mountaineering gears and when you get on
top of that you have to remove all that

3986
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:42,300
top of that you have to remove all that
 

3987
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,270
top of that you have to remove all that
and don't a suit

3988
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:44,280
and don't a suit
 

3989
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,090
and don't a suit
is there something uh you can speak to

3990
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:47,100
is there something uh you can speak to
 

3991
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,830
is there something uh you can speak to
the challenging aspects of that process

3992
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:48,840
the challenging aspects of that process
 

3993
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,050
the challenging aspects of that process
or is it just like this rigorous process

3994
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:51,060
or is it just like this rigorous process
 

3995
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,970
or is it just like this rigorous process
that's well designed you have to go

3996
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:52,980
that's well designed you have to go
 

3997
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,090
that's well designed you have to go
through and you don't think

3998
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:55,100
through and you don't think
 

3999
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:58,250
through and you don't think
this is where most of the risk is

4000
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:58,260
this is where most of the risk is
 

4001
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,830
this is where most of the risk is
because

4002
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:00,840
because
 

4003
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,590
because
you can be well prepared but for one

4004
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:03,600
you can be well prepared but for one
 

4005
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,110
you can be well prepared but for one
reason or another you get sick you know

4006
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:06,120
reason or another you get sick you know
 

4007
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,030
reason or another you get sick you know
and you can get sick not only because of

4008
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:08,040
and you can get sick not only because of
 

4009
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,850
and you can get sick not only because of
high altitude sickness it can be a

4010
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:10,860
high altitude sickness it can be a
 

4011
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,669
high altitude sickness it can be a
number of things or you can be tired or

4012
01:27:13,669 --> 01:27:13,679
number of things or you can be tired or
 

4013
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:16,070
number of things or you can be tired or
you can catch a cold and then of course

4014
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:16,080
you can catch a cold and then of course
 

4015
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,810
you can catch a cold and then of course
you have the mountain itself

4016
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:17,820
you have the mountain itself
 

4017
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:21,530
you have the mountain itself
we had a magnitude 7.8 earthquake

4018
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:21,540
we had a magnitude 7.8 earthquake
 

4019
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,750
we had a magnitude 7.8 earthquake
hitting one day when we are 50 meters

4020
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:23,760
hitting one day when we are 50 meters
 

4021
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,610
hitting one day when we are 50 meters
away from the summit so you can't

4022
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:25,620
away from the summit so you can't
 

4023
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:27,890
away from the summit so you can't
obviously plan for that no you can't and

4024
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:27,900
obviously plan for that no you can't and
 

4025
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,110
obviously plan for that no you can't and
that's the acts of God you know uh

4026
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:30,120
that's the acts of God you know uh
 

4027
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,649
that's the acts of God you know uh
working with NASA uh although I am the

4028
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:33,659
working with NASA uh although I am the
 

4029
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:35,990
working with NASA uh although I am the
director of the city Institute I my

4030
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,000
director of the city Institute I my
 

4031
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,669
director of the city Institute I my
grants are coming from NASA so I'm a

4032
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
grants are coming from NASA so I'm a
 

4033
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,709
grants are coming from NASA so I'm a
NASA contractor and every time we go to

4034
01:27:39,709 --> 01:27:39,719
NASA contractor and every time we go to
 

4035
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:41,570
NASA contractor and every time we go to
those environments we have to go through

4036
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:41,580
those environments we have to go through
 

4037
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:44,090
those environments we have to go through
the rigorous process of training with

4038
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:44,100
the rigorous process of training with
 

4039
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,550
the rigorous process of training with
NASA and checking all the boxes for

4040
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
NASA and checking all the boxes for
 

4041
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,649
NASA and checking all the boxes for
safety so they are training and training

4042
01:27:48,649 --> 01:27:48,659
safety so they are training and training
 

4043
01:27:48,659 --> 01:27:50,450
safety so they are training and training
and training us and I have to thank them

4044
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:50,460
and training us and I have to thank them
 

4045
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:54,229
and training us and I have to thank them
because a lot of those trainings are the

4046
01:27:54,229 --> 01:27:54,239
because a lot of those trainings are the
 

4047
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,390
because a lot of those trainings are the
things that are in your brain when these

4048
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:56,400
things that are in your brain when these
 

4049
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,189
things that are in your brain when these
kind of things happen you know how to

4050
01:27:58,189 --> 01:27:58,199
kind of things happen you know how to
 

4051
01:27:58,199 --> 01:28:00,950
kind of things happen you know how to
react and you are not freaking out but

4052
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:00,960
react and you are not freaking out but
 

4053
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,050
react and you are not freaking out but
in all of the things they are training

4054
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:03,060
in all of the things they are training
 

4055
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:05,629
in all of the things they are training
us for you have the green risk the

4056
01:28:05,629 --> 01:28:05,639
us for you have the green risk the
 

4057
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:08,090
us for you have the green risk the
yellow risk and the red risk so the

4058
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:08,100
yellow risk and the red risk so the
 

4059
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,129
yellow risk and the red risk so the
green risks are basically the don't be

4060
01:28:10,129 --> 01:28:10,139
green risks are basically the don't be
 

4061
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:11,689
green risks are basically the don't be
stupid that don't do the kind of thing

4062
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:11,699
stupid that don't do the kind of thing
 

4063
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:13,550
stupid that don't do the kind of thing
you wouldn't be doing at home like it's

4064
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:13,560
you wouldn't be doing at home like it's
 

4065
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,890
you wouldn't be doing at home like it's
jumping you know on rocks that are not

4066
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:15,900
jumping you know on rocks that are not
 

4067
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,370
jumping you know on rocks that are not
stable you can tweak your ankle you know

4068
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:19,380
stable you can tweak your ankle you know
 

4069
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,129
stable you can tweak your ankle you know
and then you have other risks like high

4070
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:22,139
and then you have other risks like high
 

4071
01:28:22,139 --> 01:28:24,229
and then you have other risks like high
altitude sickness how you prepare for

4072
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:24,239
altitude sickness how you prepare for
 

4073
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,629
altitude sickness how you prepare for
that how you recognize that these are

4074
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
that how you recognize that these are
 

4075
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,430
that how you recognize that these are
the yellow risks and then the red risk

4076
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:28,440
the yellow risks and then the red risk
 

4077
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,470
the yellow risks and then the red risk
the red bricks are what they call the

4078
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
the red bricks are what they call the
 

4079
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,350
the red bricks are what they call the
acts of gods the kind of thing that they

4080
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:33,360
acts of gods the kind of thing that they
 

4081
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,570
acts of gods the kind of thing that they
can happen you know there is nothing you

4082
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:35,580
can happen you know there is nothing you
 

4083
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,250
can happen you know there is nothing you
can do about it and then you accept that

4084
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:37,260
can do about it and then you accept that
 

4085
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:40,430
can do about it and then you accept that
when you do that so those are

4086
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:40,440
when you do that so those are
 

4087
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,290
when you do that so those are
volcanic eruptions when you're in this

4088
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:42,300
volcanic eruptions when you're in this
 

4089
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,990
volcanic eruptions when you're in this
kind of environment earthquakes

4090
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:45,000
kind of environment earthquakes
 

4091
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,689
kind of environment earthquakes
and everything that an Avalanches for

4092
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:47,699
and everything that an Avalanches for
 

4093
01:28:47,699 --> 01:28:49,189
and everything that an Avalanches for
instance so you're in this Giant

4094
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:49,199
instance so you're in this Giant
 

4095
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,250
instance so you're in this Giant
mountain and it's shaking no it's not

4096
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:52,260
mountain and it's shaking no it's not
 

4097
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,350
mountain and it's shaking no it's not
shaking that's the interesting part of

4098
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:54,360
shaking that's the interesting part of
 

4099
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,350
shaking that's the interesting part of
it there was a whole background of

4100
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:57,360
it there was a whole background of
 

4101
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,450
it there was a whole background of
things that happened that day when we we

4102
01:28:59,450 --> 01:28:59,460
things that happened that day when we we
 

4103
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:04,430
things that happened that day when we we
started off but we got to 50 meters from

4104
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:04,440
started off but we got to 50 meters from
 

4105
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,050
started off but we got to 50 meters from

scientists in the crater with the Cradle
 

4231
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:43,310

pop on the opposite side of the rim you

4416
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
pop on the opposite side of the rim you
 

4417
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,770
pop on the opposite side of the rim you
know

4418
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:30,780
know
 

4419
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:33,830
know
so at that time we had no choice anymore

4420
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:33,840
so at that time we had no choice anymore
 

4421
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,930
so at that time we had no choice anymore
because now you have to figure out

4422
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:35,940
because now you have to figure out
 

4423
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:39,050
because now you have to figure out
what's going to kill you first and so

4424
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:39,060
what's going to kill you first and so
 

4425
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:42,050
what's going to kill you first and so
there was the risk or the potential of

4426
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:42,060
there was the risk or the potential of
 

4427
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,430
there was the risk or the potential of
an avalanche

4428
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:43,440
an avalanche
 

4429
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,370
an avalanche
but at least you can see the rocks

4430
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:46,380
but at least you can see the rocks
 

4431
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,229
but at least you can see the rocks
the guest is going to kill you before

4432
01:35:48,229 --> 01:35:48,239
the guest is going to kill you before
 

4433
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,149
the guest is going to kill you before
you can see it yeah so I called

4434
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:50,159
you can see it yeah so I called
 

4435
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:53,750
you can see it yeah so I called
everybody back we got our stuff

4436
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:53,760
everybody back we got our stuff
 

4437
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,729
everybody back we got our stuff
um I didn't give too much detail but I

4438
01:35:55,729 --> 01:35:55,739
um I didn't give too much detail but I
 

4439
01:35:55,739 --> 01:35:57,350
um I didn't give too much detail but I
say it's time to go

4440
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:57,360
say it's time to go
 

4441
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,810
say it's time to go
downhill and fast

4442
01:35:59,810 --> 01:35:59,820
downhill and fast
 

4443
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,750
downhill and fast
so which we did we stopped only when we

4444
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:02,760
so which we did we stopped only when we
 

4445
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:06,470
so which we did we stopped only when we
were at Mid camp and then at that point

4446
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:06,480
were at Mid camp and then at that point
 

4447
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,450
were at Mid camp and then at that point
we saw the cloud just completely

4448
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:08,460
we saw the cloud just completely
 

4449
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,669
we saw the cloud just completely
covering the summit where we were so we

4450
01:36:10,669 --> 01:36:10,679
covering the summit where we were so we
 

4451
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:12,290
covering the summit where we were so we
did well to bail out

4452
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:12,300
did well to bail out
 

4453
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,870
did well to bail out
but that was 500 meter

4454
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
but that was 500 meter
 

4455
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,209
but that was 500 meter
500 meter high over than we were so we

4456
01:36:17,209 --> 01:36:17,219
500 meter high over than we were so we
 

4457
01:36:17,219 --> 01:36:18,950
500 meter high over than we were so we
are safe I was just making sure that it

4458
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:18,960
are safe I was just making sure that it
 

4459
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,810
are safe I was just making sure that it
would not go down the slope where we

4460
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:20,820
would not go down the slope where we
 

4461
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:23,510
would not go down the slope where we
were we were safe so we stayed and you

4462
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,520
were we were safe so we stayed and you
 

4463
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,390
were we were safe so we stayed and you
know just rested for a little while and

4464
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:26,400
know just rested for a little while and
 

4465
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,149
know just rested for a little while and
after that we descended and it was all

4466
01:36:29,149 --> 01:36:29,159
after that we descended and it was all
 

4467
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:30,950
after that we descended and it was all
on adrenaline I can tell you what I had

4468
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:30,960
on adrenaline I can tell you what I had
 

4469
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,470
on adrenaline I can tell you what I had
two on my crew with headaches as part of

4470
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:33,480
two on my crew with headaches as part of
 

4471
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,330
two on my crew with headaches as part of
one of them was because of the altitude

4472
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:35,340
one of them was because of the altitude
 

4473
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,250
one of them was because of the altitude
we climbed very fast the other one was

4474
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:37,260
we climbed very fast the other one was
 

4475
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,350
we climbed very fast the other one was
because of the cloud she was the closest

4476
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:39,360
because of the cloud she was the closest
 

4477
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,770
because of the cloud she was the closest
to the cloud when uh it happened so we

4478
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:42,780
to the cloud when uh it happened so we
 

4479
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,629
to the cloud when uh it happened so we
didn't send it fast wow that was close

4480
01:36:44,629 --> 01:36:44,639
didn't send it fast wow that was close
 

4481
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:47,750
didn't send it fast wow that was close
that was close and it's interesting how

4482
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:47,760
that was close and it's interesting how
 

4483
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,390
that was close and it's interesting how
the human body and mind works because I

4484
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,400
the human body and mind works because I
 

4485
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,950
the human body and mind works because I
know that from the moment my friend told

4486
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:51,960
know that from the moment my friend told
 

4487
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,290
know that from the moment my friend told
me that the volcano seemed to be

4488
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:54,300
me that the volcano seemed to be
 

4489
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,790
me that the volcano seemed to be
erupting I was going on adrenaline

4490
01:36:57,790 --> 01:36:57,800
erupting I was going on adrenaline
 

4491
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,790
erupting I was going on adrenaline
but when we got close to them and I saw

4492
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:01,800
but when we got close to them and I saw
 

4493
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,649
but when we got close to them and I saw
him we are getting close to the cars I

4494
01:37:03,649 --> 01:37:03,659
him we are getting close to the cars I
 

4495
01:37:03,659 --> 01:37:06,530
him we are getting close to the cars I
saw him come in towards me and the slope

4496
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:06,540
saw him come in towards me and the slope
 

4497
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:08,570
saw him come in towards me and the slope
all of a sudden all the adrenaline went

4498
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:08,580
all of a sudden all the adrenaline went
 

4499
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,430
all of a sudden all the adrenaline went
away

4500
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:09,440
away
 

4501
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,649
away
I was a mess I had to find the first

4502
01:37:12,649 --> 01:37:12,659
I was a mess I had to find the first
 

4503
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:16,370
I was a mess I had to find the first
rock and sit down yeah it was gone I

4504
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:16,380
rock and sit down yeah it was gone I
 

4505
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:18,169
rock and sit down yeah it was gone I
mean fascinating so you just basically

4506
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:18,179
mean fascinating so you just basically
 

4507
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:20,510
mean fascinating so you just basically
physically mentally collapsed once you

4508
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:20,520
physically mentally collapsed once you
 

4509
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:24,229
physically mentally collapsed once you
saw so there's nothing left of me I got

4510
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
saw so there's nothing left of me I got
 

4511
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:27,110
saw so there's nothing left of me I got
in the car and I felt in the cars we

4512
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:27,120
in the car and I felt in the cars we
 

4513
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,270
in the car and I felt in the cars we
were heading back towards a camp I could

4514
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:29,280
were heading back towards a camp I could
 

4515
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,970
were heading back towards a camp I could
have passed out I really fought back and

4516
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:31,980
have passed out I really fought back and
 

4517
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,830
have passed out I really fought back and
I'm not the kind of passing out really

4518
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:33,840
I'm not the kind of passing out really
 

4519
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,310
I'm not the kind of passing out really
you know easy but there was nothing left

4520
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:37,320
you know easy but there was nothing left
 

4521
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,850
you know easy but there was nothing left
I had no energy no nothing

4522
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:39,860
I had no energy no nothing
 

4523
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,970
I had no energy no nothing
it's fabulous how you react and how this

4524
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:43,980
it's fabulous how you react and how this
 

4525
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:48,890
it's fabulous how you react and how this
is embedded in your brain from and of

4526
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:48,900
is embedded in your brain from and of
 

4527
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:52,490
is embedded in your brain from and of
evolution of reaction to a dangerous

4528
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:52,500
evolution of reaction to a dangerous
 

4529
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,890
evolution of reaction to a dangerous
situation basically

4530
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:54,900
situation basically
 

4531
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,770
situation basically
the drive to survive yeah something like

4532
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:57,780
the drive to survive yeah something like
 

4533
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:00,290
the drive to survive yeah something like
that you just told us one heck of a

4534
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:00,300
that you just told us one heck of a
 

4535
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,169
that you just told us one heck of a
story and as you said such story comes

4536
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:03,179
story and as you said such story comes
 

4537
01:38:03,179 --> 01:38:04,610
story and as you said such story comes
along with many

4538
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:04,620
along with many
 

4539
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:07,129
along with many
of the diving Expeditions that you do

4540
01:38:07,129 --> 01:38:07,139
of the diving Expeditions that you do
 

4541
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:10,189
of the diving Expeditions that you do
but on the science side

4542
01:38:10,189 --> 01:38:10,199
but on the science side
 

4543
01:38:10,199 --> 01:38:13,310
but on the science side
what is that world that simulates that

4544
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:13,320
what is that world that simulates that
 

4545
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,649
what is that world that simulates that
travels back in time into the Martian

4546
01:38:15,649 --> 01:38:15,659
travels back in time into the Martian
 

4547
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:18,830
travels back in time into the Martian
landscape what is the science reveal

4548
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:18,840
landscape what is the science reveal
 

4549
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,250
landscape what is the science reveal
so the science reveals that

4550
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:22,260
so the science reveals that
 

4551
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:25,310
so the science reveals that
I feel resilient when I started that

4552
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:25,320
I feel resilient when I started that
 

4553
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,410
I feel resilient when I started that
project I told my husband I said this is

4554
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:27,420
project I told my husband I said this is
 

4555
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,030
project I told my husband I said this is
going to be very fast we are going in

4556
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:29,040
going to be very fast we are going in
 

4557
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,310
going to be very fast we are going in
such nasty environment that we're not

4558
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:31,320
such nasty environment that we're not
 

4559
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,290
such nasty environment that we're not
going to find anything and you know

4560
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:33,300
going to find anything and you know
 

4561
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:36,709
going to find anything and you know
world back home uh fairly soon

4562
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:36,719
world back home uh fairly soon
 

4563
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:38,870
world back home uh fairly soon
so 20 years later we are still studying

4564
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
so 20 years later we are still studying
 

4565
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,310
so 20 years later we are still studying
those environments that was a gut

4566
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:40,320
those environments that was a gut
 

4567
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,229
those environments that was a gut
feeling like nothing not much can

4568
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:42,239
feeling like nothing not much can
 

4569
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,390
feeling like nothing not much can
possibly survive well the the UV

4570
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:44,400
possibly survive well the the UV
 

4571
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,090
possibly survive well the the UV
environment is so nasty but there you

4572
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:47,100
environment is so nasty but there you
 

4573
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:51,709
environment is so nasty but there you
find the same microorganism that made

4574
01:38:51,709 --> 01:38:51,719
find the same microorganism that made
 

4575
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:54,649
find the same microorganism that made
the very first fossils on Earth 3.5

4576
01:38:54,649 --> 01:38:54,659
the very first fossils on Earth 3.5
 

4577
01:38:54,659 --> 01:38:56,169
the very first fossils on Earth 3.5
billion years ago

4578
01:38:56,169 --> 01:38:56,179
billion years ago
 

4579
01:38:56,179 --> 01:38:58,970
billion years ago
and they keep surviving they developed

4580
01:38:58,970 --> 01:38:58,980
and they keep surviving they developed
 

4581
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,669
and they keep surviving they developed
an adaptation

4582
01:39:00,669 --> 01:39:00,679
an adaptation
 

4583
01:39:00,679 --> 01:39:03,470
an adaptation
Swiss armina if you prefer

4584
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:03,480
Swiss armina if you prefer
 

4585
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:06,229
Swiss armina if you prefer
and so you learn about that you learn

4586
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:06,239
and so you learn about that you learn
 

4587
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:09,709
and so you learn about that you learn
about what they are how they adapt

4588
01:39:09,709 --> 01:39:09,719
about what they are how they adapt
 

4589
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:11,750
about what they are how they adapt
through times and through environmental

4590
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:11,760
through times and through environmental
 

4591
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,810
through times and through environmental
changes which is really important what

4592
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:14,820
changes which is really important what
 

4593
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,790
changes which is really important what
are their signatures we learn to

4594
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:16,800
are their signatures we learn to
 

4595
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,129
are their signatures we learn to
recognize them we learn what kind of

4596
01:39:19,129 --> 01:39:19,139
recognize them we learn what kind of
 

4597
01:39:19,139 --> 01:39:21,470
recognize them we learn what kind of
instrument we need what kind of of

4598
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:21,480
instrument we need what kind of of
 

4599
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:24,229
instrument we need what kind of of
signature whether it's chemical or

4600
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
signature whether it's chemical or
 

4601
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:28,129
signature whether it's chemical or
morphological or whatnot so basically we

4602
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:28,139
morphological or whatnot so basically we
 

4603
01:39:28,139 --> 01:39:30,890
morphological or whatnot so basically we
learn how to explore but I would say

4604
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:30,900
learn how to explore but I would say
 

4605
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,229
learn how to explore but I would say
that to me and this is a realization

4606
01:39:33,229 --> 01:39:33,239
that to me and this is a realization
 

4607
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:35,270
that to me and this is a realization
interestingly enough that came three

4608
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:35,280
interestingly enough that came three
 

4609
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,570
interestingly enough that came three
years into the project

4610
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:37,580
years into the project
 

4611
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:41,149
years into the project
uh I really woke up literally one

4612
01:39:41,149 --> 01:39:41,159
uh I really woke up literally one
 

4613
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:43,729
uh I really woke up literally one
morning saying you know we have been

4614
01:39:43,729 --> 01:39:43,739
morning saying you know we have been
 

4615
01:39:43,739 --> 01:39:46,850
morning saying you know we have been
coming here for three years now try and

4616
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:46,860
coming here for three years now try and
 

4617
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:49,250
coming here for three years now try and
understand how to search for Life on

4618
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:49,260
understand how to search for Life on
 

4619
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:52,129
understand how to search for Life on
Mars but what this place is showing us

4620
01:39:52,129 --> 01:39:52,139
Mars but what this place is showing us
 

4621
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:54,290
Mars but what this place is showing us
is what's happening right here right now

4622
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:54,300
is what's happening right here right now
 

4623
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,050
is what's happening right here right now
on our own planet

4624
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:56,060
on our own planet
 

4625
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,610
on our own planet
and uh by exploring those extreme

4626
01:39:58,610 --> 01:39:58,620
and uh by exploring those extreme
 

4627
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,649
and uh by exploring those extreme
environments we are also reaching to

4628
01:40:00,649 --> 01:40:00,659
environments we are also reaching to
 

4629
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:03,709
environments we are also reaching to
places not too many people go and so

4630
01:40:03,709 --> 01:40:03,719
places not too many people go and so
 

4631
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:05,209
places not too many people go and so
we're learning more about our own

4632
01:40:05,209 --> 01:40:05,219
we're learning more about our own
 

4633
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:09,410
we're learning more about our own
biospheres and uh the diversity of our

4634
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:09,420
biospheres and uh the diversity of our
 

4635
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,169
biospheres and uh the diversity of our
own life here on Earth so these are the

4636
01:40:12,169 --> 01:40:12,179
own life here on Earth so these are the
 

4637
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,090
own life here on Earth so these are the
two main things you know that I would

4638
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:14,100
two main things you know that I would
 

4639
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,490
two main things you know that I would
say what kind of life

4640
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:16,500
say what kind of life
 

4641
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,770
say what kind of life
survives up there

4642
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:18,780
survives up there
 

4643
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:20,629
survives up there
well there's volcanoes it's about

4644
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:20,639
well there's volcanoes it's about
 

4645
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,270
well there's volcanoes it's about
bacteria you know mostly is there

4646
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:23,280
bacteria you know mostly is there
 

4647
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,110
bacteria you know mostly is there
something

4648
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:24,120
something
 

4649
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,689
something
specific about that bacteria that's able

4650
01:40:26,689 --> 01:40:26,699
specific about that bacteria that's able
 

4651
01:40:26,699 --> 01:40:28,970
specific about that bacteria that's able
to be so rugged yes

4652
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:28,980
to be so rugged yes
 

4653
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:30,950
to be so rugged yes
um they have adapted to very high UV

4654
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:30,960
um they have adapted to very high UV
 

4655
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,530
um they have adapted to very high UV
radiation and it's not only because they

4656
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:33,540
radiation and it's not only because they
 

4657
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,930
radiation and it's not only because they
are at high altitude it's because early

4658
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:35,940
are at high altitude it's because early
 

4659
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,070
are at high altitude it's because early
Earth

4660
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:37,080
Earth
 

4661
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:40,610
Earth
didn't have an ozone layer so when those

4662
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:40,620
didn't have an ozone layer so when those
 

4663
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:43,850
didn't have an ozone layer so when those
the ancestors of those bacteria

4664
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:43,860
the ancestors of those bacteria
 

4665
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:47,209
the ancestors of those bacteria
originated they have to survive a world

4666
01:40:47,209 --> 01:40:47,219
originated they have to survive a world
 

4667
01:40:47,219 --> 01:40:49,970
originated they have to survive a world
where you had lots of short UV coming

4668
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:49,980
where you had lots of short UV coming
 

4669
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,729
where you had lots of short UV coming
down at the surface and also lots of

4670
01:40:52,729 --> 01:40:52,739
down at the surface and also lots of
 

4671
01:40:52,739 --> 01:40:54,530
down at the surface and also lots of
hydrothermal environments you know

4672
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:54,540
hydrothermal environments you know
 

4673
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:57,709
hydrothermal environments you know
volcanoes and hot water lots of salt and

4674
01:40:57,709 --> 01:40:57,719
volcanoes and hot water lots of salt and
 

4675
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:00,290
volcanoes and hot water lots of salt and
you see all these toolbox

4676
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:00,300
you see all these toolbox
 

4677
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:01,870
you see all these toolbox
Steel

4678
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:01,880
Steel
 

4679
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:05,149
Steel
embedded in those microorganisms today 4

4680
01:41:05,149 --> 01:41:05,159
embedded in those microorganisms today 4
 

4681
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:07,209
embedded in those microorganisms today 4
billion years later it's just amazing

4682
01:41:07,209 --> 01:41:07,219
billion years later it's just amazing
 

4683
01:41:07,219 --> 01:41:10,250
billion years later it's just amazing
and depending on the environment they

4684
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:10,260
and depending on the environment they
 

4685
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:12,590
and depending on the environment they
are going to switch some of these

4686
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:12,600
are going to switch some of these
 

4687
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,830
are going to switch some of these
defenses adaptation on or off

4688
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:15,840
defenses adaptation on or off
 

4689
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,870
defenses adaptation on or off
the UV

4690
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:17,880
the UV
 

4691
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:22,370
the UV
situation there is so nasty that

4692
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:22,380
situation there is so nasty that
 

4693
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:25,070
situation there is so nasty that
here you have bacterias like that

4694
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:25,080
here you have bacterias like that
 

4695
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,810
here you have bacterias like that
cyanobacteria you find them everywhere

4696
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:26,820
cyanobacteria you find them everywhere
 

4697
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,610
cyanobacteria you find them everywhere
it's really something you find all over

4698
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:28,620
it's really something you find all over
 

4699
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:31,430
it's really something you find all over
the place but if you find them here in

4700
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,440
the place but if you find them here in
 

4701
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,370
the place but if you find them here in
California they will turn their

4702
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:34,380
California they will turn their
 

4703
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,250
California they will turn their
protection against UV during the day in

4704
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:37,260
protection against UV during the day in
 

4705
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:40,430
protection against UV during the day in
summer and they will switch it off at

4706
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:40,440
summer and they will switch it off at
 

4707
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,990
summer and they will switch it off at
the end of the day

4708
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:42,000
the end of the day
 

4709
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,109
the end of the day
there in the Andes it's so nasty is that

4710
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:45,119
there in the Andes it's so nasty is that
 

4711
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,270
there in the Andes it's so nasty is that
that thing stays on all the time

4712
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,280
that thing stays on all the time
 

4713
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,090
that thing stays on all the time
but if you take samples and bring them

4714
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:50,100
but if you take samples and bring them
 

4715
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:52,970
but if you take samples and bring them
back here and start to

4716
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:52,980
back here and start to
 

4717
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:56,330
back here and start to
culture them like we did on top of a

4718
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:56,340
culture them like we did on top of a
 

4719
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:59,450
culture them like we did on top of a
building leaving them you know you will

4720
01:41:59,450 --> 01:41:59,460
building leaving them you know you will
 

4721
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,729
building leaving them you know you will
see the second generation of this

4722
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:01,739
see the second generation of this
 

4723
01:42:01,739 --> 01:42:04,729
see the second generation of this
organism they are starting to switch on

4724
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:04,739
organism they are starting to switch on
 

4725
01:42:04,739 --> 01:42:06,350
organism they are starting to switch on
and off again

4726
01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:06,360
and off again
 

4727
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:10,430
and off again
so they're extremely adaptable extremely

4728
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:10,440
so they're extremely adaptable extremely
 

4729
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:12,470
so they're extremely adaptable extremely
rugged and that's why they are still

4730
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,480
rugged and that's why they are still
 

4731
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,250
rugged and that's why they are still
here

4732
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:13,260
here
 

4733
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,709
here
and probably that's why we are here

4734
01:42:15,709 --> 01:42:15,719
and probably that's why we are here
 

4735
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:19,010
and probably that's why we are here
because life found sways so is there

4736
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:19,020
because life found sways so is there
 

4737
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:21,229
because life found sways so is there
some degree to which the harshness of

4738
01:42:21,229 --> 01:42:21,239
some degree to which the harshness of
 

4739
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:22,850
some degree to which the harshness of
the conditions

4740
01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:22,860
the conditions
 

4741
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:25,250
the conditions
enables

4742
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:25,260
enables
 

4743
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:28,790
enables
flourishing of life versus shuts it down

4744
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:28,800
flourishing of life versus shuts it down
 

4745
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,010
flourishing of life versus shuts it down
well it will shut down

4746
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:31,020
well it will shut down
 

4747
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,890
well it will shut down
those that cannot survive obviously you

4748
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:33,900
those that cannot survive obviously you
 

4749
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:35,270
those that cannot survive obviously you
know this is a statement that's Captain

4750
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
know this is a statement that's Captain
 

4751
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,629
know this is a statement that's Captain
Obvious right there but it's also

4752
01:42:37,629 --> 01:42:37,639
Obvious right there but it's also
 

4753
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:40,970
Obvious right there but it's also
the survival of the fittest and this is

4754
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:40,980
the survival of the fittest and this is
 

4755
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:43,330
the survival of the fittest and this is
what evolution is all right

4756
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:43,340
what evolution is all right
 

4757
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:46,609
what evolution is all right
so they are here because they were the

4758
01:42:46,609 --> 01:42:46,619
so they are here because they were the
 

4759
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:48,169
so they are here because they were the
most deductible

4760
01:42:48,169 --> 01:42:48,179
most deductible
 

4761
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:50,270
most deductible
and so

4762
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:50,280
and so
 

4763
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:55,609
and so
evolution is going to show the path of

4764
01:42:55,609 --> 01:42:55,619
evolution is going to show the path of
 

4765
01:42:55,619 --> 01:42:58,910
evolution is going to show the path of
the fittest the one that cannot resist

4766
01:42:58,910 --> 01:42:58,920
the fittest the one that cannot resist
 

4767
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,830
the fittest the one that cannot resist
they might have a good time for a little

4768
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:00,840
they might have a good time for a little
 

4769
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,890
they might have a good time for a little
while but then you know we've seen this

4770
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:03,900
while but then you know we've seen this
 

4771
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:07,729
while but then you know we've seen this
at much different scale and with complex

4772
01:43:07,729 --> 01:43:07,739
at much different scale and with complex
 

4773
01:43:07,739 --> 01:43:10,310
at much different scale and with complex
life not so long ago a hundred thousand

4774
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:10,320
life not so long ago a hundred thousand
 

4775
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,310
life not so long ago a hundred thousand
years ago meanderthal

4776
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:13,320
years ago meanderthal
 

4777
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:16,669
years ago meanderthal
was side by side by Homo sapiens but

4778
01:43:16,669 --> 01:43:16,679
was side by side by Homo sapiens but
 

4779
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:19,430
was side by side by Homo sapiens but
nandatho was completely adapted to a

4780
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
nandatho was completely adapted to a
 

4781
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,609
nandatho was completely adapted to a
cold Earth to a glacial Earth of the end

4782
01:43:22,609 --> 01:43:22,619
cold Earth to a glacial Earth of the end
 

4783
01:43:22,619 --> 01:43:24,350
cold Earth to a glacial Earth of the end
of the pleistocene

4784
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:24,360
of the pleistocene
 

4785
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,990
of the pleistocene
and when condition change

4786
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:27,000
and when condition change
 

4787
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,149
and when condition change
it couldn't last you think I mean

4788
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:29,159
it couldn't last you think I mean
 

4789
01:43:29,159 --> 01:43:30,530
it couldn't last you think I mean
there's still some Mysteries around that

4790
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:30,540
there's still some Mysteries around that
 

4791
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:32,870
there's still some Mysteries around that
right like exactly exactly what were the

4792
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:32,880
right like exactly exactly what were the
 

4793
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,149
right like exactly exactly what were the
harshness of the conditions

4794
01:43:35,149 --> 01:43:35,159
harshness of the conditions
 

4795
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:38,030
harshness of the conditions
um I still really suspicious what did

4796
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:38,040
um I still really suspicious what did
 

4797
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,430
um I still really suspicious what did
Homo sapiens do no no no I really want

4798
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:40,440
Homo sapiens do no no no I really want
 

4799
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,770
Homo sapiens do no no no I really want
to know no no I I'm Shady stuff that

4800
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:42,780
to know no no I I'm Shady stuff that
 

4801
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:44,930
to know no no I I'm Shady stuff that
happened yeah shitty stuff happened they

4802
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:44,940
happened yeah shitty stuff happened they
 

4803
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:47,570
happened yeah shitty stuff happened they
met they bred together they fought

4804
01:43:47,570 --> 01:43:47,580
met they bred together they fought
 

4805
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:48,830
met they bred together they fought
against each other

4806
01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:48,840
against each other
 

4807
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,990
against each other
what humans do you had to expect that

4808
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:51,000
what humans do you had to expect that
 

4809
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,530
what humans do you had to expect that
but the thing is that Neanderthal was

4810
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:54,540
but the thing is that Neanderthal was
 

4811
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:56,950
but the thing is that Neanderthal was
completely adapted for a very long time

4812
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:56,960
completely adapted for a very long time
 

4813
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,070
completely adapted for a very long time
to leave at the edge of those glaciers

4814
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:00,080
to leave at the edge of those glaciers
 

4815
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:03,729
to leave at the edge of those glaciers
there were probably in a weekend

4816
01:44:03,729 --> 01:44:03,739
there were probably in a weekend
 

4817
01:44:03,739 --> 01:44:07,310
there were probably in a weekend
situation when Homo sapiens came uh and

4818
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:07,320
situation when Homo sapiens came uh and
 

4819
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:10,490
situation when Homo sapiens came uh and
and started to spread so

4820
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:10,500
and started to spread so
 

4821
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:13,850
and started to spread so
um basically this is what life does it

4822
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:13,860
um basically this is what life does it
 

4823
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:15,590
um basically this is what life does it
adapts and if you cannot add apps

4824
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:15,600
adapts and if you cannot add apps
 

4825
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,030
adapts and if you cannot add apps
anymore it disappear and something else

4826
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:17,040
anymore it disappear and something else
 

4827
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,250
anymore it disappear and something else
takes over thank you

4828
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:19,260
takes over thank you
 

4829
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:21,830
takes over thank you
hold the women's world record for diving

4830
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:21,840
hold the women's world record for diving
 

4831
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,350
hold the women's world record for diving
at altitudes both scuba and freediving

4832
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:24,360
at altitudes both scuba and freediving
 

4833
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,350
at altitudes both scuba and freediving
so I have to ask what can you describe

4834
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,360
so I have to ask what can you describe
 

4835
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,689
so I have to ask what can you describe
the details of those records I never

4836
01:44:29,689 --> 01:44:29,699
the details of those records I never
 

4837
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:32,930
the details of those records I never
looked for those I I'm not after records

4838
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:32,940
looked for those I I'm not after records
 

4839
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,910
looked for those I I'm not after records
at all in fact I didn't know I had

4840
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:34,920
at all in fact I didn't know I had
 

4841
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,850
at all in fact I didn't know I had
broken those records when that happened

4842
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:37,860
broken those records when that happened
 

4843
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:40,250
broken those records when that happened
um we did that as part of our Expedition

4844
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:40,260
um we did that as part of our Expedition
 

4845
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:42,350
um we did that as part of our Expedition
our scientific Expedition so it's

4846
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:42,360
our scientific Expedition so it's
 

4847
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,270
our scientific Expedition so it's
basically sport in the name of science

4848
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:44,280
basically sport in the name of science
 

4849
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:46,910
basically sport in the name of science
versus no it's science in the name of

4850
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:46,920
versus no it's science in the name of
 

4851
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,430
versus no it's science in the name of
Science and it's just a very physical

4852
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:49,440
Science and it's just a very physical
 

4853
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,410
Science and it's just a very physical
thing that you have to do so we train

4854
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:51,420
thing that you have to do so we train
 

4855
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:54,590
thing that you have to do so we train
ourselves like athletes yeah but to get

4856
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:54,600
ourselves like athletes yeah but to get
 

4857
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,750
ourselves like athletes yeah but to get
the job done to get the job done you're

4858
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:56,760
the job done to get the job done you're
 

4859
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:58,490
the job done to get the job done you're
holding your breath underwater for a

4860
01:44:58,490 --> 01:44:58,500
holding your breath underwater for a
 

4861
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,470
holding your breath underwater for a
very long time like with free diving

4862
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
very long time like with free diving
 

4863
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,570
very long time like with free diving
what what are we talking about do you do

4864
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:02,580
what what are we talking about do you do
 

4865
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:04,910
what what are we talking about do you do
you think in terms of time is there like

4866
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:04,920
you think in terms of time is there like
 

4867
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,790
you think in terms of time is there like
layers where you know through training

4868
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:07,800
layers where you know through training
 

4869
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,470
layers where you know through training
you're in a good place like I'm sure you

4870
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:09,480
you're in a good place like I'm sure you
 

4871
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,590
you're in a good place like I'm sure you
take time off and you get rusty right I

4872
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:12,600
take time off and you get rusty right I
 

4873
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,930
take time off and you get rusty right I
and I had I have not been diving in a

4874
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:14,940
and I had I have not been diving in a
 

4875
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:16,790
and I had I have not been diving in a
while so probably I need to go back to

4876
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:16,800
while so probably I need to go back to
 

4877
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,189
while so probably I need to go back to
you know the drawing board and at the

4878
01:45:19,189 --> 01:45:19,199
you know the drawing board and at the
 

4879
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,229
you know the drawing board and at the
bottom of the swimming pool but having

4880
01:45:21,229 --> 01:45:21,239
bottom of the swimming pool but having
 

4881
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:23,270
bottom of the swimming pool but having
training from the past I think you know

4882
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,280
training from the past I think you know
 

4883
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:26,090
training from the past I think you know
it will pick up much more faster than

4884
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:26,100
it will pick up much more faster than
 

4885
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,430
it will pick up much more faster than
um basically I would never have those

4886
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:28,440
um basically I would never have those
 

4887
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,649
um basically I would never have those
altitude that would never go over three

4888
01:45:30,649 --> 01:45:30,659
altitude that would never go over three
 

4889
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:33,770
altitude that would never go over three
minutes that would be suicidal so the

4890
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:33,780
minutes that would be suicidal so the
 

4891
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:35,870
minutes that would be suicidal so the
altitude is much tougher than the pool

4892
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:35,880
altitude is much tougher than the pool
 

4893
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,790
altitude is much tougher than the pool
back at ground level

4894
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:37,800
back at ground level
 

4895
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:40,970
back at ground level
it is but it's because when you come up

4896
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:40,980
it is but it's because when you come up
 

4897
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:43,310
it is but it's because when you come up
yeah that's not the going in the water

4898
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:43,320
yeah that's not the going in the water
 

4899
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:45,770
yeah that's not the going in the water
when I'm on the water I'm fine and if I

4900
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:45,780
when I'm on the water I'm fine and if I
 

4901
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:47,570
when I'm on the water I'm fine and if I
wanted I could stay longer but it

4902
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:47,580
wanted I could stay longer but it
 

4903
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,830
wanted I could stay longer but it
wouldn't be very wise

4904
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:50,840

 

4905
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,689

uh you've written about the history of

4906
01:45:53,689 --> 01:45:53,699
uh you've written about the history of
 

4907
01:45:53,699 --> 01:45:55,430
uh you've written about the history of
Life on Mars like you said you've kind

4908
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:55,440
Life on Mars like you said you've kind
 

4909
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,050
Life on Mars like you said you've kind
of exploring that by looking at the

4910
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:57,060
of exploring that by looking at the
 

4911
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:59,330
of exploring that by looking at the
Lakes here

4912
01:45:59,330 --> 01:45:59,340
Lakes here
 

4913
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:02,510
Lakes here
um do you think there's been Life on

4914
01:46:02,510 --> 01:46:02,520
um do you think there's been Life on
 

4915
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,729
um do you think there's been Life on
Mars do you think there is life on Mars

4916
01:46:04,729 --> 01:46:04,739
Mars do you think there is life on Mars
 

4917
01:46:04,739 --> 01:46:06,950
Mars do you think there is life on Mars
right so when you're looking at the

4918
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:06,960
right so when you're looking at the
 

4919
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,590
right so when you're looking at the
environment of Mars early on it's fairly

4920
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:09,600
environment of Mars early on it's fairly
 

4921
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:13,129
environment of Mars early on it's fairly
similar to that of early Earth never was

4922
01:46:13,129 --> 01:46:13,139
similar to that of early Earth never was
 

4923
01:46:13,139 --> 01:46:15,109
similar to that of early Earth never was
exactly the same because Mars was always

4924
01:46:15,109 --> 01:46:15,119
exactly the same because Mars was always
 

4925
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,270
exactly the same because Mars was always
father from the Sun uh than the earth

4926
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:17,280
father from the Sun uh than the earth
 

4927
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,669
father from the Sun uh than the earth
right so it was always a little cooler

4928
01:46:19,669 --> 01:46:19,679
right so it was always a little cooler
 

4929
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,330
right so it was always a little cooler
but you have to imagine maybe the Arctic

4930
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:23,340
but you have to imagine maybe the Arctic
 

4931
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,669
but you have to imagine maybe the Arctic
during the summer that would be early

4932
01:46:25,669 --> 01:46:25,679
during the summer that would be early
 

4933
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:28,850
during the summer that would be early
Mars with a lot going on for it in terms

4934
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:28,860
Mars with a lot going on for it in terms
 

4935
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:31,910
Mars with a lot going on for it in terms
of environment very favorable to even

4936
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:31,920
of environment very favorable to even
 

4937
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,490
of environment very favorable to even
Life as we know it so

4938
01:46:34,490 --> 01:46:34,500
Life as we know it so
 

4939
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:38,209
Life as we know it so
we don't know how fast life

4940
01:46:38,209 --> 01:46:38,219
we don't know how fast life
 

4941
01:46:38,219 --> 01:46:41,629
we don't know how fast life
happen on Earth they are signs right now

4942
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:41,639
happen on Earth they are signs right now
 

4943
01:46:41,639 --> 01:46:43,550
happen on Earth they are signs right now
showing that it might have actually

4944
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:43,560
showing that it might have actually
 

4945
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,950
showing that it might have actually
originated only 200 million years after

4946
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:45,960
originated only 200 million years after
 

4947
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:49,430
originated only 200 million years after
the crust cooled down yeah uh this still

4948
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:49,440
the crust cooled down yeah uh this still
 

4949
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,109
the crust cooled down yeah uh this still
has to be verified but that that's the

4950
01:46:51,109 --> 01:46:51,119
has to be verified but that that's the
 

4951
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:52,910
has to be verified but that that's the
closest and these are indirect evidence

4952
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:52,920
closest and these are indirect evidence
 

4953
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:53,870
closest and these are indirect evidence
like

4954
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:53,880
like
 

4955
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,689
like
carbon left by the activity of life not

4956
01:46:56,689 --> 01:46:56,699
carbon left by the activity of life not
 

4957
01:46:56,699 --> 01:46:59,209
carbon left by the activity of life not
life itself and there is a Twist in the

4958
01:46:59,209 --> 01:46:59,219
life itself and there is a Twist in the
 

4959
01:46:59,219 --> 01:47:03,109
life itself and there is a Twist in the
story for Mars is that it seems that

4960
01:47:03,109 --> 01:47:03,119
story for Mars is that it seems that
 

4961
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:06,229
story for Mars is that it seems that
Mars came together as a planet faster

4962
01:47:06,229 --> 01:47:06,239
Mars came together as a planet faster
 

4963
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:09,649
Mars came together as a planet faster
than the earth and had water earlier

4964
01:47:09,649 --> 01:47:09,659
than the earth and had water earlier
 

4965
01:47:09,659 --> 01:47:11,590
than the earth and had water earlier
than the earth

4966
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:11,600
than the earth
 

4967
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:16,129
than the earth
so it may be that Mars was habitable and

4968
01:47:16,129 --> 01:47:16,139
so it may be that Mars was habitable and
 

4969
01:47:16,139 --> 01:47:19,850
so it may be that Mars was habitable and
might have seen the beginning of Life

4970
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:19,860
might have seen the beginning of Life
 

4971
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:22,390
might have seen the beginning of Life
earlier than the Earth

4972
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:22,400
earlier than the Earth
 

4973
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,129
earlier than the Earth
so all of this is speculation obviously

4974
01:47:25,129 --> 01:47:25,139
so all of this is speculation obviously
 

4975
01:47:25,139 --> 01:47:28,609
so all of this is speculation obviously
we haven't found any evidence or solid

4976
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:28,619
we haven't found any evidence or solid
 

4977
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:31,370
we haven't found any evidence or solid
evidence yet I would say unambiguous

4978
01:47:31,370 --> 01:47:31,380
evidence yet I would say unambiguous
 

4979
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:34,189
evidence yet I would say unambiguous
evidence but unambiguous evidence of

4980
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:34,199
evidence but unambiguous evidence of
 

4981
01:47:34,199 --> 01:47:37,310
evidence but unambiguous evidence of
life is going to be something uh

4982
01:47:37,310 --> 01:47:37,320
life is going to be something uh
 

4983
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,410
life is going to be something uh
interesting to prove because we don't

4984
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:39,420
interesting to prove because we don't
 

4985
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:41,510
interesting to prove because we don't
know what life is remember so I always

4986
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,520
know what life is remember so I always
 

4987
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,370
know what life is remember so I always
joke that the only way we would know

4988
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:43,380
joke that the only way we would know
 

4989
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,930
joke that the only way we would know
that there is life on Mars if there was

4990
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:44,940
that there is life on Mars if there was
 

4991
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,790
that there is life on Mars if there was
a rabbit jumping in front of the of the

4992
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:46,800
a rabbit jumping in front of the of the
 

4993
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,629
a rabbit jumping in front of the of the
Rover but we might be you know Gathering

4994
01:47:50,629 --> 01:47:50,639
Rover but we might be you know Gathering
 

4995
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:53,030
Rover but we might be you know Gathering
we have what we call a ladder of Life

4996
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:53,040
we have what we call a ladder of Life
 

4997
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,669
we have what we call a ladder of Life
detection which is that you have a

4998
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:55,679
detection which is that you have a
 

4999
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:58,669
detection which is that you have a
series of uh rungs that you know you

5000
01:47:58,669 --> 01:47:58,679
series of uh rungs that you know you
 

5001
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:00,109
series of uh rungs that you know you
need to go through

5002
01:48:00,109 --> 01:48:00,119
need to go through
 

5003
01:48:00,119 --> 01:48:03,770
need to go through
that actually are not proving you that

5004
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:03,780
that actually are not proving you that
 

5005
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:08,510
that actually are not proving you that
you've discovered life but are making

5006
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:08,520
you've discovered life but are making
 

5007
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,850
you've discovered life but are making
um the possibility that what you

5008
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:10,860
um the possibility that what you
 

5009
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,790
um the possibility that what you
discovered was made only by the

5010
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:13,800
discovered was made only by the
 

5011
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,790
discovered was made only by the
environment more and more and probable

5012
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:16,800
environment more and more and probable
 

5013
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,649
environment more and more and probable
so we are trying to prove the contrary

5014
01:48:18,649 --> 01:48:18,659
so we are trying to prove the contrary
 

5015
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:21,609
so we are trying to prove the contrary
right so this is what we have right now

5016
01:48:21,609 --> 01:48:21,619
right so this is what we have right now
 

5017
01:48:21,619 --> 01:48:24,590
right so this is what we have right now
and as far as I'm concerned

5018
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:24,600
and as far as I'm concerned
 

5019
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,870
and as far as I'm concerned
continuing all the unknowns we have I

5020
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:26,880
continuing all the unknowns we have I
 

5021
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,750
continuing all the unknowns we have I
think there was as much chance that life

5022
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:29,760
think there was as much chance that life
 

5023
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,790
think there was as much chance that life
originated on Mars that they did on

5024
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:31,800
originated on Mars that they did on
 

5025
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,070
originated on Mars that they did on
Earth and

5026
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:34,080
Earth and
 

5027
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,189
Earth and
um if it was at the surface then it got

5028
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:37,199
um if it was at the surface then it got
 

5029
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:40,010
um if it was at the surface then it got
in trouble after 500 million years

5030
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:40,020
in trouble after 500 million years
 

5031
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:42,530
in trouble after 500 million years
because of The Disappearance of the

5032
01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:42,540
because of The Disappearance of the
 

5033
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:43,729
because of The Disappearance of the
magnetosphere the loss of the

5034
01:48:43,729 --> 01:48:43,739
magnetosphere the loss of the
 

5035
01:48:43,739 --> 01:48:45,649
magnetosphere the loss of the
magnetosphere and the atmosphere but as

5036
01:48:45,649 --> 01:48:45,659
magnetosphere and the atmosphere but as
 

5037
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:49,910
magnetosphere and the atmosphere but as
we know you know life doesn't only

5038
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:49,920
we know you know life doesn't only
 

5039
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,729
we know you know life doesn't only
stay in one place as soon as it's out

5040
01:48:52,729 --> 01:48:52,739
stay in one place as soon as it's out
 

5041
01:48:52,739 --> 01:48:55,129
stay in one place as soon as it's out
there it's going to adapt it's going to

5042
01:48:55,129 --> 01:48:55,139
there it's going to adapt it's going to
 

5043
01:48:55,139 --> 01:48:56,990
there it's going to adapt it's going to
give itself more chance

5044
01:48:56,990 --> 01:48:57,000
give itself more chance
 

5045
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,830
give itself more chance
to survive and that to me means that if

5046
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:00,840
to survive and that to me means that if
 

5047
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,129
to survive and that to me means that if
life appeared I would say

5048
01:49:04,129 --> 01:49:04,139
life appeared I would say
 

5049
01:49:04,139 --> 01:49:06,770
life appeared I would say
it's still there and probably on the

5050
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:06,780
it's still there and probably on the
 

5051
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:09,169
it's still there and probably on the
ground where it can be you know in an

5052
01:49:09,169 --> 01:49:09,179
ground where it can be you know in an
 

5053
01:49:09,179 --> 01:49:10,729
ground where it can be you know in an
environment that's more stable so I

5054
01:49:10,729 --> 01:49:10,739
environment that's more stable so I
 

5055
01:49:10,739 --> 01:49:13,129
environment that's more stable so I
don't know how stability is good or not

5056
01:49:13,129 --> 01:49:13,139
don't know how stability is good or not
 

5057
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:15,290
don't know how stability is good or not
it might not be so good but they might

5058
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:15,300
it might not be so good but they might
 

5059
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:16,850
it might not be so good but they might
be in a different type of metabolism

5060
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:16,860
be in a different type of metabolism
 

5061
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:19,370
be in a different type of metabolism
through dormancy you know waiting for

5062
01:49:19,370 --> 01:49:19,380
through dormancy you know waiting for
 

5063
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:22,129
through dormancy you know waiting for
different climate cycles and there is

5064
01:49:22,129 --> 01:49:22,139
different climate cycles and there is
 

5065
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:25,129
different climate cycles and there is
the fact that Mars changes but it's

5066
01:49:25,129 --> 01:49:25,139
the fact that Mars changes but it's
 

5067
01:49:25,139 --> 01:49:26,629
the fact that Mars changes but it's
faster

5068
01:49:26,629 --> 01:49:26,639
faster
 

5069
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:29,990
faster
than the earth and climate changes are a

5070
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
than the earth and climate changes are a
 

5071
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,990
than the earth and climate changes are a
lot stronger in magnitude so there might

5072
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:33,000
lot stronger in magnitude so there might
 

5073
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,850
lot stronger in magnitude so there might
be a place on Mars we know that there is

5074
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:34,860
be a place on Mars we know that there is
 

5075
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,729
be a place on Mars we know that there is
a place on Mars deeper in the subsurface

5076
01:49:37,729 --> 01:49:37,739
a place on Mars deeper in the subsurface
 

5077
01:49:37,739 --> 01:49:40,070
a place on Mars deeper in the subsurface
where temperature and pressure are good

5078
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,080
where temperature and pressure are good
 

5079
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,530
where temperature and pressure are good
for liquid water to stay there so these

5080
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:42,540
for liquid water to stay there so these
 

5081
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,030
for liquid water to stay there so these
would be good places for a stable

5082
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:44,040
would be good places for a stable
 

5083
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,010
would be good places for a stable
habitat over time no matter what happens

5084
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:46,020
habitat over time no matter what happens
 

5085
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,570
habitat over time no matter what happens
at the surface

5086
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:47,580
at the surface
 

5087
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:52,970
at the surface
but if uh life is also caught

5088
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:52,980
but if uh life is also caught
 

5089
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:56,450
but if uh life is also caught
between that deep Zone and the surface

5090
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:56,460
between that deep Zone and the surface
 

5091
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:59,090
between that deep Zone and the surface
there is an active layer there is a lot

5092
01:49:59,090 --> 01:49:59,100
there is an active layer there is a lot
 

5093
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:01,490
there is an active layer there is a lot
of ice in the subsurface of Mars and

5094
01:50:01,490 --> 01:50:01,500
of ice in the subsurface of Mars and
 

5095
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,250
of ice in the subsurface of Mars and
when the climate changes when the

5096
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:04,260
when the climate changes when the
 

5097
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:07,850
when the climate changes when the
obliquity goes beyond 30 degrees then at

5098
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:07,860
obliquity goes beyond 30 degrees then at
 

5099
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:11,090
obliquity goes beyond 30 degrees then at
that point you will have some activation

5100
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:11,100
that point you will have some activation
 

5101
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:14,209
that point you will have some activation
of that zone you have following of the

5102
01:50:14,209 --> 01:50:14,219
of that zone you have following of the
 

5103
01:50:14,219 --> 01:50:17,390
of that zone you have following of the
eyes so all this region is reactivated

5104
01:50:17,390 --> 01:50:17,400
eyes so all this region is reactivated
 

5105
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:21,010
eyes so all this region is reactivated
and maybe that's a way where you have

5106
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:21,020
and maybe that's a way where you have
 

5107
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:24,169
and maybe that's a way where you have
Pathways for life to move from the deep

5108
01:50:24,169 --> 01:50:24,179
Pathways for life to move from the deep
 

5109
01:50:24,179 --> 01:50:27,109
Pathways for life to move from the deep
Zone to closer to the surface this is

5110
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:27,119
Zone to closer to the surface this is
 

5111
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:29,450
Zone to closer to the surface this is
why I am one of those scientists who

5112
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:29,460
why I am one of those scientists who
 

5113
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:33,109
why I am one of those scientists who
thinks that life might not be so far

5114
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
thinks that life might not be so far
 

5115
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,689
thinks that life might not be so far
from the surface than we think

5116
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:35,699
from the surface than we think
 

5117
01:50:35,699 --> 01:50:38,270
from the surface than we think
so we don't have to dig very far to find

5118
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:38,280
so we don't have to dig very far to find
 

5119
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,850
so we don't have to dig very far to find
it we probably won't and the reason I'm

5120
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:40,860
it we probably won't and the reason I'm
 

5121
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:43,550
it we probably won't and the reason I'm
not so amazing I I'm thinking of that

5122
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:43,560
not so amazing I I'm thinking of that
 

5123
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,770
not so amazing I I'm thinking of that
just because of this experience as well

5124
01:50:45,770 --> 01:50:45,780
just because of this experience as well
 

5125
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:48,590
just because of this experience as well
of extreme environments you know you

5126
01:50:48,590 --> 01:50:48,600
of extreme environments you know you
 

5127
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,050
of extreme environments you know you
have to sit and look and listen

5128
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:51,060
have to sit and look and listen
 

5129
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:53,870
have to sit and look and listen
basically the story of my life if I want

5130
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:53,880
basically the story of my life if I want
 

5131
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,669
basically the story of my life if I want
to understand where microbes are located

5132
01:50:55,669 --> 01:50:55,679
to understand where microbes are located
 

5133
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,070
to understand where microbes are located
on Mars I have to become the microbe

5134
01:50:58,070 --> 01:50:58,080
on Mars I have to become the microbe
 

5135
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,350
on Mars I have to become the microbe
right this is the thought experiment and

5136
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:00,360
right this is the thought experiment and
 

5137
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,750
right this is the thought experiment and
if I want to understand where ET is yeah

5138
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:02,760
if I want to understand where ET is yeah
 

5139
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,030
if I want to understand where ET is yeah
then I have to become ET so it's a big

5140
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:05,040
then I have to become ET so it's a big
 

5141
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,510
then I have to become ET so it's a big
stretch but in extreme environment you

5142
01:51:08,510 --> 01:51:08,520
stretch but in extreme environment you
 

5143
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,750
stretch but in extreme environment you
sit in the desert for a while and you

5144
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:11,760
sit in the desert for a while and you
 

5145
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,330
sit in the desert for a while and you
just you know try to understand

5146
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:14,340
just you know try to understand
 

5147
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:16,550
just you know try to understand
where the wind's coming from where the

5148
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:16,560
where the wind's coming from where the
 

5149
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,350
where the wind's coming from where the
humidity when it's showing up and then

5150
01:51:18,350 --> 01:51:18,360
humidity when it's showing up and then
 

5151
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:19,910
humidity when it's showing up and then
you start to understand the patterns of

5152
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:19,920
you start to understand the patterns of
 

5153
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,609
you start to understand the patterns of
those things what are the useful signals

5154
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:22,619
those things what are the useful signals
 

5155
01:51:22,619 --> 01:51:25,129
those things what are the useful signals
that you need for survival you need to

5156
01:51:25,129 --> 01:51:25,139
that you need for survival you need to
 

5157
01:51:25,139 --> 01:51:27,050
that you need for survival you need to
know where water is where the source of

5158
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:27,060
know where water is where the source of
 

5159
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:29,810
know where water is where the source of
energy is going to be uh drawn from you

5160
01:51:29,810 --> 01:51:29,820
energy is going to be uh drawn from you
 

5161
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,090
energy is going to be uh drawn from you
need to find shelters and shelters don't

5162
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:32,100
need to find shelters and shelters don't
 

5163
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:34,010
need to find shelters and shelters don't
mean that for instance you can have a

5164
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:34,020
mean that for instance you can have a
 

5165
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,530
mean that for instance you can have a
water column of a lake or a river or

5166
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:36,540
water column of a lake or a river or
 

5167
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:40,250
water column of a lake or a river or
whatnot or the ocean it can be also a

5168
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:40,260
whatnot or the ocean it can be also a
 

5169
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:44,990
whatnot or the ocean it can be also a
very thin layer of dust or it can be a

5170
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:45,000
very thin layer of dust or it can be a
 

5171
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,850
very thin layer of dust or it can be a
translucent Rock

5172
01:51:46,850 --> 01:51:46,860
translucent Rock
 

5173
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:49,490
translucent Rock
and you see what we call endless these

5174
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:49,500
and you see what we call endless these
 

5175
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:51,350
and you see what we call endless these
are the same cyanobacteria but the

5176
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:51,360
are the same cyanobacteria but the
 

5177
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,209
are the same cyanobacteria but the
different version of them they live

5178
01:51:53,209 --> 01:51:53,219
different version of them they live
 

5179
01:51:53,219 --> 01:51:55,370
different version of them they live
inside the Rocks inside those crystals

5180
01:51:55,370 --> 01:51:55,380
inside the Rocks inside those crystals
 

5181
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:58,370
inside the Rocks inside those crystals
because they have the best of Life they

5182
01:51:58,370 --> 01:51:58,380
because they have the best of Life they
 

5183
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:03,169
because they have the best of Life they
are into translucent crystals so that

5184
01:52:03,169 --> 01:52:03,179
are into translucent crystals so that
 

5185
01:52:03,179 --> 01:52:05,270
are into translucent crystals so that
they receive the light from the sun they

5186
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:05,280
they receive the light from the sun they
 

5187
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,310
they receive the light from the sun they
can do the photosynthesis

5188
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:07,320
can do the photosynthesis
 

5189
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:11,030
can do the photosynthesis
but there is enough of that Crystal so

5190
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,040
but there is enough of that Crystal so
 

5191
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:14,330
but there is enough of that Crystal so
that the nasty UV is being stopped

5192
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:14,340
that the nasty UV is being stopped
 

5193
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:19,030
that the nasty UV is being stopped
and they are in their little house

5194
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,040
and they are in their little house
 

5195
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:22,250
and they are in their little house
and um when you are looking at the

5196
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:22,260
and um when you are looking at the
 

5197
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:24,649
and um when you are looking at the
temperature within those rocks they tend

5198
01:52:24,649 --> 01:52:24,659
temperature within those rocks they tend
 

5199
01:52:24,659 --> 01:52:26,570
temperature within those rocks they tend
to make it toastier than the outside

5200
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:26,580
to make it toastier than the outside
 

5201
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:28,609
to make it toastier than the outside
temperature so there is a lot of thing

5202
01:52:28,609 --> 01:52:28,619
temperature so there is a lot of thing
 

5203
01:52:28,619 --> 01:52:30,169
temperature so there is a lot of thing
going on

5204
01:52:30,169 --> 01:52:30,179
going on
 

5205
01:52:30,179 --> 01:52:33,350
going on
um so what I'm saying for Mars is that

5206
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:33,360
um so what I'm saying for Mars is that
 

5207
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,390
um so what I'm saying for Mars is that
yeah right now you don't have an

5208
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:35,400
yeah right now you don't have an
 

5209
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,970
yeah right now you don't have an
atmosphere very much 160 times thinner

5210
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:37,980
atmosphere very much 160 times thinner
 

5211
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,250
atmosphere very much 160 times thinner
than the earth six midi bar is really

5212
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:40,260
than the earth six midi bar is really
 

5213
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:43,129
than the earth six midi bar is really
not much but it's there

5214
01:52:43,129 --> 01:52:43,139
not much but it's there
 

5215
01:52:43,139 --> 01:52:45,830
not much but it's there
um but you still have a lot of UV the

5216
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:45,840
um but you still have a lot of UV the
 

5217
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,250
um but you still have a lot of UV the
short UV like the nasty one UVA UVB UVC

5218
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:49,260
short UV like the nasty one UVA UVB UVC
 

5219
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:52,669
short UV like the nasty one UVA UVB UVC
that can really mess up your DNA uh and

5220
01:52:52,669 --> 01:52:52,679
that can really mess up your DNA uh and
 

5221
01:52:52,679 --> 01:52:54,649
that can really mess up your DNA uh and
and destroy it Beyond repair

5222
01:52:54,649 --> 01:52:54,659
and destroy it Beyond repair
 

5223
01:52:54,659 --> 01:52:58,070
and destroy it Beyond repair
but as soon as you have a little alcove

5224
01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:58,080
but as soon as you have a little alcove
 

5225
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,189
but as soon as you have a little alcove
into a rock or a cliff

5226
01:53:01,189 --> 01:53:01,199
into a rock or a cliff
 

5227
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,450
into a rock or a cliff
you know

5228
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:02,460
you know
 

5229
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:04,910
you know
I'd be looking at those places but you

5230
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:04,920
I'd be looking at those places but you
 

5231
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,830
I'd be looking at those places but you
have to understand Mars or any other

5232
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:06,840
have to understand Mars or any other
 

5233
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:09,530
have to understand Mars or any other
planet for that matter at the level that

5234
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:09,540
planet for that matter at the level that
 

5235
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:11,930
planet for that matter at the level that
matters for the microbe

5236
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:11,940
matters for the microbe
 

5237
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:15,530
matters for the microbe
and is so then maybe one with the

5238
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:15,540
and is so then maybe one with the
 

5239
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:18,229
and is so then maybe one with the
microbe one with the microbes which

5240
01:53:18,229 --> 01:53:18,239
microbe one with the microbes which
 

5241
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:20,870
microbe one with the microbes which
means that we have lots of orbital data

5242
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:20,880
means that we have lots of orbital data
 

5243
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,149
means that we have lots of orbital data
which is good to understand habitability

5244
01:53:23,149 --> 01:53:23,159
which is good to understand habitability
 

5245
01:53:23,159 --> 01:53:25,189
which is good to understand habitability
at the planet level or at the regional

5246
01:53:25,189 --> 01:53:25,199
at the planet level or at the regional
 

5247
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:26,530
at the planet level or at the regional
level

5248
01:53:26,530 --> 01:53:26,540
level
 

5249
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:29,689
level
but we have very little data right now

5250
01:53:29,689 --> 01:53:29,699
but we have very little data right now
 

5251
01:53:29,699 --> 01:53:31,310
but we have very little data right now
that is very useful to understand

5252
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:31,320
that is very useful to understand
 

5253
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:32,990
that is very useful to understand
habitability

5254
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:33,000
habitability
 

5255
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,570
habitability
uh at the scale that matters for the

5256
01:53:35,570 --> 01:53:35,580
uh at the scale that matters for the
 

5257
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:37,910
uh at the scale that matters for the
microbes at this point in time so we

5258
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:37,920
microbes at this point in time so we
 

5259
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,129
microbes at this point in time so we
need to uh to do a better job with that

5260
01:53:40,129 --> 01:53:40,139
need to uh to do a better job with that
 

5261
01:53:40,139 --> 01:53:44,030
need to uh to do a better job with that
my ideas uh is to you know have arrays

5262
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:44,040
my ideas uh is to you know have arrays
 

5263
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,430
my ideas uh is to you know have arrays
of environmental station that could have

5264
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:46,440
of environmental station that could have
 

5265
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,709
of environmental station that could have
a lot of benefits one would be to give

5266
01:53:48,709 --> 01:53:48,719
a lot of benefits one would be to give
 

5267
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:52,189
a lot of benefits one would be to give
us that Vision at for the microbes that

5268
01:53:52,189 --> 01:53:52,199
us that Vision at for the microbes that
 

5269
01:53:52,199 --> 01:53:53,990
us that Vision at for the microbes that
would be good for us through biology

5270
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:54,000
would be good for us through biology
 

5271
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,109
would be good for us through biology
and second a collection of stations on

5272
01:53:57,109 --> 01:53:57,119
and second a collection of stations on
 

5273
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:00,290
and second a collection of stations on
Mars on Mars yeah that give us a good

5274
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:00,300
Mars on Mars yeah that give us a good
 

5275
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:03,290
Mars on Mars yeah that give us a good
map yeah high resolution we can do that

5276
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:03,300
map yeah high resolution we can do that
 

5277
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,570
map yeah high resolution we can do that
originally and on top of that so that's

5278
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:05,580
originally and on top of that so that's
 

5279
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:07,250
originally and on top of that so that's
good for us through biology for the

5280
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:07,260
good for us through biology for the
 

5281
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:09,169
good for us through biology for the
search for Life on Mars that's good

5282
01:54:09,169 --> 01:54:09,179
search for Life on Mars that's good
 

5283
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:11,870
search for Life on Mars that's good
about how to learn where microbes could

5284
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:11,880
about how to learn where microbes could
 

5285
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,970
about how to learn where microbes could
be that can be a problem for

5286
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:13,980
be that can be a problem for
 

5287
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:17,030
be that can be a problem for
contamination both ways so that's good

5288
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:17,040
contamination both ways so that's good
 

5289
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:20,750
contamination both ways so that's good
for planetary protection and since those

5290
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:20,760
for planetary protection and since those
 

5291
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,050
for planetary protection and since those
stations would have communication

5292
01:54:23,050 --> 01:54:23,060
stations would have communication
 

5293
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:26,270
stations would have communication
capabilities on them that excellent for

5294
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:26,280
capabilities on them that excellent for
 

5295
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,669
capabilities on them that excellent for
human exploration because normally you

5296
01:54:28,669 --> 01:54:28,679
human exploration because normally you
 

5297
01:54:28,679 --> 01:54:30,830
human exploration because normally you
have weather stations all over the place

5298
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:30,840
have weather stations all over the place
 

5299
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,750
have weather stations all over the place
that can tell your astronauts you know

5300
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:32,760
that can tell your astronauts you know
 

5301
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,910
that can tell your astronauts you know
learn the pattern when it's a good time

5302
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:34,920
learn the pattern when it's a good time
 

5303

01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:42,840
do sorties so there are a number of
 

5309
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,410

01:54:45,410 --> 01:54:45,420
things we can do that can tell you lots
 

5311
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:47,930

so how did the challenging early years

5324
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:02,580
so how did the challenging early years
 

5325
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:04,729
so how did the challenging early years
make the human being the scientist they

everything I think that

5330
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:09,480
everything I think that
 

5331
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,430
everything I think that
um

5332
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:10,440
um
 

5333
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,290
um
this is what's taking me on top of those

5334
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:12,300
this is what's taking me on top of those
 

5335
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:14,149
this is what's taking me on top of those
big mountains

5336
01:55:14,149 --> 01:55:14,159
big mountains
 

5337
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:17,390
big mountains
and the irony is for me to be looking

5338
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:17,400
and the irony is for me to be looking
 

5339
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:20,209
and the irony is for me to be looking
for the origin and nature of life

5340
01:55:20,209 --> 01:55:20,219
for the origin and nature of life
 

5341
01:55:20,219 --> 01:55:22,970
for the origin and nature of life
because I was so close to losing it but

5342
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:22,980
because I was so close to losing it but
 

5343
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:26,410
because I was so close to losing it but
to me that was a great lesson learned

5344
01:55:26,410 --> 01:55:26,420
to me that was a great lesson learned
 

5345
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:30,649
to me that was a great lesson learned
and that helped me see through the

5346
01:55:30,649 --> 01:55:30,659
and that helped me see through the
 

5347
01:55:30,659 --> 01:55:32,030
and that helped me see through the
beauty of life

5348
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:32,040
beauty of life
 

5349
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,970
beauty of life
and going on the other side of that it

5350
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:34,980
and going on the other side of that it
 

5351
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:39,050
and going on the other side of that it
became really what made me and helped me

5352
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:39,060
became really what made me and helped me
 

5353
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:41,330
became really what made me and helped me
go through absolutely everything and

5354
01:55:41,330 --> 01:55:41,340
go through absolutely everything and
 

5355
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,770
go through absolutely everything and
anything in life

5356
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:42,780
anything in life
 

5357
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:45,950

that doesn't run spacecrafts of course
 

5643
02:01:48,599 --> 02:01:50,570
that doesn't run spacecrafts of course
but

5644

02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:30,410
be working on Yusuf Creator and deciding
for the landing side of the spirit rover

5676
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:30,420
for the landing side of the spirit rover
 

5677
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:32,390
for the landing side of the spirit rover
which means that I worked on on that

5678
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:32,400
which means that I worked on on that
 

5679
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,250
which means that I worked on on that
Landing site for 15 years and I got to

5680
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:34,260
Landing site for 15 years and I got to
 

5681
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:36,649
Landing site for 15 years and I got to
see it from the ground that's the

5682
02:02:36,649 --> 02:02:36,659
see it from the ground that's the
 

5683
02:02:36,659 --> 02:02:38,930
see it from the ground that's the
closest you know to being there and

5684
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:38,940
closest you know to being there and
 

5685
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:40,370
closest you know to being there and
exploring of course that's not

5686
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:40,380
exploring of course that's not
 

5687
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:43,310
exploring of course that's not
physically be present there

5688
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:43,320
physically be present there
 

5689
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:45,830
physically be present there
um if you were giving me the opportunity

5690
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:45,840

I would want to come back
 

5697
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:54,290
I would want to come back
so given the option

5698
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:54,300
so given the option
 

5699
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:56,629
so given the option
of dying on Mars

5700
02:02:56,629 --> 02:02:56,639
of dying on Mars
 

5701
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:00,290
of dying on Mars
or dying on Earth you'd visit Mars but

5702
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:00,300
or dying on Earth you'd visit Mars but
 

5703
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:02,149
or dying on Earth you'd visit Mars but
you would like to spend your last days

5704
02:03:02,149 --> 02:03:02,159
you would like to spend your last days
 

5705
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:05,510
you would like to spend your last days
here yeah because of a number of things

02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:07,250
here yeah because of a number of things
I think that

5708
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:07,260
I think that
 

5709
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:09,370
I think that
first we are not ready to sit on Mars

5710
02:03:09,370 --> 02:03:09,380
first we are not ready to sit on Mars
 

5711
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:12,830
first we are not ready to sit on Mars
regardless of what being said it's it

5712
02:03:12,830 --> 02:03:12,840
regardless of what being said it's it
 

5713
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,750
regardless of what being said it's it
will happen it will happen and because

02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
Explorers so this will happen and it's a
 

5719
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:22,189
Explorers so this will happen and it's a
good thing depending on how we go about

5720
02:03:22,189 --> 02:03:22,199
good thing depending on how we go about
 

5721
02:03:22,199 --> 02:03:24,589
