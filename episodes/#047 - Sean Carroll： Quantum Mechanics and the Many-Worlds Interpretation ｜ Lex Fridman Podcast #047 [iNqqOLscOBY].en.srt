376
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:13,600
quantum field theory so our intuitions
 

377
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,360
quantum field theory so our intuitions
aren't perfect but I think it's also

aren't perfect but I think it's also

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,310
aren't perfect but I think it's also
okay to say that our intuitions get

okay to say that our intuitions get

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,960
okay to say that our intuitions get
trained right like you know I have

382
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:18,970
trained right like you know I have
 

383
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,340
trained right like you know I have
different intuitions now that I had when

391
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,500
to who we are we can we can train it a
little bit so that's where I'm gonna

392
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:28,510
little bit so that's where I'm gonna
 

393
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,530
little bit so that's where I'm gonna
bring in norm Chomsky for a second who

thinks that our cognitive abilities are
 

397
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,470
thinks that our cognitive abilities are
sort of evolved through time and so

398
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:37,480
sort of evolved through time and so
 

399
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,390
sort of evolved through time and so
they're they're biologically constrained

400

they're they're biologically constrained
 

401
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,410
they're they're biologically constrained
and so there's a clear limit as he puts

402
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:43,420
and so there's a clear limit as he puts
 

403
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,300
and so there's a clear limit as he puts
it to our cognitive abilities and it's a

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,310
it to our cognitive abilities and it's a
 

405
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,970
it to our cognitive abilities and it's a
very harsh limit but you actually kind

very harsh limit but you actually kind

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,069
course there's a human you would say
that doesn't feel to be limits to our

484
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:20,079
that doesn't feel to be limits to our
 

485
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,750
that doesn't feel to be limits to our
understanding but sort of hey have you

486
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:24,760
understanding but sort of hey have you
 

487
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,500
understanding but sort of hey have you
thought that the universe is actually a

488
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,510
thought that the universe is actually a
 

489
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,199
thought that the universe is actually a
lot simpler than it appears to us and we

490
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:31,209
lot simpler than it appears to us and we
 

491
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,850
lot simpler than it appears to us and we
just will never be able to like it's

492
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:32,860
just will never be able to like it's
 

493
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,680
just will never be able to like it's
outside of our okay so us our cognitive

494
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:37,690
outside of our okay so us our cognitive
 

495
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,990
outside of our okay so us our cognitive
abilities combined with our mathematical

496
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
abilities combined with our mathematical
 

497
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,380
abilities combined with our mathematical
prowess and whatever kind of

498
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,390
prowess and whatever kind of
 

499
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,389
prowess and whatever kind of
experimental simulation devices we can

500
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:45,399
experimental simulation devices we can
 

501
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,220
experimental simulation devices we can
put together is there limits to that is

502
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,230
put together is there limits to that is
 

503
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,260
put together is there limits to that is
is it possible there's limits to that

504
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,270
is it possible there's limits to that
 

505
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,699
is it possible there's limits to that
well of course it's possible there is or

506
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:56,709
well of course it's possible there is or
 

507
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,889
well of course it's possible there is or
is there any good reason to think that

508
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:58,899
is there any good reason to think that
 

509
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,100
is there any good reason to think that
we're anywhere close to the limits is a

510
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,110
we're anywhere close to the limits is a
 

511
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,199
we're anywhere close to the limits is a
harder question look imagine asking this

512
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:04,209
harder question look imagine asking this
 

513
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:06,150
harder question look imagine asking this
question 500 years ago to the world's

514
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
question 500 years ago to the world's
 

515
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,069
question 500 years ago to the world's
greatest thinkers right like are we

516
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
greatest thinkers right like are we
 

517
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,870
greatest thinkers right like are we
approaching the limits of our ability to

518
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:09,880
approaching the limits of our ability to
 

519
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,960
approaching the limits of our ability to
understand the natural world and by

520
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:12,970
understand the natural world and by
 

521
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,030
understand the natural world and by
definition there are questions about the

522
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
definition there are questions about the
 

523
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,980
definition there are questions about the
natural world that are most interesting

524
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:16,990
natural world that are most interesting
 

525
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,620
natural world that are most interesting
to us that are the ones we

526
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:18,630
to us that are the ones we
 

527
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,090
to us that are the ones we
but yet understand right so there's

528
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,100
but yet understand right so there's
 

529
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,530
but yet understand right so there's
always we're always faced with these

530
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:21,540
always we're always faced with these
 

531
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,449
always we're always faced with these
puzzles we don't yet know and I don't

532
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:23,459
puzzles we don't yet know and I don't
 

533
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,439
puzzles we don't yet know and I don't
know what they would have said five

534
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:24,449
know what they would have said five
 

535
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,730
know what they would have said five
hundred years ago but they didn't even

536
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:25,740
hundred years ago but they didn't even
 

537
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,710
hundred years ago but they didn't even
know about classical mechanics much less

538
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:27,720
know about classical mechanics much less
 

539
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,559
know about classical mechanics much less
quantum mechanics so we know that they

540
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:30,569
quantum mechanics so we know that they
 

541
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,150
quantum mechanics so we know that they
were nowhere close to how well they

542
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
were nowhere close to how well they
 

543
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,460
were nowhere close to how well they
could do right they could do normally

544
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:34,470
could do right they could do normally
 

545
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,569
could do right they could do normally
better than they were doing at the time

546
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:35,579
better than they were doing at the time
 

547
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:38,120
better than they were doing at the time
I see no reason why the same thing isn't

548
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,130
I see no reason why the same thing isn't
 

549
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,430
I see no reason why the same thing isn't
true for us today so of all the worries

550
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,440
true for us today so of all the worries
 

551
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,559
true for us today so of all the worries
that keep me awake at night the human

552
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:42,569
that keep me awake at night the human
 

553
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:45,110
that keep me awake at night the human
minds inability to rationally comprehend

554
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
minds inability to rationally comprehend
 

555
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,910
minds inability to rationally comprehend
the world is low on the list well put so

556
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
the world is low on the list well put so
 

557
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,889
the world is low on the list well put so
one interesting philosophical point and

558
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:51,899
one interesting philosophical point and
 

559
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,230
one interesting philosophical point and
quantum mechanics bring up is the that

560
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
quantum mechanics bring up is the that
 

561
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,610
quantum mechanics bring up is the that
you talk about the distinction between

562
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:55,620
you talk about the distinction between
 

563
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,600
you talk about the distinction between
the world as it is and the world as we

564
00:10:59,600 --> 00:10:59,610
the world as it is and the world as we
 

565
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,740
the world as it is and the world as we
observe it so staying at the human level

566
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:03,750
observe it so staying at the human level
 

567
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,490
observe it so staying at the human level
for a second how big is the gap between

568
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:06,500
for a second how big is the gap between
 

569
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,290
for a second how big is the gap between
what our perception system allows us to

570
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:09,300
what our perception system allows us to
 

571
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,790
what our perception system allows us to
see and the world as it is outside our

572
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
see and the world as it is outside our
 

573
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,249
see and the world as it is outside our
minds I sort of so if not at the quantum

574
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:16,259
minds I sort of so if not at the quantum
 

575
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,090
minds I sort of so if not at the quantum
mechanical level yeah as just are these

576
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,100
mechanical level yeah as just are these
 

577
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,400
mechanical level yeah as just are these
particular tools we have which is a few

578
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,410
particular tools we have which is a few
 

579
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,470
particular tools we have which is a few
senses and cognitive abilities to

580
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
senses and cognitive abilities to
 

581
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,650
senses and cognitive abilities to
process those senses well that last

582
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:27,660
process those senses well that last
 

583
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,269
process those senses well that last
phrase having the cognitive abilities to

584
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
phrase having the cognitive abilities to
 

585
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,819
phrase having the cognitive abilities to
process them carries a lot right I mean

586
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:31,829
process them carries a lot right I mean
 

587
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:34,579
process them carries a lot right I mean
there is our sort of intuitive

588
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:34,589
there is our sort of intuitive
 

589
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,860
there is our sort of intuitive
understanding of the world you don't

590
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:36,870
understanding of the world you don't
 

591
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,870
understanding of the world you don't
need to teach people about gravity for

592
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
need to teach people about gravity for
 

593
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,759
need to teach people about gravity for
them to know that apples fall from trees

594
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:40,769
them to know that apples fall from trees
 

595
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,319
them to know that apples fall from trees
right that's something that we figure

596
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:42,329
right that's something that we figure
 

597
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:44,480
right that's something that we figure
out pretty quickly object permanence

598
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,490
out pretty quickly object permanence
 

599
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,009
out pretty quickly object permanence
things like that the three

600
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:46,019
things like that the three
 

601
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,600
things like that the three
dimensionality of space even if we don't

602
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:47,610
dimensionality of space even if we don't
 

603
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,550
dimensionality of space even if we don't
have the mathematical language to say

604
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:49,560
have the mathematical language to say
 

605
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,889
have the mathematical language to say
that we kind of know that it's true on

606
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:51,899
that we kind of know that it's true on
 

607
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,230
that we kind of know that it's true on
the other hand no one opens their eyes

608
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
the other hand no one opens their eyes
 

609
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,809
the other hand no one opens their eyes
and sees atoms all right or molecules

610
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:56,819
and sees atoms all right or molecules
 

611
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,579
and sees atoms all right or molecules
for ourselves for that matter forget

612
00:11:58,579 --> 00:11:58,589
for ourselves for that matter forget
 

613
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:01,910
for ourselves for that matter forget
about quantum mechanics so but we got

614
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
about quantum mechanics so but we got
 

615
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,189
about quantum mechanics so but we got
there we got to understanding that there

616
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:04,199
there we got to understanding that there
 

617
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,499
there we got to understanding that there
are atoms and cells using the

618
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:06,509
are atoms and cells using the
 

619
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:09,019
are atoms and cells using the
combination of our senses and our

620
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,029
combination of our senses and our
 

621
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,499
combination of our senses and our
cognitive capacities so adding the

622
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:12,509
cognitive capacities so adding the
 

623
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:14,480
cognitive capacities so adding the
ability of our cognitive capacities to

624
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,490
ability of our cognitive capacities to
 

625
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,699
ability of our cognitive capacities to
our senses is adding an enormous amount

626
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:16,709
our senses is adding an enormous amount
 

627
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,079
our senses is adding an enormous amount
and I don't think there's a hard and

628
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:18,089
and I don't think there's a hard and
 

629
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,629
and I don't think there's a hard and
fast boundary you know if you believe in

630
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
fast boundary you know if you believe in
 

631
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,730
fast boundary you know if you believe in
cells if you believe that we understand

632
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:22,740
cells if you believe that we understand
 

633
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,410
cells if you believe that we understand
those then there's no reason you believe

634
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,420
those then there's no reason you believe
 

635
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,689
those then there's no reason you believe
we can't believe in quantum mechanics

636
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:26,699
we can't believe in quantum mechanics
 

637
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:30,769
we can't believe in quantum mechanics
just as well what to you is the most

638
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:30,779
just as well what to you is the most
 

639
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,950
just as well what to you is the most
beautiful idea in physics

640
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:35,960

 

641
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,600

conservation of momentum can you

642
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:38,610
conservation of momentum can you
 

643
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,630
conservation of momentum can you
elaborate yeah if you were Aristotle

644
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:41,640
elaborate yeah if you were Aristotle
 

645
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,400
elaborate yeah if you were Aristotle
when Aristotle wrote his book on physics

646
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,410
when Aristotle wrote his book on physics
 

647
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,050
when Aristotle wrote his book on physics
he made the following very obvious point

648
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,060
he made the following very obvious point
 

649
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,340
he made the following very obvious point
we're on video here right so people can

650
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,350
we're on video here right so people can
 

651
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,040
we're on video here right so people can
see this so if I push the bottle let me

652
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,050
see this so if I push the bottle let me
 

653
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,570
see this so if I push the bottle let me
cover this bottle so we do not have a

654
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:50,580
cover this bottle so we do not have a
 

655
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,700
cover this bottle so we do not have a
mess but okay so I push the bottle it

656
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:52,710
mess but okay so I push the bottle it
 

657
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,350
mess but okay so I push the bottle it
moves and if I stop pushing itself

658
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,360
moves and if I stop pushing itself
 

659
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,200
moves and if I stop pushing itself
moving yes and this is this kind of

660
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,210
moving yes and this is this kind of
 

661
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,180
moving yes and this is this kind of
thing is repeated a large number of

662
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,190
thing is repeated a large number of
 

663
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,340
thing is repeated a large number of
times all over the place if you don't

664
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,350
times all over the place if you don't
 

665
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,200
times all over the place if you don't
keep pushing things they stop moving

666
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,210
keep pushing things they stop moving
 

667
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,230
keep pushing things they stop moving
this is a indisputably true fact about

668
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
this is a indisputably true fact about
 

669
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
this is a indisputably true fact about
our everyday environment okay and for

670
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,210
our everyday environment okay and for
 

671
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,570
our everyday environment okay and for
Aristotle this blew up into a whole

672
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:11,580
Aristotle this blew up into a whole
 

673
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,300
Aristotle this blew up into a whole
picture of the world in which things had

674
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,310
picture of the world in which things had
 

675
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,210
picture of the world in which things had
natures and teleology x' and they had

676
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,220
natures and teleology x' and they had
 

677
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,890
natures and teleology x' and they had
places they wanted to be and when you

678
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:18,900
places they wanted to be and when you
 

679
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,480
places they wanted to be and when you
were pushing them you were moving them

680
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,490
were pushing them you were moving them
 

681
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,890
were pushing them you were moving them
away from where they wanted to be and

682
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:21,900
away from where they wanted to be and
 

683
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,480
away from where they wanted to be and
they would return and stuff like that

684
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:23,490
they would return and stuff like that
 

685
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,880
they would return and stuff like that
and it took a thousand years or fifteen

686
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:25,890
and it took a thousand years or fifteen
 

687
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,890
and it took a thousand years or fifteen
hundred years for people to say actually

688
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:29,900
hundred years for people to say actually
 

689
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,420
hundred years for people to say actually
if it weren't for things like

690
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,430
if it weren't for things like
 

691
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,190
if it weren't for things like
dissipation and air resistance and

692
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,200
dissipation and air resistance and
 

693
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,250
dissipation and air resistance and
friction and so forth the natural thing

694
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,260
friction and so forth the natural thing
 

695
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,560
friction and so forth the natural thing
is for things to move forever in a

696
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:39,570
is for things to move forever in a
 

697
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,570
is for things to move forever in a
straight line there's a constant

698
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:41,580
straight line there's a constant
 

699
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,130
straight line there's a constant
velocity right conservation of momentum

700
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,140
velocity right conservation of momentum
 

701
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,600
velocity right conservation of momentum
and that is the reason why I think

702
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:47,610
and that is the reason why I think
 

703
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,710
and that is the reason why I think
that's the most beautiful idea in

704
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
that's the most beautiful idea in
 

705
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,770
that's the most beautiful idea in
physics is because it shifts us from a

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:51,780
physics is because it shifts us from a
 

707
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,580
physics is because it shifts us from a
view of nature's and teleology to a view

708
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,590
view of nature's and teleology to a view
 

709
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,940
view of nature's and teleology to a view
of patterns in the world so when you

710
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:58,950
of patterns in the world so when you
 

711
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,390
of patterns in the world so when you
were Aristotle you needed to talk a

712
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:01,400
were Aristotle you needed to talk a
 

713
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,820
were Aristotle you needed to talk a

just follow the pattern you give me you
have Laplace's deamon ultimately right

have Laplace's deamon ultimately right
 

729
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,550
have Laplace's deamon ultimately right
you give me the state of the world today

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:19,560
you give me the state of the world today

you don't need nature's and purposes and
 

755
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,590
you don't need nature's and purposes and

course this took a long time to get
 

777
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,890
course this took a long time to get
there right I mean the conservation

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:12,900
there right I mean the conservation

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,250
there right I mean the conservation

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:17,460
it's weird just like someone would say
 

783
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,800
it's weird just like someone would say
something interesting and then the next

something interesting and then the next
 

785
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,840
something interesting and then the next
interesting thing would be said like 150

786
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:20,850
interesting thing would be said like 150
 

787
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,400
interesting thing would be said like 150
or 200 years later right they weren't

00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:23,460
even talking to each other there was
 

791
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,550
even talking to each other there was
reading each other's books and probably

792
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:25,560
reading each other's books and probably
 

793
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,860
reading each other's books and probably
the first person to directly say that in

the first person to directly say that in

Golden Age circa 1000 and he didn't like

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
Golden Age circa 1000 and he didn't like
 

803
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,970
Golden Age circa 1000 and he didn't like
the idea he used that just like

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:40,980
the idea he used that just like
 

805
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,680
the idea he used that just like
furniture used Schrodinger's cat to

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,850
studies freely you don't believe that
right even Sina was saying surely you

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:46,860
right even Sina was saying surely you

right even Sina was saying surely you
don't believe there really is a vacuum

812
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,120
don't believe there really is a vacuum
 

813
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,460
don't believe there really is a vacuum
because if there was a really vacuum

814
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:49,470
because if there was a really vacuum
 

815
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,530
because if there was a really vacuum
things could keep moving forever right

816
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:51,540
things could keep moving forever right
 

817
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,990
things could keep moving forever right
but still he got right the idea that

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
but still he got right the idea that
 

819
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,490
but still he got right the idea that
there was this conservation of something

there was this conservation of something

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,120
there was this conservation of something
impetus or mile he would call it and

classical mechanics and Isaac Newton so

826
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,180
classical mechanics and Isaac Newton so
 

827
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,090
classical mechanics and Isaac Newton so
you know Galileo played a big role in

828
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,100
you know Galileo played a big role in
 

829
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,650
you know Galileo played a big role in
this but he didn't exactly get it right

830
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:06,660
this but he didn't exactly get it right
 

831
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,590
this but he didn't exactly get it right
and so it just takes a long time for

832
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
and so it just takes a long time for
 

833
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,630
and so it just takes a long time for
this to sink in because it is so against

our everyday experience do you think it

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,350
our everyday experience do you think it
 

837
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,790
our everyday experience do you think it
was a big leap a brave or a difficult

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
was a big leap a brave or a difficult
 

839
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,860
was a big leap a brave or a difficult
leap of sort of math and science to be

leap of sort of math and science to be

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,620
leap of sort of math and science to be
able to say that momentum was conserved

able to say that momentum was conserved
I do you know I think it's a example of

all there I would just go on by itself

all there I would just go on by itself

that I think comes up certainly with

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:17,680
that I think comes up certainly with

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,640
that I think comes up certainly with
quantum mechanics is what's the

892
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:20,650
quantum mechanics is what's the
 

893
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,960
quantum mechanics is what's the
difference between math and physics to

difference between math and physics to
 

895
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,150
difference between math and physics to
you to me you know very very roughly

896
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,160
you to me you know very very roughly
 

897
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,700
you to me you know very very roughly
math is about the logical structure of

898
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:29,710
math is about the logical structure of
 

899
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,530
math is about the logical structure of
all possible worlds and physics is about

900
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:31,540
all possible worlds and physics is about
 

901
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,030
all possible worlds and physics is about
our actual world and it just feels like

902
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,040
our actual world and it just feels like
 

903
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,970
our actual world and it just feels like
our actual world is a gray area when you

904
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:38,980
our actual world is a gray area when you
 

905
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,950
our actual world is a gray area when you
start talking about interpretations of

906
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
start talking about interpretations of
 

907
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,500
start talking about interpretations of
quantum mechanics or no I'm certainly

908
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:43,510
quantum mechanics or no I'm certainly
 

909
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,690
quantum mechanics or no I'm certainly
using the word world in the broadest

910
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:45,700
using the word world in the broadest
 

911
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,350
using the word world in the broadest
sense all of reality so I think the

912
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
sense all of reality so I think the
 

913
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,300
sense all of reality so I think the
reality is specific I don't think that

914
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,310
reality is specific I don't think that
 

915
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,700
reality is specific I don't think that
there's every possible thing going on in

916
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:53,710
there's every possible thing going on in
 

917
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,740
there's every possible thing going on in
reality I think there are rules whether

918
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:55,750
reality I think there are rules whether
 

919
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,150
reality I think there are rules whether
it's the Schrodinger equation or

920
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,160
it's the Schrodinger equation or
 

921
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,090
it's the Schrodinger equation or
whatever so i think i think that there's

922
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,100
whatever so i think i think that there's
 

923
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,710
whatever so i think i think that there's
a sensible notion of the set of all

924
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:01,720
a sensible notion of the set of all
 

925
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
a sensible notion of the set of all
possible worlds and we live in one of

926
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:03,730
possible worlds and we live in one of
 

927
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,550
possible worlds and we live in one of
them the world that we're talking about

928
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:05,560
them the world that we're talking about
 

929
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,110
them the world that we're talking about
might be a multiverse might be many

930
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
might be a multiverse might be many
 

931
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,340
might be a multiverse might be many
worlds of quantum mechanics might be

932
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,350
worlds of quantum mechanics might be
 

933
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,390
worlds of quantum mechanics might be
much bigger than the world of our

934
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:09,400
much bigger than the world of our
 

935
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
much bigger than the world of our
everyday experience but it's still one

936
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,410
everyday experience but it's still one
 

937
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,590
everyday experience but it's still one
physically contiguous world in some

938
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
physically contiguous world in some
 

939
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,240
physically contiguous world in some
sense but so if you look at the overlap

940
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,250
sense but so if you look at the overlap
 

941
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,340
sense but so if you look at the overlap
of math and physics it feels like when

942
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,350
of math and physics it feels like when
 

943
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,800
of math and physics it feels like when
physics tries to reach for understanding

944
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:25,810
physics tries to reach for understanding
 

945
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,950
physics tries to reach for understanding
of our world it uses the tools of math

946
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
of our world it uses the tools of math
 

947
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,290
of our world it uses the tools of math
to sort of reach beyond the limit of our

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:31,300
to sort of reach beyond the limit of our

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,370
to sort of reach beyond the limit of our
current understanding what do you make

950
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:35,380
current understanding what do you make
 

951
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,720
current understanding what do you make
of that process of sort of using math to

952
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:38,730
of that process of sort of using math to
 

953
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,670
of that process of sort of using math to

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:41,680
so you start maybe with intuition or you
 

955
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,080
so you start maybe with intuition or you
might start with the math and then build

mystery of the world would math well I
 

963
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,390
mystery of the world would math well I
think I would put it a little bit

think I would put it a little bit

do we conclude if we take these

do we conclude if we take these
 

973
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,580
do we conclude if we take these
seriously well beyond where we've

seriously well beyond where we've

Mattox and physics I think that's a

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:14,560
Mattox and physics I think that's a
 

987
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,880
Mattox and physics I think that's a
little bit wrong because anything that

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:17,890
little bit wrong because anything that
 

989

math works but that the math is so
 

1001
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,260

down on a t-shirt right I mean that's

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,370
down on a t-shirt right I mean that's
 

1005

I tend to think that there is something

I tend to think that there is something

I tend to think that there is something

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,710
think in some sense we're just gonna at
some level we're gonna say and that's

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
some level we're gonna say and that's
 

1083
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,480
some level we're gonna say and that's
how it is and you know we can't explain

how it is and you know we can't explain
 

1085
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,370
how it is and you know we can't explain
anything more we I don't know how if

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:08,380
anything more we I don't know how if
 

1087
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,380
anything more we I don't know how if
we're anywhere close to that right now

we're anywhere close to that right now
 

1089
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,030
we're anywhere close to that right now
but that seems plausible to me and

1090
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,040
but that seems plausible to me and
 

1091
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,920
but that seems plausible to me and
speaking of rock bottom one of the

things so your book kind of reminded me

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,650

a reveal to me is that what's

a reveal to me is that what's

a reveal to me is that what's

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:39,620
a he as a limited human would think are
 

1113
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,900
a he as a limited human would think are
fundamental or it can actually be

1114
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:41,910
fundamental or it can actually be
 

1115
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,490
fundamental or it can actually be
explained as emergent from the the more

1116
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:46,500
explained as emergent from the the more
 

1117
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,150
explained as emergent from the the more
deeper laws I mean we don't know of

1118
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,160
deeper laws I mean we don't know of
 

1119
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,800
deeper laws I mean we don't know of
course is you had to get that on the

1120
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:51,810
course is you had to get that on the
 

1121
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,390
course is you had to get that on the
table like we don't know what is

1122
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:53,400
table like we don't know what is
 

1123
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,580
table like we don't know what is
fundamental we do know we do have reason

1124
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:55,590
fundamental we do know we do have reason
 

1125
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,230
fundamental we do know we do have reason
to say that certain things are more

1126
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,240
to say that certain things are more
 

1127
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,680
to say that certain things are more
fundamental than others right atoms and

1128
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:00,690
fundamental than others right atoms and
 

1129
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,180
fundamental than others right atoms and
molecules are more fundamental than

1130
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,190
molecules are more fundamental than
 

1131
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,550
molecules are more fundamental than
cells and organs quantum fields are more

1132
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:04,560
cells and organs quantum fields are more
 

1133
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,640
cells and organs quantum fields are more
fundamental than atoms and molecules we

1134
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,650
fundamental than atoms and molecules we
 

1135
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,920
fundamental than atoms and molecules we
don't know if that ever bottoms out I I

1136
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:09,930
don't know if that ever bottoms out I I
 

1137
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,200
don't know if that ever bottoms out I I
do think that there's sensible ways to

1138
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,210
do think that there's sensible ways to
 

1139
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,000
do think that there's sensible ways to
think about this the if you if you

1140
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,010
think about this the if you if you
 

1141
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,740
think about this the if you if you
describe something like this table as a

1142
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:15,750
describe something like this table as a
 

1143
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,170
describe something like this table as a
table it has a height and a width and

1144
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,180
table it has a height and a width and
 

1145
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,640
table it has a height and a width and
it's made of a certain material and has

1146
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:19,650
it's made of a certain material and has
 

1147
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,110
it's made of a certain material and has
a certain solidity and weight and so

1148
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
a certain solidity and weight and so
 

1149
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,900
a certain solidity and weight and so
forth that's the very useful description

1150
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:23,910
forth that's the very useful description
 

1151
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,640
forth that's the very useful description
as far as it goes there's a whole nother

1152
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:25,650
as far as it goes there's a whole nother
 

1153
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,800
as far as it goes there's a whole nother
description at this table in terms of a

1154
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:27,810
description at this table in terms of a
 

1155
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,660
description at this table in terms of a
whole collection of atoms strung

1156
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:29,670
whole collection of atoms strung
 

1157
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,450
whole collection of atoms strung
together in certain ways the language of

1158
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,460
together in certain ways the language of
 

1159
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,210
together in certain ways the language of
the atoms is more comprehensive than the

1160
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:35,220
the atoms is more comprehensive than the
 

1161
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,800
the atoms is more comprehensive than the
language of the table you could break

1162
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:36,810
language of the table you could break
 

1163
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,530
language of the table you could break
apart to the table smash it to pieces

1164
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:38,540
apart to the table smash it to pieces
 

1165
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,210
apart to the table smash it to pieces
still talk about it as atoms but you

1166
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:41,220
still talk about it as atoms but you
 

1167
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,680
still talk about it as atoms but you
could no longer talk about it as a table

1168
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:42,690
could no longer talk about it as a table
 

1169
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,390
could no longer talk about it as a table
right so I think of this

1170
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
right so I think of this
 

1171
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,700
right so I think of this
comprehensiveness the domain of validity

1172
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:46,710
comprehensiveness the domain of validity
 

1173
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,040
comprehensiveness the domain of validity
of a theory gets broader and broader as

1174
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,050
of a theory gets broader and broader as
 

1175
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,030
of a theory gets broader and broader as
the theory gets more and more

1176
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,040
the theory gets more and more
 

1177
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,910
the theory gets more and more
fundamental so what do you think Newton

1178
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:55,920
fundamental so what do you think Newton
 

1179
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,030
fundamental so what do you think Newton
would say maybe write in a book review

1180
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,040
would say maybe write in a book review
 

1181
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,890
would say maybe write in a book review
if you read your latest book on quantum

1182
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:00,900
if you read your latest book on quantum
 

1183
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,530
if you read your latest book on quantum
mechanics something deeply hidden would

1184
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:03,540
mechanics something deeply hidden would
 

1185
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,170
mechanics something deeply hidden would
take a long time for him to think that

1186
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:06,180
take a long time for him to think that
 

1187
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,180
take a long time for him to think that
any of this was making any sense you

1188
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,190
any of this was making any sense you
 

1189
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,380
any of this was making any sense you
catch him up pretty quick in the

1190
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:09,390
catch him up pretty quick in the
 

1191
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,220
catch him up pretty quick in the
beginning yeah give him a shout out

1192
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,230
beginning yeah give him a shout out
 

1193
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,200
beginning yeah give him a shout out
that's right I mean he used the man I'm

1194
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,210
that's right I mean he used the man I'm
 

1195
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,370
that's right I mean he used the man I'm
happy to say that Newton was the

1196
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:16,380
happy to say that Newton was the
 

1197
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,830
happy to say that Newton was the
greatest scientists who ever lived I

1198
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:18,840
greatest scientists who ever lived I
 

1199
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,780
greatest scientists who ever lived I
mean he met in calculus in his spare

1200
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:20,790
mean he met in calculus in his spare
 

1201
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,770
mean he met in calculus in his spare
time which would have made it the

1202
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:21,780
time which would have made it the
 

1203
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,000
time which would have made it the
greatest mathematician just all by

1204
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,010
greatest mathematician just all by
 

1205
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,620
greatest mathematician just all by
himself right I'll buy that one thing

1206
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:24,630
himself right I'll buy that one thing
 

1207
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,680
himself right I'll buy that one thing
but of course you know it's funny

1208
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:27,690
but of course you know it's funny
 

1209
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,980
but of course you know it's funny
because Newton was in some sense still a

1210
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:30,990
because Newton was in some sense still a
 

1211
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,310
because Newton was in some sense still a
pre-modern thinker rocky Kolb who is a

1212
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
pre-modern thinker rocky Kolb who is a
 

1213
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,900
pre-modern thinker rocky Kolb who is a
cosmologists at at the University of

1214
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:35,910
cosmologists at at the University of
 

1215
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,440
cosmologists at at the University of
Chicago said that you know Galileo even

1216
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,450
Chicago said that you know Galileo even
 

1217
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,250
Chicago said that you know Galileo even
though he can be

1218
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,260
though he can be
 

1219
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,320
though he can be
for Newton was a more modern thinker

1220
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,330
for Newton was a more modern thinker
 

1221
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,000
for Newton was a more modern thinker
than than Newton was like if he got

1222
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,010
than than Newton was like if he got
 

1223
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,710
than than Newton was like if he got
Galileo and brought him to the present

1224
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:45,720
Galileo and brought him to the present
 

1225
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:45,950
Galileo and brought him to the present
day

1226
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:45,960
day
 

1227
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,300
day
you take him six months to catch up and

1228
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,310
you take him six months to catch up and
 

1229
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,560
you take him six months to catch up and
then he be in your office telling you

1230
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,570
then he be in your office telling you
 

1231
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,970
then he be in your office telling you
while your most recent paper was wrong

1232
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:49,980
while your most recent paper was wrong
 

1233
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,970
while your most recent paper was wrong
whereas Newton just thought in this kind

1234
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:52,980
whereas Newton just thought in this kind
 

1235
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,700
whereas Newton just thought in this kind
of more mystical way you know he wrote a

1236
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:55,710
of more mystical way you know he wrote a
 

1237
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,340
of more mystical way you know he wrote a
lot more about the Bible and alchemy

1238
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,350
lot more about the Bible and alchemy
 

1239
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,640
lot more about the Bible and alchemy
didn't he ever did about physics and but

1240
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,650
didn't he ever did about physics and but
 

1241
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,900
didn't he ever did about physics and but
he was also more brilliant than anybody

1242
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:02,910
he was also more brilliant than anybody
 

1243
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,640
he was also more brilliant than anybody
else and and way more mathematically

1244
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:04,650
else and and way more mathematically
 

1245
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,220
else and and way more mathematically
astute than Galileo so I really don't

1246
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,230
astute than Galileo so I really don't
 

1247
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,680
astute than Galileo so I really don't
know you know he might have he might

1248
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:09,690
know you know he might have he might
 

1249
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,390
know you know he might have he might
just yeah say like give me the textbooks

1250
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:11,400
just yeah say like give me the textbooks
 

1251
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,860
just yeah say like give me the textbooks
leave me alone for a few months and then

1252
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:12,870
leave me alone for a few months and then
 

1253
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,370
leave me alone for a few months and then
be caught up but he but he or he might

1254
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:16,380
be caught up but he but he or he might
 

1255
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,860
be caught up but he but he or he might
have had mental blocks against against

1256
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:18,870
have had mental blocks against against
 

1257
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,210
have had mental blocks against against
seeing the world in this way I really

1258
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,220
seeing the world in this way I really
 

1259
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,770
seeing the world in this way I really
don't know or perhaps find an

1260
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:21,780
don't know or perhaps find an
 

1261
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,780
don't know or perhaps find an
interesting mystical interpretation of

1262
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:23,790
interesting mystical interpretation of
 

1263
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,790
interesting mystical interpretation of
quantum mechanics very possible yeah is

1264
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:25,800
quantum mechanics very possible yeah is
 

1265
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,290
quantum mechanics very possible yeah is
there any other scientists or

1266
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:27,300
there any other scientists or
 

1267
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,510
there any other scientists or

let's start with what is quantum

1332
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
let's start with what is quantum
 

1333
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,680
let's start with what is quantum
mechanics quantum mechanics is the

mechanics quantum mechanics is the
 

1335
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,020
mechanics quantum mechanics is the
paradigm of physics that came into being

paradigm of physics that came into being
 

1337
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,640
paradigm of physics that came into being
in the early part of the 20th century

1338
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:52,650
in the early part of the 20th century
 

1339
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,180
in the early part of the 20th century
that replaced

1340
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,190
that replaced
 

1341
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,340
that replaced
classical mechanics and it replaced

1342
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,350
classical mechanics and it replaced
 

1343
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,590
classical mechanics and it replaced
classical mechanics in a weird way that

1344
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:58,600
classical mechanics in a weird way that
 

1345
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,539
classical mechanics in a weird way that
we're still coming to terms with so in

1346
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:00,549
we're still coming to terms with so in
 

1347
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:02,700
we're still coming to terms with so in
classical mechanics you have an object

1348
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:02,710
classical mechanics you have an object
 

1349
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,610
classical mechanics you have an object
it as a location has a velocity and if

1350
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:05,620
it as a location has a velocity and if
 

1351
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,869
it as a location has a velocity and if
you know the location and velocity of

1352
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:06,879
you know the location and velocity of
 

1353
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:08,340
you know the location and velocity of
everything in the world you can say what

1354
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,350
everything in the world you can say what
 

1355
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,919
everything in the world you can say what
everything's gonna do quantum mechanics

1356
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:10,929
everything's gonna do quantum mechanics
 

1357
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:14,369
everything's gonna do quantum mechanics
has an aspect of it that is kind of on

1358
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:14,379
has an aspect of it that is kind of on
 

1359
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:16,110
has an aspect of it that is kind of on
the same lines there's something called

1360
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,120
the same lines there's something called
 

1361
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,560
the same lines there's something called
a quantum state or the wave function and

1362
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:18,570
a quantum state or the wave function and
 

1363
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,999
a quantum state or the wave function and
there's an equation governing what the

1364
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:21,009
there's an equation governing what the
 

1365
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:22,740
there's an equation governing what the
quantum state does so it's very much

1366
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:22,750
quantum state does so it's very much
 

1367
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,659
quantum state does so it's very much
like classical mechanics the wave

1368
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:24,669
like classical mechanics the wave
 

1369
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:26,070
like classical mechanics the wave
function is different it's sort of a

1370
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
function is different it's sort of a
 

1371
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,830
function is different it's sort of a
wave it's a vector in a huge dimensional

1372
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:28,840
wave it's a vector in a huge dimensional
 

1373
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,810
wave it's a vector in a huge dimensional
vector space rather than a position in a

1374
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:30,820
vector space rather than a position in a
 

1375
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,700
vector space rather than a position in a
velocity but okay that's a detail and

1376
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:32,710
velocity but okay that's a detail and
 

1377
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,169
velocity but okay that's a detail and
the equation is the Schrodinger equation

1378
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:34,179
the equation is the Schrodinger equation
 

1379
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,330
the equation is the Schrodinger equation
not Newton's laws but okay again a

1380
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:36,340
not Newton's laws but okay again a
 

1381
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,460
not Newton's laws but okay again a
detail where quantum mechanics really

1382
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:38,470
detail where quantum mechanics really
 

1383
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,409
detail where quantum mechanics really
becomes weird and different is that

1384
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:40,419
becomes weird and different is that
 

1385
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:42,570
becomes weird and different is that
there's a whole nother set of rules in

1386
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:42,580
there's a whole nother set of rules in
 

1387
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,369
there's a whole nother set of rules in
our textbook formulation of quantum

1388
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:44,379
our textbook formulation of quantum
 

1389
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:46,860
our textbook formulation of quantum
mechanics in addition to saying that

1390
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:46,870
mechanics in addition to saying that
 

1391
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,299
mechanics in addition to saying that
there's a quantum state and it evolves

1392
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:48,309
there's a quantum state and it evolves
 

1393
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:50,490
there's a quantum state and it evolves
in time and all these new rules have to

1394
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:50,500
in time and all these new rules have to
 

1395
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,169
in time and all these new rules have to
do with what happens when you look at

1396
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:52,179
do with what happens when you look at
 

1397
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,789
do with what happens when you look at
the system when you observe it when you

1398
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:53,799
the system when you observe it when you
 

1399
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,100
the system when you observe it when you
measure it in classical mechanics there

1400
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,110
measure it in classical mechanics there
 

1401
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,590
measure it in classical mechanics there
were no rules about observing you just

1402
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:58,600
were no rules about observing you just
 

1403
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,820
were no rules about observing you just
look at it and you see what's going on

1404
00:26:59,820 --> 00:26:59,830
look at it and you see what's going on
 

1405
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,980
look at it and you see what's going on
that that was that right in quantum

1406
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:01,990
that that was that right in quantum
 

1407
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,830
that that was that right in quantum
mechanics the way we teach it there's

1408
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840
mechanics the way we teach it there's
 

1409
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,869
mechanics the way we teach it there's
something profoundly fundamental about

1410
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:06,879
something profoundly fundamental about
 

1411
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:08,430
something profoundly fundamental about
the act of measurement or observation

1412
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:08,440
the act of measurement or observation
 

1413
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,279
the act of measurement or observation
and the system dramatically changes its

1414
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:11,289
and the system dramatically changes its
 

1415
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,499
and the system dramatically changes its
state even though it has a wave function

1416
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:13,509
state even though it has a wave function
 

1417
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,720
state even though it has a wave function
like the electron in an atom is not

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:15,730
like the electron in an atom is not
 

1419

out in a cloud when you look at it you
don't see that cloud when you look at it

00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:22,269
don't see that cloud when you look at it

00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:26,460
it looks like a particle with a location
so it dramatically changes its state

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,710
so it dramatically changes its state
right away and the effects of that

right away and the effects of that
 

1431
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,330
right away and the effects of that
change can be instantly seen and what

so the weight of the atom the mass is
 

1553

so the weight of the atom the mass is
almost all in its nucleus protons and

00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:25,659
with classical mechanics and quantum
mechanics is modeling the behavior of

1578
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:25,669
mechanics is modeling the behavior of
 

1579
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:28,240
mechanics is modeling the behavior of
the electron I mean you can model the

1580
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,250
the electron I mean you can model the
 

1581
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,830
the electron I mean you can model the
behavior of anything but the electron

1582
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
behavior of anything but the electron
 

1583
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,120
behavior of anything but the electron
because that's where the fun is

1584
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,130
because that's where the fun is
 

1585
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,919
because that's where the fun is
the electron was it was the biggest

1586
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:32,929
the electron was it was the biggest
 

1587
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:34,870
the electron was it was the biggest
challenge right from the start yeah so

1588
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
challenge right from the start yeah so
 

1589
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,330
challenge right from the start yeah so
what's a wavefunction you said it's an

1590
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:37,340
what's a wavefunction you said it's an
 

1591
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,139
what's a wavefunction you said it's an
interesting detail yeah but in any

1592
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:41,149
interesting detail yeah but in any
 

1593
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:43,570
interesting detail yeah but in any
interpretation what is the wave function

1594
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:43,580
interpretation what is the wave function
 

1595
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
interpretation what is the wave function
in quantum mechanics well you know we

1596
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:45,590
in quantum mechanics well you know we
 

1597
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,250
in quantum mechanics well you know we
had this idea from Rutherford that atoms

1598
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,260
had this idea from Rutherford that atoms
 

1599
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,289
had this idea from Rutherford that atoms
look like little solar systems but

1600
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:50,299
look like little solar systems but
 

1601
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:52,419
look like little solar systems but
people very quickly realize that can't

1602
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:52,429
people very quickly realize that can't
 

1603
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:54,549
people very quickly realize that can't
possibly be right because if an electron

1604
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
possibly be right because if an electron
 

1605
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,889
possibly be right because if an electron
is orbiting in a circle it will give off

1606
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:56,899
is orbiting in a circle it will give off
 

1607
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,600
is orbiting in a circle it will give off
light all the light that we have in this

1608
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:58,610
light all the light that we have in this
 

1609
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,639
light all the light that we have in this
room comes from electrons zooming up and

1610
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:00,649
room comes from electrons zooming up and
 

1611
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:01,810
room comes from electrons zooming up and
down and wiggling and that's what

1612
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:01,820
down and wiggling and that's what
 

1613
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,970
down and wiggling and that's what
electromagnetic waves are and you can

1614
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:03,980
electromagnetic waves are and you can
 

1615
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,740
electromagnetic waves are and you can
calculate how long would it take for the

1616
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:05,750
calculate how long would it take for the
 

1617
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,570
calculate how long would it take for the
electron just to spiral into the nucleus

1618
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:07,580
electron just to spiral into the nucleus
 

1619
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,129
electron just to spiral into the nucleus
and the answer is 10 to the minus 11

1620
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:09,139
and the answer is 10 to the minus 11
 

1621
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:11,470
and the answer is 10 to the minus 11
seconds okay a hundred billions of a

1622
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:11,480
seconds okay a hundred billions of a
 

1623
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,830
seconds okay a hundred billions of a
second so that's not right

1624
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
second so that's not right
 

1625
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,200
second so that's not right
meanwhile people had realized that light

1626
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,210
meanwhile people had realized that light
 

1627
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,720
meanwhile people had realized that light
which we understood from the 1800s was a

1628
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:19,730
which we understood from the 1800s was a
 

1629
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,750
which we understood from the 1800s was a
wave had properties that were similar to

1630
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:22,760
wave had properties that were similar to
 

1631
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,639
wave had properties that were similar to
that of particles right this is Einstein

1632
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:24,649
that of particles right this is Einstein
 

1633
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,299
that of particles right this is Einstein
and plunk and stuff like that so if

1634
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:27,309
and plunk and stuff like that so if
 

1635
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:30,580
and plunk and stuff like that so if
something that we agree was a wave had

1636
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:30,590
something that we agree was a wave had
 

1637
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,340
something that we agree was a wave had
particle-like properties then maybe

1638
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,350
particle-like properties then maybe
 

1639
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,080
particle-like properties then maybe
something we think is a particle the

1640
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,090
something we think is a particle the
 

1641
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,600
something we think is a particle the
electron has wave-like properties right

1642
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:37,610
electron has wave-like properties right
 

1643
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,899
electron has wave-like properties right
and so a bunch of people eventually came

1644
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:40,909
and so a bunch of people eventually came
 

1645
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:42,460
and so a bunch of people eventually came
to the conclusion don't think about the

1646
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,470
to the conclusion don't think about the
 

1647
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,350
to the conclusion don't think about the
electron as a little point particle

1648
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:44,360
electron as a little point particle
 

1649
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,350
electron as a little point particle
orbiting in like a solar system think of

1650
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
orbiting in like a solar system think of
 

1651
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,840
orbiting in like a solar system think of
it as a wave that is spread out they

1652
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:49,850
it as a wave that is spread out they
 

1653
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,490
it as a wave that is spread out they
cleverly gave this the name the wave

1654
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:51,500
cleverly gave this the name the wave
 

1655
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,110
cleverly gave this the name the wave
function which is the dopiest name in

1656
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
function which is the dopiest name in
 

1657
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,310
function which is the dopiest name in
the world for one of the most profound

1658
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
the world for one of the most profound
 

1659
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,340
the world for one of the most profound
things in the universe the there's

1660
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,350
things in the universe the there's
 

1661
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,860
things in the universe the there's
literally you know a number at every

1662
00:31:59,860 --> 00:31:59,870
literally you know a number at every
 

1663
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,560
literally you know a number at every
point in space which is the value of the

1664
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:02,570
point in space which is the value of the
 

1665
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,779
point in space which is the value of the
electrons wave function at that point

1666
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:04,789
electrons wave function at that point
 

1667
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,820
electrons wave function at that point
and there's only there's only one wave

1668
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:06,830
and there's only there's only one wave
 

1669
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,950
and there's only there's only one wave
function that yeah they eventually

1670
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
function that yeah they eventually
 

1671
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,990
function that yeah they eventually
figured that out that took longer but

1672
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,000
figured that out that took longer but
 

1673
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,240
figured that out that took longer but
when you have two electrons you do not

1674
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,250
when you have two electrons you do not
 

1675
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,250
when you have two electrons you do not
have a wave function for electron one in

1676
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:15,260
have a wave function for electron one in
 

1677
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,110
have a wave function for electron one in
a wave function for electron two you

1678
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,120
a wave function for electron two you
 

1679
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,870
a wave function for electron two you
have one combined wave function for both

1680
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:19,880
have one combined wave function for both
 

1681
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,850
have one combined wave function for both
of them and indeed as you say there's

1682
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:21,860
of them and indeed as you say there's
 

1683
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,740
of them and indeed as you say there's
only one wave function for the entire

1684
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:23,750
only one wave function for the entire
 

1685
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:28,090
only one wave function for the entire
universe at once and that's where this

1686
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:28,100
universe at once and that's where this
 

1687
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,070
universe at once and that's where this
beautiful dance

1688
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
beautiful dance
 

1689
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,649
beautiful dance
can you say what is entanglement it

1690
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:32,659
can you say what is entanglement it
 

1691
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,690
can you say what is entanglement it
seems one of the most fundamental ideas

1692
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:34,700
seems one of the most fundamental ideas
 

1693
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,340
seems one of the most fundamental ideas
of quantum again well let's temporarily

1694
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,350
of quantum again well let's temporarily
 

1695
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,950
of quantum again well let's temporarily
buy into the textbook interpretation of

1696
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
buy into the textbook interpretation of
 

1697
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,299
buy into the textbook interpretation of
quantum mechanics and what that says is

1698
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:40,309
quantum mechanics and what that says is
 

1699
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:42,130
quantum mechanics and what that says is
that this wave function so it's very

1700
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:42,140
that this wave function so it's very
 

1701
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,580
that this wave function so it's very
small

1702
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:42,590
small
 

1703
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,860
small
outside the atom very big in the atom

1704
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:44,870
outside the atom very big in the atom
 

1705
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,200
outside the atom very big in the atom
basically the wave function you take it

1706
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,210
basically the wave function you take it
 

1707
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,450
basically the wave function you take it
and you square it you squared the number

1708
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:49,460
and you square it you squared the number
 

1709
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,159
and you square it you squared the number
that gives you the probability of

1710
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:51,169
that gives you the probability of
 

1711
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,220
that gives you the probability of
observing the system at that location so

1712
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:54,230
observing the system at that location so
 

1713
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,080
observing the system at that location so
if you say that for two electrons

1714
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,090
if you say that for two electrons
 

1715
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,210
if you say that for two electrons
there's only one wave function and that

1716
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:58,220
there's only one wave function and that
 

1717
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,230
there's only one wave function and that
wave function gives you the probability

1718
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,240
wave function gives you the probability
 

1719
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,090
wave function gives you the probability
of observing both electrons at once

1720
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:01,100
of observing both electrons at once
 

1721
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,029
of observing both electrons at once
doing something okay so maybe the

1722
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:04,039
doing something okay so maybe the
 

1723
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,070
doing something okay so maybe the
electron can be here or here here here

1724
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080
electron can be here or here here here
 

1725
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,720
electron can be here or here here here
and the other electron can also be there

1726
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:07,730
and the other electron can also be there
 

1727
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,090
and the other electron can also be there
but we have a wave function setup where

1728
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:10,100
but we have a wave function setup where
 

1729
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,399
but we have a wave function setup where
we don't know where either electron is

1730
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:12,409
we don't know where either electron is
 

1731
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,529
we don't know where either electron is
going to be seen but we know they'll

1732
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:14,539
going to be seen but we know they'll
 

1733
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:17,799
going to be seen but we know they'll
both be seen in the same place okay so

1734
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:17,809
both be seen in the same place okay so
 

1735
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:19,750
both be seen in the same place okay so
we don't know exactly what we're gonna

1736
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:19,760
we don't know exactly what we're gonna
 

1737
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,220
we don't know exactly what we're gonna
see for either electron but there's

1738
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:21,230
see for either electron but there's
 

1739
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,470
see for either electron but there's
entanglement between the two of them

1740
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:23,480
entanglement between the two of them
 

1741
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,210
entanglement between the two of them
there's a sort of conditional statement

1742
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:25,220
there's a sort of conditional statement
 

1743
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,490
there's a sort of conditional statement
if we see one in one location then we

1744
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:27,500
if we see one in one location then we
 

1745
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,200
if we see one in one location then we
know the other one's going to be doing a

1746
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,210
know the other one's going to be doing a
 

1747
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,029
know the other one's going to be doing a
certain thing so that's a feature of

1748
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
certain thing so that's a feature of
 

1749
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,919
certain thing so that's a feature of
quantum mechanics that is nowhere to be

1750
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:32,929
quantum mechanics that is nowhere to be
 

1751
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,269
quantum mechanics that is nowhere to be
found in classical mechanics in

1752
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:34,279
found in classical mechanics in
 

1753
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,220
found in classical mechanics in
classical mechanics there's no way I can

1754
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,230
classical mechanics there's no way I can
 

1755
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,539
classical mechanics there's no way I can
say well I don't know where either one

1756
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:37,549
say well I don't know where either one
 

1757
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,310
say well I don't know where either one
of these particles is but if I know if I

1758
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:39,320
of these particles is but if I know if I
 

1759
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,450
of these particles is but if I know if I
find out where this one is then I know

1760
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:40,460
find out where this one is then I know
 

1761
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,769
find out where this one is then I know
where the other one is that just never

1762
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:41,779
where the other one is that just never
 

1763
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:43,419
where the other one is that just never
happens they're truly separate and in

1764
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:43,429
happens they're truly separate and in
 

1765
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:45,100
happens they're truly separate and in
general it feels like if you think of a

1766
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,110
general it feels like if you think of a
 

1767
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,799
general it feels like if you think of a
wave function like as a dance floor it

1768
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:47,809
wave function like as a dance floor it
 

1769
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,009
wave function like as a dance floor it
seems like entanglement is strongest

1770
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:51,019
seems like entanglement is strongest
 

1771
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,750
seems like entanglement is strongest
between things that are dancing together

1772
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:52,760
between things that are dancing together
 

1773
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,940
between things that are dancing together
closest so there's a there's a closeness

1774
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:54,950
closest so there's a there's a closeness
 

1775
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,610
closest so there's a there's a closeness
that's important well that's not that

1776
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:57,620
that's important well that's not that
 

1777
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,930
that's important well that's not that
that's another step we have to be

1778
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:58,940
that's another step we have to be
 

1779
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,360
that's another step we have to be
careful here should cause in principle

1780
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,370
careful here should cause in principle
 

1781
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,200
careful here should cause in principle
if you if you're talking my the

00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,210
if you if you're talking my the
 

1783

entanglement of two electrons for

1784
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:03,649
entanglement of two electrons for
 

1785
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:05,310
entanglement of two electrons for
example

1786
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,320
example
 

1787
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,800
example
they can be totally entangled or totally

1788
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:07,810
they can be totally entangled or totally
 

1789
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,540
they can be totally entangled or totally
unentangled no matter where they are in

1790
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:09,550
unentangled no matter where they are in
 

1791
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,130
unentangled no matter where they are in
the universe there's no relationship

1792
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,140
the universe there's no relationship
 

1793
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,409
the universe there's no relationship
between the amount of entanglement and

1794
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:13,419
between the amount of entanglement and
 

1795
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,990
between the amount of entanglement and
the distance between two electrons but

1796
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
the distance between two electrons but
 

1797
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,290
the distance between two electrons but
we now know that you know the reality of

1798
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:19,300
we now know that you know the reality of
 

1799
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,760
we now know that you know the reality of
our best way of understanding the world

1800
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:20,770
our best way of understanding the world
 

1801
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,740
our best way of understanding the world
is through quantum fields not through

1802
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:22,750
is through quantum fields not through
 

1803
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,409
is through quantum fields not through
particles so even the electron not just

1804
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:25,419
particles so even the electron not just
 

1805
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:27,720
particles so even the electron not just
gravity and electromagnetism but even

1806
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:27,730
gravity and electromagnetism but even
 

1807
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,550
gravity and electromagnetism but even
the electron and the quarks and so forth

1808
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:29,560
the electron and the quarks and so forth
 

1809
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,550
the electron and the quarks and so forth
are really vibrations in quantum fields

1810
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,560
are really vibrations in quantum fields
 

1811
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,480
are really vibrations in quantum fields
so even empty space is full of vibrating

1812
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:36,490
so even empty space is full of vibrating
 

1813
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,630
so even empty space is full of vibrating
quantum fields and those quantum fields

1814
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:39,640
quantum fields and those quantum fields
 

1815
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,760
quantum fields and those quantum fields
in empty space are entangled with each

1816
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:41,770
in empty space are entangled with each
 

1817
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,440
in empty space are entangled with each
other in exactly the way you just said

1818
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:43,450
other in exactly the way you just said
 

1819
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,270
other in exactly the way you just said
if they're nearby if you have like two

1820
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,280
if they're nearby if you have like two
 

1821
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,560
if they're nearby if you have like two
vibrating quantum fields that are nearby

1822
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:46,570
vibrating quantum fields that are nearby
 

1823
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,510
vibrating quantum fields that are nearby
them it'll be highly entangled if

1824
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:48,520
them it'll be highly entangled if
 

1825
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,740
them it'll be highly entangled if
they're far away they will not be

1826
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:49,750
they're far away they will not be
 

1827
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,750
they're far away they will not be
entangled so what do quantum fields in a

1828
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:51,760
entangled so what do quantum fields in a
 

1829
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,090
entangled so what do quantum fields in a
vacuum look like empty space just so

1830
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,100
vacuum look like empty space just so
 

1831
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,830
vacuum look like empty space just so
like empty space it's as empty as it can

1832
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:55,840
like empty space it's as empty as it can
 

1833
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,140
like empty space it's as empty as it can
be but there's still a field it's just

1834
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,150
be but there's still a field it's just
 

1835
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,610
be but there's still a field it's just
yeah it uh what is nothing just like

1836
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:02,620
yeah it uh what is nothing just like
 

1837
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,470
yeah it uh what is nothing just like
right here or this location in space

1838
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,480
right here or this location in space
 

1839
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,240
right here or this location in space
there's a gravitational field which I

1840
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,250
there's a gravitational field which I
 

1841
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,490
there's a gravitational field which I
can detach by dropping something yeah I

1842
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:08,500
can detach by dropping something yeah I
 

1843
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,200
can detach by dropping something yeah I
don't see it but there it is so we got a

1844
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,210
don't see it but there it is so we got a
 

1845
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:18,470
don't see it but there it is so we got a
little bit of idea of entanglement now

1846
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,480
little bit of idea of entanglement now
 

1847
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,370
little bit of idea of entanglement now
what is Hilbert space and Euclidean

1848
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:23,380
what is Hilbert space and Euclidean
 

1849
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,860
what is Hilbert space and Euclidean
space yeah you know I think that people

1850
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:25,870
space yeah you know I think that people
 

1851
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,960
space yeah you know I think that people
are very welcoming over their lives not

1852
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:27,970
are very welcoming over their lives not
 

1853
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,520
are very welcoming over their lives not
knowing what Hilbert space is but if you

1854
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:29,530
knowing what Hilbert space is but if you
 

1855
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,590
knowing what Hilbert space is but if you
if you what I dig in a little bit more

1856
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:31,600
if you what I dig in a little bit more
 

1857
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,910
if you what I dig in a little bit more
into quantum mechanics it becomes

1858
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:32,920
into quantum mechanics it becomes
 

1859
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,820
into quantum mechanics it becomes
necessary you know the English language

1860
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:35,830
necessary you know the English language
 

1861
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,500
necessary you know the English language
was invented long before quantum

1862
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:37,510
was invented long before quantum
 

1863
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,960
was invented long before quantum
mechanics or various forms of higher

1864
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:39,970
mechanics or various forms of higher
 

1865
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,450
mechanics or various forms of higher
mathematics were invented so we use the

1866
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:42,460
mathematics were invented so we use the
 

1867
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,030
mathematics were invented so we use the
word space to mean different things of

1868
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
word space to mean different things of
 

1869
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,890
word space to mean different things of
course most of us think of space as this

1870
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:46,900
course most of us think of space as this
 

1871
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,570
course most of us think of space as this
three dimensional world in which we live

1872
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:48,580
three dimensional world in which we live
 

1873
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,890
three dimensional world in which we live
right I mean some of us just think of it

1874
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:49,900
right I mean some of us just think of it
 

1875
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,280
right I mean some of us just think of it
as outer space okay but space around us

1876
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,290
as outer space okay but space around us
 

1877
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,570
as outer space okay but space around us
it gives us the three-dimensional

1878
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:54,580
it gives us the three-dimensional
 

1879
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,430
it gives us the three-dimensional
location of things and objects but

1880
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:56,440
location of things and objects but
 

1881
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,480
location of things and objects but

1889
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,730
possibilities you know momentum space
etc so Hilbert space is the space of all

etc so Hilbert space is the space of all
 

1891
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,740
etc so Hilbert space is the space of all
possible quantum wave functions either

space mean you know it's just a way of

1916
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
space mean you know it's just a way of
 

1917
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,620
space mean you know it's just a way of
mathematically representing how much

1918
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:38,630
mathematically representing how much

the system how many numbers do you have

1922
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:42,980
the system how many numbers do you have
 

1923
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,250

to give me to specify what the thing is

1924
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:45,260
to give me to specify what the thing is
 

1925
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,770

doing so in classical mechanics I give

1926
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:47,780
doing so in classical mechanics I give
 

1927
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,470
doing so in classical mechanics I give
you the location of something by giving

1928
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:50,480
you the location of something by giving
 

1929
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,390
you the location of something by giving
you three numbers right up down left

1930
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:52,400
you three numbers right up down left
 

1931
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,090
you three numbers right up down left
likes XYZ coordinates but then I might

1932
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:55,100
likes XYZ coordinates but then I might
 

1933
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,240
likes XYZ coordinates but then I might
want to give you its entire state

1934
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,250
want to give you its entire state
 

1935
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,130
want to give you its entire state
physical state which means both its

1936
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:00,140
physical state which means both its
 

1937
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,710
physical state which means both its
position and also its velocity the

1938
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:02,720
position and also its velocity the
 

1939
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,570
position and also its velocity the
velocity also has three components so

1940
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:04,580
velocity also has three components so
 

1941
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,370
velocity also has three components so
it's state lives in something called

1942
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:06,380
it's state lives in something called
 

1943
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,070
it's state lives in something called
phase space which is six dimensional

1944
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,080
phase space which is six dimensional
 

1945
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,630
phase space which is six dimensional
three dimensions of position three

1946
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,640
three dimensions of position three
 

1947
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,060
three dimensions of position three
dimensions of velocity and then if it

1948
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,070
dimensions of velocity and then if it
 

1949
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,070
dimensions of velocity and then if it
also has an orientation in space that's

1950
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,080
also has an orientation in space that's
 

1951
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,930
also has an orientation in space that's
another three dimensions and so forth so

1952
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:16,940
another three dimensions and so forth so
 

1953
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,090
another three dimensions and so forth so
as you describe more and more

1954
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:19,100
as you describe more and more
 

1955
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,460
as you describe more and more
information about the system you have an

1956
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:21,470
information about the system you have an
 

1957
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,890
information about the system you have an
abstract mathematical space that has

1958
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:23,900
abstract mathematical space that has
 

1959
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,930
abstract mathematical space that has
more and more numbers that you need to

1960
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:25,940
more and more numbers that you need to
 

1961
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,280
more and more numbers that you need to
give and each one of those numbers

1962
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,290
give and each one of those numbers
 

1963
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,920
give and each one of those numbers
corresponds to a dimension in that space

1964
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:28,930
corresponds to a dimension in that space
 

1965
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,540
corresponds to a dimension in that space
so in terms of that amount of

1966
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:31,550
so in terms of that amount of
 

1967
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,380
so in terms of that amount of
information

1968
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:32,390
information
 

1969
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,859
information
what is entropy this mystical word

1970
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:35,869
what is entropy this mystical word
 

1971
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:39,010
what is entropy this mystical word
that's overused in math and physics but

1972
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,020
that's overused in math and physics but
 

1973
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,320
that's overused in math and physics but
has a very specific meaning in this

1974
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,330
has a very specific meaning in this
 

1975
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,510
has a very specific meaning in this
context sadly it has more than one very

1976
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
context sadly it has more than one very
 

1977
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,070
context sadly it has more than one very
specific meeting this is this is reason

1978
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,080
specific meeting this is this is reason
 

1979
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,260
specific meeting this is this is reason
why it is hard and roomy means different

1980
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,270
why it is hard and roomy means different
 

1981
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,180
why it is hard and roomy means different
things even to different physicists but

1982
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,190
things even to different physicists but
 

1983
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,040
things even to different physicists but
one way of thinking about it is a

1984
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,050
one way of thinking about it is a
 

1985
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,380
one way of thinking about it is a
measure of how much we don't know about

1986
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:53,390
measure of how much we don't know about
 

1987
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,630
measure of how much we don't know about
the state of a system right so if I have

1988
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:55,640
the state of a system right so if I have
 

1989
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,020
the state of a system right so if I have
a bottle of water molecules and I know

1990
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,030
a bottle of water molecules and I know
 

1991
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,609
a bottle of water molecules and I know
that okay there's a certain number of

1992
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:00,619
that okay there's a certain number of
 

1993
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,260
that okay there's a certain number of
water molecules I could weigh it right

1994
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,270
water molecules I could weigh it right
 

1995
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,060
water molecules I could weigh it right
and figure out I know the volume of it

1996
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,070
and figure out I know the volume of it
 

1997
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,440
and figure out I know the volume of it
and I know the temperature and pressure

1998
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:05,450
and I know the temperature and pressure
 

1999
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,550
and I know the temperature and pressure
and things like that

2000
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:06,560
and things like that
 

2001
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,130
and things like that
I certainly don't know the exact

2002
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,140
I certainly don't know the exact
 

2003
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,780
I certainly don't know the exact
position and velocity of every water

2004
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:10,790
position and velocity of every water
 

2005
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,820
position and velocity of every water
molecule right so there's a certain

2006
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:12,830
molecule right so there's a certain
 

2007
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,440
molecule right so there's a certain
amount of information I know certain

2008
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,450
amount of information I know certain
 

2009
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,210
amount of information I know certain
amount that I don't know that is that is

2010
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:16,220
amount that I don't know that is that is
 

2011
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,040
amount that I don't know that is that is
part of the complete state of the system

2012
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,050
part of the complete state of the system
 

2013
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,380
part of the complete state of the system
and that's what the entropy

2014
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,390
and that's what the entropy
 

2015
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,430
and that's what the entropy
characterizes how much unknown

2016
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
characterizes how much unknown
 

2017
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,680
characterizes how much unknown
information there is the difference

2018
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:23,690
information there is the difference
 

2019
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,270
information there is the difference
between what I do know about the system

2020
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,280
between what I do know about the system
 

2021
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,330
between what I do know about the system
and its full exact microscopic state so

2022
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:28,340
and its full exact microscopic state so
 

2023
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,430
and its full exact microscopic state so
when we try to describe

2024
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:30,440
when we try to describe
 

2025
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,210
when we try to describe
a quantum mechanical system is infinite

2026
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:34,220
a quantum mechanical system is infinite
 

2027
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,420
a quantum mechanical system is infinite
or finite but very large yeah we don't

2028
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:37,430
or finite but very large yeah we don't
 

2029
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,280
or finite but very large yeah we don't
know that depends on the system you know

2030
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,290
know that depends on the system you know
 

2031
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,190
know that depends on the system you know
it's easy to mathematically write down a

2032
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,200
it's easy to mathematically write down a
 

2033
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,350
it's easy to mathematically write down a
system that would have a potentially

2034
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:44,360
system that would have a potentially
 

2035
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,390
system that would have a potentially
infinite entropy an infinite dimensional

2036
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
infinite entropy an infinite dimensional
 

2037
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,090
infinite entropy an infinite dimensional
hilbert space so let's let's go back a

2038
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,100
hilbert space so let's let's go back a
 

2039
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,250
hilbert space so let's let's go back a
little bit we said that the hilbert

2040
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:51,260
little bit we said that the hilbert
 

2041
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,020
little bit we said that the hilbert
space was the space in which quantum

2042
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,030
space was the space in which quantum
 

2043
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,730
space was the space in which quantum
wave functions lived for different

2044
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:54,740
wave functions lived for different
 

2045
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,740
wave functions lived for different
systems that will be different sizes

2046
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:56,750
systems that will be different sizes
 

2047
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,510
systems that will be different sizes
they could be infinite or finite so

2048
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:58,520
they could be infinite or finite so
 

2049
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,930
they could be infinite or finite so
that's the number of numbers the number

2050
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:01,940
that's the number of numbers the number
 

2051
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,010
that's the number of numbers the number
of pieces information you could

2052
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:03,020
of pieces information you could
 

2053
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,690
of pieces information you could
potentially give me about the system so

2054
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:04,700
potentially give me about the system so
 

2055
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,960
potentially give me about the system so
the bigger hilbert spaces the bigger the

2056
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:07,970
the bigger hilbert spaces the bigger the
 

2057
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,000
the bigger hilbert spaces the bigger the
entropy of that system could be

2058
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,010
entropy of that system could be
 

2059
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,890
entropy of that system could be
depending on what I know about it if I

2060
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:11,900
depending on what I know about it if I
 

2061
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,630
depending on what I know about it if I
don't know anything about it then you

2062
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:13,640
don't know anything about it then you
 

2063
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,760
don't know anything about it then you
know as a huge entropy right but only up

2064
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:15,770
know as a huge entropy right but only up
 

2065
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,610
know as a huge entropy right but only up
to the size of its hilbert space so we

2066
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:18,620
to the size of its hilbert space so we
 

2067
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,070
to the size of its hilbert space so we
don't know in in the real physical world

2068
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,080
don't know in in the real physical world
 

2069
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,440
don't know in in the real physical world
whether or not you know this region of

2070
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:23,450
whether or not you know this region of
 

2071
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,110
whether or not you know this region of
space that contains that water bottle

2072
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,120
space that contains that water bottle
 

2073
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,180
space that contains that water bottle
has potentially an infinite entropy or

2074
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,190
has potentially an infinite entropy or
 

2075
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,650
has potentially an infinite entropy or
just a finite entropy we have we have

2076
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:29,660
just a finite entropy we have we have
 

2077
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,880
just a finite entropy we have we have
different arguments on different sides

2078
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:30,890
different arguments on different sides
 

2079
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,760
different arguments on different sides
so if it's infinite how do you think

2080
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:33,770
so if it's infinite how do you think
 

2081
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,530
so if it's infinite how do you think
about infinity is this something you can

2082
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:37,540
about infinity is this something you can
 

2083
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,210
about infinity is this something you can
your cognitive abilities are able to

2084
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:40,220
your cognitive abilities are able to
 

2085
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,790
your cognitive abilities are able to
process or is it just a mathematical

2086
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:42,800
process or is it just a mathematical
 

2087
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,010
process or is it just a mathematical
tool it's somewhere in between right I

2088
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,020
tool it's somewhere in between right I
 

2089
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,600
tool it's somewhere in between right I
mean we can say things about it we can

2090
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:46,610
mean we can say things about it we can
 

2091
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,180
mean we can say things about it we can
use mathematical tools to manipulate

2092
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:49,190
use mathematical tools to manipulate
 

2093
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,670
use mathematical tools to manipulate
infinity very very accurately we can

2094
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,680
infinity very very accurately we can
 

2095
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,470
infinity very very accurately we can
define what we mean you know for any

2096
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:53,480
define what we mean you know for any
 

2097
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,750
define what we mean you know for any
number n there's a number bigger than it

2098
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
number n there's a number bigger than it
 

2099
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,210
number n there's a number bigger than it
so there's no biggest number right so

2100
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:58,220
so there's no biggest number right so
 

2101
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,410
so there's no biggest number right so
there's something called the total

2102
00:39:59,410 --> 00:39:59,420
there's something called the total
 

2103
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,330
there's something called the total
number of all numbers that's infinite

2104
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:01,340
number of all numbers that's infinite
 

2105
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,190
number of all numbers that's infinite
but it is hard to wrap your brain around

2106
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200
but it is hard to wrap your brain around
 

2107
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,380
but it is hard to wrap your brain around
that and I think that gives people pause

2108
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,390
that and I think that gives people pause
 

2109
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,070
that and I think that gives people pause
because we talk about infinity as if

2110
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:09,080
because we talk about infinity as if
 

2111
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,570
because we talk about infinity as if
it's a number but it has plenty of

2112
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:10,580
it's a number but it has plenty of
 

2113
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,160
it's a number but it has plenty of
properties that real numbers don't have

2114
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,170
properties that real numbers don't have
 

2115
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,780
properties that real numbers don't have
you know if you multiply infinity by 2

2116
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:13,790
you know if you multiply infinity by 2
 

2117
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,090
you know if you multiply infinity by 2
you get infinity again right that's a

2118
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:16,100
you get infinity again right that's a
 

2119
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,290
you get infinity again right that's a
little bit different than what we're

2120
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:17,300
little bit different than what we're
 

2121
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,010
little bit different than what we're
used to okay but are you comfortable

2122
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,020
used to okay but are you comfortable
 

2123
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,730
used to okay but are you comfortable
with the idea that in thinking of what

2124
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:24,740
with the idea that in thinking of what
 

2125
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,040
with the idea that in thinking of what
the real world actually is that infinity

2126
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,050
the real world actually is that infinity
 

2127
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,180
the real world actually is that infinity
could be part of that world

2128
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,190
could be part of that world
 

2129
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,460
could be part of that world
are you comfortable that a world in some

2130
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:30,470
are you comfortable that a world in some
 

2131
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,050
are you comfortable that a world in some
dimension and somehow comfortable with

2132
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,060
dimension and somehow comfortable with
 

2133
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,720
dimension and somehow comfortable with
lots of things I mean you know I don't

2134
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:34,730
lots of things I mean you know I don't
 

2135
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:39,310
lots of things I mean you know I don't
want my level of comfort to affect what

2136
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:39,320
want my level of comfort to affect what
 

2137
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,050
want my level of comfort to affect what
I think about the world you know I'm

2138
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,060
I think about the world you know I'm
 

2139
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,250
I think about the world you know I'm
pretty open-minded about what the world

2140
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:42,260
pretty open-minded about what the world
 

2141
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,780
pretty open-minded about what the world
could be at the fundamental level

2142
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:43,790
could be at the fundamental level
 

2143
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,710
could be at the fundamental level
yeah but infinity is a is a tricky one

2144
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:47,720
yeah but infinity is a is a tricky one
 

2145
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,440
yeah but infinity is a is a tricky one
it's not almost a question of comfort

2146
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,450
it's not almost a question of comfort
 

2147
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,970
it's not almost a question of comfort
it's a question of is it an overreach of

2148
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:54,980
it's a question of is it an overreach of
 

2149
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,090
it's a question of is it an overreach of
our intuition sort of it could be a

2150
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,100
our intuition sort of it could be a
 

2151
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,800
our intuition sort of it could be a
convenient almost like when you add a

2152
00:40:59,800 --> 00:40:59,810
convenient almost like when you add a
 

2153
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,750
convenient almost like when you add a
constant to an equation just because

2154
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
constant to an equation just because
 

2155
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,870
constant to an equation just because
it'll help it just feels like it's

2156
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
it'll help it just feels like it's
 

2157
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,970
it'll help it just feels like it's
useful to at least be able to imagine a

2158
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:06,980
useful to at least be able to imagine a
 

2159
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,580
useful to at least be able to imagine a
concept not directly but in some kind of

2160
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:09,590
concept not directly but in some kind of
 

2161
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,730
concept not directly but in some kind of
way that this feels like it's a

2162
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:12,740
way that this feels like it's a
 

2163
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,740
way that this feels like it's a
description of the real world think of

2164
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:14,750
description of the real world think of
 

2165
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,340
description of the real world think of
it this way there's only three numbers

2166
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,350
it this way there's only three numbers
 

2167
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,400
it this way there's only three numbers
that are simple there's zero there's one

2168
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:21,410
that are simple there's zero there's one
 

2169
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:26,740
that are simple there's zero there's one
and there's infinity a number like 318

2170
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:26,750
and there's infinity a number like 318
 

2171
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,530
and there's infinity a number like 318
it's just bizarre like that that you

2172
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:29,540
it's just bizarre like that that you
 

2173
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,690
it's just bizarre like that that you
need a lot of bits to give me what that

2174
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:31,700
need a lot of bits to give me what that
 

2175
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,420
need a lot of bits to give me what that
number is yeah but zero and one infinity

2176
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:34,430
number is yeah but zero and one infinity
 

2177
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,040
number is yeah but zero and one infinity
like once you have 300 things you might

2178
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,050
like once you have 300 things you might
 

2179
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,210
like once you have 300 things you might
as well have infinity things right

2180
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:37,220
as well have infinity things right
 

2181
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,650
as well have infinity things right
otherwise yet to say how when to stop

2182
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:38,660
otherwise yet to say how when to stop
 

2183
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,600
otherwise yet to say how when to stop
making the thing that's right so there's

2184
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:40,610
making the thing that's right so there's
 

2185
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,580
making the thing that's right so there's
a sense in which infinity is a very

2186
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:42,590
a sense in which infinity is a very
 

2187
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,130
a sense in which infinity is a very
natural number of things to exist that I

2188
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,140
natural number of things to exist that I
 

2189
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,630
natural number of things to exist that I
was never comfortable with it because

2190
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
was never comfortable with it because
 

2191
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,880
was never comfortable with it because
it's just such a kick but it was a too

2192
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:48,890
it's just such a kick but it was a too
 

2193
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,140
it's just such a kick but it was a too
good to be true mmm

2194
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,150
good to be true mmm
 

2195
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,920
good to be true mmm
because in math it just helps make

2196
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:53,930
because in math it just helps make
 

2197
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,650
because in math it just helps make
things work out when things get very

2198
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:56,660
things work out when things get very
 

2199
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,680
things work out when things get very

00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,160
what is real one how does that make you
 

2255
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,280
what is real one how does that make you
feel and and two what does it then mean

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,290
feel and and two what does it then mean
 

2257
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,370
feel and and two what does it then mean
to observe something and why is it

00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:18,380
to observe something and why is it
 

2259
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,800
to observe something and why is it
different that what is real yeah you

2260
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:20,810
different that what is real yeah you
 

2261
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,340
different that what is real yeah you
know I my personal feelings such as it

2262
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:24,350
know I my personal feelings such as it
 

2263
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,880
know I my personal feelings such as it
is is that things like measurement and

2264
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:27,890
is is that things like measurement and
 

2265
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,010
is is that things like measurement and
observers and stuff like that are not

2266
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:30,020
observers and stuff like that are not
 

2267
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,810
observers and stuff like that are not
going to play a fundamental role in the

2268
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:31,820
going to play a fundamental role in the
 

2269
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,880
going to play a fundamental role in the
ultimate laws of physics but my feeling

2270
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:33,890
ultimate laws of physics but my feeling
 

2271
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,370
ultimate laws of physics but my feeling
that way is because so far that's where

2272
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:36,380
that way is because so far that's where
 

2273
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,410
that way is because so far that's where
all the evidence has been pointing I

2274
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:38,420
all the evidence has been pointing I
 

2275
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,720
all the evidence has been pointing I
could be wrong and there's certainly a

2276
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:40,730
could be wrong and there's certainly a
 

2277
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,730
could be wrong and there's certainly a
sense in which it would be infinitely

2278
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:42,740
sense in which it would be infinitely
 

2279
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,260
sense in which it would be infinitely
cool if somehow observation or mental

2280
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:47,270
cool if somehow observation or mental
 

2281
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,570
cool if somehow observation or mental
cogitation did play a fundamental role

2282
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:49,580
cogitation did play a fundamental role
 

2283
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,360
cogitation did play a fundamental role
in the in the nature of reality but I

2284
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:52,370
in the in the nature of reality but I
 

2285
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,830
in the in the nature of reality but I
don't think so I can I don't see any

2286
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:53,840
don't think so I can I don't see any
 

2287
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,120
don't think so I can I don't see any
evidence for it so I'm not spending a

2288
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,130
evidence for it so I'm not spending a
 

2289
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,350
evidence for it so I'm not spending a
lot of time worrying about that

2290
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:56,360
lot of time worrying about that
 

2291
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,200
lot of time worrying about that
possibility so what do you do about the

2292
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,210
possibility so what do you do about the
 

2293
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,970
possibility so what do you do about the
fact that in the textbook interpretation

2294
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:00,980
fact that in the textbook interpretation
 

2295
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,560
fact that in the textbook interpretation
of quantum mechanics this idea of

2296
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:02,570
of quantum mechanics this idea of
 

2297
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:06,040
of quantum mechanics this idea of
measurement or looking at things seems

2298
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,050
measurement or looking at things seems
 

2299
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,800
measurement or looking at things seems
to play an important role well you you

2300
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:08,810
to play an important role well you you
 

2301
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,420
to play an important role well you you
come up with better interpretations of

2302
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:10,430
come up with better interpretations of
 

2303
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,620
come up with better interpretations of
quantum mechanics and there are several

2304
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:11,630
quantum mechanics and there are several
 

2305
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,330
quantum mechanics and there are several
alternatives my favorite is the

2306
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:13,340
alternatives my favorite is the
 

2307
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,610
alternatives my favorite is the
many-worlds interpretation which says

2308
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:15,620
many-worlds interpretation which says
 

2309
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,720
many-worlds interpretation which says
two things number one you the observer

2310
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:19,730
two things number one you the observer
 

2311
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,850
two things number one you the observer
are just a quantum system like anything

2312
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:21,860
are just a quantum system like anything
 

2313
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,170
are just a quantum system like anything
else there's nothing special about you

2314
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:23,180

don't get so proud of yourself you know

2316
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:25,340
don't get so proud of yourself you know
 

2317
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,490
don't get so proud of yourself you know
you're just a bunch of atoms you have a

2318
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:27,500
you're just a bunch of atoms you have a
 

2319
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,470
you're just a bunch of atoms you have a
wavefunction you obey the Schrodinger

2320
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:29,480

something or observing something what's
 

2327
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,720
something or observing something what's
really happening is you're becoming

00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:37,730
really happening is you're becoming
 

2329
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,020
really happening is you're becoming
entangled with that thing so when you

2330
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,030
entangled with that thing so when you
 

2331
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,310
entangled with that thing so when you
think there's a wavefunction for the

2332
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:42,320
think there's a wavefunction for the
 

2333
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,020
think there's a wavefunction for the
electron it's all spread out but you

00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,030
electron it's all spread out but you
 

2335
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,520

2337
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,040

00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,050
location what's really happening is that
 

2339
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,480

there's still the wave functions the

there's still the wave functions the
 

2341
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,130
there's still the wave functions the

electron in all those locations but now
 

2343
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,560

it's entangled with the wave function of

it's entangled with the wave function of
 

2345
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,380
it's entangled with the wave function of

what the Schrodinger equation is telling
you it's telling you that you have a

00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:08,000
let's back out yeah

let's back out yeah
whatever it really says what his theory

whatever it really says what his theory
 

2417
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,520
whatever it really says what his theory
is is there's a wave function of the

2418
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:12,530
is is there's a wave function of the
 

2419
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,000
is is there's a wave function of the

theory right there okay the question all
 

2427
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,550
theory right there okay the question all
of the work is how in the world do you

2428
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:24,560
of the work is how in the world do you
 

2429
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,400
of the work is how in the world do you
map that theory on to reality on to what

2430
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,410
map that theory on to reality on to what
 

2431
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,950
map that theory on to reality on to what
we observe right so part of it is

2432
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:29,960
we observe right so part of it is
 

2433
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,320
we observe right so part of it is
carving up the wavefunction into these

carving up the wavefunction into these
 

2435
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,850
carving up the wavefunction into these
separate worlds saying look look it

2436
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:33,860
separate worlds saying look look it
 

2437
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,050

00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:35,060
describes a whole bunch of things that
 

2439
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,220
describes a whole bunch of things that
don't interact with each other let's

2440
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:36,230
don't interact with each other let's
 

2441
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,470
don't interact with each other let's
call them separate worlds another part

2442
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
call them separate worlds another part
 

2443
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,540
call them separate worlds another part
is distinguishing between systems and

00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:40,550
is distinguishing between systems and
 

2445
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,430
is distinguishing between systems and

their environments and the environment
 

2447
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,320
their environments and the environment
is basically all the degrees of freedom

2448
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:44,330
is basically all the degrees of freedom

00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,940
is basically all the degrees of freedom
all the things going on in the world

all the things going on in the world
that you don't keep track of so again in

2452
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:48,950
that you don't keep track of so again in
 

2453
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,100
that you don't keep track of so again in
the bottle of water I might keep track

2454
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,110
the bottle of water I might keep track
 

2455
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,080
the bottle of water I might keep track
of the total amount of water and the

00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,820
of the total amount of water and the

don't keep track of all the photons or
 

2463
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,940
don't keep track of all the photons or
the air molecules in this room so that's

00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:00,950
the air molecules in this room so that's
 

2465
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,920

asking about the behavior of some
 

2473
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:13,180
asking about the behavior of some
subsystem of it so how many worlds are

2474
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:13,190
subsystem of it so how many worlds are
 

2475
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,110
subsystem of it so how many worlds are
there you want to know that one either

2476
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:16,120
there you want to know that one either
 

2477
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,850
there you want to know that one either
there could be an infinite number there

2478
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:18,860
there could be an infinite number there
 

2479
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,260
there could be an infinite number there
could be only a finite number but it's a

2480
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,270
could be only a finite number but it's a
 

2481
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,300
could be only a finite number but it's a
big number one way or the other it's a

2482
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:22,310
big number one way or the other it's a
 

2483
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:23,840
big number one way or the other it's a
very very big number

2484

very very big number
 

2485
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,600
very very big number
one of you talked somebody asked well if

2486
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:26,610
one of you talked somebody asked well if
 

2487
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:31,030
one of you talked somebody asked well if
it's a if it's finite

00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,040
it's a if it's finite
 

2489
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,160
it's a if it's finite
so actually I'm not sure exactly the

2490
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,170
so actually I'm not sure exactly the
 

2491
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,830
so actually I'm not sure exactly the
logic you used to derive this but is

2492
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:36,840
logic you used to derive this but is
 

2493
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:43,330
logic you used to derive this but is
there you know going to be the you know

2494
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:43,340
there you know going to be the you know
 

2495
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,130
there you know going to be the you know
overlap a duplicate world that you

2496
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:46,140
overlap a duplicate world that you
 

2497
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,860
overlap a duplicate world that you
return to so you've mentioned and I'd

2498
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:48,870
return to so you've mentioned and I'd
 

2499
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,630
return to so you've mentioned and I'd
love if you can elaborate on sort of

2500
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
love if you can elaborate on sort of
 

2501
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,550
love if you can elaborate on sort of
idea that it's possible that there's

2502
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:52,560
idea that it's possible that there's
 

2503
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,400
idea that it's possible that there's
some kind of equilibrium that these

2504
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,410
some kind of equilibrium that these
 

2505
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,840
some kind of equilibrium that these
splitting worlds arrive at and then

2506
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:56,850
splitting worlds arrive at and then
 

2507
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:00,350
splitting worlds arrive at and then
maybe over time maybe somehow connected

2508
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:00,360
maybe over time maybe somehow connected
 

2509
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,380
maybe over time maybe somehow connected
to entropy you get a large number of

2510
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:03,390
to entropy you get a large number of
 

2511
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,670
to entropy you get a large number of
worlds they're very similar to each

2512
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:04,680
worlds they're very similar to each
 

2513
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,800
worlds they're very similar to each
other yeah so this question of whether

2514
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:06,810
other yeah so this question of whether
 

2515
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,010
other yeah so this question of whether
or not Hilbert space is finite or

2516
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:10,020
or not Hilbert space is finite or
 

2517
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,380
or not Hilbert space is finite or
infinite dimensional is actually

2518
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:12,390
infinite dimensional is actually
 

2519
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,570
infinite dimensional is actually
secretly connected to gravity and

2520
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:14,580
secretly connected to gravity and
 

2521
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,270
secretly connected to gravity and
cosmology this is a the part that we're

2522
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
cosmology this is a the part that we're
 

2523
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,560
cosmology this is a the part that we're
still struggling to understand right now

2524
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:18,570
still struggling to understand right now
 

2525
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,630
still struggling to understand right now
but we discovered back in 1998 that our

2526
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
but we discovered back in 1998 that our
 

2527
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,420
but we discovered back in 1998 that our
universe is accelerating and what that

2528
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:23,430
universe is accelerating and what that
 

2529
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,580
universe is accelerating and what that
means if it continues which we think it

2530
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:25,590
means if it continues which we think it
 

2531
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,050
means if it continues which we think it
probably will but we're not sure but if

2532
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:27,060
probably will but we're not sure but if
 

2533
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,210
probably will but we're not sure but if
it does that means there's a horizon

2534
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:29,220
it does that means there's a horizon
 

2535
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,460
it does that means there's a horizon
around us there there's because the

2536
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,470
around us there there's because the
 

2537
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,720
around us there there's because the
universe not only expanding but

2538
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:32,730
universe not only expanding but
 

2539
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,880
universe not only expanding but
expanding faster and faster things can

2540
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:34,890
expanding faster and faster things can
 

2541
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,460
expanding faster and faster things can
get so far away from us that from our

2542
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:37,470
get so far away from us that from our
 

2543
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,650
get so far away from us that from our
perspective it looks like they're moving

2544
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:39,660
perspective it looks like they're moving
 

2545
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,760
perspective it looks like they're moving
away faster than the speed of light

2546
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:40,770
away faster than the speed of light
 

2547
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,320
away faster than the speed of light
you'll never see them again

2548
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:42,330
you'll never see them again
 

2549
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,150
you'll never see them again
so there's literally a horizon around us

2550
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
so there's literally a horizon around us
 

2551
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,640
so there's literally a horizon around us
and that horizon approaches some fixed

2552
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:46,650
and that horizon approaches some fixed
 

2553
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:49,160
and that horizon approaches some fixed
distance away from us and you can then

2554
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,170
distance away from us and you can then
 

2555
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,950
distance away from us and you can then
argue that within that horizon there's

2556
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:51,960
argue that within that horizon there's
 

2557
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,390
argue that within that horizon there's
only a finite number of things that can

2558
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:53,400
only a finite number of things that can
 

2559
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,280
only a finite number of things that can
possibly happen the finite dimensional

2560
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,290
possibly happen the finite dimensional
 

2561
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,900
possibly happen the finite dimensional
hilbert space in fact we even have a

2562
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:56,910
hilbert space in fact we even have a
 

2563
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:58,970
hilbert space in fact we even have a
guess for what the dimensionality is

2564
00:48:58,970 --> 00:48:58,980
guess for what the dimensionality is
 

2565
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,270
guess for what the dimensionality is
it's 10 to the power of 10 to the power

2566
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:02,280
it's 10 to the power of 10 to the power
 

2567
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,750
it's 10 to the power of 10 to the power
of 122 that's a very large number yes

2568
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760
of 122 that's a very large number yes
 

2569
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,880
of 122 that's a very large number yes
just to compare the age of the universe

2570
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:07,890
just to compare the age of the universe
 

2571
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:10,580
just to compare the age of the universe
is something like 10 to the 14 seconds

2572
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:10,590
is something like 10 to the 14 seconds
 

2573
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,340
is something like 10 to the 14 seconds
10 to the 17 or 18 seconds maybe the

2574
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:13,350
10 to the 17 or 18 seconds maybe the
 

2575
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,690
10 to the 17 or 18 seconds maybe the
number of particles in the universe is

2576
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:14,700
number of particles in the universe is
 

2577
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,030
number of particles in the universe is
10 to the 88th but the number of

2578
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:17,040
10 to the 88th but the number of
 

2579
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,400
10 to the 88th but the number of
dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the

2580
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,410
dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the
 

2581
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,830
dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the
10 to the 120 - so that's just crazy

2582
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:21,840
10 to the 120 - so that's just crazy
 

2583
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,430
10 to the 120 - so that's just crazy
thing if that story is right that in our

2584
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
thing if that story is right that in our
 

2585
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,350
thing if that story is right that in our
observable horizon there's only a finite

2586
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:27,360
observable horizon there's only a finite
 

2587
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,230
observable horizon there's only a finite
dimensional hilbert space then this idea

2588
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:30,240
dimensional hilbert space then this idea
 

2589
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,180
dimensional hilbert space then this idea
of branching of the wavefunction the

2590
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:32,190
of branching of the wavefunction the
 

2591
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,790
of branching of the wavefunction the
universe into multiple distinct separate

2592
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
universe into multiple distinct separate
 

2593
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,250
universe into multiple distinct separate
branches has to reach a limit at

2594
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:37,260
branches has to reach a limit at
 

2595
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,320
branches has to reach a limit at
once you read branched that many times

2596
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:39,330
once you read branched that many times
 

2597
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,880
once you read branched that many times
you've run out of room in hilbert space

2598
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:40,890
you've run out of room in hilbert space
 

2599
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,730
you've run out of room in hilbert space
and roughly speaking that corresponds to

2600
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:43,740
and roughly speaking that corresponds to
 

2601
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,220
and roughly speaking that corresponds to
the universe just expanding and emptying

2602
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:46,230
the universe just expanding and emptying
 

2603
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,650
the universe just expanding and emptying
out and cooling off and and entering a

2604
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:48,660
out and cooling off and and entering a
 

2605
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,109
out and cooling off and and entering a
phase where it's just empty space

2606
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:50,119
phase where it's just empty space
 

2607
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,960
phase where it's just empty space
literally forever what's the difference

2608
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:53,970
literally forever what's the difference
 

2609
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:57,680
literally forever what's the difference
between splitting and copying do you

2610
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:57,690
between splitting and copying do you
 

2611
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,710
between splitting and copying do you
think like in terms of a lot of this is

2612
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:00,720
think like in terms of a lot of this is
 

2613
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,470
think like in terms of a lot of this is
an interpretation that's that helps us

2614
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:05,480
an interpretation that's that helps us
 

2615
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,740
an interpretation that's that helps us
sort of model the world so perhaps

2616
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:09,750
sort of model the world so perhaps
 

2617
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,210
sort of model the world so perhaps
shouldn't be thought of as like you know

2618
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:13,220
shouldn't be thought of as like you know
 

2619
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,810
shouldn't be thought of as like you know
philosophically or metaphysically but in

2620
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:17,820
philosophically or metaphysically but in
 

2621
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,330
philosophically or metaphysically but in
even at the physics level do you see a

2622
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:20,340
even at the physics level do you see a
 

2623
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,630
even at the physics level do you see a
difference between two generating new

2624
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:23,640
difference between two generating new
 

2625
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,200
difference between two generating new
copies of the world or splitting I think

2626
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,210
copies of the world or splitting I think
 

2627
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,359
copies of the world or splitting I think
it's better to think of in quantum

2628
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:29,369
it's better to think of in quantum
 

2629
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:30,980
it's better to think of in quantum
mechanics in many worlds the universe

2630
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:30,990
mechanics in many worlds the universe
 

2631
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,260
mechanics in many worlds the universe
splits rather than new copies because

2632
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:33,270
splits rather than new copies because
 

2633
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:34,670
splits rather than new copies because
people otherwise worry about things like

2634
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:34,680
people otherwise worry about things like
 

2635
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,099
people otherwise worry about things like
energy conservation and no one who

2636
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:37,109
energy conservation and no one who
 

2637
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:38,960
energy conservation and no one who
understands quantum mechanics worries

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:38,970
understands quantum mechanics worries
 

2639
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,430
understands quantum mechanics worries
about energy conservation because the

2640
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:40,440
about energy conservation because the
 

2641
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,680
about energy conservation because the
equation is perfectly clear but if all

2642
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:42,690
equation is perfectly clear but if all
 

2643
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,060
equation is perfectly clear but if all
you know is that someone told you the

2644
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,070
you know is that someone told you the
 

2645
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,320
you know is that someone told you the
universe duplicates then you have a

2646
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,330
universe duplicates then you have a
 

2647
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,609
universe duplicates then you have a
reasonable worry about where all the

2648
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:46,619
reasonable worry about where all the
 

2649
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:49,040
reasonable worry about where all the
energy for that came from so a

2650
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,050
energy for that came from so a
 

2651
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,349
energy for that came from so a
pre-existing universe splitting into two

2652
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:51,359
pre-existing universe splitting into two
 

2653
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,480
pre-existing universe splitting into two
skinnier universes is a better way of

2654
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:53,490
skinnier universes is a better way of
 

2655
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,280
skinnier universes is a better way of
thinking about it and mathematically

2656
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,290
thinking about it and mathematically
 

2657
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,780
thinking about it and mathematically
it's just like you know if you draw an x

2658
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:56,790
it's just like you know if you draw an x
 

2659
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:59,090
it's just like you know if you draw an x
and y axis and you draw a vector of

2660
00:50:59,090 --> 00:50:59,100
and y axis and you draw a vector of
 

2661
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,760
and y axis and you draw a vector of
length 1 45-degree angle

2662
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:01,770
length 1 45-degree angle
 

2663
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,740
length 1 45-degree angle
you you know that you can write that

2664
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:03,750
you you know that you can write that
 

2665
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,109
you you know that you can write that
vector of length 1 as the sum of two

2666
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:06,119
vector of length 1 as the sum of two
 

2667
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,050
vector of length 1 as the sum of two
vectors pointing along x and y of length

2668
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:09,060
vectors pointing along x and y of length
 

2669
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,570
vectors pointing along x and y of length
1 over the square root of 2 ok

2670
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:11,580
1 over the square root of 2 ok
 

2671
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,670
1 over the square root of 2 ok
so I write one arrow as the sum of two

2672
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:13,680
so I write one arrow as the sum of two
 

2673
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,130
so I write one arrow as the sum of two
arrows but there's a conservation of air

2674
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:16,140
arrows but there's a conservation of air
 

2675
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,320
arrows but there's a conservation of air
Onis right like if now two arrows but

2676
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,330
Onis right like if now two arrows but
 

2677
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:19,910
Onis right like if now two arrows but
the length is the same I just I'm

2678
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:19,920
the length is the same I just I'm
 

2679
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,859
the length is the same I just I'm
describing it in a different way and

2680
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:21,869
describing it in a different way and
 

2681
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,330
describing it in a different way and
that's exactly what happens when the

2682
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:23,340
that's exactly what happens when the
 

2683
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,250
that's exactly what happens when the
universe branches the the wave function

2684
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:25,260
universe branches the the wave function
 

2685
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,380
universe branches the the wave function
of the universe is a big old vector so

2686
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:27,390
of the universe is a big old vector so
 

2687
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,380
of the universe is a big old vector so
to somebody who brings up a question of

2688
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:30,390
to somebody who brings up a question of
 

2689
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,380
to somebody who brings up a question of
saying doesn't this violate the

2690
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:33,390
saying doesn't this violate the
 

2691
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,109
saying doesn't this violate the
conservation of energy can you give

2692
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:36,119
conservation of energy can you give
 

2693
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,380
conservation of energy can you give
further elaboration right so let's just

2694
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:39,390
further elaboration right so let's just
 

2695
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,750
further elaboration right so let's just
be SuperDuper perfectly clear yeah

2696
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
be SuperDuper perfectly clear yeah
 

2697
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,300
be SuperDuper perfectly clear yeah
there's zero question about whether or

2698
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:44,310
there's zero question about whether or
 

2699
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,370
there's zero question about whether or
not many-worlds violates conservation of

2700
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:46,380
not many-worlds violates conservation of
 

2701
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,290
not many-worlds violates conservation of
energy yes it does not great and I say

2702
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:48,300
energy yes it does not great and I say
 

2703
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,060
energy yes it does not great and I say
this definitively because there are

2704
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:50,070
this definitively because there are
 

2705
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,030
this definitively because there are
other questions

2706
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,040
other questions
 

2707
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,410
other questions
I think there's answers too but they're

2708
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:52,420
I think there's answers too but they're
 

2709
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,540
I think there's answers too but they're
legitimate questions right about you

2710
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:54,550
legitimate questions right about you
 

2711
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,860
legitimate questions right about you
know where does probability come from

2712
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:55,870
know where does probability come from
 

2713
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,810
know where does probability come from
and things like that this conservation

2714
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:57,820
and things like that this conservation
 

2715
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,970
and things like that this conservation
of energy question we know the answer to

2716
00:51:59,970 --> 00:51:59,980
of energy question we know the answer to
 

2717
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,620
of energy question we know the answer to
it and the answer to it is that energy

2718
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:01,630
it and the answer to it is that energy
 

2719
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,960
it and the answer to it is that energy
is conserved all of the effort goes into

2720
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:03,970
is conserved all of the effort goes into
 

2721
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,050
is conserved all of the effort goes into
how best to translate what the equation

2722
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:07,060
how best to translate what the equation
 

2723
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,420
how best to translate what the equation
unambiguously says into think plain

2724
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,430
unambiguously says into think plain
 

2725
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,680
unambiguously says into think plain
English right

2726
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:10,690
English right
 

2727
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,390
English right
so this idea that there's a universe

2728
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,400
so this idea that there's a universe
 

2729
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,040
so this idea that there's a universe
that has that that the universe comes

2730
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,050
that has that that the universe comes
 

2731
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,170
that has that that the universe comes
equipped with a thickness and it sort of

2732
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:16,180
equipped with a thickness and it sort of
 

2733
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,210
equipped with a thickness and it sort of
divides up into thinner pieces but the

2734
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:18,220
divides up into thinner pieces but the
 

2735
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,370
divides up into thinner pieces but the
total amount of universe is is conserved

2736
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:20,380
total amount of universe is is conserved
 

2737
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,910
total amount of universe is is conserved
over time is a reasonably good way of

2738
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920
over time is a reasonably good way of
 

2739
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,980
over time is a reasonably good way of
putting English words to the underlying

2740
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:25,990
putting English words to the underlying
 

2741
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,320
putting English words to the underlying
mathematics so one of my favorite things

2742
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,330
mathematics so one of my favorite things
 

2743
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:32,340
mathematics so one of my favorite things
about many worlds is I mean I love that

2744
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:32,350
about many worlds is I mean I love that
 

2745
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,140
about many worlds is I mean I love that
there's something controversial in

2746
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:34,150
there's something controversial in
 

2747
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,110
there's something controversial in
science and for some reason it makes

2748
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:37,120
science and for some reason it makes
 

2749
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,470
science and for some reason it makes
people actually not like upset but just

2750
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
people actually not like upset but just
 

2751
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,920
people actually not like upset but just
get excited why do you think it is a

2752
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:43,930
get excited why do you think it is a
 

2753
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,710
get excited why do you think it is a
controversial idea so there's there's a

2754
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:46,720
controversial idea so there's there's a
 

2755
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,430
controversial idea so there's there's a
lot of it's actually one of the cleanest

2756
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,440
lot of it's actually one of the cleanest
 

2757
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,960
lot of it's actually one of the cleanest
ways to think about quantum mechanics

2758
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:51,970
ways to think about quantum mechanics
 

2759
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,200
ways to think about quantum mechanics
yeah so why do you think there's a

2760
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,210
yeah so why do you think there's a
 

2761
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,850
yeah so why do you think there's a
discomfort a little bit among certain

2762
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:56,860
discomfort a little bit among certain
 

2763
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,360
discomfort a little bit among certain
people

2764
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:57,370
people
 

2765
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,220
people
well I draw the distinction of my book

2766
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,230
well I draw the distinction of my book
 

2767
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,230
well I draw the distinction of my book
between two different kinds of

2768
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:01,240
between two different kinds of
 

2769
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,030
between two different kinds of
simplicity in a physical theory there's

2770
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
simplicity in a physical theory there's
 

2771
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,060
simplicity in a physical theory there's
simplicity in the theory itself right

2772
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,070
simplicity in the theory itself right
 

2773
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,650
simplicity in the theory itself right
how we describe what's going on

2774
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:07,660
how we describe what's going on
 

2775
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,120
how we describe what's going on
according to the theory by its own

2776
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:09,130
according to the theory by its own
 

2777
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,160
according to the theory by its own
rights but then you know a theory is

2778
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,170
rights but then you know a theory is
 

2779
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,720
rights but then you know a theory is
just some sort of abstract mathematical

2780
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:12,730
just some sort of abstract mathematical
 

2781
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,580
just some sort of abstract mathematical
formalism you have to map it onto the

2782
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:14,590
formalism you have to map it onto the
 

2783
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:18,150
formalism you have to map it onto the
world somehow right and sometimes like

2784
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160
world somehow right and sometimes like
 

2785
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,820
world somehow right and sometimes like
for Newtonian physics it's pretty

2786
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:20,830
for Newtonian physics it's pretty
 

2787
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,640
for Newtonian physics it's pretty
obvious like okay here is a bottle and

2788
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:23,650
obvious like okay here is a bottle and
 

2789
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,250
obvious like okay here is a bottle and
as a center of mass and things like that

2790
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:25,260
as a center of mass and things like that
 

2791
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,780
as a center of mass and things like that
sometimes it's a little bit harder with

2792
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:27,790
sometimes it's a little bit harder with
 

2793
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,520
sometimes it's a little bit harder with
general relativity curvature of

2794
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:29,530
general relativity curvature of
 

2795
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,380
general relativity curvature of
space-time is a little bit harder to

2796
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:31,390
space-time is a little bit harder to
 

2797
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:34,560
space-time is a little bit harder to
grasp quantum mechanics is very hard to

2798
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:34,570
grasp quantum mechanics is very hard to
 

2799
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,930
grasp quantum mechanics is very hard to
map what you're the language you're

2800
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:36,940
map what you're the language you're
 

2801
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,460
map what you're the language you're
talking into wave functions and things

2802
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:38,470
talking into wave functions and things
 

2803
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,400
talking into wave functions and things
like that on to reality and many worlds

2804
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,410
like that on to reality and many worlds
 

2805
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:42,900
like that on to reality and many worlds
is the version of quantum mechanics

2806
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:42,910
is the version of quantum mechanics
 

2807
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,330
is the version of quantum mechanics
where it is hardest to map on the

2808
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:45,340
where it is hardest to map on the
 

2809
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,850
where it is hardest to map on the
underlying formalism to reality so

2810
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:47,860
underlying formalism to reality so
 

2811
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,950
underlying formalism to reality so
that's where the lack of simplicity

2812
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:49,960
that's where the lack of simplicity
 

2813
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,650
that's where the lack of simplicity
comes in not in the theory but in how we

2814
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:52,660
comes in not in the theory but in how we
 

2815
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,960
comes in not in the theory but in how we
use the theory to map on to reality and

2816
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:54,970
use the theory to map on to reality and
 

2817
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,970
use the theory to map on to reality and
in fact all of the work in sort of

2818

it of course you should give up on that

2834
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:17,620
it of course you should give up on that
 

2835
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,870
it of course you should give up on that
skepticism if there are no alternatives

2836

skepticism if there are no alternatives
 

2837
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,730
skepticism if there are no alternatives
and this theory always keeps working

2838
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:20,740
and this theory always keeps working
 

2839
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,080

then eventually you should overcome your

then eventually you should overcome your
 

2841
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,970
then eventually you should overcome your

skepticism but right now there are
 

2843
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,190
skepticism but right now there are
alternatives and that are that you know

alternatives and that are that you know
 

2845
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,200
alternatives and that are that you know
people work to make alternatives that

2846
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,210
people work to make alternatives that
 

2847
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,450
people work to make alternatives that
are by their nature closer to what we

it so the the Copenhagen interpretation

2854
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:36,160
it so the the Copenhagen interpretation
 

2855
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,110
it so the the Copenhagen interpretation
and the many-worlds

2856
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,120
and the many-worlds
 

2857
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,820
and the many-worlds
maybe there's a difference between the

2858
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:41,830
maybe there's a difference between the
 

2859
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,880
maybe there's a difference between the

there they look like waves and particles
 

2923

there they look like waves and particles
because there are both waves and

because there are both waves and
 

2925
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,990
because there are both waves and

the wave function roughly it becomes
 

2935
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,530
the wave function roughly it becomes
much harder when you take quantum field

2936

so in the conventional textbook
 

2945
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:21,729
so in the conventional textbook
interpretation we say when you look at a

00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,929
collapses and you see it in one location
a spontaneous collapse theory says that

2952
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:27,939
a spontaneous collapse theory says that
 

2953
00:56:27,939 --> 00:56:33,130
a spontaneous collapse theory says that
every particle has a chance per second

2954

every particle has a chance per second
 

2955
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,319
every particle has a chance per second
of having its wavefunction spontaneously

00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:35,329
of having its wavefunction spontaneously
 

2957
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:37,719
of having its wavefunction spontaneously
collapse the chance is very small for a

00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:42,949
even once but in a table or some
 

2965
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:44,469

2967
00:56:44,479 --> 00:56:46,569
macroscopic object there are way more
than a hundred million particles and

2968
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:46,579
than a hundred million particles and
 

2969
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:48,189
than a hundred million particles and
they're all entangled with each other so

2970
00:56:48,189 --> 00:56:48,199
they're all entangled with each other so
 

2971
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:49,809
they're all entangled with each other so
when one of them clacks it collapses it

2972
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:49,819
when one of them clacks it collapses it
 

2973
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:51,870
when one of them clacks it collapses it
brings everything else along with it

2974
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:51,880
brings everything else along with it
 

2975
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,069
brings everything else along with it
there's a slight variation of this

00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:55,459
that's a spontaneous collapse theory
 

2979
00:56:55,459 --> 00:56:57,099
that's a spontaneous collapse theory
there are also induced collapse theories

2980
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:57,109
there are also induced collapse theories
 

2981
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:59,439
there are also induced collapse theories
like Roger Penrose thinks that when the

3003
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:21,849

new variables or collapse theories which

3004
00:57:21,849 --> 00:57:21,859
new variables or collapse theories which
 

3005

the wave function sometimes obeys the

the wave function sometimes obeys the

00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:25,569
the wave function sometimes obeys the

3008
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:25,579
Schrodinger equation and sometimes it
 

3009
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,219
Schrodinger equation and sometimes it
collapses so you can see that the

3010
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:27,229
collapses so you can see that the
 

3011
00:57:27,229 --> 00:57:29,049
collapses so you can see that the
alternatives are more complicated in

00:57:29,049 --> 00:57:29,059
alternatives are more complicated in
 

3013
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:31,839
alternatives are more complicated in
their formalism than many-worlds is but

3014
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:31,849
their formalism than many-worlds is but
 

3015
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:34,390
their formalism than many-worlds is but
they are closer to our experience so

3016
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:34,400
they are closer to our experience so
 

3017
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,269
they are closer to our experience so
just this moment of collapse do you

just this moment of collapse do you
 

3019
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:41,069
just this moment of collapse do you

00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,989
version of quantum mechanics and I am
someone who is very willing to put a lot

3136
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:52,999
someone who is very willing to put a lot
 

3137
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:55,299
someone who is very willing to put a lot
of work into mapping the formalism onto

3138
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:55,309
of work into mapping the formalism onto
 

3139
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:57,130
of work into mapping the formalism onto
reality I'm less willing to complicate

3140
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:57,140
reality I'm less willing to complicate
 

3141
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,650
reality I'm less willing to complicate
the formalism itself but the other big

3142
00:59:59,650 --> 00:59:59,660
the formalism itself but the other big
 

3143
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,150
the formalism itself but the other big
reason is that there's something called

3144
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:01,160
reason is that there's something called
 

3145
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,390
reason is that there's something called
modern physics with quantum fields and

3146
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:04,400
modern physics with quantum fields and
 

3147
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,249
modern physics with quantum fields and
quantum gravity and holography and

3148
01:00:06,249 --> 01:00:06,259
quantum gravity and holography and
 

3149
01:00:06,259 --> 01:00:08,549
quantum gravity and holography and
space-time doing things like that and

3150
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:08,559
space-time doing things like that and
 

3151
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,769
space-time doing things like that and
when you take any of the other versions

3152
01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:11,779
when you take any of the other versions
 

3153
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:13,689
when you take any of the other versions
of quantum theory they bring along

3154
01:00:13,689 --> 01:00:13,699
of quantum theory they bring along
 

3155
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:16,029
of quantum theory they bring along
classical baggage all of the other

3156
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:16,039
classical baggage all of the other
 

3157
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:19,449
classical baggage all of the other
versions of quantum mechanics prejudice

3158
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:19,459
versions of quantum mechanics prejudice
 

3159
01:00:19,459 --> 01:00:22,599
versions of quantum mechanics prejudice
or privilege some version of classical

3160
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:22,609
or privilege some version of classical
 

3161
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:25,390
or privilege some version of classical
reality like locations in space okay and

3162
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:25,400
reality like locations in space okay and
 

3163
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,380
reality like locations in space okay and
I think that that's a barrier to doing

3164
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,390
I think that that's a barrier to doing
 

3165
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,819
I think that that's a barrier to doing
better at understanding the theory of

3166
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:30,829
better at understanding the theory of
 

3167
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:32,049
better at understanding the theory of
everything and understanding quantum

3168
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:32,059
everything and understanding quantum
 

3169
01:00:32,059 --> 01:00:33,459
everything and understanding quantum
gravity and the emergence of space-time

3170
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:33,469
gravity and the emergence of space-time
 

3171
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:35,890
gravity and the emergence of space-time
whenever if you change your theory from

3172
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:35,900
whenever if you change your theory from
 

3173
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,349
whenever if you change your theory from
you know here's a harmonic oscillator oh

3174
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:38,359
you know here's a harmonic oscillator oh
 

3175
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:40,239
you know here's a harmonic oscillator oh
there's a spin here's an electromagnetic

3176
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:40,249
there's a spin here's an electromagnetic
 

3177
01:00:40,249 --> 01:00:42,849
there's a spin here's an electromagnetic
field in hidden variable theories or

3178
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:42,859
field in hidden variable theories or
 

3179
01:00:42,859 --> 01:00:44,289
field in hidden variable theories or
dynamical collapse theories you have to

3180
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:44,299
dynamical collapse theories you have to
 

3181
01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:45,520
dynamical collapse theories you have to
start from scratch

3182
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:45,530
start from scratch
 

3183
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,080
start from scratch
what are the hidden variables for this

3184
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:47,090
what are the hidden variables for this
 

3185
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,400
what are the hidden variables for this
theory or how does he collapse or

3186
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:48,410
theory or how does he collapse or
 

3187
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:48,850
theory or how does he collapse or
whatever

3188
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:48,860
whatever
 

3189
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,860
whatever
whereas many-worlds is plug-and-play you

3190
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:50,870
whereas many-worlds is plug-and-play you
 

3191
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,330
whereas many-worlds is plug-and-play you
tell me the theory and I can give you as

3192
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:52,340
tell me the theory and I can give you as
 

3193
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,550
tell me the theory and I can give you as
many worlds version so when we have a

3194
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:54,560
many worlds version so when we have a
 

3195
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,380
many worlds version so when we have a
situation like we have with gravity and

3196
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:56,390
situation like we have with gravity and
 

3197
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,930
situation like we have with gravity and
space-time where the classical

3198
01:00:58,930 --> 01:00:58,940
space-time where the classical
 

3199
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,670
space-time where the classical
description seems to break down in a

3200
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:00,680
description seems to break down in a
 

3201
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,550
description seems to break down in a
dramatic way then I think you should

3202
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:03,560
dramatic way then I think you should
 

3203
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,230
dramatic way then I think you should
start from the most quantum theory that

3204
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:05,240
start from the most quantum theory that
 

3205
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,180
start from the most quantum theory that
you have which is really many worlds so

3206
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:07,190
you have which is really many worlds so
 

3207
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,080
you have which is really many worlds so
start with the quantum theory and try to

3208
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:10,090
start with the quantum theory and try to
 

3209
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:14,140
start with the quantum theory and try to
build up a model of space-time the

3210
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:14,150
build up a model of space-time the
 

3211
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:18,300
build up a model of space-time the
emergence of space-time that's okay so I

3212
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:18,310
emergence of space-time that's okay so I
 

3213
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:21,670
emergence of space-time that's okay so I
thought space-time was fundamental yeah

3214
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
thought space-time was fundamental yeah
 

3215
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,770
thought space-time was fundamental yeah
I know so this sort of dream that

3216
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:23,780
I know so this sort of dream that
 

3217
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,840
I know so this sort of dream that
Einstein had that everybody had and

3218
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:25,850
Einstein had that everybody had and
 

3219
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,410
Einstein had that everybody had and
everybody has of you know the theory of

3220
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:29,420
everybody has of you know the theory of
 

3221
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,200
everybody has of you know the theory of
everything so how do we build up from

3222
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:32,210
everything so how do we build up from
 

3223
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,870
everything so how do we build up from
many worlds from quantum mechanics a

3224
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:34,880
many worlds from quantum mechanics a
 

3225
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,370
many worlds from quantum mechanics a
model of space-time model of gravity

3226
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:38,380
model of space-time model of gravity
 

3227
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,360
model of space-time model of gravity
well yeah I mean let me first mention

3228
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:40,370
well yeah I mean let me first mention
 

3229
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:42,400
well yeah I mean let me first mention
very quickly why we think it's necessary

3230
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:42,410
very quickly why we think it's necessary
 

3231
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:45,460
very quickly why we think it's necessary
you know we've had gravity in the form

3232
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:45,470
you know we've had gravity in the form
 

3233
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:47,020
you know we've had gravity in the form
that Einstein bequeathed it to us for

3234
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:47,030
that Einstein bequeathed it to us for
 

3235
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,860
that Einstein bequeathed it to us for
over a hundred years now

3236
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:47,870
over a hundred years now
 

3237
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,440
over a hundred years now
like 1915 or 1916 he put general

3238
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:50,450
like 1915 or 1916 he put general
 

3239
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,470
like 1915 or 1916 he put general
relativity in the final form so gravity

3240
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:53,480
relativity in the final form so gravity
 

3241
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,180
relativity in the final form so gravity
is the curvature of space-time and

3242
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:55,190
is the curvature of space-time and
 

3243
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:57,040
is the curvature of space-time and
there's a field that pervades all the

3244
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,050
there's a field that pervades all the
 

3245
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,840
there's a field that pervades all the
universe that tells us how curved

3246
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:58,850
universe that tells us how curved
 

3247
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:00,970
universe that tells us how curved
space-time is and that's a fundamentally

3248
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:00,980
space-time is and that's a fundamentally
 

3249
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,220
space-time is and that's a fundamentally
classical that's totally classical right

3250
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:03,230
classical that's totally classical right
 

3251
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:06,880
classical that's totally classical right
exactly but we also have a formalism an

3252
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:06,890
exactly but we also have a formalism an
 

3253
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,010
exactly but we also have a formalism an
algorithm for taking a classical theory

3254
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:09,020
algorithm for taking a classical theory
 

3255
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,620
algorithm for taking a classical theory
and quantizing it this is how we get

3256
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:11,630
and quantizing it this is how we get
 

3257
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,960
and quantizing it this is how we get
quantum electrodynamics for example and

3258
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:13,970
quantum electrodynamics for example and
 

3259
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,450
quantum electrodynamics for example and
it could be tricky I mean you think your

3260
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:16,460
it could be tricky I mean you think your
 

3261
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,070
it could be tricky I mean you think your
quantizing something so that means

3262
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:18,080
quantizing something so that means
 

3263
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,020
quantizing something so that means
taking a classical theory and promoting

3264
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:20,030
taking a classical theory and promoting
 

3265
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:22,450
taking a classical theory and promoting
it to a quantum mechanical theory but

3266
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:22,460
it to a quantum mechanical theory but
 

3267
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,430
it to a quantum mechanical theory but
you can run into problems so they ran

3268
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:24,440
you can run into problems so they ran
 

3269
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,570
you can run into problems so they ran
into problems and you did that with

3270
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:25,580
into problems and you did that with
 

3271
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,550
into problems and you did that with
electromagnetism namely that certain

3272
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:27,560
electromagnetism namely that certain
 

3273
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,230
electromagnetism namely that certain
quantities were infinity and you don't

3274
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:29,240
quantities were infinity and you don't
 

3275
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,990
quantities were infinity and you don't
like infinity right so Fineman and

3276
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
like infinity right so Fineman and
 

3277
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,520
like infinity right so Fineman and
tominaga and Schwinger won the nobel

3278
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:33,530
tominaga and Schwinger won the nobel
 

3279
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:35,290
tominaga and Schwinger won the nobel
prize for teaching us how to deal with

3280
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:35,300
prize for teaching us how to deal with
 

3281
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,000
prize for teaching us how to deal with
the infinities and then Ken Wilson won

3282
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,010
the infinities and then Ken Wilson won
 

3283
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,710
the infinities and then Ken Wilson won
another Nobel Prize for saying you

3284
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
another Nobel Prize for saying you
 

3285
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,640
another Nobel Prize for saying you
shouldn't have been worried about those

3286
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:39,650
shouldn't have been worried about those
 

3287
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:42,250
shouldn't have been worried about those
infinities after all but still that was

3288
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:42,260
infinities after all but still that was
 

3289
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,200
infinities after all but still that was
the it's always the thought that that's

3290
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:44,210
the it's always the thought that that's
 

3291
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,670
the it's always the thought that that's
how you will make a good quantum theory

3292
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
how you will make a good quantum theory
 

3293
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,660
how you will make a good quantum theory
you'll start with the classical theory

3294
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:46,670
you'll start with the classical theory
 

3295
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,370
you'll start with the classical theory
and quantize it so if we have a

3296
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:48,380
and quantize it so if we have a
 

3297
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,350
and quantize it so if we have a
classical theory general relativity we

3298
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:50,360
classical theory general relativity we
 

3299
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,050
classical theory general relativity we
can quantize it or we can try to but we

3300
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:53,060
can quantize it or we can try to but we
 

3301
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,180
can quantize it or we can try to but we
run into even bigger problems with

3302
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:55,190
run into even bigger problems with
 

3303
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,800
run into even bigger problems with
gravity than we ran into with

3304
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:56,810
gravity than we ran into with
 

3305
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,420
gravity than we ran into with
electromagnetism and so far those

01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:58,430
electromagnetism and so far those
 

3307
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,240
electromagnetism and so far those
problems are

3308
01:02:59,240 --> 01:02:59,250

01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,550
problems are
we've not been able to get a successful

we've not been able to get a successful

evidence that there's a good reason why

evidence that there's a good reason why

01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,770
evidence that there's a good reason why
this is true that the whatever the

this is true that the whatever the

this is true that the whatever the
quantum theory of gravity is it's not a

quantum theory of gravity is it's not a

field theory it's something that has
 

3325
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,450

weird non-local features built into it

weird non-local features built into it
 

3327
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,340
weird non-local features built into it
somehow that we don't understand and we

somehow that we don't understand and we
 

3329
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,800
somehow that we don't understand and we
get this idea from black holes and

01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:24,810
get this idea from black holes and
 

3331
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,810
get this idea from black holes and
Hawking radiation and information

3332
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:26,820

01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:30,540
ideas I talked about in the book so if
 

3337
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,570

that's true if the fundamental theory

that's true if the fundamental theory
 

3339
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,250
that's true if the fundamental theory
isn't even local in the sense that an

isn't even local in the sense that an

ordinary quantum field theory would be
 

3343

then we just don't know where to start

3344
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:37,620
then we just don't know where to start
 

3345
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,070
then we just don't know where to start
in terms of getting a classical

3346
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:40,080
in terms of getting a classical
 

3347
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,860
in terms of getting a classical
precursor and quantizing so the only

3348
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:42,870
precursor and quantizing so the only
 

3349
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,540
precursor and quantizing so the only
sensible thing is at least the next

3350
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:44,550
sensible thing is at least the next
 

3351
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,370
sensible thing is at least the next
obvious sensible thing to me would be to

3352
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:46,380
obvious sensible thing to me would be to
 

3353
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,840
obvious sensible thing to me would be to
say okay let's just start intrinsically

3354
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:47,850
say okay let's just start intrinsically
 

3355
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:50,090
say okay let's just start intrinsically
quantum and work backwards see if we can

3356
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:50,100
quantum and work backwards see if we can
 

3357
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,130
quantum and work backwards see if we can
find a classical limit so the idea of

3358
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:52,140
find a classical limit so the idea of
 

3359
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,320
find a classical limit so the idea of
locality the the fact that locality is

3360
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:54,330
locality the the fact that locality is
 

3361
01:03:54,330 --> 01:04:00,590
locality the the fact that locality is
not fundamental to the nature of our

3362
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:00,600
not fundamental to the nature of our
 

3363
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,400
not fundamental to the nature of our
existence sort of you know I guess in

3364
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:04,410
existence sort of you know I guess in
 

3365
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,930
existence sort of you know I guess in
that sense modeling everything's the

3366
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:05,940
that sense modeling everything's the
 

3367
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,670
that sense modeling everything's the
field makes sense to me stuff that's

3368
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
field makes sense to me stuff that's
 

3369
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,550
field makes sense to me stuff that's
close by interact stuff that's far away

3370
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:10,560
close by interact stuff that's far away
 

3371
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,880
close by interact stuff that's far away
doesn't so what's what's locality and

3372
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:13,890
doesn't so what's what's locality and
 

3373
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,770
doesn't so what's what's locality and
why is it not fundamental and how is

3374
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:15,780
why is it not fundamental and how is
 

3375
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,820
why is it not fundamental and how is
that even possible

3376
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:16,830
that even possible
 

3377
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,740
that even possible
yeah I mean locality is the answer to

3378
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:18,750
yeah I mean locality is the answer to
 

3379
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,360
yeah I mean locality is the answer to
the question that Isaac Newton was

3380
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:20,370
the question that Isaac Newton was
 

3381
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:21,710
the question that Isaac Newton was
worried about back in the beginning of

3382
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:21,720
worried about back in the beginning of
 

3383
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,480
worried about back in the beginning of
our conversation right I mean how can

3384
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:23,490
our conversation right I mean how can
 

3385
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,580
our conversation right I mean how can
the earth know what the gravitational

3386
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:25,590
the earth know what the gravitational
 

3387
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,430
the earth know what the gravitational
field of the Sun is when the answer has

3388
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:28,440
field of the Sun is when the answer has
 

3389
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,200
field of the Sun is when the answer has
spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and

3390
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:30,210
spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and
 

3391
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,490
spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and
others is that there's a field in

3392
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:31,500
others is that there's a field in
 

3393
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,860
others is that there's a field in
between and the way a field works is

3394
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:33,870
between and the way a field works is
 

3395
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,780
between and the way a field works is
that what's happening to the field at

3396
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:35,790
that what's happening to the field at
 

3397
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,360
that what's happening to the field at
this point in space only depends

3398
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:38,370
this point in space only depends
 

3399
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,430
this point in space only depends
directly on what's happening at points

3400
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:40,440
directly on what's happening at points
 

3401
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,590
directly on what's happening at points
right next to it but what's happening at

3402
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:42,600
right next to it but what's happening at
 

3403
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,240
right next to it but what's happening at
those points depends on what's happening

3404
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:44,250
those points depends on what's happening
 

3405
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,620
those points depends on what's happening
right next to those right is you can

3406
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:45,630
right next to those right is you can
 

3407
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:47,540
right next to those right is you can
build up an influence across space

3408
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:47,550
build up an influence across space
 

3409
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,570
build up an influence across space
through only local interactions that's

3410
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:50,580
through only local interactions that's
 

3411
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,490
through only local interactions that's
what locality means what happens here is

3412
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:52,500
what locality means what happens here is
 

3413
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,960
what locality means what happens here is
only affected by what's happening right

3414
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:53,970
only affected by what's happening right
 

3415
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,680
only affected by what's happening right
next to it that's locality the idea of

3416
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:57,690
next to it that's locality the idea of
 

3417
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,750
next to it that's locality the idea of
locality is built into every field

3418
01:04:59,750 --> 01:04:59,760
locality is built into every field

when we talk about black holes and you

01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,450
when we talk about black holes and you

black holes radiate they give off

01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,170
black holes radiate they give off
they'll eventually evaporate away

3447
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,490
what that black hole will turn into if
it's just obeying the Schrodinger

3448
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:31,500
it's just obeying the Schrodinger
 

3449
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,430
it's just obeying the Schrodinger
equation and if that's true there are

3450
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:34,440
equation and if that's true there are
 

3451
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,710
equation and if that's true there are
good arguments that can't happen while

3452
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
good arguments that can't happen while
 

3453
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,510
good arguments that can't happen while
preserving locality at the same time

3454
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:38,520
preserving locality at the same time
 

3455
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,460
preserving locality at the same time
it's just that their information seems

3456
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:40,470
it's just that their information seems
 

3457
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,590
it's just that their information seems
to be spread out non locally in

3458
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:42,600
to be spread out non locally in
 

3459
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,710
to be spread out non locally in
interesting ways and people should you

3460
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:45,720
interesting ways and people should you
 

3461
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,330
interesting ways and people should you
talk about holography with the Leonard

3462
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:47,340
talk about holography with the Leonard
 

3463
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,640
talk about holography with the Leonard
Susskind on your - a podcast

3464
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:49,650
Susskind on your - a podcast
 

3465
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,410
Susskind on your - a podcast
yes I have a podcast I didn't even

3466
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:51,420
yes I have a podcast I didn't even
 

3467
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,480
yes I have a podcast I didn't even
mention that I'm terrible no I'm gonna

3468
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:53,490
mention that I'm terrible no I'm gonna
 

3469
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,310
mention that I'm terrible no I'm gonna
I'm gonna ask you questions about that

3470
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:55,320
I'm gonna ask you questions about that
 

3471
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,620
I'm gonna ask you questions about that
too and I've been not shutting up about

3472
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:57,630
too and I've been not shutting up about
 

3473
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,600
too and I've been not shutting up about
it's my favorite science podcast so or

3474
01:05:59,600 --> 01:05:59,610
it's my favorite science podcast so or
 

3475
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,900
it's my favorite science podcast so or
not it's a famous science podcast it's

3476
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:02,910
not it's a famous science podcast it's
 

3477
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:07,280
not it's a famous science podcast it's
like it's a scientist doing absolutely

3478
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:07,290
like it's a scientist doing absolutely
 

3479
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:10,460
like it's a scientist doing absolutely
yes yeah anyway yeah so holography is

3480
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:10,470
yes yeah anyway yeah so holography is
 

3481
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,170
yes yeah anyway yeah so holography is
this idea when you have a black hole and

3482
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:12,180
this idea when you have a black hole and
 

3483
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,750
this idea when you have a black hole and
black hole is a region of space inside

3484
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:14,760
black hole is a region of space inside
 

3485
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,310
black hole is a region of space inside
of which gravity is so strong that you

3486
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:16,320
of which gravity is so strong that you
 

3487
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,260
of which gravity is so strong that you
can't escape and there's this weird

3488
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:18,270
can't escape and there's this weird
 

3489
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,540
can't escape and there's this weird
feature of black holes that again is a

3490
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:20,550
feature of black holes that again is a
 

3491
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,460
feature of black holes that again is a
totally a thought experiment feature cuz

3492
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:22,470
totally a thought experiment feature cuz
 

3493
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:24,530
totally a thought experiment feature cuz
we haven't gone and probed any yet but

3494
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:24,540
we haven't gone and probed any yet but
 

3495
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,960
we haven't gone and probed any yet but
there seems to be one way of thinking

3496
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:26,970
there seems to be one way of thinking
 

3497
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:29,120
there seems to be one way of thinking
about what happens inside a black hole

3498
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:29,130
about what happens inside a black hole
 

3499
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:31,880
about what happens inside a black hole
as seen by an observer who's falling in

3500
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:31,890
as seen by an observer who's falling in
 

3501
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,680
as seen by an observer who's falling in
which is actually pretty normal like

3502
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:33,690
which is actually pretty normal like
 

3503
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,970
which is actually pretty normal like
everything looks pretty normal until you

3504
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:34,980
everything looks pretty normal until you
 

3505
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,430
everything looks pretty normal until you
get the singularity and you die but from

3506
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,440
get the singularity and you die but from
 

3507
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,960
get the singularity and you die but from
the point of the view of the outside

3508
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:38,970
the point of the view of the outside
 

3509
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:40,760
the point of the view of the outside
observer it seems like all the

3510
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:40,770
observer it seems like all the
 

3511
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:43,190
observer it seems like all the
information that that fell in is

3512
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:43,200
information that that fell in is
 

3513
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,040
information that that fell in is
actually smeared over the horizon in a

3514
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:46,050
actually smeared over the horizon in a
 

3515
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:48,890
actually smeared over the horizon in a
non-local way and that's puzzling and

3516
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:48,900
non-local way and that's puzzling and
 

3517
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,300
non-local way and that's puzzling and
that's a lot so holography because

3518
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:50,310
that's a lot so holography because
 

3519
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:51,800
that's a lot so holography because
that's a two-dimensional surface that is

3520
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:51,810
that's a two-dimensional surface that is
 

3521
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:52,670
that's a two-dimensional surface that is
encapsulating the whole

3522
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:52,680
encapsulating the whole
 

3523
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,460
encapsulating the whole
three-dimensional thing inside right

3524
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:54,470
three-dimensional thing inside right
 

3525
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,360
three-dimensional thing inside right
still trying to deal with that still

3526
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:56,370
still trying to deal with that still
 

3527
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:57,650
still trying to deal with that still
trying to figure out how to get there

3528
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:57,660
trying to figure out how to get there
 

3529
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,720
trying to figure out how to get there
but it's an indication that we need to

3530
01:06:59,720 --> 01:06:59,730
but it's an indication that we need to
 

3531
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:00,980
but it's an indication that we need to
think a little more subtly when we

3532
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:00,990
think a little more subtly when we
 

3533
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:03,230
think a little more subtly when we
quantize gravity so because you can

3534
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:03,240
quantize gravity so because you can
 

3535
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,000
quantize gravity so because you can
describe everything that's going on in

3536
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,010
describe everything that's going on in
 

3537
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:07,520
describe everything that's going on in
the in three-dimensional space by

3538
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:07,530
the in three-dimensional space by
 

3539
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,750
the in three-dimensional space by
looking at the two-dimensional

3540
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:08,760
looking at the two-dimensional
 

3541
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,720
looking at the two-dimensional
projection of it that means that

3542
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:11,730
projection of it that means that
 

3543
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:15,380
projection of it that means that
locality doesn't it's not necessary well

3544
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:15,390
locality doesn't it's not necessary well
 

3545
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:18,080
locality doesn't it's not necessary well
it means it's somehow it's only a good

3546
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:18,090
it means it's somehow it's only a good
 

3547
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:19,550
it means it's somehow it's only a good
approximation it's not really what's

3548
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:19,560
approximation it's not really what's
 

3549
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,080
approximation it's not really what's
going on how we're supposed to feel

3550
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:21,090
going on how we're supposed to feel
 

3551
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:25,010
going on how we're supposed to feel
about that supposed to be liberated

3552
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:25,020
about that supposed to be liberated
 

3553
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,650
about that supposed to be liberated
you know space is just a good

3554
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:27,660
you know space is just a good
 

3555
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,150
you know space is just a good
approximation and this was always gonna

3556
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:29,160
approximation and this was always gonna
 

3557
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,620
approximation and this was always gonna
be true once you started quantizing

3558
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:30,630
be true once you started quantizing
 

3559
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:34,609
be true once you started quantizing
gravity so we're just beginning now to

3560
01:07:34,609 --> 01:07:34,619
gravity so we're just beginning now to
 

3561
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:37,280
gravity so we're just beginning now to
face up to the dramatic implications of

3562
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:37,290
face up to the dramatic implications of
 

3563
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:39,470
face up to the dramatic implications of
quantizing gravity is there other weird

3564
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:39,480
quantizing gravity is there other weird
 

3565
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,780
quantizing gravity is there other weird
stuff that happens to quantum mechanics

3566
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:41,790
stuff that happens to quantum mechanics
 

3567
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,690
stuff that happens to quantum mechanics
in black hole I don't think that

3568
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:44,700
in black hole I don't think that
 

3569
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,790
in black hole I don't think that
anything weird happen with quantum

3570
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:46,800
anything weird happen with quantum
 

3571
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,960
anything weird happen with quantum
mechanics thinking weird things happen

3572
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:47,970
mechanics thinking weird things happen
 

3573
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,490
mechanics thinking weird things happen
with space-time I mean that's what it is

3574
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:49,500
with space-time I mean that's what it is
 

3575
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,780
with space-time I mean that's what it is
like quantum mechanics is still just

3576
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:50,790
like quantum mechanics is still just
 

3577
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,880
like quantum mechanics is still just
quantum mechanics but our ordinary

3578
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:52,890
quantum mechanics but our ordinary
 

3579
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:56,660
quantum mechanics but our ordinary
notions of space-time don't really quite

3580
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:56,670
notions of space-time don't really quite
 

3581
01:07:56,670 --> 01:08:00,710
notions of space-time don't really quite
work and there's a principle that goes

3582
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
work and there's a principle that goes
 

3583
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,359
work and there's a principle that goes
hand in hand with holography called

3584
01:08:02,359 --> 01:08:02,369
hand in hand with holography called
 

3585
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:06,620
hand in hand with holography called
complementarity which says that there's

3586
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:06,630
complementarity which says that there's
 

3587
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,530
complementarity which says that there's
no one unique way to describe what's

3588
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:09,540
no one unique way to describe what's
 

3589
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,240
no one unique way to describe what's
going on inside a black hole different

3590
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:11,250
going on inside a black hole different
 

3591
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,230
going on inside a black hole different
observers will have different

3592
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,240
observers will have different
 

3593
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,329
observers will have different
descriptions both of which are accurate

3594
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:14,339
descriptions both of which are accurate
 

3595
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:17,990
descriptions both of which are accurate
but sound completely incompatible with

3596
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,000
but sound completely incompatible with
 

3597
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,999
but sound completely incompatible with
each other so depends on how you look at

3598
01:08:19,999 --> 01:08:20,009
each other so depends on how you look at
 

3599
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:21,920
each other so depends on how you look at
it you know the word complementarity in

3600
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:21,930
it you know the word complementarity in
 

3601
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,660
it you know the word complementarity in
this context is borrowed from Niels Bohr

3602
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:23,670
this context is borrowed from Niels Bohr
 

3603
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,640
this context is borrowed from Niels Bohr
who points out you can measure the

3604
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:25,650
who points out you can measure the
 

3605
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:27,829
who points out you can measure the
position or you can measure the momentum

3606
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:27,839
position or you can measure the momentum
 

3607
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,690
position or you can measure the momentum
you can't measure both at the same time

3608
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:29,700
you can't measure both at the same time
 

3609
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,269
you can't measure both at the same time
in quantum mechanics so a couple

3610
01:08:32,269 --> 01:08:32,279
in quantum mechanics so a couple
 

3611
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,360
in quantum mechanics so a couple
questions on many worlds how does many

3612
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:35,370
questions on many worlds how does many
 

3613
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:37,999
questions on many worlds how does many
worlds help us understand our particular

3614
01:08:37,999 --> 01:08:38,009
worlds help us understand our particular
 

3615
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:41,780
worlds help us understand our particular
branch of reality so ok that's fine and

3616
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:41,790
branch of reality so ok that's fine and
 

3617
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:43,490
branch of reality so ok that's fine and
good that is everything is splitting

3618
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:43,500
good that is everything is splitting
 

3619
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,470
good that is everything is splitting
we're just traveling down a single

3620
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:45,480
we're just traveling down a single
 

3621
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,110
we're just traveling down a single
branch of it so how does it help us

3622
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:48,120
branch of it so how does it help us
 

3623
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,110
branch of it so how does it help us
understand our little unique branch yeah

3624
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,120
understand our little unique branch yeah
 

3625
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,849
understand our little unique branch yeah
I mean that's a great question but

3626
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:52,859
I mean that's a great question but
 

3627
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:54,680
I mean that's a great question but
that's the point is that we didn't

3628
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:54,690
that's the point is that we didn't
 

3629
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:55,940
that's the point is that we didn't
invent many worlds cuz you thought it

3630
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:55,950
invent many worlds cuz you thought it
 

3631
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:57,200
invent many worlds cuz you thought it
was cool to have a whole bunch of worlds

3632
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:57,210
was cool to have a whole bunch of worlds
 

3633
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:59,209
was cool to have a whole bunch of worlds
right we invented it because we were

3634
01:08:59,209 --> 01:08:59,219
right we invented it because we were
 

3635
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,190
right we invented it because we were
trying to account for what we observe

3636
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:01,200
trying to account for what we observe
 

3637
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,039
trying to account for what we observe
here in our world and what we observe

3638
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:04,049
here in our world and what we observe
 

3639
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:05,349
here in our world and what we observe
here in our world are wave functions

3640
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:05,359
here in our world are wave functions
 

3641
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:08,990
here in our world are wave functions
collapsing ok we do have a position as a

3642
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:09,000
collapsing ok we do have a position as a
 

3643
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,820
collapsing ok we do have a position as a
situation where the electron seems to be

3644
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:10,830
situation where the electron seems to be
 

3645
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:12,349
situation where the electron seems to be
spread out but then when we look at it

3646
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:12,359
spread out but then when we look at it
 

3647
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:13,729
spread out but then when we look at it
we don't see it spread out we see it

3648
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:13,739
we don't see it spread out we see it
 

3649
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:15,920
we don't see it spread out we see it
located somewhere so what's going on

3650
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:15,930
located somewhere so what's going on
 

3651
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,120
located somewhere so what's going on
that's the measurement problem of

3652
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:17,130
that's the measurement problem of
 

3653
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:18,320
that's the measurement problem of
quantum mechanics that's what we have to

3654
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:18,330
quantum mechanics that's what we have to
 

3655
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:20,749
quantum mechanics that's what we have to
face up to so many worlds is just a

3656
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:20,759
face up to so many worlds is just a
 

3657
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:22,999
face up to so many worlds is just a
proposed solution to that problem and

3658
01:09:22,999 --> 01:09:23,009
proposed solution to that problem and
 

3659
01:09:23,009 --> 01:09:25,160
proposed solution to that problem and
the answer is nothing special is

3660
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:25,170
the answer is nothing special is
 

3661
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,360
the answer is nothing special is
happening it's still just the

3662
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:26,370
happening it's still just the
 

3663
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,459
happening it's still just the
Schrodinger equation but you have a wave

3664
01:09:28,459 --> 01:09:28,469
Schrodinger equation but you have a wave
 

3665
01:09:28,469 --> 01:09:30,860
Schrodinger equation but you have a wave
function - and that's a different answer

3666
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:30,870
function - and that's a different answer
 

3667
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,200
function - and that's a different answer
than would be given in hidden variables

3668
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:33,210
than would be given in hidden variables
 

3669
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,970
than would be given in hidden variables
or dynamical collapse theories or

3670
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:34,980
or dynamical collapse theories or
 

3671
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:38,010
or dynamical collapse theories or
whatever so the entire point of many

3672
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:38,020
whatever so the entire point of many
 

3673
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,660
whatever so the entire point of many
world's is to explain what we observe

3674
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:39,670
world's is to explain what we observe
 

3675
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:42,360
world's is to explain what we observe
but it tries to explain what we already

3676
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:42,370
but it tries to explain what we already
 

3677
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,789
but it tries to explain what we already
have observed right it's not trying to

3678
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:44,799
have observed right it's not trying to
 

3679
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:47,280
have observed right it's not trying to
be different from what we've observed

3680
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:47,290
be different from what we've observed
 

3681
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:48,539
be different from what we've observed
because that would be something other

3682
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:48,549
because that would be something other
 

3683
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:50,789
because that would be something other
than quantum mechanics but you know the

3684
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:50,799
than quantum mechanics but you know the
 

3685
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,710
than quantum mechanics but you know the
idea that there's worlds that we didn't

3686
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:52,720
idea that there's worlds that we didn't
 

3687
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,690
idea that there's worlds that we didn't
observe they keep branching off it's

3688
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:54,700
observe they keep branching off it's
 

3689
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,230
observe they keep branching off it's
kind of it is uh you know it's

3690
01:09:58,230 --> 01:09:58,240
kind of it is uh you know it's
 

3691
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,380
kind of it is uh you know it's
stimulating to the imagination so is it

3692
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:01,390
stimulating to the imagination so is it
 

3693
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,950
stimulating to the imagination so is it
possible to hop from you mentioned the

3694
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
possible to hop from you mentioned the
 

3695
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,220
possible to hop from you mentioned the
branches are independent yes is it

3696
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:08,230
branches are independent yes is it
 

3697
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:10,170
branches are independent yes is it
possible to hop from one to the other

3698
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:10,180
possible to hop from one to the other
 

3699
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,710
possible to hop from one to the other
no it's so physical limit then the

3700
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:13,720
no it's so physical limit then the
 

3701
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,290
no it's so physical limit then the
theory says it's impossible there's

3702
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:16,300
theory says it's impossible there's
 

3703
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,400
theory says it's impossible there's
already a copy of you in the other world

3704
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:17,410
already a copy of you in the other world
 

3705
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:19,790
already a copy of you in the other world
don't worry yes leave them alone

3706
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:19,800
don't worry yes leave them alone
 

3707
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,130
don't worry yes leave them alone
no but there's a there's a fear of

3708
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:23,140
no but there's a there's a fear of
 

3709
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:27,110
no but there's a there's a fear of
missing out form oh yes that I feel like

3710
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
missing out form oh yes that I feel like
 

3711
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,610
missing out form oh yes that I feel like
immediately start to wander if that

3712
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:29,620
immediately start to wander if that
 

3713
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,670
immediately start to wander if that
other copy is having more or less fun

3714
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:32,680
other copy is having more or less fun
 

3715
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:35,130
other copy is having more or less fun
well the downside in many worlds is that

3716
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:35,140
well the downside in many worlds is that
 

3717
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:38,520
well the downside in many worlds is that
you're missing out on an enormous and

3718
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:38,530
you're missing out on an enormous and
 

3719
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:39,990
you're missing out on an enormous and
that's always what it's gonna be like

3720
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,000
that's always what it's gonna be like
 

3721
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,570
that's always what it's gonna be like
and I mean there's a certain stage of

3722
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:42,580
and I mean there's a certain stage of
 

3723
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,140
and I mean there's a certain stage of
acceptance and that yes in terms of

3724
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:45,150
acceptance and that yes in terms of
 

3725
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,910
acceptance and that yes in terms of
rewinding you think we can rewind the

3726
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:47,920
rewinding you think we can rewind the
 

3727
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,010
rewinding you think we can rewind the
system back sort of the the nice thing

3728
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:50,020
system back sort of the the nice thing
 

3729
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:53,070
system back sort of the the nice thing
about many worlds I guess is it really

3730
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:53,080
about many worlds I guess is it really
 

3731
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,250
about many worlds I guess is it really
emphasizes the maybe you can correct me

3732
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:56,260
emphasizes the maybe you can correct me
 

3733
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,260
emphasizes the maybe you can correct me
but to determine it the deterministic

3734
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:58,270
but to determine it the deterministic
 

3735
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:02,670
but to determine it the deterministic
nature of a branch and it feels like it

3736
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:02,680
nature of a branch and it feels like it
 

3737
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,990
nature of a branch and it feels like it
could be a while back is it is do you

3738
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:07,000
could be a while back is it is do you
 

3739
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,190
could be a while back is it is do you
see is this something that could be

3740
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:08,200
see is this something that could be
 

3741
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,420
see is this something that could be
perfectly won back rewinded back yeah

3742
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:12,430
perfectly won back rewinded back yeah
 

3743
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:13,800
perfectly won back rewinded back yeah
you know if you're at a fancy French

3744
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:13,810
you know if you're at a fancy French
 

3745
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,780
you know if you're at a fancy French
restaurant yeah there's a nice linen

3746
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:15,790
restaurant yeah there's a nice linen
 

3747
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:17,700
restaurant yeah there's a nice linen
white tablecloth and you have your glass

3748
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:17,710
white tablecloth and you have your glass
 

3749
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,770
white tablecloth and you have your glass
of Bordeaux and you knock it over and

3750
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:19,780
of Bordeaux and you knock it over and
 

3751
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:22,170
of Bordeaux and you knock it over and
the wine spills across the tablecloth if

3752
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:22,180
the wine spills across the tablecloth if
 

3753
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:26,070
the wine spills across the tablecloth if
the world were classical okay it would

3754
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080

3911
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,740
what's the difference between the arrow
of time and time are using arrow of time

3912
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:53,750
of time and time are using arrow of time
 

3913
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:56,350
of time and time are using arrow of time
to simply mean this the synonymous with

01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:56,360
to simply mean this the synonymous with
 

3915
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,540
to simply mean this the synonymous with
the second law thermodynamics no but the

3916
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:58,550
the second law thermodynamics no but the
 

3917
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,040
the second law thermodynamics no but the
arrow of time is the difference between

3918

arrow of time is the difference between
 

3919
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:02,170
arrow of time is the difference between
the past and future so all right there's

3920
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:02,180
the past and future so all right there's
 

3921
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:04,540
the past and future so all right there's
space but there's no arrow of space you

3922
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:04,550
space but there's no arrow of space you
 

3923
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:05,740
space but there's no arrow of space you
don't feel that space has to have an

01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:05,750
don't feel that space has to have an
 

3925
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,660
don't feel that space has to have an
arrow right you could live in

it'd still be a difference between now
 

3933
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:16,240
it'd still be a difference between now
and the future also ok so if nothing

01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:16,250
and the future also ok so if nothing
 

3935
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:19,270
and the future also ok so if nothing
changes there's still time well things

3936
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,280
changes there's still time well things
 

3937
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,860
changes there's still time well things
could even change like if the whole

3942
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:26,480
around the Sun yeah ok it would just go
 

3943
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,020

disprove or expand these theories well I
 

4069
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:06,310

think for the there's two parts of that

think for the there's two parts of that
 

4071

think for the there's two parts of that
question one is many worlds and the

01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
question one is many worlds and the
 

4073
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,000
question one is many worlds and the
other one is sort of emergent space-time

4074
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:10,010
other one is sort of emergent space-time

other one is sort of emergent space-time
for many worlds you know there are

for many worlds you know there are

01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,479
for many worlds you know there are

that's the thing you know so there could

be violations of the speed of light if

you have a version space-time not going

faster than the speed of light but the
 

4161
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,460
faster than the speed of light but the

speed of light could be different for

that would be a dramatic violation of

that would be a dramatic violation of

01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,550
that would be a dramatic violation of

there anything that quantum mechanics

there anything that quantum mechanics

there anything that quantum mechanics
can teach us about human nature or the

4180

can teach us about human nature or the
 

4181
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,620
can teach us about human nature or the
human mind do you think about sort of

4182
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:02,630
human mind do you think about sort of
 

4183
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,630
human mind do you think about sort of
consciousness and these kinds of topics

4184
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:04,640
consciousness and these kinds of topics
 

4185
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,830
consciousness and these kinds of topics
is there it's certainly excessively used

4186
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:08,840
is there it's certainly excessively used
 

4187
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,260
is there it's certainly excessively used
as you point out the word quantum is

4188
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:11,270
as you point out the word quantum is
 

4189
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:14,200
as you point out the word quantum is
used for everything besides quantum

4190
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:14,210
used for everything besides quantum
 

4191
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,530
used for everything besides quantum
mechanics but in more seriousness is

4192
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:17,540
mechanics but in more seriousness is
 

4193
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:22,270
mechanics but in more seriousness is
there something that goes to the human

4194
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:22,280
there something that goes to the human
 

4195
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,640
there something that goes to the human
level and can help us understand our

4196
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:24,650
level and can help us understand our
 

4197
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:28,510

mind not really is the short answer

4198
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:28,520
mind not really is the short answer
 

4199
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,780
mind not really is the short answer
you know minds are pretty classical I

4200
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:30,790
you know minds are pretty classical I
 

4201
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:33,700
you know minds are pretty classical I
don't think we don't know this for sure

4202
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:33,710
don't think we don't know this for sure
 

4203
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:35,290
don't think we don't know this for sure
but I don't think that phenomena like

4204
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:35,300
but I don't think that phenomena like
 

4205
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,000
but I don't think that phenomena like
entanglement are crucial to how the

4206
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,010
entanglement are crucial to how the
 

4207
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:39,850
entanglement are crucial to how the
human mind works or about consciousness

4208
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:39,860
human mind works or about consciousness
 

4209
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:42,370
human mind works or about consciousness
so you mentioned I think early on in the

4210
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:42,380
so you mentioned I think early on in the
 

4211
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:42,830
so you mentioned I think early on in the
Commerce

4212
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:42,840
Commerce
 

4213
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,260
Commerce
you said it would be I'm a it would be

4214
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:47,270
you said it would be I'm a it would be
 

4215
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:51,200
you said it would be I'm a it would be
unlikely but incredible if sort of the

4216
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,210
unlikely but incredible if sort of the
 

4217
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:53,899
unlikely but incredible if sort of the
observer somehow a fundamental part yeah

4218
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:53,909
observer somehow a fundamental part yeah
 

4219
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:58,160
observer somehow a fundamental part yeah
so observer not to romanticize the

4220
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:58,170
so observer not to romanticize the
 

4221
01:20:58,170 --> 01:21:00,260
so observer not to romanticize the

4532
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:12,100
interesting so let me ask the idea of
 

4533
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:15,810
interesting so let me ask the idea of
Charlton is an interesting idea you

4534
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:15,820
Charlton is an interesting idea you
 

4535
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:17,760
Charlton is an interesting idea you
might be more educated on this topic

4536
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:17,770
might be more educated on this topic
 

4537
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:22,470
might be more educated on this topic
than me but there's um there's folks for

4538
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,480
than me but there's um there's folks for
 

4539
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,710
than me but there's um there's folks for
example who argue of various aspects of

4540
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:25,720
example who argue of various aspects of
 

4541
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:29,850
example who argue of various aspects of
evolution sort of try to approach and

4542
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:29,860
evolution sort of try to approach and
 

4543
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:32,660
evolution sort of try to approach and
say that evolution sort of our current

4544
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:32,670
say that evolution sort of our current
 

4545
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:35,910
say that evolution sort of our current
theory of evolution has many holes in it

4546
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:35,920
theory of evolution has many holes in it
 

4547
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,760
theory of evolution has many holes in it
as many flaws and they argue that I

4548
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:38,770
as many flaws and they argue that I
 

4549
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:41,270
as many flaws and they argue that I
think like Cambridge

4550
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:41,280
think like Cambridge
 

4551
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,510
think like Cambridge
Cambrian explosion that which is like a

4552
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:45,520
Cambrian explosion that which is like a
 

4553
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,120
Cambrian explosion that which is like a
huge added variability of species

4554
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:48,130
huge added variability of species
 

4555
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,660
huge added variability of species
doesn't make sense under our current

4556
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:50,670
doesn't make sense under our current
 

4557
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:52,800
doesn't make sense under our current
description of evolution to a theory of

description of evolution to a theory of
 

4559
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:55,860
description of evolution to a theory of
evolution sort of if you had were to

4560
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:55,870
evolution sort of if you had were to
 

4561
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,660
evolution sort of if you had were to
have the conversation with people like

4562
01:27:57,660 --> 01:27:57,670
have the conversation with people like
 

4563
01:27:57,670 --> 01:27:57,960
have the conversation with people like
that

4564
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:57,970
that
 

4565
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:01,200
that
how do you know that they're the

4566
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:01,210
how do you know that they're the
 

4567
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:02,700
how do you know that they're the
difference being outside the box

4568
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:02,710
difference being outside the box
 

4569
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:08,030
difference being outside the box
thinkers and people who are

4570
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:08,040
thinkers and people who are
 

4571
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,069
thinkers and people who are
fundamentally unscientific and

4572
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:11,079
fundamentally unscientific and
 

4573
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:13,830
fundamentally unscientific and
even bordering on charlatans it's a

4574
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:13,840
even bordering on charlatans it's a
 

4575
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,660
even bordering on charlatans it's a
great question and you know the further

4576
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:15,670
great question and you know the further
 

4577
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:17,549
great question and you know the further
you get away from my expertise the

4578
01:28:17,549 --> 01:28:17,559
you get away from my expertise the
 

4579
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:19,410
you get away from my expertise the
harder it is for me to really judge

4580
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:19,420
harder it is for me to really judge
 

4581
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:22,589
harder it is for me to really judge
exactly those things and you know yeah I

4582
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:22,599
exactly those things and you know yeah I
 

4583
01:28:22,599 --> 01:28:24,180
exactly those things and you know yeah I
don't have a satisfying answer for that

4584
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:24,190
don't have a satisfying answer for that
 

4585
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:25,979
don't have a satisfying answer for that
one because I think the example you use

4586
01:28:25,979 --> 01:28:25,989
one because I think the example you use
 

4587
01:28:25,989 --> 01:28:28,649
one because I think the example you use
of someone who you know believes in the

4588
01:28:28,649 --> 01:28:28,659
of someone who you know believes in the
 

4589
01:28:28,659 --> 01:28:30,870
of someone who you know believes in the
basic structure of natural selection but

4590
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:30,880
basic structure of natural selection but
 

4591
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,669
basic structure of natural selection but
thinks that you know this particular

4592
01:28:32,669 --> 01:28:32,679
thinks that you know this particular
 

4593
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:35,129
thinks that you know this particular
thing cannot be understood in the terms

4594
01:28:35,129 --> 01:28:35,139
thing cannot be understood in the terms
 

4595
01:28:35,139 --> 01:28:36,359
thing cannot be understood in the terms
of our current understanding of

4596
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:36,369
of our current understanding of
 

4597
01:28:36,369 --> 01:28:37,530
of our current understanding of
Darwinism

4598
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:37,540
Darwinism
 

4599
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,810
Darwinism
that's a perfect edge case where it's

4600
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:39,820
that's a perfect edge case where it's
 

4601
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:42,780
that's a perfect edge case where it's
hard to tell right and I would have to I

4602
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:42,790
hard to tell right and I would have to I
 

4603
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:43,890
hard to tell right and I would have to I
would try to talk to people who I do

4604
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:43,900
would try to talk to people who I do
 

4605
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,780
would try to talk to people who I do
respect and who do know things and I

4606
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:45,790
respect and who do know things and I
 

4607
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:47,640
respect and who do know things and I
would have to you know given that I'm a

4608
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:47,650
would have to you know given that I'm a
 

4609
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:49,410
would have to you know given that I'm a
physicist I know that physicists will

4610
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:49,420
physicist I know that physicists will
 

4611
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:52,080
physicist I know that physicists will
sometimes be too dismissive of

4612
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:52,090
sometimes be too dismissive of
 

4613
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:53,850
sometimes be too dismissive of
alternative points of view I have to

4614
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:53,860
alternative points of view I have to
 

4615
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:55,589
alternative points of view I have to
take into account that biologists can

4616
01:28:55,589 --> 01:28:55,599
take into account that biologists can
 

4617
01:28:55,599 --> 01:28:57,149
take into account that biologists can
also be too dismissive of alternative

4618
01:28:57,149 --> 01:28:57,159
also be too dismissive of alternative
 

4619
01:28:57,159 --> 01:29:00,209
also be too dismissive of alternative
points of view so yeah that's a tricky

4620
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:00,219
points of view so yeah that's a tricky
 

4621
01:29:00,219 --> 01:29:02,549
points of view so yeah that's a tricky
one have you gotten heat yet yeah all

4622
01:29:02,549 --> 01:29:02,559
one have you gotten heat yet yeah all
 

4623
01:29:02,559 --> 01:29:04,379
one have you gotten heat yet yeah all
the time like there's always something I

4624
01:29:04,379 --> 01:29:04,389
the time like there's always something I
 

4625
01:29:04,389 --> 01:29:07,430
the time like there's always something I
mean it's it's hilarious cuz I do have I

4626
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,440
mean it's it's hilarious cuz I do have I
 

4627
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,620
mean it's it's hilarious cuz I do have I
try very hard not to like have the same

4628
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:10,630
try very hard not to like have the same
 

4629
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:12,419
try very hard not to like have the same
topic several times in a row I did have

4630
01:29:12,419 --> 01:29:12,429
topic several times in a row I did have
 

4631
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:14,970
topic several times in a row I did have
like to climate change episodes but they

4632
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:14,980
like to climate change episodes but they
 

4633
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:15,689
like to climate change episodes but they
were from very different perspectives

4634
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:15,699
were from very different perspectives
 

4635
01:29:15,699 --> 01:29:17,520
were from very different perspectives
but I like to mix it up that's the whole

4636
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:17,530
but I like to mix it up that's the whole
 

4637
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:19,530
but I like to mix it up that's the whole
puzzle I'm having fun and every time I

4638
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:19,540
puzzle I'm having fun and every time I
 

4639
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:21,600
puzzle I'm having fun and every time I
do an episode someone says oh the person

4640
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:21,610
do an episode someone says oh the person
 

4641
01:29:21,610 --> 01:29:22,979
do an episode someone says oh the person
you should really get on to talk about

4642
01:29:22,979 --> 01:29:22,989
you should really get on to talk about
 

4643
01:29:22,989 --> 01:29:24,839
you should really get on to talk about
exactly that is this other person like

4644
01:29:24,839 --> 01:29:24,849
exactly that is this other person like
 

4645
01:29:24,849 --> 01:29:26,339
exactly that is this other person like
well I don't but I did that now I want
