missions that we're on where you know
often early on you know people doubt

250
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
often early on you know people doubt
 

251
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,749
often early on you know people doubt
that we're gonna be able to do it and

252
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
that we're gonna be able to do it and
 

253
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,030
that we're gonna be able to do it and
the initial work seems kind of silly and

254
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,040
the initial work seems kind of silly and
 

255
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,469
the initial work seems kind of silly and
our whole ethos says we don't want to

256
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:33,479
our whole ethos says we don't want to
 

257
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,909
our whole ethos says we don't want to
wait until something is perfect to put

258
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:34,919
wait until something is perfect to put
 

259
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,469

it out there we want to get it out
 

261
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,629
it out there we want to get it out
quickly and get feedback on it and so I

262
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
quickly and get feedback on it and so I
 

263
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,469
quickly and get feedback on it and so I
don't know I mean there's probably just

264
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:39,479
don't know I mean there's probably just
 

265
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,689
don't know I mean there's probably just
something about how I approach things in

266
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:41,699
something about how I approach things in
 

267
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,730
something about how I approach things in
there but I just kind of think that the

268
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:43,740
there but I just kind of think that the
 

269
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,930
there but I just kind of think that the
moment that you decide that you're going

270
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:44,940
moment that you decide that you're going
 

271
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,310
moment that you decide that you're going
to be too embarrassed to try something

272
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
to be too embarrassed to try something
 

273
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,450

that much I mean I I kind of you know
it's not that I I get everything right

316
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,100
it's not that I I get everything right
 

317
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,370
it's not that I I get everything right

of course I don't right I mean we make a
lot of mistakes but

320
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,240
lot of mistakes but
 

321
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,070
lot of mistakes but
um

322
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
um
 

323
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,590
um
but I at least have a pretty strong

324
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:42,600
but I at least have a pretty strong
 

325
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,529
but I at least have a pretty strong
sense of where I want us to go on that

326
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:45,539
sense of where I want us to go on that
 

327

sense of where I want us to go on that
the the thing in in running a company

328
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,060

for you know almost 20 years now one of

330
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
for you know almost 20 years now one of
 

331
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,070
for you know almost 20 years now one of
the things that's been pretty clear is

332
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
the things that's been pretty clear is
 

333
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,390
the things that's been pretty clear is
when you have

334
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:53,400
when you have
 

335
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,610
when you have
a team that's cohesive

you can get
 

339
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,029
you can get
almost anything done

almost anything done
 

341
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,850
almost anything done
and you know you can you can run through

342
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:01,860
and you know you can you can run through
 

343
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,249
and you know you can you can run through
super hard challenges

344
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:04,259
super hard challenges
 

345
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,469
super hard challenges
um you can make hard decisions and push

346
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
um you can make hard decisions and push
 

347
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,510
um you can make hard decisions and push
really hard to to do the best work even

348
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,520
really hard to to do the best work even
 

349
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,029
really hard to to do the best work even
you know and kind of optimize something

350
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
you know and kind of optimize something
 

351
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,490
you know and kind of optimize something
super well but when when there's that

352
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,500
super well but when when there's that
 

353
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,230
super well but when when there's that
tension I mean that's that's when when

354
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,240
tension I mean that's that's when when
 

355
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,450
tension I mean that's that's when when
things get really tough and you know

356
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:17,460
things get really tough and you know
 

357
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,310
things get really tough and you know
when I talk to other friends who run

358
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,320
when I talk to other friends who run
 

359
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,810
when I talk to other friends who run
other companies and things like that I

360
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:20,820
other companies and things like that I
 

361
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,249
other companies and things like that I
think one of the things that I actually

362
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:22,259
think one of the things that I actually
 

363
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,870
think one of the things that I actually
spend a disproportionate amount of time

364
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:23,880
spend a disproportionate amount of time
 

365
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,090
spend a disproportionate amount of time
on in running this company is just

366
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,100
on in running this company is just
 

367
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,170
on in running this company is just
fostering a pretty tight core group of

368
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,180
fostering a pretty tight core group of
 

369
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,570
fostering a pretty tight core group of
of people who are running the company uh

370
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:32,580
of people who are running the company uh
 

371
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,529
of people who are running the company uh
with me and that to me is is kind of the

372
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:36,539
with me and that to me is is kind of the
 

373
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,790
with me and that to me is is kind of the
thing that

374
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:37,800
thing that
 

375
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,890
thing that
both makes it fun right having having

376
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:39,900

tight group who can who you can go work
on some of these crazy things with

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,660
on some of these crazy things with
 

387
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,029
on some of these crazy things with
um but to me that's also the most

388
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
um but to me that's also the most
 

389
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,950
um but to me that's also the most
stressful thing is when when there are

390
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:51,960
stressful thing is when when there are
 

391
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,809
stressful thing is when when there are
when there's tension

392
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:53,819
when there's tension
 

393
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,610
when there's tension
um you know that's that that weighs on

it's maybe not surprising I mean we're
 

399
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,090
it's maybe not surprising I mean we're
like a very people focused company and

400
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,100
like a very people focused company and
 

401
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,950
like a very people focused company and
it's the the people is the the part of

402
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:03,960
it's the the people is the the part of
 

403

it that that

404
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:05,580
it that that
 

405
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,890
it that that
um you know weighs on me the most to

406
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:06,900
um you know weighs on me the most to
 

407
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,510
um you know weighs on me the most to
make sure that we get right but yeah

that that I'd say across everything that
we do is probably

412
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:11,819
we do is probably
 

413
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,270
we do is probably
the big thing so when there's tension in

414
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,280
the big thing so when there's tension in

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
one thing it's just spending a lot of
 

443
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,050
one thing it's just spending a lot of
time with whatever the group is that you

444
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,060
time with whatever the group is that you
 

445
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,210
time with whatever the group is that you
want to be that Core Group

451
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,689
challenges and that requires a fair
amount of openness and you know so I

452
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:02,699
amount of openness and you know so I

that end up
 

505
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,389
that end up
um being values that we care about

506
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
um being values that we care about
 

507
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,610
um being values that we care about
deeply and we need to kind of decide

508
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:58,620
deeply and we need to kind of decide
 

509
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,810
deeply and we need to kind of decide
where we want to be on that and I just

510
00:08:59,810 --> 00:08:59,820
where we want to be on that and I just
 

511
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,009
where we want to be on that and I just
think over time

512
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:01,019
think over time
 

513
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,530
think over time
when um you know by working through a

514
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:03,540
when um you know by working through a
 

515
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,210
when um you know by working through a
lot of issues with people and doing it

516
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,220
lot of issues with people and doing it
 

517
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,790
lot of issues with people and doing it
openly people develop an intuition for

518
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:07,800
openly people develop an intuition for
 

519
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,670
openly people develop an intuition for
each other and a bond in camaraderie

520
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:10,680
each other and a bond in camaraderie
 

521
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,570
each other and a bond in camaraderie
um and to me developing that is is like

522
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:14,580
um and to me developing that is is like
 

523
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,190
um and to me developing that is is like
a lot of the fun part of running a

524
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,200
a lot of the fun part of running a
 

525
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,810
a lot of the fun part of running a
company or doing anything right I think

526
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:17,820
company or doing anything right I think
 

527
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,670
company or doing anything right I think
it's like having having people who are

528
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
it's like having having people who are
 

529
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,290
it's like having having people who are
kind of along on the journey that you're

530
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,300
kind of along on the journey that you're
 

531
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,430
kind of along on the journey that you're
that you feel like you're doing it with

532
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:22,440
that you feel like you're doing it with
 

533
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,590
that you feel like you're doing it with
nothing is ever just one person doing it

534
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:24,600
nothing is ever just one person doing it
 

535
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,290
nothing is ever just one person doing it
other people that disagree also yeah

536
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
other people that disagree also yeah
 

537
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,730
other people that disagree also yeah
within that group it's a fairly

538
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:28,740
within that group it's a fairly
 

539
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,430
within that group it's a fairly
combative group okay so combat is part

540
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
combative group okay so combat is part
 

541
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,410
combative group okay so combat is part
of it so this is making decisions on

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:33,420
of it so this is making decisions on
 

543
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,110
of it so this is making decisions on
design engineering

544
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,120
design engineering
 

545
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,870

maybe mimics clothing so you can choke
what's like a kimono it's like the

570
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
what's like a kimono it's like the
 

571
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,070
what's like a kimono it's like the
traditional martial arts

572
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,080
traditional martial arts
 

573
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,590
traditional martial arts
um

574
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
um
 

575
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,850
um
that you could choke people with yes

576
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:13,860
that you could choke people with yes
 

577
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,190

well it's got the lapels yes yeah
 

579
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,970
well it's got the lapels yes yeah
um so I like Jiu Jitsu I also really

580
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:19,980
um so I like Jiu Jitsu I also really
 

581
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,810
um so I like Jiu Jitsu I also really
like MMA and so I think nogi more

582
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:23,820
like MMA and so I think nogi more
 

583
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,170
like MMA and so I think nogi more
closely approximates MMA and I think my

584
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,180
closely approximates MMA and I think my
 

585
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,329
closely approximates MMA and I think my
style is

586
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:29,339
style is
 

587
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,430
style is
um is maybe a little closer to an MMA

588
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
um is maybe a little closer to an MMA
 

589
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,490
um is maybe a little closer to an MMA
style so like a lot of Jiu Jitsu players

590
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:33,500
style so like a lot of Jiu Jitsu players
 

591
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,810
style so like a lot of Jiu Jitsu players
are fine being on their back right and

592
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:35,820
are fine being on their back right and
 

593
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,670
are fine being on their back right and
obviously having a good guard is is a

594
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
obviously having a good guard is is a
 

595
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,550
obviously having a good guard is is a
critical part of of Jiu Jitsu but but in

596
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
critical part of of Jiu Jitsu but but in
 

597
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,750
critical part of of Jiu Jitsu but but in
MMA you don't want to be on your back

598
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
MMA you don't want to be on your back
 

599
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,829
MMA you don't want to be on your back
right because even if you have control

600
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:42,839
right because even if you have control
 

601
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,110
right because even if you have control
you're just taking punches while you're

602
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
you're just taking punches while you're
 

603
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,850
you're just taking punches while you're
on your back so

604
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:46,860
on your back so
 

605
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,410
on your back so
um so that's no good do you like being

606
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,420
um so that's no good do you like being
 

607
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,110
um so that's no good do you like being
on top my style is I'm probably more

608
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
on top my style is I'm probably more
 

609
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,090
on top my style is I'm probably more
pressure and

610
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:53,100
pressure and
 

611
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,870
pressure and
um and yeah and and I'd probably rather

612
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
um and yeah and and I'd probably rather
 

613
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,730
um and yeah and and I'd probably rather
be the top player but

614
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:58,740
be the top player but
 

615
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,110
be the top player but
um but I'm also smaller right I'm not

616
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,120
um but I'm also smaller right I'm not
 

617
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,329
um but I'm also smaller right I'm not
I'm not like a a heavyweight guy right

618
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:02,339
I'm not like a a heavyweight guy right
 

619
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,630
I'm not like a a heavyweight guy right
so from that perspective I think like

620
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:05,640
so from that perspective I think like
 

621
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,430
so from that perspective I think like
you know it's especially because you

622
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
you know it's especially because you
 

623
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,509
you know it's especially because you
know from doing a competition I'll

624
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,519
know from doing a competition I'll
 

625
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,190
know from doing a competition I'll
compete with people who are my size but

626
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,200
compete with people who are my size but
 

627
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,810
compete with people who are my size but
a lot of my friends are bigger than me

628
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:11,820
a lot of my friends are bigger than me
 

629
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,009
a lot of my friends are bigger than me
so

630
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:13,019
so
 

631
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,569
so
um so back takes probably pretty

632
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:14,579
um so back takes probably pretty
 

633
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:15,769
um so back takes probably pretty
important right because that's where you

634
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:15,779
important right because that's where you
 

635
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,630
important right because that's where you
have the most leverage Advantage right

636
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:17,640
have the most leverage Advantage right
 

637
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,710
have the most leverage Advantage right
where where

638
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
where where
 

639
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,630
where where
um you know people you know their arms

640
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
um you know people you know their arms
 

641
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,490
um you know people you know their arms
your arms are very weak behind you right

642
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:22,500
your arms are very weak behind you right
 

643
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,569
your arms are very weak behind you right
so

644
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:23,579
so
 

645
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,949
so
um so being able to get to the back and

646
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
um so being able to get to the back and
 

647
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,110
um so being able to get to the back and
and take that pretty important but I

648
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
and take that pretty important but I
 

649
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,949
and take that pretty important but I
don't know I feel like the right

650
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959
don't know I feel like the right
 

651
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,690
don't know I feel like the right
strategy is to not be too committed to

652
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:29,700
strategy is to not be too committed to
 

653
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,850
strategy is to not be too committed to
any single submission but that said I

654
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:31,860
any single submission but that said I
 

655
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,430
any single submission but that said I
don't like hurting people so

656
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:34,440
don't like hurting people so
 

657
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,310
don't like hurting people so
um so I always think that chokes are are

658
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:37,320
um so I always think that chokes are are
 

659
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,590
um so I always think that chokes are are
a somewhat more human way to go than

660
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
a somewhat more human way to go than
 

661
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,870
a somewhat more human way to go than
than joint locks yeah and it's more

662
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:41,880
than joint locks yeah and it's more
 

663
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,509
than joint locks yeah and it's more
about control it's less Dynamic so

664
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:44,519
about control it's less Dynamic so
 

665
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,610
about control it's less Dynamic so
you're basically like a Habib numbering

666
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:46,620
you're basically like a Habib numbering
 

667
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,470
you're basically like a Habib numbering
a Madoff type of fighter so so let's go

668
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
a Madoff type of fighter so so let's go
 

669
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,449
a Madoff type of fighter so so let's go
yeah a back take to a rear naked choke I

670
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:50,459
yeah a back take to a rear naked choke I
 

671
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,190
yeah a back take to a rear naked choke I
think it's like the clean the clean way

672
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:52,200
think it's like the clean the clean way
 

673
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,750
think it's like the clean the clean way
to go straightforward answer right there

674
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
to go straightforward answer right there
 

675
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,690
to go straightforward answer right there
what advice would you give to um to

676

but I mean over time I think that
 

697
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,750
but I mean over time I think that
there's there's a flow to all these

698
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:20,760
there's there's a flow to all these

00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:00,899
questions about like
 

735
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,930
questions about like
um you know how how many days people

736
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:02,940

um you know how how many days people
want to work and things like that I

738

want to work and things like that I
 

739
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,629
want to work and things like that I
think almost all the people who like

740
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:05,639
think almost all the people who like
 

741
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,190
think almost all the people who like
start successful companies or things

742
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
start successful companies or things
 

743

like that are just are working extremely
 

745
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,550
like that are just are working extremely
hard but I think one of the things that

746
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
hard but I think one of the things that
 

747
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,590
hard but I think one of the things that
you learn both by you know doing this

748
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:12,600
you learn both by you know doing this
 

749
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,990
you learn both by you know doing this
over time or you know very acutely with

750
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,000
over time or you know very acutely with
 

751
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,069
over time or you know very acutely with
things like Jiu Jitsu or surfing is um

752
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:19,079
things like Jiu Jitsu or surfing is um
 

753
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,350
things like Jiu Jitsu or surfing is um
you can't push through everything

754
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
you can't push through everything
 

755
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,030
you can't push through everything
and

756
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
and
 

757
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,190
and
I think that that's

758
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
I think that that's
 

759
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,769
I think that that's
you you learn this stuff very acutely

760
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:27,779
you you learn this stuff very acutely
 

761
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,990
you you learn this stuff very acutely
you run doing sports compared to running

762
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
you run doing sports compared to running
 

763
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,150
you run doing sports compared to running
a company because running a company the

764
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
a company because running a company the
 

765
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,829
a company because running a company the
cycle times are so long right it's like

766
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
cycle times are so long right it's like
 

767
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,550
cycle times are so long right it's like
you start a project and then you know

768
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:37,560
you start a project and then you know
 

769
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,410
you start a project and then you know
it's like months later or you know if

770
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:39,420
it's like months later or you know if
 

771
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,790
it's like months later or you know if
you're building Hardware it could be

772
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
you're building Hardware it could be
 

773
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,050
you're building Hardware it could be
years later before you're actually

774
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,060
years later before you're actually
 

775
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,970
years later before you're actually
getting feedback and able to you know

776
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:43,980
getting feedback and able to you know
 

777
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,350
getting feedback and able to you know
make the next set of decisions for the

doing whereas you one of the things that
I just think is mentally so nice about

784
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:50,339
I just think is mentally so nice about
 

785
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,269
I just think is mentally so nice about
these very high turnaround

786
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
these very high turnaround
 

787
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,730
these very high turnaround
conditioning Sports things like that is

788
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:55,740
conditioning Sports things like that is

you get feedback very quickly right it's
 

791
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,329
you get feedback very quickly right it's

a lot of them it really teaches you that
 

951
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,150
a lot of them it really teaches you that
and you made it sound so simple like I'm

952
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
and you made it sound so simple like I'm
 

953
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,250
and you made it sound so simple like I'm
almost you know it's it's okay it's part

954
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,260
almost you know it's it's okay it's part
 

955
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,929
almost you know it's it's okay it's part
of the process you just get humble get

956
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:05,939
of the process you just get humble get
 

957
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,549
of the process you just get humble get
yourself I've just failed and been

958
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:07,559
yourself I've just failed and been
 

959
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,990
yourself I've just failed and been
embarrassed so many times in my life

960
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,000
embarrassed so many times in my life
 

961
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,329
embarrassed so many times in my life
that like you know I'm I'm it's a core

962
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,339
that like you know I'm I'm it's a core
 

963
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,130
that like you know I'm I'm it's a core
competence of this it's a core

964
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,140
competence of this it's a core
 

965
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,530
competence of this it's a core
competence well yes and there's a deep

966
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,540
competence well yes and there's a deep
 

967
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,689
competence well yes and there's a deep
truth to that being able to and you said

968
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:17,699
truth to that being able to and you said
 

969
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,210
truth to that being able to and you said
it in the very beginning which is that's

970
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,220
it in the very beginning which is that's
 

971
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,250
it in the very beginning which is that's
the thing that stops US especially as

972
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,260
the thing that stops US especially as
 

973
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,809
the thing that stops US especially as
you get older especially as you develop

974
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:23,819
you get older especially as you develop
 

975
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,689
you get older especially as you develop
expertise in certain areas the

976
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:26,699
expertise in certain areas the
 

977
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,330
expertise in certain areas the
not being willing to be a beginner in a

978
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:29,340
not being willing to be a beginner in a
 

979
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,690
not being willing to be a beginner in a
new area yeah uh that because that's

980
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:32,700
new area yeah uh that because that's
 

981
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,430
new area yeah uh that because that's
where the growth happens is being

982
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:34,440
where the growth happens is being
 

983
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,470
where the growth happens is being
willing to be a beginner being willing

984
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
willing to be a beginner being willing
 

985
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,090
willing to be a beginner being willing
to be embarrassed saying something

986
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,100
to be embarrassed saying something
 

987
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,730
to be embarrassed saying something
stupid doing something stupid

988
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:40,740
stupid doing something stupid
 

989
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,409
stupid doing something stupid
um a lot of us to get good at one thing

990
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:42,419
um a lot of us to get good at one thing
 

991
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,909
um a lot of us to get good at one thing
we want to show that off and it sucks

992
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
we want to show that off and it sucks
 

993
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,370
we want to show that off and it sucks
uh being a beginner but it's it's where

994
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:49,380
uh being a beginner but it's it's where
 

995
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,630
uh being a beginner but it's it's where
growth happens

996
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
growth happens
 

997
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,930
growth happens
yeah well speaking of which let me ask

998
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:53,940
yeah well speaking of which let me ask
 

999
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,690
yeah well speaking of which let me ask
you about AI it seems like this year for

1000
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:56,700
you about AI it seems like this year for
 

1001
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,130
you about AI it seems like this year for
the entirety of the human civilization

1002
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,140
the entirety of the human civilization
 

1003
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,350
the entirety of the human civilization
is an interesting year for the

1004
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:00,360
is an interesting year for the
 

1005
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,510
is an interesting year for the
development of artificial intelligence

1006
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:02,520
development of artificial intelligence
 

1007
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,450
development of artificial intelligence
a lot of interesting stuff is happening

1008
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,460
a lot of interesting stuff is happening
 

1009
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,810
a lot of interesting stuff is happening
So Meta is a big part of that

1010
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:07,820
So Meta is a big part of that
 

1011
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,970
So Meta is a big part of that
met has developed llama which is a 65

1012
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:10,980
met has developed llama which is a 65
 

1013
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,390
met has developed llama which is a 65
billion parameter model

1014
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:13,400
billion parameter model
 

1015
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,770
billion parameter model
uh there's a lot of interesting

1016
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:15,780
uh there's a lot of interesting
 

1017
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,330
uh there's a lot of interesting
questions I can ask here one of which

1018
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:17,340
questions I can ask here one of which
 

1019
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,390
questions I can ask here one of which
has to do with open source but first can

1020
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
has to do with open source but first can
 

1021
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,270
has to do with open source but first can
you tell the story of developing of this

1022
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
you tell the story of developing of this
 

1023
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,750
you tell the story of developing of this
model and uh making the complicated

1024
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:26,760
model and uh making the complicated
 

1025
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,350
model and uh making the complicated
decision of how to release it yeah sure

1026
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,360
decision of how to release it yeah sure
 

1027
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,330
decision of how to release it yeah sure
I think you're right first of all that

1028
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,340
I think you're right first of all that
 

1029
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,730
I think you're right first of all that
in the last year there have been a bunch

1030
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:34,740
in the last year there have been a bunch
 

1031
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,750
in the last year there have been a bunch
of advances on scaling up these large

1032
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:38,760
of advances on scaling up these large
 

1033
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,310
of advances on scaling up these large
Transformer models so there's the

1034
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
Transformer models so there's the
 

1035
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,570
Transformer models so there's the
language equivalent of it with large

1036
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:41,580
language equivalent of it with large
 

1037
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,630
language equivalent of it with large
language models uh the sort of the image

1038
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
language models uh the sort of the image
 

1039
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,029
language models uh the sort of the image
generation equivalent with these large

1040
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
generation equivalent with these large
 

1041
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,070
generation equivalent with these large
diffusion models

1042
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,080
diffusion models
 

1043
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,690
diffusion models
um there's a lot of fundamental research

1044
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:50,700
um there's a lot of fundamental research
 

1045
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,630
um there's a lot of fundamental research
that's gone into this and

1046
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
that's gone into this and
 

1047
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,370
that's gone into this and
meta has taken the approach

1048
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:55,380
meta has taken the approach
 

1049
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,830
meta has taken the approach
of being quite open and academic in in

1050
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:00,840
of being quite open and academic in in
 

1051
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,810
of being quite open and academic in in
our development

1052
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:02,820
our development
 

1053
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,049
our development
um of AI part of this is we want to have

1054
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:06,059
um of AI part of this is we want to have
 

1055
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,150
um of AI part of this is we want to have
the best people in the world researching

1056
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
the best people in the world researching
 

1057
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,650
the best people in the world researching
this and

1058
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:09,660
this and
 

1059
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,450
this and
um and a lot of the best people want to

1060
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,460
um and a lot of the best people want to
 

1061
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,289
um and a lot of the best people want to
know that they're going to be able to

1062
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:12,299
know that they're going to be able to
 

1063
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,330
know that they're going to be able to
share their work so that's part of the

1064
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:14,340
share their work so that's part of the
 

1065
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,730
share their work so that's part of the
deal that we that we have is that you

1066
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:16,740
deal that we that we have is that you
 

1067
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,950
deal that we that we have is that you
know we can get you know if you're one

1068
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
know we can get you know if you're one
 

1069
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,390
know we can get you know if you're one
of the top AI researchers in the world

1070
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
of the top AI researchers in the world
 

1071
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,010
of the top AI researchers in the world
you can come here you can get access to

1072
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,020
you can come here you can get access to
 

1073
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,130
you can come here you can get access to
kind of industry scale

1074
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,140
kind of industry scale
 

1075
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,930
kind of industry scale
infrastructure and and and part of our

1076
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:26,940
infrastructure and and and part of our
 

1077
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,390
infrastructure and and and part of our
ethos is that we we want to share what's

1078
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,400
ethos is that we we want to share what's
 

1079
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,070
ethos is that we we want to share what's
what's invented

1080
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,080
what's invented
 

1081
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,230
what's invented
um broadly we do that with a lot of the

1082
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,240
um broadly we do that with a lot of the
 

1083
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,110
um broadly we do that with a lot of the
the different AI tools that we create

1084
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
the different AI tools that we create
 

1085
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,090
the different AI tools that we create
and llama is the language model that

1086
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,100
and llama is the language model that
 

1087
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,909
and llama is the language model that
that our research team made and

1088
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:40,919
that our research team made and
 

1089
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,730
that our research team made and
you know we we did in a limited

1090
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:43,740
you know we we did in a limited
 

1091
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,830
you know we we did in a limited
um a limited open source release for it

1092
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
um a limited open source release for it
 

1093
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,110
um a limited open source release for it
right where which was intended for

1094
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,120
right where which was intended for
 

1095
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,330
right where which was intended for
researchers to be able to use it

1096
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:50,340
researchers to be able to use it
 

1097
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,990
researchers to be able to use it
um

1098
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,000
um
 

1099
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,750
um
but you know responsibility and getting

1100
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
but you know responsibility and getting
 

1101
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,750
but you know responsibility and getting
safety right on these is um is very

1102
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:56,760
safety right on these is um is very
 

1103
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,090
safety right on these is um is very
important so we didn't think that

1104
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,100
important so we didn't think that
 

1105
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,650
important so we didn't think that
for the first one there were a bunch of

1106
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:00,660
for the first one there were a bunch of
 

1107
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,690
for the first one there were a bunch of
questions around whether we should be

1108
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:02,700
questions around whether we should be
 

1109
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,330
questions around whether we should be
releasing this commercially so we kind

1110
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,340
releasing this commercially so we kind
 

1111
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,370
releasing this commercially so we kind
of punched it on that for for V1 of of

1112
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:07,380
of punched it on that for for V1 of of
 

1113
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,289
of punched it on that for for V1 of of
llama and and just released it from

1114
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:09,299
llama and and just released it from
 

1115
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,450
llama and and just released it from
research now obviously by releasing it

1116
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:11,460
research now obviously by releasing it
 

1117
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,890
research now obviously by releasing it
for research

1118
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:12,900
for research
 

1119
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,510
for research
um you know it's out there but but

1120
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:14,520
um you know it's out there but but
 

1121
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,130
um you know it's out there but but
companies know that that they're that

1122
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,140
companies know that that they're that
 

1123
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,330
companies know that that they're that
they're not supposed to kind of put it

1124
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:17,340
they're not supposed to kind of put it
 

1125
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,029
they're not supposed to kind of put it
into commercial releases and um you know

1126
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:20,039
into commercial releases and um you know
 

1127
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,370
into commercial releases and um you know
we're working on the follow-up models

1128
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:22,380
we're working on the follow-up models
 

1129
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,990
we're working on the follow-up models
for this and and thinking through how

1130
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
for this and and thinking through how
 

1131
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,350
for this and and thinking through how
how um what what the the how exactly

1132
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
how um what what the the how exactly
 

1133
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,909
how um what what the the how exactly
this should work for for follow-on now

1134
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:28,919
this should work for for follow-on now
 

1135
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,830
this should work for for follow-on now
that we've had time to to work on a lot

1136
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:30,840
that we've had time to to work on a lot
 

1137
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,750
that we've had time to to work on a lot
more of the the safety and

1138
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:32,760
more of the the safety and
 

1139
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,549
more of the the safety and
um and the pieces around that but but

1140
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
um and the pieces around that but but
 

1141
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,890
um and the pieces around that but but
overall I mean this is

1142
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:36,900
overall I mean this is
 

1143
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,549
overall I mean this is
I just kind of think that

1144
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
I just kind of think that
 

1145
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,650
I just kind of think that
that it would be good

1146
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:42,660
that it would be good
 

1147
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,010
that it would be good
if there were a lot of different folks

1148
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,020
if there were a lot of different folks
 

1149
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,190
if there were a lot of different folks
who had the ability to build state of

1150
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
who had the ability to build state of
 

1151
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,830
who had the ability to build state of
the art technology here

1152
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
the art technology here
 

1153
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,470
the art technology here
you know it's and not just a small

1154
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
you know it's and not just a small
 

1155
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,810
you know it's and not just a small
number of of big companies we're to

1156
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:56,820
number of of big companies we're to
 

1157
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,909
number of of big companies we're to
train one of these AI models the

1158
00:20:58,909 --> 00:20:58,919
train one of these AI models the
 

1159
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,270
train one of these AI models the
state-of-the-art models is um it just

1160
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,280
state-of-the-art models is um it just
 

1161
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,190
state-of-the-art models is um it just
takes you know hundreds of millions of

1162
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,200
takes you know hundreds of millions of
 

1163
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,230
takes you know hundreds of millions of
dollars of infrastructure right so there

1164
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
dollars of infrastructure right so there
 

1165
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,169
dollars of infrastructure right so there
are not that many organizations in the

1166
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:09,179
are not that many organizations in the
 

1167
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,370
are not that many organizations in the
world

1168
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:10,380
world
 

1169
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,169
world
um that can do that at the biggest scale

1170
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:12,179
um that can do that at the biggest scale
 

1171
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,350
um that can do that at the biggest scale
today and no it gets it gets more

1172
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
today and no it gets it gets more
 

1173
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,510
today and no it gets it gets more
efficient every day so

1174
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
efficient every day so
 

1175
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,610
efficient every day so
um so I I do think that that will be

1176
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:19,620
um so I I do think that that will be
 

1177
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,230
um so I I do think that that will be
available to more folks over time but

1178
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:21,240
available to more folks over time but
 

1179
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,730
available to more folks over time but
but I just think like there's there's

1180
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:22,740
but I just think like there's there's
 

1181
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,169
but I just think like there's there's
all this Innovation out there that

1182
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:24,179
all this Innovation out there that
 

1183
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,870
all this Innovation out there that
people can create and um

1184
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
people can create and um
 

1185
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,669
people can create and um
and and I I just think that will will

1186
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:28,679
and and I I just think that will will
 

1187
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,430
and and I I just think that will will
also learn a lot by by seeing what the

1188
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
also learn a lot by by seeing what the
 

1189
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,190
also learn a lot by by seeing what the
whole community of students and

1190
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:34,200
whole community of students and
 

1191
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,289
whole community of students and
um and hackers and startups and

1192
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:36,299
um and hackers and startups and
 

1193
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,789
um and hackers and startups and
different folks

1194
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:37,799
different folks
 

1195
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,110
different folks
um build with this and that's kind of

1196
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
um build with this and that's kind of
 

1197
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,310
um build with this and that's kind of
that's kind of been how we've approached

1198
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
that's kind of been how we've approached
 

1199
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,350
that's kind of been how we've approached
this and it's also we've done a lot of

1200
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,360
this and it's also we've done a lot of
 

1201
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,850
this and it's also we've done a lot of
our infrastructure and we took our whole

1202
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:43,860
our infrastructure and we took our whole
 

1203
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,890
our infrastructure and we took our whole
data center design and our server design

1204
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:45,900
data center design and our server design
 

1205
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,750
data center design and our server design
and we we built this open compute

1206
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
and we we built this open compute
 

1207
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,070
and we we built this open compute
project where we just made that public

1208
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,080
project where we just made that public
 

1209
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,330
project where we just made that public
and

1210
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,340
and
 

1211
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,890
and
um part of the theory was like all right

1212
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:51,900
um part of the theory was like all right
 

1213
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,210
um part of the theory was like all right
if we make it's that more people can use

1214
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,220
if we make it's that more people can use
 

1215
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,230
if we make it's that more people can use
this server design then um then that'll

1216
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,240
this server design then um then that'll
 

1217
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,789
this server design then um then that'll
enable more Innovation it'll also make

1218
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
enable more Innovation it'll also make
 

1219
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,470
enable more Innovation it'll also make
the server design more efficient and

1220
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
the server design more efficient and
 

1221
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,149
the server design more efficient and
that'll that'll make our business more

1222
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
that'll that'll make our business more
 

1223
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,590
that'll that'll make our business more
efficient too so that's worked and we've

1224
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
efficient too so that's worked and we've
 

1225
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,029
efficient too so that's worked and we've
we've just done this with a lot of our

1226
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
we've just done this with a lot of our
 

1227
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,409
we've just done this with a lot of our
our infrastructure

1228
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:06,419
our infrastructure
 

1229
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,390
our infrastructure
so for people who don't know you did the

1230
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
so for people who don't know you did the
 

1231
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,310
so for people who don't know you did the
limited release I think in February of

1232
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
limited release I think in February of
 

1233
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,470
limited release I think in February of
one of this year of llama

1234
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
one of this year of llama
 

1235
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,490
one of this year of llama
and it got quote unquote leaked

1236
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:16,500
and it got quote unquote leaked
 

1237
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,190
and it got quote unquote leaked
meaning like it's uh

1238
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
meaning like it's uh
 

1239
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,810
meaning like it's uh
escaped

1240
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:20,820
escaped
 

1241
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,810
escaped
the uh the the limited release aspect

1242
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:23,820
the uh the the limited release aspect
 

1243
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,370
the uh the the limited release aspect
but it was

1244
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,380
but it was
 

1245
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,230
but it was
you know that something you probably

1246
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,240
you know that something you probably
 

1247
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,090
you know that something you probably
anticipated given that it's just

1248
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,100
anticipated given that it's just
 

1249
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,890
anticipated given that it's just
released we shared it with researchers

1250
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:30,900
released we shared it with researchers
 

1251
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,470
released we shared it with researchers
right so it's just trying to make sure

1252
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:33,480
right so it's just trying to make sure
 

1253
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,950
right so it's just trying to make sure
that there's like a slow release yeah uh

1254
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
that there's like a slow release yeah uh
 

1255
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,690
that there's like a slow release yeah uh
but from there I just would love to get

1256
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:38,700
but from there I just would love to get
 

1257
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,190
but from there I just would love to get
your comment on what happened next which

1258
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,200
your comment on what happened next which
 

1259
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,049
your comment on what happened next which
is like this is a very vibrant open

1260
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:42,059
is like this is a very vibrant open
 

1261
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,549
is like this is a very vibrant open
source community that just builds stuff

1262
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:43,559
source community that just builds stuff
 

1263
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,110
source community that just builds stuff
on top of it there's uh llama CPP

1264
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,120
on top of it there's uh llama CPP
 

1265
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,190
on top of it there's uh llama CPP
basically stuff that makes it more

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
basically stuff that makes it more
 

1267
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,830
basically stuff that makes it more
efficient to run on smaller computers uh

1268
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
efficient to run on smaller computers uh

1270
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:54,780
there's combining with uh reinforcement

00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,930
there's combining with uh reinforcement
learning with human feedback so some of

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
mechanisms there's then also like
 

1277
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,450
mechanisms there's then also like
fine-tuning and a GPT three generations

there's a lot of uh GPT for all alpaca

1280
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
there's a lot of uh GPT for all alpaca
 

1281

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:08,460
uh colossal AI all these kinds of models
 

1283
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,370
uh colossal AI all these kinds of models
just kind of spring up like

1284
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:10,380
just kind of spring up like
 

1285
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,590
just kind of spring up like
run on top of wood yeah like what do you

1286
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,600
run on top of wood yeah like what do you
 

1287
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,970
run on top of wood yeah like what do you
think about that no I think it's been

1288
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:13,980
think about that no I think it's been
 

1289
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,190
think about that no I think it's been
really neat to see I mean there's been

1290
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:16,200
really neat to see I mean there's been
 

1291
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,649
really neat to see I mean there's been
folks who are getting it to run on local

1292
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:18,659
folks who are getting it to run on local
 

1293
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,270
folks who are getting it to run on local
devices right so if you're an individual

1294
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,280
devices right so if you're an individual
 

1295
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,630
devices right so if you're an individual
who just you know wants to experiment

1296
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
who just you know wants to experiment
 

1297
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,890
who just you know wants to experiment
you know with this at home

1298
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:24,900
you know with this at home
 

1299
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,510
you know with this at home
you probably don't have a large budget

1300
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:26,520
you probably don't have a large budget
 

1301
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,029
you probably don't have a large budget
to get access to like a large amount of

1302
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
to get access to like a large amount of
 

1303
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,409
to get access to like a large amount of
cloud compute so getting it to run on

1304
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:30,419
cloud compute so getting it to run on
 

1305
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,690
cloud compute so getting it to run on
your local laptop

1306
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:32,700
your local laptop
 

1307
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,850
your local laptop
um you know is is uh is pretty good

1308
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:34,860
um you know is is uh is pretty good
 

1309
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,070
um you know is is uh is pretty good
right and pretty relevant

1310
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,080
right and pretty relevant
 

1311
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,450
right and pretty relevant
um and then there are things like yeah

1312
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:38,460
um and then there are things like yeah
 

1313
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,789
um and then there are things like yeah
llama CPP

1314
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
llama CPP
 

1315
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,950
llama CPP
um re-implemented it more efficiently so

1316
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
um re-implemented it more efficiently so
 

1317
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,570
um re-implemented it more efficiently so
you know now even when we run our own

1318
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:44,580
you know now even when we run our own
 

1319
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,850
you know now even when we run our own
versions of it we can do it on way less

1320
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:46,860
versions of it we can do it on way less
 

1321
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,830
versions of it we can do it on way less
compute and it just way more efficient

1322
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
compute and it just way more efficient
 

1323
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,330
compute and it just way more efficient
save a lot of money

1324
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,340
save a lot of money
 

1325
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,190
save a lot of money
um for everyone who uses this so that

1326
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,200
um for everyone who uses this so that
 

1327
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,649
um for everyone who uses this so that
that is is is good

1328
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:54,659
that is is is good
 

1329
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:55,669
that is is is good
um

1330
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
um
 

1331
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,090
um
I do think it's worth calling out that

1332
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,100
I do think it's worth calling out that
 

1333
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,010
I do think it's worth calling out that
because this was a relatively early

1334
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,020
because this was a relatively early
 

1335
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,750
because this was a relatively early
release

1336
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:02,760
release
 

1337
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,350
release
um

1338
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
um
 

1339
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,789
um
llama isn't quite as on the frontier as

1340
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:07,799
llama isn't quite as on the frontier as
 

1341
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,669
llama isn't quite as on the frontier as
for example the biggest open AI models

1342
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:10,679
for example the biggest open AI models
 

1343
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,669
for example the biggest open AI models
or the biggest Google models right when

1344
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
or the biggest Google models right when
 

1345
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,370
or the biggest Google models right when
you mentioned that the largest llama

1346
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:16,380
you mentioned that the largest llama
 

1347
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,230
you mentioned that the largest llama
model that we released had 65 billion

1348
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
model that we released had 65 billion
 

1349
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,649
model that we released had 65 billion
parameters and when no one knows you

1350
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:21,659
parameters and when no one knows you
 

1351
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,070
parameters and when no one knows you
know I guess outside of open AI exactly

1352
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,080
know I guess outside of open AI exactly
 

1353
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,890
know I guess outside of open AI exactly
what the specs are for um for for gpd4

1354
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:27,900
what the specs are for um for for gpd4
 

1355
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,630
what the specs are for um for for gpd4
but but I I think the you know my

1356
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:29,640
but but I I think the you know my
 

1357
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,430
but but I I think the you know my
understanding is it's like 10 times

1358
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
understanding is it's like 10 times
 

1359
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,830
understanding is it's like 10 times
bigger and I think Google's Palm model

1360
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
bigger and I think Google's Palm model
 

1361
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,169
bigger and I think Google's Palm model
is is also I think has about 10 times as

1362
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:36,179
is is also I think has about 10 times as
 

1363
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,149
is is also I think has about 10 times as
many parameters now the Llama models are

1364
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
many parameters now the Llama models are
 

1365
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,070
many parameters now the Llama models are
very efficient so they perform well for

1366
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
very efficient so they perform well for
 

1367
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,870
very efficient so they perform well for
for something that's around 65 billion

1368
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:41,880
for something that's around 65 billion
 

1369
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,090
for something that's around 65 billion
parameters so for me that was also part

1370
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,100
parameters so for me that was also part
 

1371
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,590
parameters so for me that was also part
of this because there's this whole

1372
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
of this because there's this whole
 

1373
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,350
of this because there's this whole
debate around you know is it good for

1374
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:48,360
debate around you know is it good for
 

1375
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,430
debate around you know is it good for
everyone in the world to have access to

1376
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:52,440
everyone in the world to have access to
 

1377
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,450
everyone in the world to have access to
um to the most Frontier AI models and I

1378
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:56,460
um to the most Frontier AI models and I
 

1379
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,510
um to the most Frontier AI models and I
I think as the AI models start

1380
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
I think as the AI models start
 

1381
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,210
I think as the AI models start
approaching something that's like a

1382
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,220
approaching something that's like a
 

1383
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,490
approaching something that's like a
super human intelligent sense like that

1384
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:04,500
super human intelligent sense like that
 

1385
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,870
super human intelligent sense like that
that's a bigger question that we'll have

1386
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:05,880
that's a bigger question that we'll have
 

1387
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,190
that's a bigger question that we'll have
to Grapple with but right now I mean

1388
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
to Grapple with but right now I mean
 

1389
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,370
to Grapple with but right now I mean
these are still you know very basic

1390
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:10,380
these are still you know very basic
 

1391
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,409
these are still you know very basic
tools they're um you know they're

1392
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:12,419
tools they're um you know they're
 

1393
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,330
tools they're um you know they're
they're powerful in the sense that you

1394
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:14,340
they're powerful in the sense that you
 

1395
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,770
they're powerful in the sense that you
know a lot of Open Source software like

1396
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:15,780
know a lot of Open Source software like
 

1397
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,950
know a lot of Open Source software like
databases or web servers can enable a

1398
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
databases or web servers can enable a
 

1399
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,529
databases or web servers can enable a
lot of pretty important things

1400
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:21,539
lot of pretty important things
 

1401
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,270
lot of pretty important things
um but

1402
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,280
um but
 

1403
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,250
um but
I don't think anyone looks at the the

1404
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:25,260
I don't think anyone looks at the the
 

1405
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,769
I don't think anyone looks at the the
you know the current generation of llama

1406
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:27,779
you know the current generation of llama
 

1407
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,330
you know the current generation of llama
and thinks it's um you know anywhere

1408
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:29,340
and thinks it's um you know anywhere
 

1409
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,070
and thinks it's um you know anywhere
near a super intelligence so I think

1410
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,080
near a super intelligence so I think
 

1411
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,210
near a super intelligence so I think
that a bunch of those questions around

1412
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:32,220
that a bunch of those questions around
 

1413
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,909
that a bunch of those questions around
like is it is it good to to kind of get

1414
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:34,919
like is it is it good to to kind of get
 

1415
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,669
like is it is it good to to kind of get
out there I think at this stage surely

1416
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
out there I think at this stage surely
 

1417
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,070
out there I think at this stage surely
you you want more researchers working on

1418
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
you you want more researchers working on
 

1419
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,990
you you want more researchers working on
it for all the reasons that

1420
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
it for all the reasons that
 

1421
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,029
it for all the reasons that
um that open source software has a lot

1422
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:44,039
um that open source software has a lot
 

1423
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,049
um that open source software has a lot
of advantages and we talked about

1424
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:45,059
of advantages and we talked about
 

1425
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,669
of advantages and we talked about
efficiency before but another one is

1426
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:46,679
efficiency before but another one is
 

1427
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,649
efficiency before but another one is
just open source software tends to be

1428
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:48,659
just open source software tends to be
 

1429
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,690
just open source software tends to be
more secure because you have more people

1430
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:50,700
more secure because you have more people
 

1431
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,149
more secure because you have more people
looking at it openly and scrutinizing it

1432
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:53,159
looking at it openly and scrutinizing it
 

1433
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,730
looking at it openly and scrutinizing it
and finding holes in it

1434
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:55,740
and finding holes in it
 

1435
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,409
and finding holes in it
um and that makes it more safe so I

1436
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:57,419
um and that makes it more safe so I
 

1437
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,149
um and that makes it more safe so I
think at this point it's more

1438
00:25:59,149 --> 00:25:59,159
think at this point it's more
 

1439
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,510
think at this point it's more
I think it's generally agreed upon that

1440
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:02,520
I think it's generally agreed upon that
 

1441
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,850
I think it's generally agreed upon that
open source software is generally more

1442
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:04,860
open source software is generally more
 

1443
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,649
open source software is generally more
secure and safer

1444
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:06,659
secure and safer
 

1445
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:07,909
secure and safer
um than things that are kind of

1446
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:07,919
um than things that are kind of
 

1447
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,590
um than things that are kind of
developed in a silo where people try to

1448
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
developed in a silo where people try to
 

1449
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,269
developed in a silo where people try to
get through security through obscurity

1450
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,279
get through security through obscurity
 

1451
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,450
get through security through obscurity
so I think that for the scale of of what

1452
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:14,460
so I think that for the scale of of what
 

1453
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,250
so I think that for the scale of of what
we're seeing now with AI

1454
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:16,260
we're seeing now with AI
 

1455
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,529
we're seeing now with AI
I think we're more likely to get to you

1456
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:18,539
I think we're more likely to get to you
 

1457
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,049
I think we're more likely to get to you
know good alignment and good

1458
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:21,059
know good alignment and good
 

1459
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,029
know good alignment and good
um understanding of of kind of what

1460
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
um understanding of of kind of what
 

1461
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,010
um understanding of of kind of what
needs to do to make this work well by

1462
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,020
needs to do to make this work well by
 

1463
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,690
needs to do to make this work well by
having it be open source and and that's

1464
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:26,700
having it be open source and and that's
 

1465
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,310
having it be open source and and that's
something that I think is is quite good

1466
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
something that I think is is quite good
 

1467
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,930
something that I think is is quite good
to have out there and and happening

1468
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:29,940
to have out there and and happening
 

1469
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,909
to have out there and and happening
publicly at this point meta released a

1470
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
publicly at this point meta released a
 

1471
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,390
publicly at this point meta released a
lot of models as open source so uh the

1472
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,400
lot of models as open source so uh the
 

1473
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,269
lot of models as open source so uh the
Massillon multi-lingual speech model

1474
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:40,279

 

1475
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,289

I'll ask you questions about those but

1476
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:42,299
I'll ask you questions about those but
 

1477
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:43,789
I'll ask you questions about those but
the point is

1478
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:43,799
the point is
 

1479
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,190
the point is
uh you've open source quite a lot you've

1480
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,200
uh you've open source quite a lot you've
 

1481
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,450
uh you've open source quite a lot you've
been spearheading the open source

1482
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:47,460
been spearheading the open source
 

1483
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,730
been spearheading the open source
movement where's uh that's really

1484
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:49,740
movement where's uh that's really
 

1485
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,010
movement where's uh that's really
positive inspiring to see from one angle

1486
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,020
positive inspiring to see from one angle
 

1487
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,390
positive inspiring to see from one angle
from the research angle of course

1488
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:53,400
from the research angle of course
 

1489
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,250
from the research angle of course
there's folks who are really terrified

1490
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,260
there's folks who are really terrified
 

1491
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,110
there's folks who are really terrified
about the existential threat of

1492
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
about the existential threat of
 

1493
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,330
about the existential threat of
artificial intelligence and those folks

1494
00:26:59,330 --> 00:26:59,340
artificial intelligence and those folks
 

1495
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,330
artificial intelligence and those folks
will say that you know

1496
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:02,340
will say that you know
 

1497
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,190
will say that you know
um you have to be careful about the open

1498
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,200
um you have to be careful about the open
 

1499
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,610
um you have to be careful about the open
sourcing uh step but where do you see

1500
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:07,620
sourcing uh step but where do you see
 

1501
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,830
sourcing uh step but where do you see
the future of Open Source here uh as

1502
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
the future of Open Source here uh as
 

1503
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,269
the future of Open Source here uh as
part of meta the tension here is do you

1504
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:14,279
part of meta the tension here is do you
 

1505
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,370
part of meta the tension here is do you
want to release the magic sauce that's

1506
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:16,380
want to release the magic sauce that's
 

1507
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,269
want to release the magic sauce that's
one

1508
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,279
one
 

1509
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,390
one
tension and the other one is uh do you

1510
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,400
tension and the other one is uh do you
 

1511
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,789
tension and the other one is uh do you
want to put a powerful tool in the hands

1512
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
want to put a powerful tool in the hands
 

1513
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,149
want to put a powerful tool in the hands
of uh Bad actors even though it probably

1514
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
of uh Bad actors even though it probably
 

1515
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,769
of uh Bad actors even though it probably
has a huge amount of positive impact

1516
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:27,779
has a huge amount of positive impact
 

1517
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,029
has a huge amount of positive impact
also

1518
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
also
 

1519
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,470
also
yeah I mean again

1520
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
yeah I mean again
 

1521
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,970
yeah I mean again
stage that we're at in the development

1522
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:31,980
stage that we're at in the development
 

1523
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,190
stage that we're at in the development
of AI I don't think anyone looks at the

1524
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,200
of AI I don't think anyone looks at the
 

1525
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,870
of AI I don't think anyone looks at the
current state of things and thinks that

1526
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:35,880
current state of things and thinks that
 

1527
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,390
current state of things and thinks that
this is super intelligence

1528
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,400
this is super intelligence
 

1529
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,130
this is super intelligence
um and you know the models that we're

1530
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,140
um and you know the models that we're
 

1531
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,950
um and you know the models that we're
talking about for the Llama models here

1532
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
talking about for the Llama models here
 

1533
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,409
talking about for the Llama models here
are you know generally an order of

1534
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:45,419
are you know generally an order of
 

1535
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,269
are you know generally an order of
magnitude smaller than what open AI or

1536
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:47,279
magnitude smaller than what open AI or
 

1537
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,890
magnitude smaller than what open AI or
Google are doing so

1538
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:48,900
Google are doing so
 

1539
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,169
Google are doing so
I think that at least for the stage that

1540
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:51,179
I think that at least for the stage that
 

1541
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,690
I think that at least for the stage that
we're at now the equities

1542
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:53,700
we're at now the equities
 

1543
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,330
we're at now the equities
balance strongly in my view towards

1544
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:56,340
balance strongly in my view towards
 

1545
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,250
balance strongly in my view towards
doing this more openly

1546
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,260
doing this more openly
 

1547
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,049
doing this more openly
um I think if you got something that was

1548
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:00,059
um I think if you got something that was
 

1549
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,409
um I think if you got something that was
closer to Super intelligence then I

1550
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:03,419
closer to Super intelligence then I
 

1551
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,149
closer to Super intelligence then I
think you'd have to discuss that more

1552
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:05,159
think you'd have to discuss that more
 

1553
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,310
think you'd have to discuss that more
and and think through that

1554
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,320
and and think through that
 

1555
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,990
and and think through that
um a lot more and we haven't made a

1556
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,000
um a lot more and we haven't made a
 

1557
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,730
um a lot more and we haven't made a
decision yet as to what we would do if

1558
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:10,740
decision yet as to what we would do if
 

1559
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,110
decision yet as to what we would do if
we were in that position but I don't

1560
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,120
we were in that position but I don't
 

1561
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,730
we were in that position but I don't
think I think there's a good chance that

1562
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:13,740
think I think there's a good chance that
 

1563
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,930
think I think there's a good chance that
we're pretty far off from that position

1564
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:14,940
we're pretty far off from that position
 

1565
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,370
we're pretty far off from that position
so

1566
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:16,380
so
 

1567
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,810
so
um so

1568
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:17,820
um so
 

1569
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,149
um so
I'm not

1570
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:20,159
I'm not
 

1571
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,370
I'm not
uh I'm certainly not saying that the

1572
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:22,380
uh I'm certainly not saying that the
 

1573
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,769
uh I'm certainly not saying that the
position that we're taking on this now

1574
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:24,779
position that we're taking on this now
 

1575
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,630
position that we're taking on this now
applies to every single thing that we

1576
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
applies to every single thing that we
 

1577
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,250
applies to every single thing that we
would ever do and you know certainly

1578
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,260
would ever do and you know certainly
 

1579
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,990
would ever do and you know certainly
inside the company and we probably do

1580
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
inside the company and we probably do
 

1581
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,789
inside the company and we probably do
more open source work than

1582
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:31,799
more open source work than
 

1583
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,289
more open source work than
you know most of the other big tech

1584
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:33,299
you know most of the other big tech
 

1585
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,450
you know most of the other big tech
companies but we also don't open source

1586
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:35,460
companies but we also don't open source
 

1587
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,909
companies but we also don't open source
everything and a lot of our the core

1588
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
everything and a lot of our the core
 

1589
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,850
everything and a lot of our the core
kind of app code for WhatsApp or

1590
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:40,860
kind of app code for WhatsApp or
 

1591
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,289
kind of app code for WhatsApp or
Instagram or something I mean we're not

1592
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:42,299
Instagram or something I mean we're not
 

1593
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,269
Instagram or something I mean we're not
open sourcing that it's not like a a

1594
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:44,279
open sourcing that it's not like a a
 

1595
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,010
open sourcing that it's not like a a
general enough piece of software that

1596
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,020
general enough piece of software that
 

1597
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,690
general enough piece of software that
would be useful for a lot of people to

1598
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:47,700
would be useful for a lot of people to
 

1599
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,730
would be useful for a lot of people to
do different things

1600
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:49,740
do different things
 

1601
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,430
do different things
um you know whereas

1602
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
um you know whereas
 

1603
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,930
um you know whereas
the software that we do whether it's

1604
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:53,940
the software that we do whether it's
 

1605
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,230
the software that we do whether it's
like a an open source server design or

1606
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,240
like a an open source server design or
 

1607
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,330
like a an open source server design or
um or basically you know things like

1608
00:28:59,330 --> 00:28:59,340
um or basically you know things like
 

1609
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,730
um or basically you know things like
memcache right like a good you know it

1610
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:01,740
memcache right like a good you know it
 

1611
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,190
memcache right like a good you know it
was probably our earliest project

1612
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,200
was probably our earliest project
 

1613
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,750
was probably our earliest project
um that I worked on it was probably one

1614
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
um that I worked on it was probably one
 

1615
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,250
um that I worked on it was probably one
of the last things that I that I coded

1616
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,260
of the last things that I that I coded
 

1617
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,010
of the last things that I that I coded
and and led directly for the company

1618
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,020
and and led directly for the company
 

1619
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,649
and and led directly for the company
um but but basically this like caching

1620
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:12,659
um but but basically this like caching
 

1621
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,269
um but but basically this like caching
tool

1622
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:14,279
tool
 

1623
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,730
tool
um for for quick data retrieval

1624
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:16,740
um for for quick data retrieval
 

1625
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,470
um for for quick data retrieval
um these are things that are just

1626
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
um these are things that are just
 

1627
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,529
um these are things that are just
broadly useful across like anything that

1628
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:21,539
broadly useful across like anything that
 

1629
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,330
broadly useful across like anything that
you want to build and and I think that

1630
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:23,340
you want to build and and I think that
 

1631
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,409
you want to build and and I think that
some of the

1632
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:24,419
some of the
 

1633
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,289
some of the
language models now have that feel as

1634
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:27,299
language models now have that feel as
 

1635
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,310
language models now have that feel as
well as some of the other things that

1636
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
well as some of the other things that
 

1637
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,810
well as some of the other things that
we're building like the translation tool

1638
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:29,820
we're building like the translation tool
 

1639
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,450
we're building like the translation tool
that that you just referenced so text to

1640
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:32,460
that that you just referenced so text to
 

1641
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,909
that that you just referenced so text to
speech and speech to text you've

1642
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:34,919
speech and speech to text you've
 

1643
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,649
speech and speech to text you've
expanded it from around 100 languages to

1644
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:36,659
expanded it from around 100 languages to
 

1645
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,230
expanded it from around 100 languages to
more than 1100 languages yeah and you

1646
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:39,240
more than 1100 languages yeah and you
 

1647
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,970
more than 1100 languages yeah and you
can identify more than the model can

1648
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:40,980
can identify more than the model can
 

1649
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,350
can identify more than the model can
identify more than

1650
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:42,360
identify more than
 

1651
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,049
identify more than
4 000 spoken languages which is 40 times

1652
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:45,059
4 000 spoken languages which is 40 times
 

1653
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,870
4 000 spoken languages which is 40 times
more than any known previous technology

1654
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
more than any known previous technology
 

1655
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,029
more than any known previous technology
to me that's really really exciting in

1656
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:50,039
to me that's really really exciting in
 

1657
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,490
to me that's really really exciting in
terms of connecting the world breaking

1658
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:52,500
terms of connecting the world breaking
 

1659
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,950
terms of connecting the world breaking
down barriers that language creates yeah

1660
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
down barriers that language creates yeah
 

1661
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,090
down barriers that language creates yeah
I think being able to translate between

1662
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,100
I think being able to translate between
 

1663
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,769
I think being able to translate between
all of these different

1664
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:57,779
all of these different
 

1665
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:02,090
all of these different
pieces in real time this has been a

1666
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:02,100
pieces in real time this has been a
 

1667
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,950
pieces in real time this has been a
kind of common sci-fi idea that we'd all

1668
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
kind of common sci-fi idea that we'd all
 

1669
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,750
kind of common sci-fi idea that we'd all
have you know whether it's

1670
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:08,760
have you know whether it's
 

1671
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,090
have you know whether it's
on an earbud or glasses or something

1672
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,100
on an earbud or glasses or something
 

1673
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,850
on an earbud or glasses or something
that can help translate in real time

1674
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:13,860
that can help translate in real time
 

1675
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,169
that can help translate in real time
um between all these different languages

1676
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:15,179
um between all these different languages
 

1677
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,549
um between all these different languages
and that's one that I think technology

1678
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
and that's one that I think technology
 

1679
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,450
and that's one that I think technology
is basically delivering now so I think

1680
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:20,460
is basically delivering now so I think
 

1681
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,470
is basically delivering now so I think
yeah I think that's pretty pretty

1682
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:21,480
yeah I think that's pretty pretty
 

1683
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,049
yeah I think that's pretty pretty
exciting uh you mentioned the next

1684
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:24,059
exciting uh you mentioned the next
 

1685
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,789
exciting uh you mentioned the next
version of llama what can you say about

1686
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:25,799
version of llama what can you say about
 

1687
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,710
version of llama what can you say about
the next version of llama

1688
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:27,720
the next version of llama
 

1689
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,529
the next version of llama
what what can you say about like what uh

1690
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:30,539
what what can you say about like what uh
 

1691
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,029
what what can you say about like what uh
what were you working on in terms of

1692
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:32,039
what were you working on in terms of
 

1693
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,430
what were you working on in terms of
release in terms of the vision for that

1694
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:34,440
release in terms of the vision for that
 

1695
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,490
release in terms of the vision for that
well a lot of what we're doing is taking

1696
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:37,500
well a lot of what we're doing is taking
 

1697
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,010
well a lot of what we're doing is taking
the first version which was primarily

1698
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,020
the first version which was primarily
 

1699
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,649
the first version which was primarily
you know this research version and

1700
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:42,659
you know this research version and
 

1701
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,930
you know this research version and
trying to now build a version that has

1702
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:46,940
trying to now build a version that has
 

1703
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,370
trying to now build a version that has
all of the latest state-of-the-art

1704
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:49,380
all of the latest state-of-the-art
 

1705
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,190
all of the latest state-of-the-art
safety precautions built in

1706
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,200
safety precautions built in
 

1707
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,169
safety precautions built in
um and and we're

1708
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:54,179
um and and we're
 

1709
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,789
um and and we're
um we're using some more data to train

1710
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:55,799
um we're using some more data to train
 

1711
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,630
um we're using some more data to train
it from across our services but

1712
00:30:59,630 --> 00:30:59,640
it from across our services but
 

1713
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,430
it from across our services but
but a lot of the the work that we're

1714
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
but a lot of the the work that we're
 

1715
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,590
but a lot of the the work that we're
doing internally is really just focused

1716
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
doing internally is really just focused
 

1717
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,169
doing internally is really just focused
on making sure that this is

1718
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:06,179
on making sure that this is
 

1719
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,789
on making sure that this is
um you know as

1720
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:07,799
um you know as
 

1721
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,210
um you know as
aligned and responsible as possible and

1722
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:11,220
aligned and responsible as possible and
 

1723
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,710
aligned and responsible as possible and
you know we're building a lot of our own

1724
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
you know we're building a lot of our own
 

1725
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,870
you know we're building a lot of our own
you know we're talking about kind of the

1726
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
you know we're talking about kind of the
 

1727
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,149
you know we're talking about kind of the
open source infrastructure but you know

1728
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:17,159
open source infrastructure but you know
 

1729
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:17,810
open source infrastructure but you know
the

1730
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:17,820
the
 

1731
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,370
the
the main thing that we focus on building

1732
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:19,380
the main thing that we focus on building
 

1733
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,750
the main thing that we focus on building
here are you know a lot of product

1734

I've talked about a bunch of this stuff

1740
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,220
I've talked about a bunch of this stuff
 

1741
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,529
I've talked about a bunch of this stuff
but um you'll have an assistant that you

1742
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:30,539
but um you'll have an assistant that you
 

1743
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,269
but um you'll have an assistant that you
can talk to in WhatsApp

1744
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:32,279
can talk to in WhatsApp
 

1745
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,950
can talk to in WhatsApp
um you know I think I I think in the

1746
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:33,960
um you know I think I I think in the
 

1747
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,470
um you know I think I I think in the
future every Creator will will have kind

1748
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
future every Creator will will have kind
 

1749
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,750
future every Creator will will have kind
of an AI agent that can kind of act on

1750
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:38,760
of an AI agent that can kind of act on
 

1751
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,669
of an AI agent that can kind of act on
their behalf that their fans can talk to

1752
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:40,679
their behalf that their fans can talk to
 

1753
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,710
their behalf that their fans can talk to
I I want to get to the point where every

1754
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
I I want to get to the point where every
 

1755
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,649
I I want to get to the point where every
small business basically has an AI agent

1756
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:45,659
small business basically has an AI agent
 

1757
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,110
small business basically has an AI agent
that people can talk to for you know to

1758
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,120
that people can talk to for you know to
 

1759
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,730
that people can talk to for you know to
do Commerce and customer support and

1760
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:49,740
do Commerce and customer support and
 

1761
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,470
do Commerce and customer support and
things like that so they're going to be

1762
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:51,480
things like that so they're going to be
 

1763
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,950
things like that so they're going to be
all these different things and

1764
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
all these different things and
 

1765
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,110
all these different things and
llama or the language model underlying

1766
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
llama or the language model underlying
 

1767
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,029
llama or the language model underlying
this is is basically going to be the

1768
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
this is is basically going to be the
 

1769
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,010
this is is basically going to be the
engine that powers that the reason to

1770
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,020
engine that powers that the reason to
 

1771
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,850
engine that powers that the reason to
open source it is that um as we did with

1772
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:04,860
open source it is that um as we did with
 

1773
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,430
open source it is that um as we did with
um with the the first version is that it

1774
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
um with the the first version is that it
 

1775
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,350
um with the the first version is that it
uh

1776
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,360
uh
 

1777
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,750
uh
basically it unlocks a lot of innovation

1778
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
basically it unlocks a lot of innovation
 

1779
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,330
basically it unlocks a lot of innovation
in the ecosystem will make our products

1780
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:14,340
in the ecosystem will make our products
 

1781
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,850
in the ecosystem will make our products
better as well and also gives us a lot

1782
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:16,860
better as well and also gives us a lot
 

1783
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,529
better as well and also gives us a lot
of valuable feedback on security and

1784
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:18,539
of valuable feedback on security and
 

1785
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,389
of valuable feedback on security and
safety which is important for making

1786
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
safety which is important for making
 

1787
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,730
safety which is important for making
this good but yeah I mean the the work

1788
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:22,740
this good but yeah I mean the the work
 

1789
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,230
this good but yeah I mean the the work
that we're doing to advance the

1790
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
that we're doing to advance the
 

1791
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,470
that we're doing to advance the
infrastructure it's um it's basically at

1792
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:27,480
infrastructure it's um it's basically at
 

1793
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,149
infrastructure it's um it's basically at
this point taking it Beyond a research

1794
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:29,159
this point taking it Beyond a research
 

1795
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,370
this point taking it Beyond a research
project into something which is ready to

1796
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,380
project into something which is ready to
 

1797
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,010
project into something which is ready to
be kind of core infrastructure not only

1798
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,020
be kind of core infrastructure not only
 

1799
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,350
be kind of core infrastructure not only
for our own products but

1800
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,360
for our own products but
 

1801
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,029
for our own products but
um you know hopefully for for a lot of

1802
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:38,039
um you know hopefully for for a lot of
 

1803
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,649
um you know hopefully for for a lot of
other things out there too do you think

1804
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:39,659
other things out there too do you think
 

1805
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,750
other things out there too do you think
the Llama Or the language model

1806
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
the Llama Or the language model
 

1807
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,990
the Llama Or the language model
underlying that version two will be open

1808
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,000
underlying that version two will be open
 

1809
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,750
underlying that version two will be open
sourced

1810
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:46,760
sourced
 

1811
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,310
sourced
you're you have internal debate around

1812
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,320
you're you have internal debate around
 

1813
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,010
you're you have internal debate around
that the pros and cons and so on this is

1814
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,020
that the pros and cons and so on this is
 

1815
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,269
that the pros and cons and so on this is
I mean we were talking about the debates

1816
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:53,279
I mean we were talking about the debates
 

1817
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,730
I mean we were talking about the debates
that we have internally and I think

1818
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:55,740
that we have internally and I think
 

1819
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,570
that we have internally and I think
um

1820
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:56,580
um
 

1821
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,310
um
I think the question is how to do it

1822
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
I think the question is how to do it
 

1823
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,950
I think the question is how to do it
right I mean it's I think we

1824
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:00,960
right I mean it's I think we
 

1825
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,230
right I mean it's I think we
you know we did the research license for

1826
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:03,240
you know we did the research license for
 

1827
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,450
you know we did the research license for
V1 and and I think the the big thing

1828
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:05,460
V1 and and I think the the big thing
 

1829
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,730
V1 and and I think the the big thing
that we're that we're thinking about is

1830
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:07,740
that we're that we're thinking about is
 

1831
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,529
that we're that we're thinking about is
is basically like what's the what's the

1832
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:09,539
is basically like what's the what's the
 

1833
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,049
is basically like what's the what's the
right the right way so there was a leak

1834
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:12,059
right the right way so there was a leak
 

1835
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,789
right the right way so there was a leak
that happened I don't know if you can

1836
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:13,799
that happened I don't know if you can
 

1837
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,070
that happened I don't know if you can
comment on it for V1 you know we

1838
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
comment on it for V1 you know we
 

1839
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,370
comment on it for V1 you know we
released it as a research project

1840
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,380
released it as a research project
 

1841
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,950
released it as a research project
um for researchers to be able to use but

1842
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:21,960
um for researchers to be able to use but
 

1843
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,649
um for researchers to be able to use but
in doing so we put it out there so

1844
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:24,659
in doing so we put it out there so
 

1845
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,570
in doing so we put it out there so
um you know we were very clear that

1846
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:26,580
um you know we were very clear that
 

1847
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,430
um you know we were very clear that
anyone who uses the the code and the

1848
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:28,440
anyone who uses the the code and the
 

1849
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,630
anyone who uses the the code and the
weights doesn't have a commercial

1850
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:29,640
weights doesn't have a commercial
 

1851
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,029
weights doesn't have a commercial
license to put into products and we've

1852
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:32,039
license to put into products and we've
 

1853
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,590
license to put into products and we've
we've generally seen people respect that

1854
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:33,600
we've generally seen people respect that
 

1855
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,450
we've generally seen people respect that
right it's like you don't have any

1856
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:35,460
right it's like you don't have any
 

1857
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,130
right it's like you don't have any
reputable companies that are basically

1858
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:37,140
reputable companies that are basically
 

1859
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,409
reputable companies that are basically
trying to put this into into

1860
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:39,419
trying to put this into into
 

1861
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,149
trying to put this into into
um their commercial products but but

1862
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:41,159
um their commercial products but but
 

1863
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,190
um their commercial products but but
yeah but by sharing it with you know so

1864
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
yeah but by sharing it with you know so
 

1865
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,470
yeah but by sharing it with you know so
many researchers it's it's you know yeah

1866
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:45,480
many researchers it's it's you know yeah
 

1867
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,049
many researchers it's it's you know yeah
it did leave the building but uh what

1868
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:48,059
it did leave the building but uh what
 

1869
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,310
it did leave the building but uh what
have you learned from that process that

1870
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,320
have you learned from that process that
 

1871
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,549
have you learned from that process that
you might be able to apply to V2 about

1872
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
you might be able to apply to V2 about
 

1873
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,090
you might be able to apply to V2 about
how to release it safely effectively uh

1874
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,100
how to release it safely effectively uh
 

1875
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,310
how to release it safely effectively uh
if if you release it yeah well I mean I

1876
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
if if you release it yeah well I mean I
 

1877
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,930
if if you release it yeah well I mean I
think a lot of the feedback like I said

1878
00:33:59,930 --> 00:33:59,940
think a lot of the feedback like I said
 

1879
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,210
think a lot of the feedback like I said
is just around you know different things

1880
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:02,220
is just around you know different things
 

1881
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,610
is just around you know different things
around you know how do you fine-tune

1882
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:04,620
around you know how do you fine-tune
 

1883
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,009
around you know how do you fine-tune
models to make them more aligned and

1884
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:07,019
models to make them more aligned and
 

1885
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,470
models to make them more aligned and
safer and you see all the different data

1886
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:09,480
safer and you see all the different data
 

1887
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,389
safer and you see all the different data
recipes that

1888
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:11,399
recipes that
 

1889
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,649
recipes that
um you know you mentioned a lot of

1890
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:12,659
um you know you mentioned a lot of
 

1891
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,550
um you know you mentioned a lot of
different

1892
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:13,560
different
 

1893
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,230
different
projects that are based on this I mean

1894
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,240
projects that are based on this I mean
 

1895
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,089
projects that are based on this I mean
there's one at Berkeley there's you know

1896
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:17,099
there's one at Berkeley there's you know
 

1897
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,849
there's one at Berkeley there's you know
it's just like all over and um

1898
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:19,859
it's just like all over and um
 

1899
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,829
it's just like all over and um
and

1900
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
and
 

1901
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,089
and
people have tried a lot of different

1902
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:23,099
people have tried a lot of different
 

1903
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,829
people have tried a lot of different
things and we've tried a bunch of stuff

1904
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:24,839
things and we've tried a bunch of stuff
 

1905
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,349
things and we've tried a bunch of stuff
internally so kind of where we're we're

1906
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:27,359
internally so kind of where we're we're
 

1907
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,169
internally so kind of where we're we're
making progress here but also we're able

1908
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:30,179
making progress here but also we're able
 

1909
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,909
making progress here but also we're able
to learn from some of the best ideas in

1910
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:31,919
to learn from some of the best ideas in
 

1911
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:33,710
to learn from some of the best ideas in
the community and you know I think it

1912
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:33,720
the community and you know I think it
 

1913
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,970
the community and you know I think it
you know we want to just continue

1914
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:34,980
you know we want to just continue
 

1915
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,609
you know we want to just continue
continue pushing that forward but I

1916
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:37,619
continue pushing that forward but I
 

1917
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,250
continue pushing that forward but I
don't have any news to announce um if

1918
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:40,260
don't have any news to announce um if
 

1919
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,389
don't have any news to announce um if
that's if that's what you're you're

1920
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:41,399
that's if that's what you're you're
 

1921
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,450
that's if that's what you're you're
asking I mean this is a a thing that

1922
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:44,460
asking I mean this is a a thing that
 

1923
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,369
asking I mean this is a a thing that
we're uh

1924
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:46,379
we're uh
 

1925
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,950
we're uh
we're still we're still kind of you know

1926
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
we're still we're still kind of you know
 

1927
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,409
we're still we're still kind of you know
actively working through the the right

00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:53,639
way to move forward here the details of
 

1931
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,490
way to move forward here the details of
the secret sauce are still being

1932
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:55,500
the secret sauce are still being
 

1933
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,670
the secret sauce are still being
developed I see uh can you comment on

1934
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:58,680
developed I see uh can you comment on
 

1935
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,829
developed I see uh can you comment on
what do you think of uh the thing that

1936
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:00,839
what do you think of uh the thing that
 

1937
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,630
what do you think of uh the thing that
worked for gbt which is the

1938
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
worked for gbt which is the
 

1939
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,770
worked for gbt which is the
reinforcement learning with human

1940
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:03,780
reinforcement learning with human
 

1941
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,650
reinforcement learning with human
feedback so doing this alignment process

1942
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:06,660
feedback so doing this alignment process
 

1943
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,410
feedback so doing this alignment process
do you find it interesting and as part

1944
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:09,420
do you find it interesting and as part
 

1945
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,849
do you find it interesting and as part
of that let me ask because I talked to

1946
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:10,859
of that let me ask because I talked to
 

1947
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,730
of that let me ask because I talked to
Jan lacun before talking to you today he

1948
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:13,740
Jan lacun before talking to you today he
 

1949
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,430
Jan lacun before talking to you today he
asked me to ask or suggested that I ask

1950
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:16,440
asked me to ask or suggested that I ask
 

1951
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,810
asked me to ask or suggested that I ask
do you think

1952
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:17,820
do you think
 

1953
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,270
do you think
llm fine tuning will need to be

1954
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:20,280
llm fine tuning will need to be
 

1955
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,030
llm fine tuning will need to be
crowdsourced Wikipedia Style

1956
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
crowdsourced Wikipedia Style
 

1957
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,210
crowdsourced Wikipedia Style
so crowdsourcing so this kind of idea of

1958
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,220
so crowdsourcing so this kind of idea of
 

1959
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,810
so crowdsourcing so this kind of idea of
how to integrate the human in the fine

1960
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:29,820
how to integrate the human in the fine
 

1961
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,290
how to integrate the human in the fine
tuning of these Foundation models yeah I

1962
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,300
tuning of these Foundation models yeah I
 

1963
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,510
tuning of these Foundation models yeah I
think that's a really interesting idea

1964
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
think that's a really interesting idea
 

1965
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,810
think that's a really interesting idea
that I've talked to Jan about a bunch

1966
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:38,820
that I've talked to Jan about a bunch
 

1967
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,010
that I've talked to Jan about a bunch
um

1968
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:40,020
um
 

1969
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,270
um
and

1970
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,280
and
 

1971
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,010
and
we were talking about

1972
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,020
we were talking about
 

1973
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,710
we were talking about
how do you basically train these models

1974
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:45,720
how do you basically train these models
 

1975
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,069
how do you basically train these models
to be as as safe and aligned and

1976
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:49,079
to be as as safe and aligned and
 

1977
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,930
to be as as safe and aligned and
responsible as possible and you know

1978
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:50,940
responsible as possible and you know
 

1979
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,130
responsible as possible and you know
different groups out there who are doing

1980
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,140
different groups out there who are doing
 

1981
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,069
different groups out there who are doing
development test different data recipes

1982
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:55,079
development test different data recipes
 

1983
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,089
development test different data recipes
in fine tuning but this idea that you

1984
00:35:59,089 --> 00:35:59,099
in fine tuning but this idea that you
 

1985
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,790
in fine tuning but this idea that you
you just mentioned is

1986
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:01,800
you just mentioned is
 

1987
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,950
you just mentioned is
that at the end of the day

1988
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:03,960
that at the end of the day
 

1989
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,630
that at the end of the day
instead of having kind of one group

1990
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:05,640
instead of having kind of one group
 

1991
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,970
instead of having kind of one group
fine-tune some stuff and another group

1992
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:07,980
fine-tune some stuff and another group
 

1993
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,310
fine-tune some stuff and another group
you know produce a different fine-tuning

1994
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
you know produce a different fine-tuning
 

1995
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,750
you know produce a different fine-tuning
recipe and then

1996
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,760
recipe and then
 

1997
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,370
recipe and then
I was trying to figure out which one we

1998
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:13,380
I was trying to figure out which one we
 

1999
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,230
I was trying to figure out which one we
think works best to produce the most

2000
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,240
think works best to produce the most
 

2001
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,970
think works best to produce the most
aligned model

2002
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:16,980
aligned model
 

2003
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,050
aligned model
um

2004
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,060
um
 

2005
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,849
um
I I do think that

2006
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:19,859
I I do think that
 

2007
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:22,609
I I do think that
it would be nice if you could get to a

2008
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:22,619
it would be nice if you could get to a
 

2009
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,250
it would be nice if you could get to a
point where you had a Wikipedia style

2010
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:25,260
point where you had a Wikipedia style
 

2011
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,310
point where you had a Wikipedia style
collaborative

2012
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,320

 

2013
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,450

way for a kind of a broader Community to

2014
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:32,460
way for a kind of a broader Community to
 

2015
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,670
way for a kind of a broader Community to
um to fine tune it as well now there's a

2016
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:34,680
um to fine tune it as well now there's a
 

2017
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,310
um to fine tune it as well now there's a
lot of challenges in that both from an

2018
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:37,320
lot of challenges in that both from an
 

2019
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,310
lot of challenges in that both from an
infrastructure and like uh Community

2020
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
infrastructure and like uh Community
 

2021
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,109
infrastructure and like uh Community
Management and product perspective about

2022
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:42,119
Management and product perspective about
 

2023
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,270
Management and product perspective about
how you do that so I I haven't worked

2024
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:44,280
how you do that so I I haven't worked
 

2025
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,890
how you do that so I I haven't worked
that out yet

2026
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:45,900
that out yet
 

2027
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,990
that out yet
um but as an idea I think it's it's

2028
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,000
um but as an idea I think it's it's
 

2029
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,030
um but as an idea I think it's it's
quite compelling and I think it it goes

2030
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,040
quite compelling and I think it it goes
 

2031
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,069
quite compelling and I think it it goes
well with the ethos of open sourcing the

2032
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
well with the ethos of open sourcing the
 

2033
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,530
well with the ethos of open sourcing the
technology is also finding a way to have

2034
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:54,540
technology is also finding a way to have
 

2035
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,230
technology is also finding a way to have
a kind of Community Driven

2036
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,240
a kind of Community Driven
 

2037
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,829
a kind of Community Driven
um

2038
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:57,839
um
 

2039
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,130
um
a Community Driven training of it

2040
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:01,140
a Community Driven training of it
 

2041
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,569
a Community Driven training of it
um but I think there are a lot of

2042
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:02,579
um but I think there are a lot of
 

2043
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,430
um but I think there are a lot of
questions on this in general these this

2044
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,440
questions on this in general these this
 

2045
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,770
questions on this in general these this
these questions around what's the the

2046
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:06,780
these questions around what's the the
 

2047
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,349
these questions around what's the the
best way to produce aligned AI models

2048
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:09,359
best way to produce aligned AI models
 

2049
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,589
best way to produce aligned AI models
it's very much a research area and it's

2050
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:12,599
it's very much a research area and it's
 

2051
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,630
it's very much a research area and it's
one that I think we will need to make as

2052
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
one that I think we will need to make as
 

2053
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,670
one that I think we will need to make as
much progress on as the kind of core

2054
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:16,680
much progress on as the kind of core
 

2055
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,430
much progress on as the kind of core
intelligence capability of the of the um

2056
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,440
intelligence capability of the of the um
 

2057
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,310
intelligence capability of the of the um
the models themselves well I just did a

2058
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,320
the models themselves well I just did a
 

2059
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,690
the models themselves well I just did a
conversation with Jimmy Wales the

2060
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:23,700
conversation with Jimmy Wales the
 

2061
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,750
conversation with Jimmy Wales the
founder of Wikipedia and to me Wikipedia

2062
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:26,760
founder of Wikipedia and to me Wikipedia
 

2063
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,670
founder of Wikipedia and to me Wikipedia
is one of the greatest websites ever

2064
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:28,680
is one of the greatest websites ever
 

2065
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,690
is one of the greatest websites ever
created

2066
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:29,700
created
 

2067
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,430
created
and it's a kind of a miracle that it

2068
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
and it's a kind of a miracle that it
 

2069
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,109
and it's a kind of a miracle that it
works and I think it has to do with

2070
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
works and I think it has to do with
 

2071
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,430
works and I think it has to do with

uh they handle very controversial
 

2081
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,210
uh they handle very controversial
topics and they handle it

2082
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:47,220
topics and they handle it
 

2083
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,550
topics and they handle it
with balance and with Grace despite sort

2084
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:49,560
with balance and with Grace despite sort

of the attacks that will often happen a

2086
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,079
of the attacks that will often happen a
 

2087
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,050
of the attacks that will often happen a
lot of the time I mean it's not it's it

2088
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:54,060
lot of the time I mean it's not it's it
 

2089

mean it's a it's amazing what they've

2094
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:00,839
mean it's a it's amazing what they've
 

2095
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,390
mean it's a it's amazing what they've
been able to achieve but it's also not

2096
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
been able to achieve but it's also not
 

2097
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,270
been able to achieve but it's also not
perfect and I think that that's

2098
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,280
perfect and I think that that's
 

2099
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,609
perfect and I think that that's
um there's still a lot of challenges

2100
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:07,619
um there's still a lot of challenges
 

2101
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,650
um there's still a lot of challenges
right it's uh the more controversial the

2102
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:09,660
right it's uh the more controversial the
 

2103
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,770
right it's uh the more controversial the
topic the more the more difficult uh the

2104
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:12,780

models will need to

2114
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:22,619
models will need to
 

2115
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,890
models will need to
be able to generate those same things

2116
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:24,900
be able to generate those same things
 

2117
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,470
be able to generate those same things
truth knowledge and wisdom and how do

2118
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:27,480
truth knowledge and wisdom and how do
 

2119
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,910
truth knowledge and wisdom and how do
you align those models that they

2120
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:28,920
you align those models that they
 

2121
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,270
you align those models that they
generate

2122
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,280

 

2123
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,510

um something that uh is closest to truth

2124
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
um something that uh is closest to truth
 

2125
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,250
um something that uh is closest to truth
there's these concerns about

2126
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:37,260
there's these concerns about
 

2127
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,870
there's these concerns about
misinformation all this kind of stuff

2128
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
misinformation all this kind of stuff
 

2129
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,170
misinformation all this kind of stuff
that nobody can Define

2130
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,180
that nobody can Define
 

2131
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,569
that nobody can Define
and it's a it's something that we

2132
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:44,579
and it's a it's something that we
 

2133
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,250
and it's a it's something that we
together as a human species have to

2134
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:46,260
together as a human species have to
 

2135
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,770
together as a human species have to
Define like what is truth and how to

2136
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:48,780
Define like what is truth and how to
 

2137
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,170
Define like what is truth and how to
help AI systems generate that is one of

2138
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:51,180
help AI systems generate that is one of
 

2139
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,550
help AI systems generate that is one of
the things language models do really

2140
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
the things language models do really
 

2141
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,010
the things language models do really
well is generate convincing sounding

2142
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,020
well is generate convincing sounding
 

2143
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,550
well is generate convincing sounding
things they can be completely wrong

2144
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,560
things they can be completely wrong
 

2145
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,089
things they can be completely wrong
and so how do you align it

2146
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:02,099
and so how do you align it
 

2147
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,390
and so how do you align it
uh to be less wrong

2148
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:05,400
uh to be less wrong
 

2149
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,950
uh to be less wrong
and part of that is the training and

2150
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:06,960
and part of that is the training and
 

2151
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,990
and part of that is the training and
part of that is the alignment and

2152
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,000
part of that is the alignment and
 

2153
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,849
part of that is the alignment and
however you do the alignment stage and

2154
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:10,859
however you do the alignment stage and
 

2155
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:14,450
however you do the alignment stage and
just like you said it's a very new and a

2156
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:14,460
just like you said it's a very new and a
 

2157
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,490
just like you said it's a very new and a
very open research problem

2158
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:16,500
very open research problem
 

2159
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,010
very open research problem
yeah and I think there's also

2160
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:19,020
yeah and I think there's also
 

2161
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,890
yeah and I think there's also
a lot of questions about whether the

2162
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:21,900
a lot of questions about whether the
 

2163
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,069
a lot of questions about whether the
current architecture for llms

2164
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:25,079
current architecture for llms
 

2165
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,970
current architecture for llms
as you continue scaling it what happens

2166
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:28,980
as you continue scaling it what happens
 

2167
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,490
as you continue scaling it what happens
um I mean a lot of the a lot of what's

2168
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:31,500
um I mean a lot of the a lot of what's
 

2169
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,470
um I mean a lot of the a lot of what's
been exciting in the last year

2170
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:33,480
been exciting in the last year
 

2171
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,030
been exciting in the last year
is that there's there's clearly a

2172
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
is that there's there's clearly a
 

2173
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,950
is that there's there's clearly a
qualitative breakthrough where you know

2174
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
qualitative breakthrough where you know
 

2175
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,290
qualitative breakthrough where you know
with with some of the GPT models

2176
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:39,300
with with some of the GPT models
 

2177
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,510
with with some of the GPT models
um that opened I put out and and that

2178
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
um that opened I put out and and that
 

2179
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,910
um that opened I put out and and that
others have been able to do as well I I

2180
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
others have been able to do as well I I
 

2181
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,530
others have been able to do as well I I
think it reached a kind of level of

2182
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:45,540
think it reached a kind of level of
 

2183
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,030
think it reached a kind of level of
quality where people like wow this is

2184
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,040
quality where people like wow this is
 

2185
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,390
quality where people like wow this is
this feels different and

2186
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,400
this feels different and
 

2187
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,109
this feels different and
um

2188
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:51,119
um
 

2189
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,490
um
and like it's going to be able to be the

2190
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:52,500
and like it's going to be able to be the
 

2191
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,130
and like it's going to be able to be the
foundation for building a lot of awesome

2192
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,140
foundation for building a lot of awesome
 

2193
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,290
foundation for building a lot of awesome
products and experiences and value but I

2194
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:57,300
products and experiences and value but I
 

2195
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,670
products and experiences and value but I
think the other realization that people

2196
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:58,680
think the other realization that people
 

2197
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,730
think the other realization that people
have is wow we just made a breakthrough

2198
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:01,740
have is wow we just made a breakthrough
 

2199
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,050
have is wow we just made a breakthrough
um

2200
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,060
um
 

2201
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,329
um
if there are other breakthroughs quickly

2202
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:05,339
if there are other breakthroughs quickly
 

2203
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,069
if there are other breakthroughs quickly
then I think that there's the sense that

2204
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:07,079
then I think that there's the sense that
 

2205
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,430
then I think that there's the sense that
maybe where we're closer to general

2206
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,440
maybe where we're closer to general
 

2207
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,230
maybe where we're closer to general
intelligence but I think that that idea

2208
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,240
intelligence but I think that that idea
 

2209
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,170
intelligence but I think that that idea
is predicated on the idea that I I think

2210
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:15,180
is predicated on the idea that I I think
 

2211
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,130
is predicated on the idea that I I think
people believe that there's still

2212
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:16,140
people believe that there's still
 

2213
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,390
people believe that there's still
generally a bunch of additional

2214
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:17,400
generally a bunch of additional
 

2215
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,670
generally a bunch of additional
breakthroughs to make and that it's um

2216
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
breakthroughs to make and that it's um
 

2217
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,349
breakthroughs to make and that it's um
we just don't know

2218
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:21,359
we just don't know
 

2219
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,030
we just don't know
how long it's going to take to get there

2220
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,040
how long it's going to take to get there
 

2221
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,589
how long it's going to take to get there
and you know one view that some people

2222
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:24,599
and you know one view that some people
 

2223
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,030
and you know one view that some people
have

2224
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,040
have
 

2225
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,410
have
um this doesn't tend to be my view as

2226
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:27,420
um this doesn't tend to be my view as
 

2227
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,589
um this doesn't tend to be my view as
much is that simply

2228
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
much is that simply
 

2229
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,750
much is that simply
scaling the current llms and you know

2230
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:32,760
scaling the current llms and you know
 

2231
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,609
scaling the current llms and you know
getting to higher parameter count models

2232
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:34,619
getting to higher parameter count models
 

2233
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,710
getting to higher parameter count models
by itself we'll we'll get to something

2234
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:36,720
by itself we'll we'll get to something
 

2235
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,530
by itself we'll we'll get to something
that is closer to um to to general

2236
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:39,540
that is closer to um to to general
 

2237
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,569
that is closer to um to to general
intelligence but

2238
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:41,579
intelligence but
 

2239
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,370
intelligence but
um I don't know I tend to think that

2240
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:43,380
um I don't know I tend to think that
 

2241
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,490
um I don't know I tend to think that
there's probably more more um

2242
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:46,500
there's probably more more um
 

2243
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,770
there's probably more more um
if fundamental steps that need to be

2244
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:48,780
if fundamental steps that need to be
 

2245
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,810
if fundamental steps that need to be
taken along the way there but still the

2246
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:50,820
taken along the way there but still the

00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,180
you can start to see civilization
 

2263
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,930
you can start to see civilization

to some degree
 

2283
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,230
to some degree
you know I'm excited to

00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,240
you know I'm excited to
 

2285
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,150
you know I'm excited to
work on a lot of those products over the

2286
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,160
work on a lot of those products over the
 

2287
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,530
work on a lot of those products over the
next few years and I think it would just

2288
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:36,540
next few years and I think it would just
 

2289
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,609
next few years and I think it would just
create

2290
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:37,619
create
 

2291
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,190
create
a tremendous amount of whiplash if the

2292
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:40,200
a tremendous amount of whiplash if the
 

2293
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,410
a tremendous amount of whiplash if the
number of breakthroughs keeps like if if

2294
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:42,420
number of breakthroughs keeps like if if
 

2295
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,089
number of breakthroughs keeps like if if
they keep on being stacked breakthroughs

2296
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:44,099
they keep on being stacked breakthroughs
 

2297
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,890
they keep on being stacked breakthroughs
because I think to some degree industry

2298
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:45,900
because I think to some degree industry
 

2299
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,410
because I think to some degree industry
in the world needs some time to kind of

2300
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:48,420
in the world needs some time to kind of
 

2301
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,450
in the world needs some time to kind of
build these breakthroughs into the

2302
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:50,460
build these breakthroughs into the
 

2303
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,890
build these breakthroughs into the
products and experiences that we all use

2304
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:51,900
products and experiences that we all use
 

2305
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,349
products and experiences that we all use
so we can actually benefit from them

2306
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:54,359
so we can actually benefit from them
 

2307
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:55,190
so we can actually benefit from them
um

um
 

2309
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,890
um
but

but
 

2311
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,890
but
I don't know I think there's just a a

2312
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:00,900
I don't know I think there's just a a
 

2313
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,690
I don't know I think there's just a a
like an awesome amount of stuff to do I

2314
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:02,700
like an awesome amount of stuff to do I
 

2315
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,030
like an awesome amount of stuff to do I
mean I think about like all of the

2316
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,040
mean I think about like all of the
 

2317
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,710
mean I think about like all of the
I don't know small businesses or

2318
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
I don't know small businesses or
 

2319
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,589
I don't know small businesses or
individual entrepreneurs out there who

2320
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:09,599
individual entrepreneurs out there who
 

2321
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,150
individual entrepreneurs out there who
um you know now we're going to be able

2322
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,160
um you know now we're going to be able
 

2323
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,910
um you know now we're going to be able
to you know get help coding the things

2324
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,920
to you know get help coding the things
 

2325
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,410
to you know get help coding the things
that they need to go build things or

2326
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:15,420
that they need to go build things or
 

2327
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,990
that they need to go build things or
designing the things that they need or

2328
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,000
designing the things that they need or
 

2329
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,730
designing the things that they need or
um we'll be able to you know use these

2330
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:19,740
um we'll be able to you know use these
 

2331
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,290
um we'll be able to you know use these
models to be able to do customer support

2332
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:21,300
models to be able to do customer support

2335
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,010
for the people that they're that they're
serving you know over WhatsApp without

2336
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,020
serving you know over WhatsApp without
 

2337
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,589
serving you know over WhatsApp without
having to you know I I think that that's

2338
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:27,599
having to you know I I think that that's
 

2339
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,390
having to you know I I think that that's
that's just gonna be I just think that

2340
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:29,400
that's just gonna be I just think that
 

2341
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,609
that's just gonna be I just think that
this is all going to be yeah super

2342
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:31,619
this is all going to be yeah super
 

2343
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,349
this is all going to be yeah super
exciting it's going to create better

2344
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
exciting it's going to create better
 

2345

that go into that like we're talking
 

2361
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,730
that go into that like we're talking
about anything with llms will have a

2362
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:55,740
about anything with llms will have a
 

2363
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,710
about anything with llms will have a
tremendous amount of impact do you have

00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:57,720
tremendous amount of impact do you have
 

2365
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,750
tremendous amount of impact do you have
ideas and thoughts about

2366
00:42:59,750 --> 00:42:59,760
ideas and thoughts about
 

2367
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,790
ideas and thoughts about
possible products

2368
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:01,800
possible products
 

2369
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,450
possible products
that might start being integrated into

2370
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:05,460
that might start being integrated into
 

2371
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,450
that might start being integrated into
uh into these platforms used by so many

2372
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:08,460
uh into these platforms used by so many
 

2373
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,150
uh into these platforms used by so many
people yeah I think there's three main

2374
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,160
people yeah I think there's three main
 

2375
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,829
people yeah I think there's three main
categories of things that we're working

2376
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:12,839
categories of things that we're working
 

2377
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:14,450
categories of things that we're working
on

2378
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:14,460
on
 

2379
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,170
on
um

2380
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:17,180

 

2381
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,470

the first that I think is probably the

2382
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:21,480
the first that I think is probably the
 

2383
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,089
the first that I think is probably the
most interesting

2384
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:23,099
most interesting
 

2385
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,609
most interesting
is um

2386
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:25,619
is um
 

2387
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,349
is um
you know there's this notion of like

2388
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:27,359
you know there's this notion of like
 

2389
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,170
you know there's this notion of like
you're gonna have an assistant or or an

2390
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:30,180
you're gonna have an assistant or or an
 

2391
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,790
you're gonna have an assistant or or an
agent who you can talk to and I think

2392
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:31,800
agent who you can talk to and I think
 

2393
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,950
agent who you can talk to and I think
probably the biggest thing that's

2394
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:33,960
probably the biggest thing that's
 

2395
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,809
probably the biggest thing that's
different about my view of how this

2396
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:35,819
different about my view of how this
 

2397
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:38,990
different about my view of how this
plays out from what I see with um with

2398
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:39,000
plays out from what I see with um with
 

2399
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,329
plays out from what I see with um with
openai and Google and others is you know

2400
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:41,339
openai and Google and others is you know
 

2401
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:43,010
openai and Google and others is you know
everyone else is building like

2402
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,020
everyone else is building like
 

2403
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,890
everyone else is building like
the One Singular AI right it's like okay

2404
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:45,900
the One Singular AI right it's like okay
 

2405
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,829
the One Singular AI right it's like okay

2411
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,470

that they're going to be a lot of

2412
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:57,480
that they're going to be a lot of
 

2413
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,150
that they're going to be a lot of
different AIS that people are going to

2414
00:43:59,150 --> 00:43:59,160
different AIS that people are going to
 

2415

to use
 

2419
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:03,109
to use
um you know a number of different apps

2420
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:03,119
um you know a number of different apps
 

2421
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,150
um you know a number of different apps
for different things and you have

2422
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:05,160
for different things and you have
 

2423
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,589
for different things and you have
relationships with different people in

2424
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:06,599
relationships with different people in
 

2425
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,450
relationships with different people in
your life who feel different emotional

2426
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:08,460
your life who feel different emotional
 

2427
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,089
your life who feel different emotional
roles for you

2428
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:11,099
roles for you
 

2429
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,510
roles for you
um and I am

2430
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:14,520
um and I am
 

2431
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,490
um and I am
so I think that they're going to be

2432
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:16,500
so I think that they're going to be
 

2433
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,290
so I think that they're going to be
people have a reason that they that I

2434
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:18,300
people have a reason that they that I
 

2435
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,250
people have a reason that they that I
think you don't just want like a

2436
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:19,260
think you don't just want like a
 

2437
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,190
think you don't just want like a
singular Ai and that that I think is

2438
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:22,200
singular Ai and that that I think is
 

2439
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,870
singular Ai and that that I think is
probably the biggest distinction in in

2440
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:23,880
probably the biggest distinction in in
 

2441
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,150
probably the biggest distinction in in
terms of how I think about this and a

2442
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,160
terms of how I think about this and a
 

2443
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,530
terms of how I think about this and a
bunch of these things I think you'll

2444
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:27,540
bunch of these things I think you'll
 

2445
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,390
bunch of these things I think you'll
you'll want an assistant

2446
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:29,400
you'll want an assistant
 

2447
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,710
you'll want an assistant
um I mean I mentioned a couple of these

2448
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
um I mean I mentioned a couple of these
 

2449
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,390
um I mean I mentioned a couple of these
before I think like every Creator who

2450
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
before I think like every Creator who
 

2451
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,490
before I think like every Creator who
you interact with will ultimately want

2452
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:34,500
you interact with will ultimately want
 

2453
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,210
you interact with will ultimately want
some kind of AI that can proxy them and

2454
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:38,220
some kind of AI that can proxy them and
 

2455
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,829
some kind of AI that can proxy them and
be something that their fans can

2456
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
be something that their fans can
 

2457

be something that their fans can
interact with or that allows them to

2458

promise everyone's trying to build a

2464
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:47,880
promise everyone's trying to build a
 

2465
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,730
promise everyone's trying to build a
community and engage with people and

2466
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:49,740
community and engage with people and
 

2467
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,109
community and engage with people and
they want tools to be able to amplify

2468
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:51,119
they want tools to be able to amplify
 

2469
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,750
they want tools to be able to amplify
themselves more and be able to do that

2470
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760
themselves more and be able to do that
 

2471
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,790
themselves more and be able to do that
um but

2472
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:55,800
um but
 

2473
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,270
um but
but you only have 24 hours in a day so

2474
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
but you only have 24 hours in a day so
 

2475
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,370
but you only have 24 hours in a day so
um so I think having the ability to

2476
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:01,380
um so I think having the ability to
 

2477
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,230
um so I think having the ability to
basically like bottle up your

2478
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,240

a concert or something like that I mean
that's that I think is going to be

2488
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:12,480
that's that I think is going to be
 

2489
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,849
that's that I think is going to be
something that's super valuable but it's

2490
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:13,859
something that's super valuable but it's
 

2491
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:15,710
something that's super valuable but it's
not just that you know again it's not

2492
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:15,720
not just that you know again it's not
 

2493
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,150
not just that you know again it's not
this idea that I think people are going

2494
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:17,160
this idea that I think people are going
 

2495
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,069
this idea that I think people are going
to want Just One Singular AI I think

2496
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:19,079
to want Just One Singular AI I think
 

2497
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:20,569
to want Just One Singular AI I think
you're gonna You Know You're Gonna Want

2498
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:20,579
you're gonna You Know You're Gonna Want
 

2499

to interact with a lot of different
 

2501
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,450
to interact with a lot of different
entities and then I think there's the

2502
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:23,460
entities and then I think there's the
 

2503
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,710
entities and then I think there's the
business version of this too which we've

2504
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
business version of this too which we've
 

2505
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,290
business version of this too which we've
touched on a couple of times which is

2506
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:27,300
touched on a couple of times which is
 

2507
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,089
touched on a couple of times which is
um

2508
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:28,099
um
 

2509
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:30,349
um
I think every business in the world is

2510
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:30,359
I think every business in the world is
 

2511
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:31,550
I think every business in the world is
going to want

00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:31,560
going to want
 

2513
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,970
going to want
basically an AI that that you know it's

2514
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:34,980
basically an AI that that you know it's
 

2515
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,250

providing support for for your product
so I think that there's going to be a

2548
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:07,079
so I think that there's going to be a
 

2549
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:08,870
so I think that there's going to be a
clear need

2550
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:08,880
clear need
 

2551
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,809
clear need
um in the market and in people's lives

2552
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:11,819
um in the market and in people's lives
 

2553
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,750
um in the market and in people's lives
for there to be a bunch of these part of

2554
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:14,760
for there to be a bunch of these part of
 

2555
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,690
for there to be a bunch of these part of
that is figuring out the research the

2556
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:17,700
that is figuring out the research the
 

2557
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,550
that is figuring out the research the
technology that enables the

2558
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:19,560
technology that enables the
 

2559
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,870
technology that enables the
personalization that you're talking

2560
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
personalization that you're talking
 

2561

personalization that you're talking
about so not one centralized god-like

00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:47,460
fans and I think that's
 

2583
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,450
fans and I think that's
um so yeah I think that there there's a

2584
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:50,460
um so yeah I think that there there's a
 

2585
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,890
um so yeah I think that there there's a
clear kind of interesting product

2586
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:51,900
clear kind of interesting product
 

2587
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,829
clear kind of interesting product
Direction here that I think is fairly

2588
00:46:54,829 --> 00:46:54,839
Direction here that I think is fairly
 

2589
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,410
Direction here that I think is fairly
unique from from what in any of the

2590
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:57,420
unique from from what in any of the
 

2591
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,510
unique from from what in any of the
other big companies there are taking

2592
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,520
other big companies there are taking
 

2593
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,250
other big companies there are taking
um it also aligns well with this sort of

2594
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:01,260
um it also aligns well with this sort of
 

2595
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,930
um it also aligns well with this sort of
Open Source approach because again we we

2596
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:02,940
Open Source approach because again we we
 

2597
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,290
Open Source approach because again we we
sort of believe in this more

2598
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:05,300
sort of believe in this more
 

2599
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,910
sort of believe in this more
community-oriented uh more democratic

2600
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:07,920
community-oriented uh more democratic
 

2601
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,190
community-oriented uh more democratic
approach to building out the products

2602
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:10,200
approach to building out the products
 

2603
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,390
approach to building out the products
and Technology around this we don't

2604
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:11,400
and Technology around this we don't
 

2605
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,410
and Technology around this we don't
think that there's going to be the one

2606
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:12,420
think that there's going to be the one
 

2607
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,730
think that there's going to be the one
true thing we think that there there

2608
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:13,740
true thing we think that there there
 

2609
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,950
true thing we think that there there
should be kind of a lot of development

2610
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:15,960
should be kind of a lot of development
 

2611
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,150
should be kind of a lot of development
so

2612
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:17,160
so
 

2613
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,650
so
that part of things I think is going to

2614
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:18,660
that part of things I think is going to
 

2615
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,790
that part of things I think is going to
be really interesting and we could we

2616
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:19,800
be really interesting and we could we
 

2617
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,530
be really interesting and we could we
could go probably spent a lot of time

2618
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:21,540
could go probably spent a lot of time
 

2619
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,329
could go probably spent a lot of time
talking about that and the the kind of

2620
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:23,339
talking about that and the the kind of
 

2621
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:26,510
talking about that and the the kind of
implications of um of that approach

2622
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:26,520
implications of um of that approach
 

2623
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,710
implications of um of that approach
being different from what others are

2624
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:27,720
being different from what others are
 

2625
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,150
being different from what others are
taking

2626
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:29,160
taking
 

2627
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,770
taking
um but there's a bunch of other simpler

2628
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:30,780
um but there's a bunch of other simpler
 

2629
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,030
um but there's a bunch of other simpler
things that I think we're also going to

2630
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:32,040
things that I think we're also going to
 

2631
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,290
things that I think we're also going to
do just going back to your question

2632
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:33,300
do just going back to your question
 

2633
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,490
do just going back to your question
around

2634
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:34,500
around
 

2635
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,530
around
how this finds its way into like what do

2636
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:36,540
how this finds its way into like what do
 

2637
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,730
how this finds its way into like what do
we build

2638
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:37,740
we build
 

2639
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,470
we build
um they're going to be a lot of simpler

2640
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:39,480
um they're going to be a lot of simpler
 

2641
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,569
um they're going to be a lot of simpler
things around

2642
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:41,579
things around
 

2643
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:42,829
things around
um

2644
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:42,839
um
 

2645
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:45,530

2653
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,870
photos to look as good as possible so
like having an AI that you can just like

2654
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:53,880
like having an AI that you can just like
 

2655
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,150

2659
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,970
okay I want to edit this thing or
describe this it's like I think we're

2660
00:47:58,970 --> 00:47:58,980
describe this it's like I think we're
 

2661
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,010
describe this it's like I think we're
gonna have tools that are just way

2662
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:01,020
gonna have tools that are just way
 

2663
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,870
gonna have tools that are just way
better than than what we've historically

2664
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
better than than what we've historically
 

2665
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,730
better than than what we've historically
had on this

2666
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:04,740
had on this
 

2667
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,109
had on this
um and that's more in the image and

2668
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:06,119
um and that's more in the image and
 

2669
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,670
um and that's more in the image and
media generation side than the large

2670
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
media generation side than the large
 

2671
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,010
media generation side than the large
language model side but but it's it all

2672
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:10,020
language model side but but it's it all
 

2673
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,930
language model side but but it's it all
kind of you know plays off of advances

2674
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:11,940
kind of you know plays off of advances
 

2675
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,270
kind of you know plays off of advances
in the same space

2676
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:14,280
in the same space
 

2677
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,829
in the same space
um is there a lot of tools that I think

2678
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:15,839
um is there a lot of tools that I think
 

2679
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:16,910
um is there a lot of tools that I think
are just going to get built into every

2680
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:16,920
are just going to get built into every
 

2681

well that's a super powerful idea
 

2713
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,150
well that's a super powerful idea
of generating the language almost like a

2714
00:48:59,150 --> 00:48:59,160
of generating the language almost like a
 

2715
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,990

yeah totally and do that if as
 

2731
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:21,710
yeah totally and do that if as
efficiently as possible when it's done

2732
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:21,720
efficiently as possible when it's done
 

2733
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,050
efficiently as possible when it's done
well people actually like it you know

2734
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:24,060
well people actually like it you know
 

2735
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,370
well people actually like it you know
it's um yeah I think there's a lot of

2736
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:25,380
it's um yeah I think there's a lot of
 

2737
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,809
it's um yeah I think there's a lot of
examples where it's not done well and

2738
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:26,819
examples where it's not done well and
 

2739
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,970
examples where it's not done well and
it's annoying and I think that's what

2740
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:28,980
it's annoying and I think that's what
 

2741
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,250
it's annoying and I think that's what
kind of gives it a bad rap but

2742
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:31,260
kind of gives it a bad rap but
 

2743
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,809
kind of gives it a bad rap but
um but yeah and a lot of the stuff is

2744
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:32,819
um but yeah and a lot of the stuff is
 

2745
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,309
um but yeah and a lot of the stuff is
possible today I mean obviously a b

2746
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:34,319
possible today I mean obviously a b
 

2747
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,349
possible today I mean obviously a b
testing stuff is built into a lot of

2748
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:36,359
testing stuff is built into a lot of
 

2749
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:38,450
testing stuff is built into a lot of
these Frameworks the thing that's new is

2750
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:38,460
these Frameworks the thing that's new is
 

2751
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,309
these Frameworks the thing that's new is
having technology that can generate the

2752
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:40,319
having technology that can generate the
 

2753
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,230
having technology that can generate the
ideas for about what to a B test

2754
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
ideas for about what to a B test
 

2755
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,910
ideas for about what to a B test
something that that's exciting so this

2756
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:43,920
something that that's exciting so this
 

2757
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,410
something that that's exciting so this
will just be across like

2758
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:45,420
will just be across like
 

2759
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,089
will just be across like
everything that we're doing right all

2760
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:47,099
everything that we're doing right all
 

2761
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:48,109
everything that we're doing right all
the metaverse stuff that we're doing

2762
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:48,119
the metaverse stuff that we're doing
 

2763
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,550
the metaverse stuff that we're doing
right it's like you want to create

2764
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:49,560
right it's like you want to create
 

2765
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,990
right it's like you want to create
worlds in the future you'll just

2766
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:51,000
worlds in the future you'll just
 

2767
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,910
worlds in the future you'll just
describe them and then it'll create the

2768
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:52,920
describe them and then it'll create the
 

2769
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,089
describe them and then it'll create the
code for you so the natural language

2770
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:55,099
code for you so the natural language
 

2771
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:58,670
code for you so the natural language
becomes the the interface we use for

2772
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:58,680
becomes the the interface we use for
 

2773
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,650
becomes the the interface we use for
all the ways we interact with the

2774
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:00,660
all the ways we interact with the
 

2775
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,990
all the ways we interact with the
computer with

2776
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,000
computer with
 

2777
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,910
computer with
with the digital or them yeah yeah

2778
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:04,920
with the digital or them yeah yeah
 

2779
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,490
with the digital or them yeah yeah
totally yeah which is what everyone can

2780
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:07,500
totally yeah which is what everyone can
 

2781
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,290
totally yeah which is what everyone can
do using natural language and with

2782
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:09,300
do using natural language and with
 

2783
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,910
do using natural language and with
translation you can do it any kind of

2784
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:10,920
translation you can do it any kind of
 

2785
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,010
translation you can do it any kind of
language

2786
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,020
language
 

2787
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,230
language
um I I mean for the personalization is

2788
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:15,240
um I I mean for the personalization is
 

2789
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,450
um I I mean for the personalization is
really really really interesting

2790
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:17,460
really really really interesting
 

2791
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,329
really really really interesting
yeah it unlocks so many possible things

2792
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:20,339
yeah it unlocks so many possible things
 

2793
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,370
yeah it unlocks so many possible things
I mean I for one look forward to

2794
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:22,380
I mean I for one look forward to
 

2795

I mean I for one look forward to
creating a copy of myself

2796
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:24,420
creating a copy of myself
 

2797
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,790
creating a copy of myself
I know we talked about this last time

2798
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:25,800
I know we talked about this last time
 

2799

but this has since the last time this
 

2801
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:31,430
but this has since the last time this
becomes now we're closer

2802
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:31,440
becomes now we're closer
 

2803
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,829
becomes now we're closer
much closer like I could literally just

2804
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:33,839
much closer like I could literally just
 

2805
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,150
much closer like I could literally just
haven't interacted with some of these

2806
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:35,160
haven't interacted with some of these
 

2807
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,309
haven't interacted with some of these
language models I could see the Absurd

2808
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:37,319
language models I could see the Absurd
 

2809
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:42,250
language models I could see the Absurd
situation where I'll have a uh large uh

2810
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:42,260
situation where I'll have a uh large uh
 

2811
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,530
situation where I'll have a uh large uh
or a Lex language model and I'll have to

2812
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:45,540
or a Lex language model and I'll have to
 

2813
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,589
or a Lex language model and I'll have to
have a conversation with him about like

2814
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:48,599
have a conversation with him about like
 

2815
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,910

mean that's that's going to be the
that seems like an amazing product

2828
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:04,200
that seems like an amazing product
 

2829
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,030
that seems like an amazing product
for businesses for humans just not not

2830
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:08,040
for businesses for humans just not not
 

2831
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,430
for businesses for humans just not not
just the assistant that's facing the

2832
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:10,440
just the assistant that's facing the
 

2833
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,309
just the assistant that's facing the
individual but the assistant that

than what's possible today
 

2907
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,750
than what's possible today
and I think there's like tens of

2908

relationships with it and I think that

2916
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:55,260
relationships with it and I think that
 

2917
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,569
relationships with it and I think that
there's

2918
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:56,579
there's
 

2919
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,069
there's
um you know there's services today like

2920
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:58,079

otherwise have a hard time doing that so
 

3189
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,650
otherwise have a hard time doing that so
part of it might be okay because you

3190
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:15,660
part of it might be okay because you
 

3191
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,390
part of it might be okay because you
speak a language that I don't know

3192

at that and say it's sad that do we have
 

3199
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,829
at that and say it's sad that do we have
the capacity to do that because I should

3200
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:24,839
the capacity to do that because I should

3205
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:29,809

um
 

3207
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:33,349
um
but overall I'd say um

3208
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:33,359
but overall I'd say um
 

3209
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,630
but overall I'd say um
they're all these impediments

3210
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:35,640
they're all these impediments
 

3211

00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,970
seeing your baby cry right but like it's
like what why is that right it's like

3314
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:25,980
like what why is that right it's like
 

3315
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,490
like what why is that right it's like
well because babies don't generally have

3316
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:28,500
well because babies don't generally have
 

3317
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,670
well because babies don't generally have
much capacity to tell you what they

3318
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
much capacity to tell you what they
 

3319
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,530
much capacity to tell you what they
care about otherwise right it's not

3320
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:33,540
care about otherwise right it's not
 

3321
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,589
care about otherwise right it's not
actually just babies right it's um you

3322
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:36,599
actually just babies right it's um you
 

3323
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:38,329
actually just babies right it's um you
know my five-year-old daughter cries too

3324
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:38,339
know my five-year-old daughter cries too
 

3325
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:39,950
know my five-year-old daughter cries too
because she sometimes has a hard time

3326
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:39,960
because she sometimes has a hard time
 

3327
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,770
because she sometimes has a hard time
expressing you know what what um matters

3328
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:42,780
expressing you know what what um matters
 

3329
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,650
expressing you know what what um matters
to to her and and I was thinking about

3330
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:45,660
to to her and and I was thinking about
 

3331
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,609
to to her and and I was thinking about
that and it's like well you know

3332
00:59:46,609 --> 00:59:46,619
that and it's like well you know
 

3333
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:47,690
that and it's like well you know
actually a lot of adults get very

3334
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:47,700
actually a lot of adults get very
 

3335
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,430
actually a lot of adults get very
frustrated too because they can't they

3336
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:49,440
frustrated too because they can't they
 

3337
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,589
frustrated too because they can't they
have a hard time expressing things in a

3338
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:51,599
have a hard time expressing things in a
 

3339
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,630
have a hard time expressing things in a
way that going back to some of the early

3340
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:53,640
way that going back to some of the early
 

3341
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,490
way that going back to some of the early
themes that

3342
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:55,500
themes that
 

3343
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,730
themes that
maybe is something that you know is a

3344
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:58,740
maybe is something that you know is a
 

3345
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,289
maybe is something that you know is a
mistake or maybe they have pride or

3346
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:00,299
mistake or maybe they have pride or
 

3347
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:01,309
mistake or maybe they have pride or
something like all these things get in

3348
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:01,319
something like all these things get in
 

3349
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:03,470
something like all these things get in
the way so I don't know I think that all

3350
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:03,480
the way so I don't know I think that all
 

3351
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,630
the way so I don't know I think that all
these different technologies that can

3352
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:05,640
these different technologies that can
 

3353
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,329
these different technologies that can
help us navigate the social complexity

3354
01:00:08,329 --> 01:00:08,339
help us navigate the social complexity
 

3355
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,430
help us navigate the social complexity
and actually be able to better express

3356
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:10,440
and actually be able to better express
 

3357
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,370
and actually be able to better express
our what we're feeling and thinking I

3358
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:13,380
our what we're feeling and thinking I
 

3359
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,549
our what we're feeling and thinking I
think that's generally all good and um

3360
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:16,559
think that's generally all good and um
 

3361
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,109
think that's generally all good and um
there are always these concerns like

3362
01:00:18,109 --> 01:00:18,119
there are always these concerns like
 

3363
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:19,490
there are always these concerns like
okay are people gonna have worse

3364
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:19,500
okay are people gonna have worse
 

3365
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,049
okay are people gonna have worse
memories because you have Google to look

3366
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:21,059
memories because you have Google to look
 

3367
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:23,329
memories because you have Google to look
things up and and I think in general a

3368
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:23,339
things up and and I think in general a
 

3369
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:25,730
things up and and I think in general a
generation later you don't look back and

3370
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:25,740
generation later you don't look back and
 

3371
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,890
generation later you don't look back and
lament that I think it's you're just

3372
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:27,900
lament that I think it's you're just
 

3373
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,450
lament that I think it's you're just
like wow we have so much more capacity

3374
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:29,460
like wow we have so much more capacity
 

3375
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,370
like wow we have so much more capacity
to to do so much more now and I think

3376
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:31,380
to to do so much more now and I think
 

3377
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,410
to to do so much more now and I think
that that'll be the case here too you

3378
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:33,420
that that'll be the case here too you
 

3379
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,549
that that'll be the case here too you
can allocate those cognitive

3380
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:34,559
can allocate those cognitive
 

3381
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,329
can allocate those cognitive
capabilities to like deeper like nuanced

3382
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:38,339
capabilities to like deeper like nuanced
 

3383
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:40,130
capabilities to like deeper like nuanced
thought yeah

3384
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:40,140
thought yeah
 

3385
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,690
thought yeah
uh yeah but it's change so with with uh

3386
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:44,700
uh yeah but it's change so with with uh
 

3387
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,289
uh yeah but it's change so with with uh
just like with Google search

3388
01:00:47,289 --> 01:00:47,299
just like with Google search
 

3389
01:00:47,299 --> 01:00:50,390
just like with Google search
the the additional language models large

3390
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:50,400
the the additional language models large
 

3391
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,770
the the additional language models large
language models

3392
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:51,780
language models
 

3393
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,109
language models
you basically don't have to remember

3394
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:53,119
you basically don't have to remember
 

3395
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,670
you basically don't have to remember
nearly as much

3396
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:55,680
nearly as much
 

3397
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,349
nearly as much
just like with stack Overflow for

3398
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
just like with stack Overflow for
 

3399
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,210
just like with stack Overflow for
programming now that these language

3400
01:00:59,210 --> 01:00:59,220
programming now that these language
 

3401
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,430
programming now that these language
models can generate code right there I

3402
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
models can generate code right there I
 

3403
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,109
models can generate code right there I
mean I find that I write like maybe

3404
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:03,119
mean I find that I write like maybe
 

3405
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,329
mean I find that I write like maybe
eighty percent ninety percent of the

3406
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:05,339
eighty percent ninety percent of the
 

3407
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:07,789
eighty percent ninety percent of the
code I write is as uh not generated

3408
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:07,799
code I write is as uh not generated
 

3409
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:10,910
code I write is as uh not generated
first and then edited I mean so you

3410
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:10,920
first and then edited I mean so you
 

3411
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,289
first and then edited I mean so you
don't have to remember how to write

3412
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:12,299
don't have to remember how to write
 

3413
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:13,789
don't have to remember how to write
specifics of different functions oh

3414
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:13,799
specifics of different functions oh
 

3415
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,010
specifics of different functions oh
that's great and it's also it's not just

3416
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:16,020
that's great and it's also it's not just
 

3417
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,010
that's great and it's also it's not just
the the specific

3418
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:19,020
the the specific
 

3419
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,170
the the specific
coding I mean in the in the context of

3420
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:21,180
coding I mean in the in the context of
 

3421
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:21,950
coding I mean in the in the context of
uh

3422
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:21,960
uh
 

3423
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,690
uh
of a large company like this I think

3424
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:23,700
of a large company like this I think
 

3425
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,970
of a large company like this I think
before an engineer can sit down to code

3426
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:25,980
before an engineer can sit down to code
 

3427
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,890
before an engineer can sit down to code
they first need to

3428
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:27,900
they first need to
 

3429
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,630
they first need to
figure out all of the library's

3430
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:29,640
figure out all of the library's
 

3431
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,089
figure out all of the library's
independencies that you know tens of

3432
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:32,099
independencies that you know tens of
 

3433
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:33,829
independencies that you know tens of
thousands of people have written before

3434
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
thousands of people have written before
 

3435
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,410
thousands of people have written before
them and

3436
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:36,420
them and
 

3437
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,329
them and
um you know one of the things that I'm

3438
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:38,339
um you know one of the things that I'm
 

3439
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:40,609
um you know one of the things that I'm
excited about they're working on is it's

3440
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:40,619
excited about they're working on is it's
 

3441
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:43,069
excited about they're working on is it's
not just um you know tools that help

3442
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:43,079
not just um you know tools that help
 

3443
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:44,690
not just um you know tools that help
Engineers code it's tools that can help

3444
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:44,700
Engineers code it's tools that can help
 

3445
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,549
Engineers code it's tools that can help
summarize the whole knowledge base and

3446
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:46,559
summarize the whole knowledge base and
 

3447
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,710
summarize the whole knowledge base and
and help people be able to navigate all

3448
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:48,720
and help people be able to navigate all
 

3449
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,210
and help people be able to navigate all
the internal information and I think

3450
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:50,220
the internal information and I think
 

3451
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,410
the internal information and I think
that's

3452
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:51,420
that's
 

3453
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,809
that's
um in the experiments that I've done

3454
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:53,819
um in the experiments that I've done
 

3455
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:55,549
um in the experiments that I've done
with this stuff I mean that's

3456
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:55,559
with this stuff I mean that's
 

3457
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:57,950
with this stuff I mean that's
on the public stuff you just you know

3458
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:57,960
on the public stuff you just you know
 

3459
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,970
on the public stuff you just you know
ask ask

3460
01:01:58,970 --> 01:01:58,980
ask ask
 

3461
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,630
ask ask
um

3462
01:01:59,630 --> 01:01:59,640
um
 

3463
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,490
um
one of these models to

3464
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:01,500
one of these models to
 

3465
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,410
one of these models to
build you a script that does anything

3466
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:03,420
build you a script that does anything
 

3467
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,150
build you a script that does anything
and it basically already understands

3468
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:05,160
and it basically already understands
 

3469
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,950
and it basically already understands
what the best libraries are to do that

3470
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:06,960
what the best libraries are to do that
 

3471
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,270
what the best libraries are to do that
thing and pulls them in automatically

3472
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:08,280
thing and pulls them in automatically
 

3473
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,470
thing and pulls them in automatically
it's I mean I think that's super

3474
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:09,480
it's I mean I think that's super
 

3475
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,750
it's I mean I think that's super
powerful that was always I the most

3476
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:11,760
powerful that was always I the most
 

3477
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,089
powerful that was always I the most
annoying part of coding was that you had

3478
01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:14,099
annoying part of coding was that you had
 

3479
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:15,289
annoying part of coding was that you had
to spend all this time actually figuring

3480
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:15,299
to spend all this time actually figuring
 

3481
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:16,789
to spend all this time actually figuring
out what the resources were that you

3482
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799
out what the resources were that you
 

3483
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,109
out what the resources were that you
were supposed to import before you could

3484
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:18,119
were supposed to import before you could
 

3485
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:20,329
were supposed to import before you could
actually start building the thing yeah I

3486
01:02:20,329 --> 01:02:20,339
actually start building the thing yeah I
 

3487
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:22,190
actually start building the thing yeah I
mean there's of course

3488
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:22,200
mean there's of course
 

3489
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,049
mean there's of course
the flip side of that I think for the

3490
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:24,059
the flip side of that I think for the
 

3491
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,490
the flip side of that I think for the
most part is positive but the flip side

3492
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:25,500
most part is positive but the flip side
 

3493
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:30,530
most part is positive but the flip side
is if you Outsource that thinking to an

3494
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:30,540
is if you Outsource that thinking to an
 

3495
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:35,089
is if you Outsource that thinking to an
AI model you might miss nuanced mistakes

3496
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:35,099
AI model you might miss nuanced mistakes
 

3497
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:38,210
AI model you might miss nuanced mistakes
and bugs they're good you lose the skill

3498
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:38,220
and bugs they're good you lose the skill
 

3499
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,010
and bugs they're good you lose the skill
to find those bugs

3500
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:40,020
to find those bugs
 

3501
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,890
to find those bugs
and those bugs might be uh the code

3502
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:42,900
and those bugs might be uh the code
 

3503
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,230
and those bugs might be uh the code
looks very convincingly right

3504
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:45,240
looks very convincingly right
 

3505
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,390
looks very convincingly right
but it's actually wrong in a very subtle

3506
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:47,400
but it's actually wrong in a very subtle
 

3507
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,589
but it's actually wrong in a very subtle
way

3508
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:48,599
way
 

3509
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:52,490
way
but that's that's the trade-off that we

3510
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:52,500
but that's that's the trade-off that we
 

3511
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,690
but that's that's the trade-off that we
uh

3512
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:53,700
uh
 

3513
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,730
uh
that we face as human civilization when

3514
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:55,740
that we face as human civilization when
 

3515
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,710
that we face as human civilization when
we build more and more powerful tools

3516
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:57,720
we build more and more powerful tools
 

3517
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,710
we build more and more powerful tools
when we stand on the shoulders of taller

3518
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
when we stand on the shoulders of taller
 

3519
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,349
when we stand on the shoulders of taller
and taller Giants we could do more but

3520
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:03,359
and taller Giants we could do more but
 

3521
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,849
and taller Giants we could do more but
then we forget how to do all the stuff

3522
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:04,859
then we forget how to do all the stuff
 

3523
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:06,170
then we forget how to do all the stuff
that they did

3524
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:06,180
that they did
 

3525
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,010
that they did
foreign

3526
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:07,020
foreign
 

3527
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:10,490
foreign
it's a weird trade-off yeah I agree I

3528
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:10,500
it's a weird trade-off yeah I agree I
 

3529
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,230
it's a weird trade-off yeah I agree I
mean I think it's I think it is very

3530
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:12,240
mean I think it's I think it is very
 

3531
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,789
mean I think it's I think it is very
valuable in your life to be able to do

3532
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:13,799
valuable in your life to be able to do
 

3533
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:15,470
valuable in your life to be able to do
basic things too

3534
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:15,480
basic things too
 

3535
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,549
basic things too
do you worry about some of the

3536
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:18,559
do you worry about some of the
 

3537
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,770
do you worry about some of the
concerns of bots being present on social

3538
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:21,780
concerns of bots being present on social
 

3539
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,430
concerns of bots being present on social
networks more and more human-like Bots

3540
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:24,440
networks more and more human-like Bots
 

3541
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,390
networks more and more human-like Bots
that are

3542
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
that are
 

3543
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,970
that are
not necessarily trying to do a good

3544
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:28,980
not necessarily trying to do a good
 

3545
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,430
not necessarily trying to do a good
thing or they might be explicitly trying

3546
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
thing or they might be explicitly trying
 

3547
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,410
thing or they might be explicitly trying
to do a bad thing like phishing scams

3548
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:33,420
to do a bad thing like phishing scams
 

3549
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,630
to do a bad thing like phishing scams
yeah like social engineering all that

3550
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:35,640
yeah like social engineering all that
 

3551
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,730
yeah like social engineering all that
kind of stuff which has always been a

3552
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:37,740
kind of stuff which has always been a
 

3553
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,410
kind of stuff which has always been a
very difficult problem for social

3554
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:39,420
very difficult problem for social
 

3555
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,390
very difficult problem for social
networks but now it's becoming almost a

3556
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:41,400
networks but now it's becoming almost a
 

3557
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,490
networks but now it's becoming almost a
more and more difficult problem well I

3558
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:43,500
more and more difficult problem well I
 

3559
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,109
more and more difficult problem well I
think there's a few different parts of

3560
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
think there's a few different parts of
 

3561
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,910
think there's a few different parts of
of this so one is

3562
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920

 

3563
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,710

there are all these harms that we need

3564
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:51,720
there are all these harms that we need
 

3565
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,329
there are all these harms that we need
to basically fight against and prevent

3566
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:53,339
to basically fight against and prevent
 

3567
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:56,450
to basically fight against and prevent
and and that's been you know a lot of

3568
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:56,460
and and that's been you know a lot of
 

3569
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,609
and and that's been you know a lot of
our Focus over the last

3570
01:03:58,609 --> 01:03:58,619
our Focus over the last
 

3571
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:00,109
our Focus over the last
you know five or seven years is

3572
01:04:00,109 --> 01:04:00,119
you know five or seven years is
 

3573
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:02,510
you know five or seven years is
basically ramping up very sophisticated

3574
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:02,520
basically ramping up very sophisticated
 

3575
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,210
basically ramping up very sophisticated
AI systems not generative AI systems

3576
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:05,220
AI systems not generative AI systems
 

3577
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,609
AI systems not generative AI systems
more kind of classical AI systems to be

3578
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:07,619
more kind of classical AI systems to be
 

3579
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:08,930
more kind of classical AI systems to be
able to

3580
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:08,940
able to
 

3581
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,470
able to
um you know categorize and classify and

3582
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
um you know categorize and classify and
 

3583
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,910
um you know categorize and classify and
identify

3584
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:13,920

3585
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,730

okay this this post looks like it's um

3586
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:16,740
okay this this post looks like it's um
 

3587
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,430
okay this this post looks like it's um
promoting terrorism this one is you know

3588
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
promoting terrorism this one is you know
 

3589
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,150
promoting terrorism this one is you know
like exploiting children this one is

3590
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:23,160
like exploiting children this one is
 

3591
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,349
like exploiting children this one is
um looks like it might be trying to

3592
01:04:24,349 --> 01:04:24,359
um looks like it might be trying to
 

3593
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:25,849
um looks like it might be trying to
incite violence this one's an

3594
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:25,859
incite violence this one's an
 

3595
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:28,190
incite violence this one's an
intellectual uh property violation so

3596
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:28,200
intellectual uh property violation so
 

3597
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,650
intellectual uh property violation so
there's there's like that's like 18

3598
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:30,660
there's there's like that's like 18
 

3599
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,829
there's there's like that's like 18
different categories of of violating

3600
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
different categories of of violating
 

3601
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,870
different categories of of violating
kind of harmful content that we've had

3602
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:35,880
kind of harmful content that we've had
 

3603
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,270
kind of harmful content that we've had
to build specific systems to be able to

3604
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:38,280
to build specific systems to be able to
 

3605
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,010
to build specific systems to be able to
track and

3606
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:40,020
track and
 

3607
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:40,789
track and
um

3608
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
um
 

3609
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,150
um
I think it's certainly the case that

3610
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:43,160
I think it's certainly the case that
 

3611
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,890
I think it's certainly the case that
advances in generative AI

3612
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:45,900
advances in generative AI
 

3613
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,289
advances in generative AI
will test those

3614
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:48,299
will test those
 

3615
01:04:48,299 --> 01:04:49,390
will test those
um

3616
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:49,400
um
 

3617
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,130
um
but at least so far it's been the case

3618
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:52,140
but at least so far it's been the case
 

3619
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,809
but at least so far it's been the case
and and I'm optimistic that it will

3620
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:53,819
and and I'm optimistic that it will
 

3621
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:56,270
and and I'm optimistic that it will
continue to be the case that we will be

3622
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:56,280
continue to be the case that we will be
 

3623
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,130
continue to be the case that we will be
able to bring more computing power to

3624
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:58,140
able to bring more computing power to
 

3625
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,710
able to bring more computing power to
Bear to have even stronger AIS that can

3626
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:00,720
Bear to have even stronger AIS that can
 

3627
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,289
Bear to have even stronger AIS that can
help defend against those things so

3628
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:03,299
help defend against those things so
 

3629
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,670
help defend against those things so
um we've had to deal with some

3630
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:04,680
um we've had to deal with some
 

3631
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,190
um we've had to deal with some
adversarial issues before right it's I

3632
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,200
adversarial issues before right it's I
 

3633
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,349
adversarial issues before right it's I
mean for for some things like hate

3634
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:09,359
mean for for some things like hate
 

3635
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:10,849
mean for for some things like hate
speech it's like people aren't generally

3636
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:10,859
speech it's like people aren't generally
 

3637
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:13,130
speech it's like people aren't generally
getting a lot more sophisticated like

3638
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:13,140
getting a lot more sophisticated like
 

3639
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,530
getting a lot more sophisticated like
the average person who let's say you

3640
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:15,540
the average person who let's say you
 

3641
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,750
the average person who let's say you
know if someone's saying some kind of

3642
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:17,760
know if someone's saying some kind of
 

3643
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,430
know if someone's saying some kind of
racist thing right it's like they're not

3644
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
racist thing right it's like they're not
 

3645
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,630
racist thing right it's like they're not
necessarily getting more sophisticated

3646
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
necessarily getting more sophisticated
 

3647
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,430
necessarily getting more sophisticated
at being racist right it just it's okay

3648
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:22,440
at being racist right it just it's okay
 

3649
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,010
at being racist right it just it's okay
so that the system can just find but

3650
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:25,020
so that the system can just find but
 

3651
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,710
so that the system can just find but
then there's other adversaries who

3652
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:27,720
then there's other adversaries who
 

3653
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,450
then there's other adversaries who
actually are very sophisticated like

3654
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:29,460
actually are very sophisticated like
 

3655
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,730
actually are very sophisticated like
nation states doing things and you know

3656
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:31,740
nation states doing things and you know
 

3657
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:32,630
nation states doing things and you know
we find

3658
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
we find
 

3659
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,270
we find
you know whether it's Russia or you know

3660
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:35,280
you know whether it's Russia or you know
 

3661
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,470
you know whether it's Russia or you know
just different countries that are

3662
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
just different countries that are
 

3663
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,049
just different countries that are
basically standing up these networks of

3664
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:39,059
basically standing up these networks of
 

3665
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:41,450
basically standing up these networks of
um of bots or or

3666
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:41,460
um of bots or or
 

3667
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,609
um of bots or or
um inauthentic accounts is what is what

3668
01:05:43,609 --> 01:05:43,619
um inauthentic accounts is what is what
 

3669
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:44,630
um inauthentic accounts is what is what
we call them because they're not

3670
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
we call them because they're not
 

3671
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,130
we call them because they're not
necessarily Bots that some of them could

3672
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:46,140
necessarily Bots that some of them could
 

3673
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,870
necessarily Bots that some of them could
actually be real people who are kind of

3674
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:47,880
actually be real people who are kind of
 

3675
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,670
actually be real people who are kind of
masquerading as other as other people

3676
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:49,680
masquerading as other as other people
 

3677
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,910
masquerading as other as other people
but they're acting in a coordinated way

3678
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:52,920
but they're acting in a coordinated way
 

3679
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,490
but they're acting in a coordinated way
and some of that behavior has gotten

3680
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:55,500
and some of that behavior has gotten
 

3681
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,829
and some of that behavior has gotten
very sophisticated and it's very

3682
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
very sophisticated and it's very
 

3683
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,329
very sophisticated and it's very
adversarial so they you know each

3684
01:05:59,329 --> 01:05:59,339
adversarial so they you know each
 

3685
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:01,370
adversarial so they you know each
iteration every time we find something

3686
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:01,380
iteration every time we find something
 

3687
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,930
iteration every time we find something
and stop them

3688
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:02,940
and stop them
 

3689
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,250
and stop them
um they kind of evolve their behavior

3690
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:04,260
um they kind of evolve their behavior
 

3691
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,630
um they kind of evolve their behavior
they don't just pack up their bags and

3692
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:05,640
they don't just pack up their bags and
 

3693
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,030
they don't just pack up their bags and
go home and say Okay We're not gonna try

3694
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:08,040
go home and say Okay We're not gonna try
 

3695
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,349
go home and say Okay We're not gonna try
you know at some point they might decide

3696
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:09,359
you know at some point they might decide
 

3697
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,870
you know at some point they might decide
doing it on meta Services is not worth

3698
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:11,880
doing it on meta Services is not worth
 

3699
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,250
doing it on meta Services is not worth
it they'll go do it on someone else if

3700
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:13,260
it they'll go do it on someone else if
 

3701
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,510
it they'll go do it on someone else if
it's easier to do it in another place

3702
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:14,520
it's easier to do it in another place
 

3703
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,390
it's easier to do it in another place
but um but

3704
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:17,400
but um but
 

3705
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,069
but um but
we have a fair amount of experience

3706
01:06:19,069 --> 01:06:19,079
we have a fair amount of experience
 

3707
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,750
we have a fair amount of experience
dealing with

3708
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:20,760
dealing with
 

3709
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,789
dealing with
even those kind of adversarial attacks

3710
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:22,799
even those kind of adversarial attacks
 

3711
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:23,930
even those kind of adversarial attacks
where they just keep on getting better

3712
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:23,940
where they just keep on getting better
 

3713
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,970
where they just keep on getting better
and better and I do think that as long

3714
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:25,980
and better and I do think that as long
 

3715
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,950
and better and I do think that as long
as we can keep on putting more compute

3716
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:27,960
as we can keep on putting more compute
 

3717
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,529
as we can keep on putting more compute
power against it and and if we're kind

3718
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:30,539
power against it and and if we're kind
 

3719
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:32,210
power against it and and if we're kind
of one of the leaders in developing some

3720
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:32,220
of one of the leaders in developing some
 

3721
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,130
of one of the leaders in developing some
of these AI models I'm quite optimistic

3722
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:34,140
of these AI models I'm quite optimistic
 

3723
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,890
of these AI models I'm quite optimistic
that we're going to be able to keep on

3724
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:36,900
that we're going to be able to keep on
 

3725
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,770
that we're going to be able to keep on
um pushing against the kind of normal

3726
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:39,780
um pushing against the kind of normal
 

3727
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,390
um pushing against the kind of normal
categories of harm that you talk about

3728
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:41,400
categories of harm that you talk about
 

3729
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:45,349
categories of harm that you talk about
fraud scams spam

3730
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:45,359
fraud scams spam
 

3731
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:48,049
fraud scams spam
um IP violations things like that what

3732
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:48,059
um IP violations things like that what
 

3733
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:50,089
um IP violations things like that what
about like creating narratives and

3734
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:50,099
about like creating narratives and
 

3735
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:53,510
about like creating narratives and
controversy to me it's kind of amazing

3736
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:53,520
controversy to me it's kind of amazing
 

3737
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,510
controversy to me it's kind of amazing
how a small collection of yeah uh what

3738
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:56,520
how a small collection of yeah uh what
 

3739
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,430
how a small collection of yeah uh what
did you say inauthentic accounts so it

3740
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:58,440
did you say inauthentic accounts so it
 

3741
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,410
did you say inauthentic accounts so it
could be Bots but yeah I mean we have

3742
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:00,420
could be Bots but yeah I mean we have
 

3743
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,730
could be Bots but yeah I mean we have
sort of this funny name for it but we

3744
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:01,740
sort of this funny name for it but we
 

3745
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,289
sort of this funny name for it but we
call it coordinated and authentic

3746
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:03,299
call it coordinated and authentic
 

3747
01:07:03,299 --> 01:07:05,390
call it coordinated and authentic
Behavior yeah it's it's kind of

3748
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:05,400
Behavior yeah it's it's kind of
 

3749
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,370
Behavior yeah it's it's kind of
incredible how a small collection of

3750
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:07,380
incredible how a small collection of
 

3751
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:10,549
incredible how a small collection of
folks can create narratives create

3752
01:07:10,549 --> 01:07:10,559
folks can create narratives create
 

3753
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,870
folks can create narratives create
stories

3754
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:11,880
stories
 

3755
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,990
stories
yeah especially if they're viral so if

3756
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:15,000
yeah especially if they're viral so if
 

3757
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,029
yeah especially if they're viral so if
especially if they have a element they

3758
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,039
especially if they have a element they
 

3759
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:17,770
especially if they have a element they
can

3760
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:17,780
can
 

3761
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,510
can
catalyze the virality of the narrative

3762
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:20,520
catalyze the virality of the narrative
 

3763
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,549
catalyze the virality of the narrative
yeah and I think there the question is

3764
01:07:22,549 --> 01:07:22,559
yeah and I think there the question is
 

3765
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,289
yeah and I think there the question is
you have to be

3766
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:24,299
you have to be
 

3767
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:26,270
you have to be
I'm very specific about what is bad

3768
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:26,280
I'm very specific about what is bad
 

3769
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,250
I'm very specific about what is bad
about it right because I think a set of

3770
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:28,260
about it right because I think a set of
 

3771
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,390
about it right because I think a set of
people

3772
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:29,400
people
 

3773
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,130
people
coming together

3774
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:31,140
coming together
 

3775
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,670
coming together
or organically bouncing ideas off each

3776
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:34,680
or organically bouncing ideas off each
 

3777
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,430
or organically bouncing ideas off each
other and a narrative comes out of that

3778
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:37,440
other and a narrative comes out of that
 

3779
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,589
other and a narrative comes out of that
is not necessarily A Bad Thing by itself

3780
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:39,599
is not necessarily A Bad Thing by itself
 

3781
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,630
is not necessarily A Bad Thing by itself
if it's if it's kind of authentic and

3782
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:41,640
if it's if it's kind of authentic and
 

3783
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,370
if it's if it's kind of authentic and
organic that's like a lot of what

3784
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:43,380
organic that's like a lot of what
 

3785
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,809
organic that's like a lot of what
happens and how culture gets created and

3786
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:44,819
happens and how culture gets created and
 

3787
01:07:44,819 --> 01:07:46,190
happens and how culture gets created and
how art gets created and a lot of good

3788
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:46,200
how art gets created and a lot of good
 

3789
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,750
how art gets created and a lot of good
stuff so that's why we've kind of

3790
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:47,760
stuff so that's why we've kind of
 

3791
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,329
stuff so that's why we've kind of
focused on this sense of coordinated and

3792
01:07:50,329 --> 01:07:50,339
focused on this sense of coordinated and
 

3793
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:52,370
focused on this sense of coordinated and
authentic Behavior so it's like if you

3794
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:52,380
authentic Behavior so it's like if you
 

3795
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,049
authentic Behavior so it's like if you
have a network of you know whether it's

3796
01:07:54,049 --> 01:07:54,059
have a network of you know whether it's
 

3797
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:56,329
have a network of you know whether it's
Bots some some people masquerading as

3798
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:56,339
Bots some some people masquerading as
 

3799
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,069
Bots some some people masquerading as
different accounts

3800
01:07:58,069 --> 01:07:58,079
different accounts
 

3801
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,670
different accounts
um

3802
01:07:58,670 --> 01:07:58,680
um
 

3803
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,010
um
but you have kind of someone pulling the

3804
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:01,020
but you have kind of someone pulling the
 

3805
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,930
but you have kind of someone pulling the
strings behind it

3806
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:02,940
strings behind it
 

3807
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:07,069
strings behind it
um and trying to kind of act as if this

3808
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:07,079
um and trying to kind of act as if this
 

3809
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:08,870
um and trying to kind of act as if this
is a more organic set of behavior but

3810
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:08,880
is a more organic set of behavior but
 

3811
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,130
is a more organic set of behavior but
really it's not it's just like one

3812
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:10,140
really it's not it's just like one
 

3813
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,630
really it's not it's just like one
coordinated thing

3814
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:11,640
coordinated thing
 

3815
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,609
coordinated thing
that seems problematic to me right I

3816
01:08:13,609 --> 01:08:13,619
that seems problematic to me right I
 

3817
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:14,990
that seems problematic to me right I
mean I don't think people should be able

3818
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:15,000
mean I don't think people should be able
 

3819
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,570
mean I don't think people should be able
to have coordinated networks and not

3820
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:17,580
to have coordinated networks and not
 

3821
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:20,030
to have coordinated networks and not
disclose it as such

3822
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:20,040
disclose it as such
 

3823
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,590
disclose it as such
um but that again you know we've been

3824
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
um but that again you know we've been
 

3825
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,289
um but that again you know we've been
able to deploy pretty sophisticated Ai

3826
01:08:24,289 --> 01:08:24,299
able to deploy pretty sophisticated Ai
 

3827
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:26,930
able to deploy pretty sophisticated Ai
and you know counter-terrorism

3828
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:26,940
and you know counter-terrorism
 

3829
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,430
and you know counter-terrorism
groups and things like that to be able

3830
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:28,440
groups and things like that to be able
 

3831
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,269
groups and things like that to be able
to identify a fair number of these

3832
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:31,279
to identify a fair number of these
 

3833
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,189
to identify a fair number of these
coordinated and authentic networks of

3834
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:34,199
coordinated and authentic networks of
 

3835
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:36,829
coordinated and authentic networks of
accounts and and take them down

3836
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:36,839
accounts and and take them down
 

3837
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:38,870
accounts and and take them down
um we continue to do that I think we're

3838
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:38,880
um we continue to do that I think we're
 

3839
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,910
um we continue to do that I think we're
we've you know so it's one thing that if

3840
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:40,920
we've you know so it's one thing that if
 

3841
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,470
we've you know so it's one thing that if
you told me 20 years ago it's like all

3842
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
you told me 20 years ago it's like all
 

3843
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,329
you told me 20 years ago it's like all
right you're starting this website to

3844
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:44,339
right you're starting this website to
 

3845
01:08:44,339 --> 01:08:46,550
right you're starting this website to
help people connect at a college and you

3846
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:46,560
help people connect at a college and you
 

3847
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,630
help people connect at a college and you
know in the future you're going to be

3848
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:47,640
know in the future you're going to be
 

3849
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,189
know in the future you're going to be
you know part of your organization is

3850
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:49,199
you know part of your organization is
 

3851
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:50,269
you know part of your organization is
going to be a counter-terrorism

3852
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:50,279
going to be a counter-terrorism
 

3853
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:52,789
going to be a counter-terrorism
organization with AI to find coordinated

3854
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799
organization with AI to find coordinated
 

3855
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,410
organization with AI to find coordinated
and authentic I would have thought that

3856
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:54,420
and authentic I would have thought that
 

3857
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,189
and authentic I would have thought that
was

3858
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:55,199
was
 

3859
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:59,329
was
pretty wild but um but but it's um but

3860
01:08:59,329 --> 01:08:59,339
pretty wild but um but but it's um but
 

3861
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:00,590
pretty wild but um but but it's um but
no I think that's that's part of where

3862
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:00,600
no I think that's that's part of where
 

3863
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,450
no I think that's that's part of where
we are but look I think that these

3864
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:02,460
we are but look I think that these
 

3865
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:04,789
we are but look I think that these
questions that you're pushing on now

3866
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
questions that you're pushing on now
 

3867
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,709
questions that you're pushing on now
um

3868
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
um
 

3869
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,630
um
this is actually where I guess most of

3870
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,640
this is actually where I guess most of
 

3871
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,789
this is actually where I guess most of
the challenge around AI will be

3872
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:10,799
the challenge around AI will be
 

3873
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:13,130
the challenge around AI will be
for the foreseeable future I think

3874
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:13,140
for the foreseeable future I think
 

3875
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:15,229
for the foreseeable future I think
there's a lot of debate around things

3876
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:15,239
there's a lot of debate around things
 

3877
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:17,630
there's a lot of debate around things
like is this going to create existential

3878
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:17,640
like is this going to create existential
 

3879
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,269
like is this going to create existential
risk to humanity and I think that those

3880
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:20,279
risk to humanity and I think that those
 

3881
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:22,070
risk to humanity and I think that those
are very hard things to disprove one way

3882
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:22,080
are very hard things to disprove one way
 

3883
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,010
are very hard things to disprove one way
or another my own intuition is that the

3884
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:25,020
or another my own intuition is that the
 

3885
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,930
or another my own intuition is that the
point at which we become close to super

3886
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:26,940
point at which we become close to super
 

3887
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,349
point at which we become close to super
intelligent is super intelligence is

3888
01:09:30,349 --> 01:09:30,359
intelligent is super intelligence is
 

3889
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:33,289
intelligent is super intelligence is
um I I it's it's just really unclear to

3890
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:33,299
um I I it's it's just really unclear to
 

3891
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,789
um I I it's it's just really unclear to
me that the current technology is gonna

3892
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799
me that the current technology is gonna
 

3893
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,370
me that the current technology is gonna
gonna get there without another set of

3894
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:37,380
gonna get there without another set of
 

3895
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,229
gonna get there without another set of
of significant advances

3896
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:39,239
of significant advances
 

3897
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:40,490
of significant advances
but that doesn't mean that there's no

3898
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:40,500
but that doesn't mean that there's no
 

3899
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,349
but that doesn't mean that there's no
danger I think the danger is basically

3900
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:42,359
danger I think the danger is basically
 

3901
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:44,990
danger I think the danger is basically
amplifying the kind of known set of of

3902
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:45,000
amplifying the kind of known set of of
 

3903
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,110
amplifying the kind of known set of of
harms that people or or sets of accounts

3904
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:48,120
harms that people or or sets of accounts
 

3905
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,610
harms that people or or sets of accounts
can do and we just need to make sure

3906
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:49,620
can do and we just need to make sure
 

3907
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,769
can do and we just need to make sure
that we really focus on

3908
01:09:51,769 --> 01:09:51,779
that we really focus on
 

3909
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:52,430
that we really focus on
um

3910
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:52,440
um
 

3911
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,410
um
on on on basically doing that as well as

3912
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:54,420
on on on basically doing that as well as
 

3913
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,209
on on on basically doing that as well as
possible so that that's a that's

3914
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:56,219
possible so that that's a that's
 

3915
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:58,189
possible so that that's a that's
definitely a big Focus for me well you

3916
01:09:58,189 --> 01:09:58,199
definitely a big Focus for me well you
 

3917
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:00,229
definitely a big Focus for me well you
can basically use large language models

3918
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:00,239
can basically use large language models
 

3919
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,729
can basically use large language models
as an assistant

3920
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:01,739
as an assistant
 

3921
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:04,070
as an assistant
of how to cause harm on social networks

3922
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,080
of how to cause harm on social networks
 

3923
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,410
of how to cause harm on social networks
so you can ask it a question

3924
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:06,420
so you can ask it a question
 

3925
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,490
so you can ask it a question
um

3926
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:07,500
um
 

3927
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,729
um
you know meta has very impressive

3928
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:10,739
you know meta has very impressive
 

3929
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,550
you know meta has very impressive
coordinated inauthentic account

3930
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:13,560
coordinated inauthentic account
 

3931
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,410
coordinated inauthentic account
uh fighting capabilities how do I do the

3932
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:18,420
uh fighting capabilities how do I do the
 

3933
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,330
uh fighting capabilities how do I do the
coordinating authentic account

3934
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:20,340
coordinating authentic account
 

3935
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:23,390
coordinating authentic account
uh creation where meta doesn't detect it

3936
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:23,400
uh creation where meta doesn't detect it
 

3937
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,669
uh creation where meta doesn't detect it
like literally ask that question and

3938
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:25,679
like literally ask that question and
 

3939
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,729
like literally ask that question and
they and basically there's this kind of

3940
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:27,739
they and basically there's this kind of
 

3941
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:30,709
they and basically there's this kind of
part of it I mean that's what open AI

3942
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:30,719
part of it I mean that's what open AI
 

3943
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:32,030
part of it I mean that's what open AI
showed that they're concerned with those

3944
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:32,040
showed that they're concerned with those
 

3945
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,189
showed that they're concerned with those
questions uh perhaps you can comment on

3946
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:34,199
questions uh perhaps you can comment on
 

3947
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:36,709
questions uh perhaps you can comment on
your approach to it how to do

3948
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:36,719
your approach to it how to do
 

3949
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,229
your approach to it how to do
kind of moderation on the output of

3950
01:10:39,229 --> 01:10:39,239
kind of moderation on the output of
 

3951
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,510
kind of moderation on the output of
those models that it can't be used to

3952
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:41,520
those models that it can't be used to
 

3953
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,669
those models that it can't be used to
help you coordinate harm

3954
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:43,679
help you coordinate harm
 

3955
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,890
help you coordinate harm
in all the full definition of what the

3956
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:45,900
in all the full definition of what the
 

3957
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,930
in all the full definition of what the
harm means yeah and that's a lot of the

3958
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:47,940
harm means yeah and that's a lot of the
 

3959
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,729
harm means yeah and that's a lot of the
fine-tuning and the the alignment

3960
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:49,739
fine-tuning and the the alignment
 

3961
01:10:49,739 --> 01:10:51,110
fine-tuning and the the alignment
training that we do

3962
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,120
training that we do
 

3963
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,169
training that we do
is basically you know when we when we

3964
01:10:54,169 --> 01:10:54,179
is basically you know when we when we
 

3965
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:56,290
is basically you know when we when we
ship

3966
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:56,300
ship
 

3967
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,390
ship
ai's across the our products a lot of

3968
01:10:59,390 --> 01:10:59,400
ai's across the our products a lot of
 

3969
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,830
ai's across the our products a lot of
what we're trying to

3970
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:00,840
what we're trying to
 

3971
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,669
what we're trying to
make sure is that if you can't ask it to

3972
01:11:04,669 --> 01:11:04,679
make sure is that if you can't ask it to
 

3973
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:08,450
make sure is that if you can't ask it to
help you commit a crime right it's um

3974
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:08,460
help you commit a crime right it's um
 

3975
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,030
help you commit a crime right it's um
uh

3976
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:11,040
uh
 

3977
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,310
uh
so I think training it to kind of

3978
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:13,320
so I think training it to kind of
 

3979
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,450
so I think training it to kind of
understand that

3980
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:14,460
understand that
 

3981
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,850
understand that
and it's not that not like any of these

3982
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:16,860
and it's not that not like any of these
 

3983
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,530
and it's not that not like any of these
systems are ever going to be 100 perfect

3984
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:18,540
systems are ever going to be 100 perfect
 

3985
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,689
systems are ever going to be 100 perfect
but

3986
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:20,699
but
 

3987
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:23,390
but
you know just making it so that

3988
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:23,400
you know just making it so that
 

3989
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,950
you know just making it so that
this isn't a an easier way to go about

3990
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:27,960
this isn't a an easier way to go about
 

3991
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,870
this isn't a an easier way to go about
doing something bad

3992
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:29,880
doing something bad
 

3993
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,090
doing something bad
then the next best alternative right I

3994
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:32,100
then the next best alternative right I
 

3995
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,770
then the next best alternative right I
mean people still have Google right you

3996
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:33,780
mean people still have Google right you
 

3997
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,930
mean people still have Google right you
know you still have search engines so

3998
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:35,940
know you still have search engines so
 

3999
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,750
know you still have search engines so
um the information is is out there

4000
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:38,760
um the information is is out there
 

4001
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,130
um the information is is out there
um and

4002
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:40,140
um and
 

4003
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,050
um and
now for for these

4004
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:42,060
now for for these
 

4005
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,790
now for for these
you know what we see is like for nation

4006
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:43,800
you know what we see is like for nation
 

4007
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,010
you know what we see is like for nation
states or you know these actors that are

4008
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:46,020
states or you know these actors that are
 

4009
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,229
states or you know these actors that are
trying to pull off these large

4010
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
trying to pull off these large
 

4011
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,850
trying to pull off these large
you know coordinated and authentic

4012
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:49,860
you know coordinated and authentic
 

4013
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,950
you know coordinated and authentic
networks to to kind of influence

4014
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:51,960
networks to to kind of influence
 

4015
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,110
networks to to kind of influence
different things at some point when we

4016
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:54,120
different things at some point when we
 

4017
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,850
different things at some point when we
just make it very difficult they do just

4018
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:55,860
just make it very difficult they do just
 

4019
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,110
just make it very difficult they do just
you know try to use other services

4020
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:57,120
you know try to use other services
 

4021
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,450
you know try to use other services
instead right it's it's just like if you

4022
01:11:59,450 --> 01:11:59,460
instead right it's it's just like if you
 

4023
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,030
instead right it's it's just like if you
can make it more expensive for

4024
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:02,040
can make it more expensive for
 

4025
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,290
can make it more expensive for
um for them to do it on your service

4026
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:03,300
um for them to do it on your service
 

4027
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,870
um for them to do it on your service
then then kind of people go go elsewhere

4028
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:05,880
then then kind of people go go elsewhere
 

4029
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,090
then then kind of people go go elsewhere
and I think that that's that's the bar

4030
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:08,100
and I think that that's that's the bar
 

4031
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,189
and I think that that's that's the bar
right it's like it's not like okay are

4032
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:10,199
right it's like it's not like okay are
 

4033
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:11,990
right it's like it's not like okay are
you ever going to be perfect at finding

4034
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
you ever going to be perfect at finding
 

4035
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,030
you ever going to be perfect at finding
you know every adversary who tries to

4036
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:14,040
you know every adversary who tries to
 

4037
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,950
you know every adversary who tries to
attack you it's I mean you try to get as

4038
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:15,960
attack you it's I mean you try to get as
 

4039
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,870
attack you it's I mean you try to get as
close to that as possible but

4040
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:17,880
close to that as possible but
 

4041
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,610
close to that as possible but
um but I think really kind of

4042
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:19,620
um but I think really kind of
 

4043
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,930
um but I think really kind of
economically we're just trying to do is

4044
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:20,940
economically we're just trying to do is
 

4045
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,310
economically we're just trying to do is
make it that it's it it's just

4046
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
make it that it's it it's just
 

4047
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,290
make it that it's it it's just
inefficient for them to to go after that

4048
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:24,300
inefficient for them to to go after that
 

4049
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,970
inefficient for them to to go after that
uh but there's also complicated

4050
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:25,980
uh but there's also complicated
 

4051
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,250
uh but there's also complicated
questions of uh what is and isn't harm

4052
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:28,260
questions of uh what is and isn't harm
 

4053
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,470
questions of uh what is and isn't harm
what isn't isn't misinformation

4054
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
what isn't isn't misinformation
 

4055
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,330
what isn't isn't misinformation
so this is one of the things that

4056
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:32,340
so this is one of the things that
 

4057
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:35,090
so this is one of the things that
Wikipedia has also tried to face I

4058
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:35,100
Wikipedia has also tried to face I
 

4059
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,709
Wikipedia has also tried to face I
remember asking

4060
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
remember asking
 

4061
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,070
remember asking
um GPT about whether the virus leaked

4062
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,080
um GPT about whether the virus leaked
 

4063
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,510
um GPT about whether the virus leaked
from a lab or not and the answer

4064
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
from a lab or not and the answer
 

4065
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,930
from a lab or not and the answer
provided was a very nuanced one

4066
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:44,940
provided was a very nuanced one
 

4067
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,709
provided was a very nuanced one
and uh a well-cited one almost dare I

4068
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:48,719
and uh a well-cited one almost dare I
 

4069
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,450
and uh a well-cited one almost dare I
say well thought out one

4070
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:50,460
say well thought out one
 

4071
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:54,050
say well thought out one
uh balanced I would hate for that Nuance

4072
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:54,060
uh balanced I would hate for that Nuance
 

4073
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,970
uh balanced I would hate for that Nuance

so how do you get that right I I really

4100
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:27,540
so how do you get that right I I really
 

4101
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,390
so how do you get that right I I really
agree with what you're pushing on I mean

01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,550
agree with what you're pushing on I mean
the the core

4104
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:31,560
the the core
 

4105
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,830
the the core
I think the core shape of the problem

4106
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:33,840
I think the core shape of the problem
 

4107
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,649
I think the core shape of the problem
is that there are some harms that I

4108
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:36,659
is that there are some harms that I
 

4109
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:39,709
is that there are some harms that I
think everyone agrees are bad right so

4110
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:39,719
think everyone agrees are bad right so
 

4111
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:40,689
think everyone agrees are bad right so
yeah

4112
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:40,699
yeah
 

4113
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:43,610
yeah
sexual exploitation of children right

4114
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:43,620
sexual exploitation of children right
 

4115
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,950
sexual exploitation of children right
like you're not going to get many people

4116
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:45,960
like you're not going to get many people
 

4117
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,750
like you're not going to get many people
who who think that that type of thing

4118
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:47,760
who who think that that type of thing
 

4119
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,550
who who think that that type of thing
should be allowed on any service right

4120
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:49,560
should be allowed on any service right
 

4121
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,290
should be allowed on any service right
and that's something that we that we

4122
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:51,300
and that's something that we that we
 

4123
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,930
and that's something that we that we
face and try to push off the you know as

4124
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:53,940
face and try to push off the you know as
 

4125
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,090
face and try to push off the you know as
as much as possible today

4126
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:56,100
as much as possible today
 

4127
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,830
as much as possible today
um you know terrorism

4128
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
um you know terrorism
 

4129
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,169
um you know terrorism
um and citing violence right it's like

4130
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:00,179
um and citing violence right it's like
 

4131
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:01,370
um and citing violence right it's like
we went through a bunch of these these

4132
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:01,380
we went through a bunch of these these
 

4133
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,470
we went through a bunch of these these
types of harms before

4134
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:03,480
types of harms before
 

4135
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,970
types of harms before
um

4136
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:04,980
um
 

4137
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,590
um
but then I do think that you get to a

4138
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:06,600
but then I do think that you get to a
 

4139
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,990
but then I do think that you get to a
set of harms where there is more social

4140
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,000
set of harms where there is more social
 

4141
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,790
set of harms where there is more social
debate around it

4142
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:10,800
debate around it
 

4143
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,810
debate around it
um so misinformation I think is

4144
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:14,820
um so misinformation I think is
 

4145
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,250
um so misinformation I think is
um

4146
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:16,260
um
 

4147
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,590
um
has been a really tricky one because

4148
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:18,600
has been a really tricky one because
 

4149
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,570
has been a really tricky one because
there are things that are

4150
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:20,580
there are things that are
 

4151
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,209
there are things that are
kind of obviously false

4152
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:23,219
kind of obviously false
 

4153
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:26,090
kind of obviously false
right that are maybe factual

4154
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:26,100
right that are maybe factual
 

4155
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,410
right that are maybe factual
um

4156
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:27,420
um
 

4157
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,410
um
but may not be harmful

4158
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:30,420
but may not be harmful
 

4159
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,750
but may not be harmful
um since the guard are you gonna censor

4160
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:32,760
um since the guard are you gonna censor
 

4161
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,729
um since the guard are you gonna censor
someone for just being wrong it's you

4162
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:34,739
someone for just being wrong it's you
 

4163
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:35,930
someone for just being wrong it's you
know if there's no kind of harm

4164
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:35,940
know if there's no kind of harm
 

4165
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,189
know if there's no kind of harm
implication of what they're doing I

4166
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:37,199
implication of what they're doing I
 

4167
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,450
implication of what they're doing I
think that that's there's there's a

4168
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:38,460
think that that's there's there's a
 

4169
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,709
think that that's there's there's a
bunch of real kind of issues and

4170
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:39,719
bunch of real kind of issues and
 

4171
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:41,030
bunch of real kind of issues and
challenges there

4172
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
challenges there
 

4173
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,189
challenges there
but then I think that there are other

4174
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:43,199
but then I think that there are other
 

4175
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,229
but then I think that there are other
places where it is

4176
01:14:45,229 --> 01:14:45,239
places where it is
 

4177
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:46,490
places where it is
um let me just take some of the stuff

4178
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:46,500
um let me just take some of the stuff
 

4179
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,590
um let me just take some of the stuff
around covet earlier on in the pandemic

4180
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:48,600
around covet earlier on in the pandemic
 

4181
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,850
around covet earlier on in the pandemic
where

4182
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:49,860
where
 

4183
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,250
where
um there were you know real Health

4184
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:52,260
um there were you know real Health
 

4185
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,830
um there were you know real Health
implications but there hadn't been time

4186
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:54,840
implications but there hadn't been time
 

4187
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,450
implications but there hadn't been time
to fully vet a bunch of the scientific

4188
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:56,460
to fully vet a bunch of the scientific
 

4189
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,729
to fully vet a bunch of the scientific
assumptions and you know unfortunately I

4190
01:14:58,729 --> 01:14:58,739
assumptions and you know unfortunately I
 

4191
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:00,530
assumptions and you know unfortunately I
think a lot of the kind of establishment

4192
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:00,540
think a lot of the kind of establishment
 

4193
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,090
think a lot of the kind of establishment
on that

4194
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:02,100
on that
 

4195
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,530
on that
um you know kind of waffled on a bunch

4196
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:03,540
um you know kind of waffled on a bunch
 

4197
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,689
um you know kind of waffled on a bunch
of facts and you know asked for a bunch

4198
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:05,699
of facts and you know asked for a bunch
 

4199
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:07,010
of facts and you know asked for a bunch
of things to be censored that in

4200
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:07,020
of things to be censored that in
 

4201
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,890
of things to be censored that in
retrospect ended up being you know more

4202
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:09,900
retrospect ended up being you know more
 

4203
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,830
retrospect ended up being you know more
debatable or or true and that stuff is

4204
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:12,840
debatable or or true and that stuff is
 

4205
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,390
debatable or or true and that stuff is
really tough right really undermines

4206
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
really tough right really undermines
 

4207
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,910
really tough right really undermines
trust in in that and

4208
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:16,920
trust in in that and
 

4209
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,110
trust in in that and
um

4210
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:18,120
um
 

4211
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,750
um
so I I do think that the questions

4212
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:20,760
so I I do think that the questions
 

4213
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,570
so I I do think that the questions
around how to manage that are are are

4214
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:22,580
around how to manage that are are are
 

4215
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,130
around how to manage that are are are
very nuanced the way that I try to think

4216
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:25,140
very nuanced the way that I try to think
 

4217
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,950
very nuanced the way that I try to think
about it is that um

4218
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:27,960
about it is that um
 

4219
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,229
about it is that um
it goes I think it's best to generally

4220
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:30,239
it goes I think it's best to generally
 

4221
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:33,770
it goes I think it's best to generally
boil things down to the harms that

4222
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:33,780
boil things down to the harms that
 

4223
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,330
boil things down to the harms that
people agree on so when you think about

4224
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:35,340
people agree on so when you think about
 

4225
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,490
people agree on so when you think about
you know is something misinformation or

4226
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:37,500
you know is something misinformation or
 

4227
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,130
you know is something misinformation or
not I think often the more Salient bit

4228
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:40,140
not I think often the more Salient bit
 

4229
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,090
not I think often the more Salient bit
is

4230
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:41,100
is
 

4231
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,970
is
is this going to potentially leave lead

4232
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:43,980
is this going to potentially leave lead
 

4233
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,470
is this going to potentially leave lead
to um

4234
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:45,480
to um
 

4235
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,229
to um
to physical harm for someone

4236
01:15:48,229 --> 01:15:48,239
to physical harm for someone
 

4237
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,149
to physical harm for someone
um and kind of think about it in that

4238
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:50,159
um and kind of think about it in that
 

4239
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,770
um and kind of think about it in that
sense and then beyond that I think

4240
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:51,780
sense and then beyond that I think
 

4241
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,030
sense and then beyond that I think
people just have different preferences

4242
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,040
people just have different preferences
 

4243
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,130
people just have different preferences
on how they want things to be flagged

4244
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:55,140
on how they want things to be flagged
 

4245
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,510
on how they want things to be flagged
for them I think a bunch of people would

4246
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:56,520
for them I think a bunch of people would
 

4247
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,630
for them I think a bunch of people would
be like prefer to kind of have a a flag

4248
01:15:59,630 --> 01:15:59,640
be like prefer to kind of have a a flag
 

4249
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,830
be like prefer to kind of have a a flag
on something that says hey a fact

4250
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:00,840
on something that says hey a fact
 

4251
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,390
on something that says hey a fact
Checker thinks that this might be false

4252
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400
Checker thinks that this might be false
 

4253
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,350
Checker thinks that this might be false
or

4254
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
or
 

4255
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,850
or
um I think Twitter's Community notes

4256
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:04,860
um I think Twitter's Community notes
 

4257
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:08,209
um I think Twitter's Community notes
implementation is quite good on on this

4258
01:16:08,209 --> 01:16:08,219
implementation is quite good on on this
 

4259
01:16:08,219 --> 01:16:09,709
implementation is quite good on on this
um but again it's the same type of thing

4260
01:16:09,709 --> 01:16:09,719
um but again it's the same type of thing
 

4261
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:11,810
um but again it's the same type of thing
it's like just kind of discretionarily

4262
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:11,820
it's like just kind of discretionarily
 

4263
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,729
it's like just kind of discretionarily
adding a flag because it makes the user

4264
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:13,739
adding a flag because it makes the user
 

4265
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:15,590
adding a flag because it makes the user
experience better but it's not it's not

4266
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:15,600
experience better but it's not it's not
 

4267
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,790
experience better but it's not it's not
you know trying to take down the

4268
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:16,800
you know trying to take down the
 

4269
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,350
you know trying to take down the
information or not that you want to

4270
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:18,360
information or not that you want to
 

4271
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,290
information or not that you want to
reserve the kind of censorship of

4272
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:21,300
reserve the kind of censorship of
 

4273
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,870
reserve the kind of censorship of
content to things that are of known

4274
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:23,880
content to things that are of known
 

4275
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,149
content to things that are of known
categories that that people generally

4276
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:26,159
categories that that people generally
 

4277
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,530
categories that that people generally
agree or bad

4278
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:27,540
agree or bad
 

4279
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,930
agree or bad
yeah but there's so many

4280
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:29,940
yeah but there's so many
 

4281
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,910
yeah but there's so many
things especially with the pandemic but

4282
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:31,920
things especially with the pandemic but
 

4283
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,550
things especially with the pandemic but
there's other topics where there's just

4284
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
there's other topics where there's just
 

4285
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,510
there's other topics where there's just
deep disagreement fueled by politics

4286
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:38,520
deep disagreement fueled by politics
 

4287
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,149
deep disagreement fueled by politics
about what is and isn't harmful

4288
01:16:41,149 --> 01:16:41,159
about what is and isn't harmful
 

4289
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:44,149
about what is and isn't harmful
there's uh even just the degree to which

4290
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159
there's uh even just the degree to which
 

4291
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,490
there's uh even just the degree to which
the virus is harmful and the degree to

4292
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:46,500
the virus is harmful and the degree to
 

4293
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,270
the virus is harmful and the degree to
which

4294
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:47,280
which
 

4295
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,729
which
the vaccines the response to the virus

4296
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:49,739
the vaccines the response to the virus
 

4297
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,649
the vaccines the response to the virus
are harmful there's just there's a

4298
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:51,659
are harmful there's just there's a
 

4299
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:53,990
are harmful there's just there's a
almost like a political divider on that

4300
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
almost like a political divider on that
 

4301
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,610
almost like a political divider on that
and so

4302
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:55,620
and so
 

4303
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,770
and so
how do you make decisions about that

4304
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:57,780
how do you make decisions about that
 

4305
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,350
how do you make decisions about that
where half the country in the United

4306
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:00,360
where half the country in the United
 

4307
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,930
where half the country in the United
States or some large fraction of the

4308
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:02,940
States or some large fraction of the
 

4309
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:05,630
States or some large fraction of the
world has very different views from

4310
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:05,640
world has very different views from
 

4311
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,850
world has very different views from
another part of the world

4312
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:07,860
another part of the world
 

4313
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,149
another part of the world
is there a way

4314
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
is there a way
 

4315
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,250
is there a way
out of the uh I mean the moderation of

4316
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:13,260
out of the uh I mean the moderation of
 

4317
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,290
out of the uh I mean the moderation of
this I think we

4318
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:15,300
this I think we
 

4319
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,810
this I think we
it's very difficult to

4320
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:17,820
it's very difficult to
 

4321
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:20,570
it's very difficult to
just abstain but but I think we should

4322
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:20,580
just abstain but but I think we should
 

4323
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,030
just abstain but but I think we should
be clear about which of these things are

4324
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:23,040
be clear about which of these things are
 

4325
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,130
be clear about which of these things are
actual safety concerns

4326
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:25,140
actual safety concerns
 

4327
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,530
actual safety concerns
and which ones are a matter of

4328
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:27,540
and which ones are a matter of
 

4329
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,149
and which ones are a matter of
preference in terms of how people want

4330
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:29,159
preference in terms of how people want
 

4331
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:31,130
preference in terms of how people want
information flagged right so we did

4332
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:31,140
information flagged right so we did
 

4333
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,590
information flagged right so we did
recently introduce something that allows

4334
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:33,600
recently introduce something that allows
 

4335
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,450
recently introduce something that allows
people

4336
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:35,460
people
 

4337
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,790
people
to have fact checking not affect the

4338
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:37,800
to have fact checking not affect the
 

4339
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,470
to have fact checking not affect the
distribution of of

4340
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:39,480
distribution of of
 

4341
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,610
distribution of of
um of what shows them their products so

4342
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:40,620
um of what shows them their products so
 

4343
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,229
um of what shows them their products so
a bunch of people don't trust who the

4344
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:42,239
a bunch of people don't trust who the
 

4345
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,390
a bunch of people don't trust who the
fact Checkers are all right well you can

4346
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:44,400
fact Checkers are all right well you can
 

4347
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,490
fact Checkers are all right well you can
you can turn that off if you want but if

4348
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:46,500
you can turn that off if you want but if
 

4349
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,590
you can turn that off if you want but if
the if the if the content you know

4350
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:48,600
the if the if the content you know
 

4351
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,630
the if the if the content you know
violates some policy like it's inciting

4352
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:50,640
violates some policy like it's inciting
 

4353
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,770
violates some policy like it's inciting
violence or something like that it's

4354
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:51,780
violence or something like that it's
 

4355
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,990
violence or something like that it's
still not going to be allowed so I I

4356
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,000
still not going to be allowed so I I
 

4357
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,490
still not going to be allowed so I I
think that you want to honor people's

4358
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:55,500
think that you want to honor people's
 

4359
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,709
think that you want to honor people's
preferences on on that as much as

4360
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:57,719
preferences on on that as much as
 

4361
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:59,390
preferences on on that as much as
possible

4362
01:17:59,390 --> 01:17:59,400
possible
 

4363
01:17:59,400 --> 01:17:59,990
possible
um

4364
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,000
um
 

4365
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,729
um
but look I mean this is really difficult

4366
01:18:01,729 --> 01:18:01,739
but look I mean this is really difficult
 

4367
01:18:01,739 --> 01:18:05,030
but look I mean this is really difficult
stuff I think the it's really hard to

4368
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,040
stuff I think the it's really hard to
 

4369
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,729
stuff I think the it's really hard to
know where to draw the line on

4370
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:07,739
know where to draw the line on
 

4371
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:11,090
know where to draw the line on
what is fact and what is opinion because

4372
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:11,100
what is fact and what is opinion because
 

4373
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,970
what is fact and what is opinion because
the nature of science is that nothing is

4374
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:13,980
the nature of science is that nothing is
 

4375
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,649
the nature of science is that nothing is
ever a hundred percent known for certain

4376
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:15,659
ever a hundred percent known for certain
 

4377
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:18,050
ever a hundred percent known for certain
you can disprove certain things but

4378
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:18,060
you can disprove certain things but
 

4379
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,330
you can disprove certain things but
you're constantly testing new hypotheses

4380
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:20,340
you're constantly testing new hypotheses
 

4381
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,709
you're constantly testing new hypotheses
and

4382
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:21,719
and
 

4383
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:23,990
and
um you know scrutinizing Frameworks that

4384
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000
um you know scrutinizing Frameworks that
 

4385
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,149
um you know scrutinizing Frameworks that
have been long held and every once in a

4386
01:18:26,149 --> 01:18:26,159
have been long held and every once in a
 

4387
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:28,189
have been long held and every once in a
while you you throw out something that

4388
01:18:28,189 --> 01:18:28,199
while you you throw out something that
 

4389
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:29,689
while you you throw out something that
was working for a very long period of

4390
01:18:29,689 --> 01:18:29,699
was working for a very long period of
 

4391
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:30,649
was working for a very long period of
time and

4392
01:18:30,649 --> 01:18:30,659
time and
 

4393
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:32,930
time and
it's very difficult but

4394
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:32,940
it's very difficult but
 

4395
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,250
it's very difficult but
um but I think that just because it's

4396
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:34,260
um but I think that just because it's
 

4397
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,570
um but I think that just because it's
very hard and just because their edge

4398
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:35,580
very hard and just because their edge
 

4399
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,490
very hard and just because their edge
cases doesn't mean that you

4400
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:37,500
cases doesn't mean that you
 

4401
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,990
cases doesn't mean that you
you should not

4402
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:39,000
you should not
 

4403
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,669
you should not
try to give people what they're looking

4404
01:18:40,669 --> 01:18:40,679
try to give people what they're looking
 

4405
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,010
try to give people what they're looking
for as well

4406
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,020
for as well
 

4407
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,669
for as well
let me ask about something you faced in

4408
01:18:46,669 --> 01:18:46,679
let me ask about something you faced in
 

4409
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:48,830
let me ask about something you faced in
terms of moderation

4410
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:48,840
terms of moderation
 

4411
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,310
terms of moderation
is uh pressure from different sources

4412
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
is uh pressure from different sources
 

4413
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,770
is uh pressure from different sources
pressure from governments I want to ask

4414
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:54,780
pressure from governments I want to ask
 

4415
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,870
pressure from governments I want to ask
a question how to withstand

4416
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
a question how to withstand
 

4417
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,770
a question how to withstand
that pressure for a world where AI

4418
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:00,780
that pressure for a world where AI
 

4419
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:03,590
that pressure for a world where AI
moderation starts becoming a thing too

4420
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:03,600
moderation starts becoming a thing too
 

4421
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,110
moderation starts becoming a thing too
so what's

4422
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:06,120
so what's
 

4423
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,470
so what's
um meta's approach to uh

4424
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:09,480
um meta's approach to uh
 

4425
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,570
um meta's approach to uh
to resist the pressure from governments

4426
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:11,580
to resist the pressure from governments
 

4427
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,669
to resist the pressure from governments
and other interest groups in terms of

4428
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
and other interest groups in terms of
 

4429
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,490
and other interest groups in terms of
what to moderate and not

4430
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:16,500
what to moderate and not
 

4431
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,870
what to moderate and not
I don't know that there's like a

4432
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:17,880
I don't know that there's like a
 

4433
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,910
I don't know that there's like a
one-size-fits-all answer to that and I

4434
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:19,920
one-size-fits-all answer to that and I
 

4435
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,110
one-size-fits-all answer to that and I
think we

4436
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:21,120
think we
 

4437
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,990
think we
basically have the principles around

4438
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
basically have the principles around
 

4439
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,209
basically have the principles around
you know we want to allow people to

4440
01:19:26,209 --> 01:19:26,219
you know we want to allow people to
 

4441
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:29,090
you know we want to allow people to
express as much as possible but

4442
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:29,100
express as much as possible but
 

4443
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,030
express as much as possible but
we have developed clear

4444
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:32,040
we have developed clear
 

4445
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:35,330
we have developed clear
IES of things that we think are

4446
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:35,340
IES of things that we think are
 

4447
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,490
IES of things that we think are
wrong that we don't want on our services

4448
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:37,500
wrong that we don't want on our services
 

4449
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,830
wrong that we don't want on our services
and we build tools to try to moderate

4450
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:39,840
and we build tools to try to moderate
 

4451
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,050
and we build tools to try to moderate
those so then the question is okay what

4452
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:42,060
those so then the question is okay what
 

4453
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,189
those so then the question is okay what
do you do

4454
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:43,199
do you do
 

4455
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,709
do you do
when a government says

4456
01:19:45,709 --> 01:19:45,719
when a government says
 

4457
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:48,290
when a government says
that they don't want something

4458
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:48,300
that they don't want something
 

4459
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,930
that they don't want something
on on the service and

4460
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:50,940
on on the service and
 

4461
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,330
on on the service and
I think we have we have a bunch of

4462
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:53,340
I think we have we have a bunch of
 

4463
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,950
I think we have we have a bunch of
um principles around how we deal with

4464
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:54,960
um principles around how we deal with
 

4465
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,750
um principles around how we deal with
that because on on the one hand if

4466
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:56,760
that because on on the one hand if
 

4467
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,729
that because on on the one hand if
there's a you know democratically

4468
01:19:58,729 --> 01:19:58,739
there's a you know democratically
 

4469
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:01,669
there's a you know democratically
elected government and people around the

4470
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:01,679
elected government and people around the
 

4471
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,290
elected government and people around the
world just have different values in

4472
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:03,300
world just have different values in
 

4473
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:06,169
world just have different values in
different places then you know should we

4474
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:06,179
different places then you know should we
 

4475
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:10,189
different places then you know should we
as uh you know california-based company

4476
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:10,199
as uh you know california-based company
 

4477
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:11,750
as uh you know california-based company
tell them

4478
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
tell them
 

4479
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,229
tell them
that something that they have decided is

4480
01:20:15,229 --> 01:20:15,239
that something that they have decided is
 

4481
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:18,770
that something that they have decided is
unacceptable actually like that we need

4482
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:18,780
unacceptable actually like that we need
 

4483
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,050
unacceptable actually like that we need
to be able to to to to express that I

4484
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:21,060
to be able to to to to express that I
 

4485
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,910
to be able to to to to express that I
mean I think that's there's a certain

4486
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:22,920
mean I think that's there's a certain
 

4487
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,010
mean I think that's there's a certain
amount of um

4488
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:25,020
amount of um
 

4489
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,410
amount of um
of hubris in that

4490
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:27,420
of hubris in that
 

4491
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,490
of hubris in that
um but then I think there are other

4492
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:28,500
um but then I think there are other
 

4493
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,130
um but then I think there are other
cases where you know it's it's like a

4494
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:31,140
cases where you know it's it's like a
 

4495
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,410
cases where you know it's it's like a
little more autocratic and you know you

4496
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:33,420
little more autocratic and you know you
 

4497
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,110
little more autocratic and you know you
have the dictator leader who's just

4498
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:36,120
have the dictator leader who's just
 

4499
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,330
have the dictator leader who's just
trying to crack down on descent and you

4500
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:38,340
trying to crack down on descent and you
 

4501
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,330
trying to crack down on descent and you
know the people in a country are really

4502
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:41,340
know the people in a country are really
 

4503
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,310
know the people in a country are really
um not aligned with that and it's not

4504
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:43,320
um not aligned with that and it's not
 

4505
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,410
um not aligned with that and it's not
necessarily against their culture but um

4506
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:45,420
necessarily against their culture but um
 

4507
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,510
necessarily against their culture but um
but the the person who's leading it is

4508
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:47,520
but the the person who's leading it is
 

4509
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,590
but the the person who's leading it is
just trying to push in a certain

4510
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:48,600
just trying to push in a certain
 

4511
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,970
just trying to push in a certain
direction

4512
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:49,980
direction
 

4513
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:53,149
direction
um these are very complex questions uh

4514
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:53,159
um these are very complex questions uh
 

4515
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:56,209
um these are very complex questions uh
but I I think so it's it's difficult to

4516
01:20:56,209 --> 01:20:56,219
but I I think so it's it's difficult to
 

4517
01:20:56,219 --> 01:21:00,169
but I I think so it's it's difficult to
have have a one-size-fits all

4518
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:00,179
have have a one-size-fits all
 

4519
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:02,570
have have a one-size-fits all
um approach to it but in general we're

4520
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:02,580
um approach to it but in general we're
 

4521
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,030
um approach to it but in general we're
pretty active and and kind of advocating

4522
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,040
pretty active and and kind of advocating
 

4523
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,450
pretty active and and kind of advocating
and pushing back on on um

4524
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:08,460
and pushing back on on um
 

4525
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:11,570
and pushing back on on um
requests to take things down

4526
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:11,580
requests to take things down
 

4527
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,189
requests to take things down
um

4528
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
um
 

4529
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,350
um
but honestly the thing that I think a

4530
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,360
but honestly the thing that I think a
 

4531
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,410
but honestly the thing that I think a
request to censor things is one thing

4532
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:18,420
request to censor things is one thing
 

4533
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,350
request to censor things is one thing
um and that's obviously bad but were we

4534
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,360
um and that's obviously bad but were we
 

4535
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,270
um and that's obviously bad but were we
um draw a much harder line

4536
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,280
um draw a much harder line
 

4537
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,130
um draw a much harder line
is on requests for access to information

4538
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:25,140
is on requests for access to information
 

4539
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:28,189
is on requests for access to information
right because you know if you can

4540
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:28,199
right because you know if you can
 

4541
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:29,450
right because you know if you can
if you get told that you can't say

4542
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:29,460
if you get told that you can't say
 

4543
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,950
if you get told that you can't say
something I mean

4544
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
something I mean
 

4545
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,110
something I mean
that's bad right I mean that that you

4546
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:33,120
that's bad right I mean that that you
 

4547
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:37,729
that's bad right I mean that that you
know is is obviously it violates your

4548
01:21:37,729 --> 01:21:37,739
know is is obviously it violates your
 

4549
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:40,250
know is is obviously it violates your
sense and freedom of expression at some

4550
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:40,260
sense and freedom of expression at some
 

4551
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,450
sense and freedom of expression at some
level but

4552
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:41,460
level but
 

4553
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,189
level but
um but a government getting access to

4554
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:43,199
um but a government getting access to
 

4555
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,850
um but a government getting access to
data in a way that seems

4556
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:46,860
data in a way that seems
 

4557
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,550
data in a way that seems
um like it would be unlawful in in our

4558
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:49,560
um like it would be unlawful in in our
 

4559
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,930
um like it would be unlawful in in our
country

4560
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:50,940
country
 

4561
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:54,290
country
um exposes people to real physical harm

4562
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:54,300
um exposes people to real physical harm
 

4563
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,790
um exposes people to real physical harm
um and

4564
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:55,800
um and
 

4565
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,130
um and
that's something that in general we take

4566
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:58,140
that's something that in general we take
 

4567
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:01,310
that's something that in general we take
very seriously and then so there's that

4568
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:01,320
very seriously and then so there's that
 

4569
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,229
very seriously and then so there's that
flows through like all of our policies

4570
01:22:03,229 --> 01:22:03,239
flows through like all of our policies
 

4571
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:05,330
flows through like all of our policies
and in a lot of ways right it's by the

4572
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:05,340
and in a lot of ways right it's by the
 

4573
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,310
and in a lot of ways right it's by the
time you're actually like litigating

4574
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:07,320
time you're actually like litigating
 

4575
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,290
time you're actually like litigating
with a government or pushing back on

4576
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:09,300
with a government or pushing back on
 

4577
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,510
with a government or pushing back on
them that's pretty late in the funnel

4578
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
them that's pretty late in the funnel
 

4579
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,189
them that's pretty late in the funnel
I'd say

4580
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:13,199
I'd say
 

4581
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,350
I'd say
a bunch of this stuff starts a lot

4582
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360
a bunch of this stuff starts a lot
 

4583
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,209
a bunch of this stuff starts a lot
higher up in the decision of where do we

4584
01:22:17,209 --> 01:22:17,219
higher up in the decision of where do we
 

4585
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:19,970
higher up in the decision of where do we
put data centers then

4586
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:19,980
put data centers then
 

4587
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,649
put data centers then
um there are a lot of countries where

4588
01:22:21,649 --> 01:22:21,659
um there are a lot of countries where
 

4589
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:22,790
um there are a lot of countries where
you know we may have a lot of people

4590
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,800
you know we may have a lot of people
 

4591
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,250
you know we may have a lot of people
using the service in a place it might be

4592
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:25,260
using the service in a place it might be
 

4593
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,649
using the service in a place it might be
you know good for the service in some

4594
01:22:27,649 --> 01:22:27,659
you know good for the service in some
 

4595
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:28,970
you know good for the service in some
ways

4596
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:28,980
ways
 

4597
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,290
ways
um good for those people if we could

4598
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:30,300
um good for those people if we could
 

4599
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,209
um good for those people if we could
reduce the latency by having a data

4600
01:22:32,209 --> 01:22:32,219
reduce the latency by having a data
 

4601
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:34,250
reduce the latency by having a data
center nearby them

4602
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:34,260
center nearby them
 

4603
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,410
center nearby them
but you know for whatever reason we just

4604
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:36,420
but you know for whatever reason we just
 

4605
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,510
but you know for whatever reason we just
feel like hey this government does not

4606
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:38,520
feel like hey this government does not
 

4607
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,930
feel like hey this government does not
have a good track record on on um

4608
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:41,940
have a good track record on on um
 

4609
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,270
have a good track record on on um
ew

4610
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:43,280
ew
 

4611
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,770
ew
basically not trying to get access to

4612
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:45,780
basically not trying to get access to
 

4613
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,510
basically not trying to get access to
people's data and at the end of the day

4614
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,520
people's data and at the end of the day
 

4615
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,430
people's data and at the end of the day
I mean if you put a data center in a

4616
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,440
I mean if you put a data center in a
 

4617
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,990
I mean if you put a data center in a
country and the government wants to get

4618
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:51,000
country and the government wants to get
 

4619
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,330
country and the government wants to get
access to people's data then you know

4620
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:53,340
access to people's data then you know
 

4621
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,250
access to people's data then you know
they do at the end of the day have the

4622
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:55,260
they do at the end of the day have the
 

4623
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,870
they do at the end of the day have the
option of having people show up with

4624
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:56,880
option of having people show up with
 

4625
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,290
option of having people show up with
guns and taking it by force so I I think

4626
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:00,300
guns and taking it by force so I I think
 

4627
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,370
guns and taking it by force so I I think
that there's like a lot of decisions

4628
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:01,380
that there's like a lot of decisions
 

4629
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,050
that there's like a lot of decisions
that go into like how you architect the

4630
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:03,060
that go into like how you architect the
 

4631
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,430
that go into like how you architect the
systems

4632
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:04,440
systems
 

4633
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,090
systems
um

4634
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:05,100
um
 

4635
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,810
um
years in advance of these actual

4636
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:08,820
years in advance of these actual
 

4637
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:11,030
years in advance of these actual
confrontations that end up being really

4638
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,040
confrontations that end up being really
 

4639
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,310
confrontations that end up being really
important so you put the protection of

4640
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:13,320
important so you put the protection of
 

4641
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,669
important so you put the protection of
people's data as a very very high

4642
01:23:16,669 --> 01:23:16,679
people's data as a very very high
 

4643
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:19,550
people's data as a very very high
priority but that I think is a there are

4644
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:19,560
priority but that I think is a there are
 

4645
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,689
priority but that I think is a there are
more harms that I think can be

4646
01:23:20,689 --> 01:23:20,699
more harms that I think can be
 

4647
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:22,490
more harms that I think can be
associated with that and and I think

4648
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:22,500
associated with that and and I think
 

4649
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,470
associated with that and and I think
that that ends up being a more critical

4650
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:24,480
that that ends up being a more critical
 

4651
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,410
that that ends up being a more critical
thing to defend against governments

4652
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:27,420
thing to defend against governments
 

4653
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,070
thing to defend against governments
um

4654
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080
um
 

4655
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,750
um
then you know whereas you know if

4656
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
then you know whereas you know if
 

4657
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,010
then you know whereas you know if
another government has a different view

4658
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:31,020
another government has a different view
 

4659
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,810
another government has a different view
of what should be acceptable speech in

4660
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:32,820
of what should be acceptable speech in
 

4661
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,070
of what should be acceptable speech in
their country

4662
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
their country
 

4663
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,510
their country
especially if it's a democratically

4664
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:35,520
especially if it's a democratically
 

4665
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,189
especially if it's a democratically
elected government and you know it's

4666
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:37,199
elected government and you know it's
 

4667
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,169
elected government and you know it's
then I I think that there's a certain

4668
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:39,179
then I I think that there's a certain
 

4669
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:40,370
then I I think that there's a certain
amount of deference that you should have

4670
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:40,380
amount of deference that you should have
 

4671
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,250
amount of deference that you should have
to that so it's uh that's speaking more

4672
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:43,260
to that so it's uh that's speaking more
 

4673
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,290
to that so it's uh that's speaking more
to the direct harm that's possible when

4674
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:45,300
to the direct harm that's possible when
 

4675
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,810
to the direct harm that's possible when
you give governments access to data but

4676
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:47,820
you give governments access to data but
 

4677
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:50,209
you give governments access to data but
if we look at the United States

4678
01:23:50,209 --> 01:23:50,219
if we look at the United States
 

4679
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:52,910
if we look at the United States
to the more nuanced kind of pressure to

4680
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:52,920
to the more nuanced kind of pressure to
 

4681
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,130
to the more nuanced kind of pressure to
censor not even order to censor but

4682
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:55,140
censor not even order to censor but
 

4683
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,709
censor not even order to censor but
pressure sensor from political entities

4684
01:23:57,709 --> 01:23:57,719
pressure sensor from political entities
 

4685
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:00,110
pressure sensor from political entities
which is kind of received quite a bit of

4686
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:00,120
which is kind of received quite a bit of
 

4687
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,590
which is kind of received quite a bit of
attention in the United States uh

4688
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:03,600
attention in the United States uh
 

4689
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,530
attention in the United States uh
maybe one way to ask that question is

4690
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:06,540
maybe one way to ask that question is
 

4691
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:09,290
maybe one way to ask that question is
if you've seen the Twitter files

4692
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:09,300
if you've seen the Twitter files
 

4693
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,630
if you've seen the Twitter files
what have you learned from

4694
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:11,640
what have you learned from
 

4695
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,990
what have you learned from
the kind of uh pressure from U.S

4696
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:15,000
the kind of uh pressure from U.S
 

4697
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,090
the kind of uh pressure from U.S
government agencies that was seen in

4698
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:17,100
government agencies that was seen in
 

4699
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,790
government agencies that was seen in
Twitter files and what do you do with

4700
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:19,800
Twitter files and what do you do with
 

4701
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,189
Twitter files and what do you do with
that kind of pressure

4702
01:24:22,189 --> 01:24:22,199
that kind of pressure
 

4703
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:24,709
that kind of pressure
you know I've I've seen it

4704
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:24,719
you know I've I've seen it
 

4705
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,090
you know I've I've seen it
um

4706
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:26,100
um
 

4707
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,070
um
it's really hard from the outside to

4708
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,080
it's really hard from the outside to
 

4709
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,570
it's really hard from the outside to
know exactly what happened in each of

4710
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:29,580
know exactly what happened in each of
 

4711
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,550
know exactly what happened in each of
these cases you know we've we've

4712
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:31,560
these cases you know we've we've
 

4713
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,070
these cases you know we've we've
obviously been

4714
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:34,080
obviously been
 

4715
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,850
obviously been
been in a bunch of our own cases where

4716
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:37,860
been in a bunch of our own cases where
 

4717
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,030
been in a bunch of our own cases where
you know where

4718
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:40,040
you know where
 

4719
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,590
you know where
agencies or different folks will just

4720
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:42,600
agencies or different folks will just
 

4721
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,689
agencies or different folks will just
say hey

4722
01:24:43,689 --> 01:24:43,699
say hey
 

4723
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:46,490
say hey
here's a threat that we're aware of

4724
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:46,500
here's a threat that we're aware of
 

4725
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,130
here's a threat that we're aware of
you should be aware of this too it's not

4726
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:49,140
you should be aware of this too it's not
 

4727
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:52,189
you should be aware of this too it's not
really pressure as much as it is just

4728
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:52,199
really pressure as much as it is just
 

4729
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:52,790
really pressure as much as it is just
um

4730
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:52,800
um
 

4731
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,470
um
you know flagging something that that

4732
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
you know flagging something that that
 

4733
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,870
you know flagging something that that
are our security systems should be on on

4734
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
are our security systems should be on on
 

4735
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,430
are our security systems should be on on
alert about

4736
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:58,440
alert about
 

4737
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,350
alert about
I get how some people could think of it

4738
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:00,360
I get how some people could think of it
 

4739
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,910
I get how some people could think of it
as that

4740

decisions based on trying to make people

4898
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:46,920
decisions based on trying to make people
 

4899
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,790
decisions based on trying to make people
happy I think you just have to do what

4900
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:49,800
happy I think you just have to do what
 

4901
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,430
happy I think you just have to do what
you think is the right balance and

4902
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:52,440
you think is the right balance and
 

4903
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,370
you think is the right balance and
accept that people are going to be upset

4904
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:55,380
accept that people are going to be upset
 

4905
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:56,930
accept that people are going to be upset
no matter where you come out on that

4906
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:56,940
no matter where you come out on that
 

4907
01:27:56,940 --> 01:28:00,229
no matter where you come out on that
yeah I like that pressurized debate uh

4908
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:00,239
yeah I like that pressurized debate uh
 

4909
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,030
yeah I like that pressurized debate uh
so how's your view of the freedom of

4910
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,040
so how's your view of the freedom of
 

4911
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:05,330
so how's your view of the freedom of
speech evolved over the years

4912
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:05,340

 

4913
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,790

um

4914
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:07,800

 

4915
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,550

and now they I

4916
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:10,560
and now they I
 

4917
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,649
and now they I
where the freedom might apply to them

4918
01:28:12,649 --> 01:28:12,659
where the freedom might apply to them
 

4919
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:16,669
where the freedom might apply to them
not just to the humans but to the uh the

4920
01:28:16,669 --> 01:28:16,679
not just to the humans but to the uh the
 

4921
01:28:16,679 --> 01:28:18,470
not just to the humans but to the uh the
personalized agents as you've spoken

4922
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:18,480
personalized agents as you've spoken
 

4923
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,970
personalized agents as you've spoken
about them

4924
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:19,980
about them
 

4925
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:22,070
about them
so yeah I mean I I've probably gotten to

4926
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:22,080
so yeah I mean I I've probably gotten to
 

4927
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,870
so yeah I mean I I've probably gotten to
someone more nuanced view just because I

4928
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:23,880
someone more nuanced view just because I
 

4929
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,729
someone more nuanced view just because I
think that there are you know I I come

4930
01:28:25,729 --> 01:28:25,739
think that there are you know I I come
 

4931
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:27,890
think that there are you know I I come
at this I'm obviously very Pro

4932
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:27,900
at this I'm obviously very Pro
 

4933
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,570
at this I'm obviously very Pro
freedom of expression right I don't

4934
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:29,580
freedom of expression right I don't
 

4935
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,729
freedom of expression right I don't
think you build a service like this that

4936
01:28:31,729 --> 01:28:31,739
think you build a service like this that
 

4937
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:33,350
think you build a service like this that
gives people tools to express themselves

4938
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:33,360
gives people tools to express themselves
 

4939
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,850
gives people tools to express themselves
unless you think that people expressing

4940
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:34,860
unless you think that people expressing
 

4941
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,290
unless you think that people expressing
themselves at scale is a good thing

4942
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:36,300
themselves at scale is a good thing
 

4943
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,470
themselves at scale is a good thing
right so I I get into this to like try

4944
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:39,480
right so I I get into this to like try
 

4945
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,050
right so I I get into this to like try
to prevent people from from expressing

4946
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:42,060
to prevent people from from expressing
 

4947
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,250
to prevent people from from expressing
anything I like want to give people

4948
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:43,260
anything I like want to give people
 

4949
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,649
anything I like want to give people
tools so they can express as much as

4950
01:28:45,649 --> 01:28:45,659
tools so they can express as much as
 

4951
01:28:45,659 --> 01:28:47,990
tools so they can express as much as
possible and then I think

4952
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,000
possible and then I think
 

4953
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,570
possible and then I think
it's become clear that there are certain

4954
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:50,580
it's become clear that there are certain
 

4955
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,070
it's become clear that there are certain
categories of things that we've talked

4956
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:52,080
categories of things that we've talked
 

4957
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:52,790
categories of things that we've talked
about

4958
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
about
 

4959
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,709
about
I think almost everyone accepts or are

4960
01:28:54,709 --> 01:28:54,719
I think almost everyone accepts or are
 

4961
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,149
I think almost everyone accepts or are
bad and that no one wants and that

4962
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:56,159
bad and that no one wants and that
 

4963
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:57,649
bad and that no one wants and that
they're that are illegal even in

4964
01:28:57,649 --> 01:28:57,659
they're that are illegal even in
 

4965
01:28:57,659 --> 01:28:59,750
they're that are illegal even in
countries like the US where you know you

4966
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
countries like the US where you know you
 

4967
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,149
countries like the US where you know you
have the the First Amendment that's very

4968
01:29:02,149 --> 01:29:02,159
have the the First Amendment that's very
 

4969
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,550
have the the First Amendment that's very
protective of of enabling speech it's

4970
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:04,560
protective of of enabling speech it's
 

4971
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,229
protective of of enabling speech it's
like you're still not allowed to you

4972
01:29:06,229 --> 01:29:06,239
like you're still not allowed to you
 

4973
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,070
like you're still not allowed to you
know do things that are gonna

4974
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:07,080
know do things that are gonna
 

4975
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,050
know do things that are gonna
immediately inside violence or you know

4976
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:09,060
immediately inside violence or you know
 

4977
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,550
immediately inside violence or you know
violate people's intellectual property

4978
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:10,560
violate people's intellectual property
 

4979
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,709
violate people's intellectual property
or things like that so through those but

4980
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:12,719
or things like that so through those but
 

4981
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,370
or things like that so through those but
then there's also a very active core of

4982
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:16,380
then there's also a very active core of
 

4983
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,770
then there's also a very active core of
just active disagreements in society

4984
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:18,780
just active disagreements in society
 

4985
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,390
just active disagreements in society
where some people may think that

4986
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:20,400
where some people may think that
 

4987
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,070
where some people may think that
something is true or false the other

4988
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:22,080
something is true or false the other
 

4989
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,930
something is true or false the other
side might think it's

4990
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:23,940
side might think it's
 

4991
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:27,830
side might think it's
the opposite or just unsettled right and

4992
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
the opposite or just unsettled right and
 

4993
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,270
the opposite or just unsettled right and
um and those are some of the most

4994
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:29,280
um and those are some of the most
 

4995
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,430
um and those are some of the most
difficult to to kind of handle like like

4996
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:31,440
difficult to to kind of handle like like
 

4997
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,990
difficult to to kind of handle like like
we've talked about

4998
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:33,000
we've talked about
 

4999
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,470
we've talked about
but um

5000
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:36,480

 

5001
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,090

one of the lessons that I feel like I've

5002
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:38,100
one of the lessons that I feel like I've
 

5003
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,950
one of the lessons that I feel like I've
learned is that

5004
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:39,960
learned is that
 

5005
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,830
learned is that
a lot of times

5006
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:42,840
a lot of times
 

5007
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,870
a lot of times
when you can

5008
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:44,880
when you can
 

5009
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,390
when you can
the best way to handle this stuff

5010
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:47,400
the best way to handle this stuff
 

5011
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,450
the best way to handle this stuff
more practically is not in terms of

5012
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:50,460
more practically is not in terms of
 

5013
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,189
more practically is not in terms of
answering the question of should this be

5014
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:52,199
answering the question of should this be
 

5015
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:55,189
answering the question of should this be
allowed but just like

5016
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:55,199
allowed but just like
 

5017
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,229
allowed but just like
what

5018
01:29:57,229 --> 01:29:57,239
what
 

5019
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:58,970
what
what is the best way to deal with

5020
01:29:58,970 --> 01:29:58,980
what is the best way to deal with
 

5021
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:00,590
what is the best way to deal with
someone being a jerk

5022
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:00,600
someone being a jerk
 

5023
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,070
someone being a jerk
is the person basically just having a

5024
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:04,080
is the person basically just having a
 

5025
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,990
is the person basically just having a
like repeat

5026
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,000
like repeat
 

5027
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,050
like repeat
behavior of like

5028
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:09,060
behavior of like
 

5029
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:12,350
behavior of like
causing a lot of a lot of issues so

5030
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:12,360
causing a lot of a lot of issues so
 

5031
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,229
causing a lot of a lot of issues so
looking at it more at that level and its

5032
01:30:15,229 --> 01:30:15,239
looking at it more at that level and its
 

5033
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:17,090
looking at it more at that level and its
effect on the broader communities Health

5034
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:17,100
effect on the broader communities Health
 

5035
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,189
effect on the broader communities Health
the community health

5036
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:19,199
the community health
 

5037
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,110
the community health
It's Tricky though because like how do

5038
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:21,120
It's Tricky though because like how do
 

5039
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,450
It's Tricky though because like how do
you know there could be people

5040
01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:23,460
you know there could be people
 

5041
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,370
you know there could be people
that have a very controversial Viewpoint

5042
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:25,380
that have a very controversial Viewpoint
 

5043
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,709
that have a very controversial Viewpoint
that turns out to have a positive

5044
01:30:27,709 --> 01:30:27,719
that turns out to have a positive
 

5045
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:29,390
that turns out to have a positive
long-term effect on the health of the

5046
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:29,400
long-term effect on the health of the
 

5047
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,189
long-term effect on the health of the
community because it challenges the

5057
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,310
I'm expressing this very very clearly
um

5058
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,320
um
 

5059
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,169
um
because I certainly agree with your your

5060
01:30:42,169 --> 01:30:42,179
because I certainly agree with your your
 

5061
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:44,450
because I certainly agree with your your
point there and my point isn't that we

5062
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:44,460
point there and my point isn't that we
 

5063
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:45,830
point there and my point isn't that we
should

5064
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:45,840
should
 

5065
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,050
should
not have people on our services that are

5066
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:48,060
not have people on our services that are
 

5067
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:49,250
not have people on our services that are
that are that are being controversial

5068
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:49,260
that are that are being controversial
 

5069
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,510
that are that are being controversial
that's that's certainly not what I mean

5070
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:50,520
that's that's certainly not what I mean
 

5071
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,649
that's that's certainly not what I mean
to say

5072
01:30:51,649 --> 01:30:51,659
to say
 

5073
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:55,370
to say
um it's that often I think

5074
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:55,380

 

5075
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:58,129

it's not just looking at a specific

5076
01:30:58,129 --> 01:30:58,139
it's not just looking at a specific
 

5077
01:30:58,139 --> 01:31:00,290
it's not just looking at a specific
example of speech that it's most

5078
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:00,300
example of speech that it's most
 

5079
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,110
example of speech that it's most
effective to to handle this stuff

5080
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:03,120
effective to to handle this stuff
 

5081
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,850
effective to to handle this stuff
um and and I I think often you don't

5082
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:04,860
um and and I I think often you don't
 

5083
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,590
um and and I I think often you don't
want to make specific binary decisions

5084
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:06,600
want to make specific binary decisions
 

5085
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,990
want to make specific binary decisions
of kind of this is allowed or this isn't

5086
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:09,000
of kind of this is allowed or this isn't
 

5087
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,270
of kind of this is allowed or this isn't
I mean we talked about you know it's

5088
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:11,280
I mean we talked about you know it's
 

5089
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,070
I mean we talked about you know it's
fact checking or Twitter's Community

5090
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:13,080
fact checking or Twitter's Community
 

5091
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,990
fact checking or Twitter's Community
Voices thing I think that's another good

5092
01:31:14,990 --> 01:31:15,000
Voices thing I think that's another good
 

5093
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,729
Voices thing I think that's another good
example it's like it's not a question of

5094
01:31:16,729 --> 01:31:16,739
example it's like it's not a question of
 

5095
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:19,189
example it's like it's not a question of
is this allowed or not it's just a

5096
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:19,199
is this allowed or not it's just a
 

5097
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,689
is this allowed or not it's just a
question of adding more context to the

5098
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:20,699
question of adding more context to the
 

5099
01:31:20,699 --> 01:31:23,090
question of adding more context to the
thing I think that that's helpful so in

5100
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:23,100
thing I think that that's helpful so in
 

5101
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,890
thing I think that that's helpful so in
the context of AI which is is what

5102
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:24,900
the context of AI which is is what
 

5103
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,990
the context of AI which is is what
you're asking about and there are lots

5104
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:27,000
you're asking about and there are lots
 

5105
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,290
you're asking about and there are lots
of ways that an AI can be helpful

5106
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:30,300
of ways that an AI can be helpful
 

5107
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,510
of ways that an AI can be helpful
you know with with an AI it's it's less

5108
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:32,520
you know with with an AI it's it's less
 

5109
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,729
you know with with an AI it's it's less
about censorship right because and it's

5110
01:31:34,729 --> 01:31:34,739
about censorship right because and it's
 

5111
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,890
about censorship right because and it's
it's more about what is the most

5112
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:36,900
it's more about what is the most
 

5113
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,709
it's more about what is the most
productive answer to a question

5114
01:31:39,709 --> 01:31:39,719
productive answer to a question
 

5115
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:41,810
productive answer to a question
um you know there's one case study that

5116
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:41,820
um you know there's one case study that
 

5117
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,090
um you know there's one case study that
I was reviewing with the the team is

5118
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:44,100
I was reviewing with the the team is
 

5119
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,129
I was reviewing with the the team is
someone asked

5120
01:31:46,129 --> 01:31:46,139
someone asked
 

5121
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:48,950
someone asked
um

5122
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:48,960

 

5123
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,129

can you explain to me how to 3D print a

5124
01:31:52,129 --> 01:31:52,139
can you explain to me how to 3D print a
 

5125
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,790
can you explain to me how to 3D print a
gun and

5126
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:54,800
gun and
 

5127
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,850
gun and
one proposed response is like no I can't

5128
01:31:58,850 --> 01:31:58,860
one proposed response is like no I can't
 

5129
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,350
one proposed response is like no I can't
talk about that right it's like

5130
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:00,360
talk about that right it's like
 

5131
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,310
talk about that right it's like
basically just like shut it down

5132
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:01,320
basically just like shut it down
 

5133
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,390
basically just like shut it down
immediately

5134
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:02,400
immediately
 

5135
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,950
immediately
which I think is is some of what you see

5136
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:03,960
which I think is is some of what you see
 

5137
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,750
which I think is is some of what you see
it's like as a large language model I'm

5138
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:05,760
it's like as a large language model I'm
 

5139
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,129
it's like as a large language model I'm
not allowed to talk about you know

5140
01:32:07,129 --> 01:32:07,139
not allowed to talk about you know
 

5141
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:08,390
not allowed to talk about you know
whatever

5142

01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:09,120
um
 

5145
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,610
um
but there's another response which is

5146
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:10,620
but there's another response which is
 

5147
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,450
but there's another response which is
like hey

5148
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:11,460
like hey
 

5149
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,830
like hey
you know I don't think that's a good

5150
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:12,840
you know I don't think that's a good
 

5151
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,229
you know I don't think that's a good
idea in a lot of countries

5152
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:15,239
idea in a lot of countries
 

5153
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:18,169
idea in a lot of countries
um including the US 3D printing guns is

5154
01:32:18,169 --> 01:32:18,179
um including the US 3D printing guns is
 

5155
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:20,030
um including the US 3D printing guns is
illegal or or kind of whatever the

5156
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:20,040
illegal or or kind of whatever the
 

5157
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,070
illegal or or kind of whatever the
factual thing is it's like okay you know

5158
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,080
factual thing is it's like okay you know
 

5159
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,990
factual thing is it's like okay you know
that's actually a respectful and

5160
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,000
that's actually a respectful and
 

5161
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,850
that's actually a respectful and
informative answer and you know I may

5162
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:25,860
informative answer and you know I may
 

5163
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:29,209
informative answer and you know I may
have not known that specific thing and

5164
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:29,219
have not known that specific thing and
 

5165
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:30,950
have not known that specific thing and
um so there are different ways to handle

5166
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:30,960
um so there are different ways to handle
 

5167
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,550
um so there are different ways to handle
this that I think kind of you can either

5168
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:34,560
this that I think kind of you can either
 

5169
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,370
this that I think kind of you can either
you can either assume good intent

5170
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:37,380
you can either assume good intent
 

5171
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,870
you can either assume good intent
like maybe the person didn't know and

5172
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:38,880
like maybe the person didn't know and
 

5173
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,610
like maybe the person didn't know and
I'm just going to help educate them or

5174
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:40,620
I'm just going to help educate them or
 

5175
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,110
I'm just going to help educate them or
you could like kind of come at it as

5176
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:42,120
you could like kind of come at it as
 

5177
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,430
you could like kind of come at it as
like no I need to shut this thing down

5178
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:43,440
like no I need to shut this thing down
 

5179
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,050
like no I need to shut this thing down
immediately right it's like I just I'm

5180
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:45,060
immediately right it's like I just I'm
 

5181
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,209
immediately right it's like I just I'm
not going to talk about this like

5182
01:32:47,209 --> 01:32:47,219
not going to talk about this like
 

5183
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:49,790
not going to talk about this like
um and there would be times where you

5184
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:49,800
um and there would be times where you
 

5185
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,850
um and there would be times where you
need to do that but I actually think

5186
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:52,860
need to do that but I actually think
 

5187
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,350
need to do that but I actually think
having a

5188
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:54,360
having a
 

5189
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,930
having a
somewhat more informative approach where

5190
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:56,940
somewhat more informative approach where
 

5191
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,669
somewhat more informative approach where
you generally assume good intent from

5192
01:32:58,669 --> 01:32:58,679
you generally assume good intent from
 

5193
01:32:58,679 --> 01:32:59,750
you generally assume good intent from
people

5194
01:32:59,750 --> 01:32:59,760
people
 

5195
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,590
people
is probably a better balance to be on as

5196
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
is probably a better balance to be on as
 

5197
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,209
is probably a better balance to be on as
many things as you can be you're not

5198
01:33:05,209 --> 01:33:05,219
many things as you can be you're not
 

5199
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:06,530
many things as you can be you're not
going to do that for everything but but

5200
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:06,540
going to do that for everything but but
 

5201
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,450
going to do that for everything but but
I but that you're kind of asking about

5202
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:08,460
I but that you're kind of asking about
 

5203
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,189
I but that you're kind of asking about
how I approach this and I'm thinking

5204
01:33:10,189 --> 01:33:10,199
how I approach this and I'm thinking
 

5205
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:13,250
how I approach this and I'm thinking
about this and as it relates to

5206
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:13,260
about this and as it relates to
 

5207
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,410
about this and as it relates to
to Ai and I think that that's a that's a

5208
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:15,420
to Ai and I think that that's a that's a
 

5209
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,229
to Ai and I think that that's a that's a
big difference in in kind of how how to

5210
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:18,239
big difference in in kind of how how to
 

5211
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:21,229
big difference in in kind of how how to
handle um sensitive content across these

5212
01:33:21,229 --> 01:33:21,239
handle um sensitive content across these
 

5213
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:23,930
handle um sensitive content across these
different modes

5214
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:23,940

 

5215

there is a project
 

5229
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,689
there is a project
you know I've always thought that sort

5230
01:33:41,689 --> 01:33:41,699
you know I've always thought that sort
 

5231
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,729
you know I've always thought that sort
of a text based

of a text based
 

5233
01:33:43,739 --> 01:33:47,209
of a text based
kind of information utility

5234
01:33:47,209 --> 01:33:47,219
kind of information utility
 

5235
01:33:47,219 --> 01:33:48,050
kind of information utility
um

5236
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:48,060
um
 

5237
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:49,910
um
it's just a really important thing to

5238
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:49,920
it's just a really important thing to
 

5239
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,950
it's just a really important thing to
society and

5240
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:51,960
society and
 

5241
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,709
society and
for whatever reason I feel like Twitter

5242
01:33:53,709 --> 01:33:53,719
for whatever reason I feel like Twitter
 

5243
01:33:53,719 --> 01:33:56,330
for whatever reason I feel like Twitter
has not lived up to what I would have

5244
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:56,340
has not lived up to what I would have
 

5245
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:58,490
has not lived up to what I would have
thought its full potential should be and

5246
01:33:58,490 --> 01:33:58,500
thought its full potential should be and
 

5247
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,810
thought its full potential should be and
I think that the current you know I

5248
01:33:59,810 --> 01:33:59,820
I think that the current you know I
 

5249
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:01,189
I think that the current you know I
think Elon thinks that right and that's

5250
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
think Elon thinks that right and that's
 

5251
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,149
think Elon thinks that right and that's
probably one of the reasons why you

5252
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
probably one of the reasons why you
 

5253
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,709
probably one of the reasons why you
bought it and

5254
01:34:03,709 --> 01:34:03,719
bought it and
 

5255
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:06,649
bought it and
um and

5256
01:34:06,649 --> 01:34:06,659
um and
 

5257
01:34:06,659 --> 01:34:08,770
um and
I do think that there are ways to to

5258
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:08,780
I do think that there are ways to to
 

5259
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:11,450
I do think that there are ways to to
consider alternative approaches to this

5260
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:11,460
consider alternative approaches to this
 

5261
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:13,610
consider alternative approaches to this
and one that I think is potentially

5262
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:13,620
and one that I think is potentially
 

5263
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:15,350
and one that I think is potentially
interesting

5264
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:15,360
interesting
 

5265
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,270
interesting
um is this open in Federated approach

5266
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,280
um is this open in Federated approach
 

5267
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,950
um is this open in Federated approach
where you're singing with Mastodon I

5268
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:18,960
where you're singing with Mastodon I
 

5269
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,910
where you're singing with Mastodon I
mean you're seeing that a little bit

5270
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:19,920
mean you're seeing that a little bit
 

5271
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,330
mean you're seeing that a little bit
with blue sky and

5272
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:23,340
with blue sky and
 

5273
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,790
with blue sky and
I think that it's possible that

5274
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:25,800
I think that it's possible that
 

5275
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,910
I think that it's possible that
something that melds some of those ideas

5276
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:27,920
something that melds some of those ideas
 

5277
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,669
something that melds some of those ideas

5285
01:34:36,659 --> 01:34:39,290
could be a kind of very
welcome contribution to that space But I

5286
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:39,300
welcome contribution to that space But I
 

5287
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:40,250
welcome contribution to that space But I
don't know we work on a lot of things

5288
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:40,260
don't know we work on a lot of things
 

5289
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,930
don't know we work on a lot of things
all the time though too so I don't want

5290
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:41,940
all the time though too so I don't want
 

5291
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:44,030
all the time though too so I don't want
to get a get ahead of myself and we we

5292

01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:49,430
of different things and this is
certainly one that I think could be

5298
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:49,440
certainly one that I think could be

so if you look at it'd be interesting
 

5325
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,629
so if you look at it'd be interesting
just to ask this question and throw

5326
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:17,639
just to ask this question and throw
 

5327
01:35:17,639 --> 01:35:20,810
just to ask this question and throw
Twitter into the mix at the landscape of

5328
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:20,820
Twitter into the mix at the landscape of
 

5329
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:24,110
Twitter into the mix at the landscape of
social networks that is Facebook that is

5330
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:24,120
social networks that is Facebook that is

that is WhatsApp
 

5335
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,649
that is WhatsApp
and then think of a text-based social

5336
01:35:30,649 --> 01:35:30,659
and then think of a text-based social
 

5337
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:32,390
and then think of a text-based social
network when you look at that landscape

5338
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
network when you look at that landscape
 

5339
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,310
network when you look at that landscape
what are the interesting differences to

5340
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:34,320
what are the interesting differences to
 

5341
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:34,970
what are the interesting differences to
you

5342
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:34,980
you
 

5343
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:37,729
you
why do we have these different flavors

5344
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:37,739
why do we have these different flavors
 

5345
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:40,129
why do we have these different flavors
and what what what are the needs what

5346
01:35:40,129 --> 01:35:40,139
and what what what are the needs what
 

5347
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:41,629
and what what what are the needs what
are the use cases what are the products

5348
01:35:41,629 --> 01:35:41,639
are the use cases what are the products
 

5349
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:43,669
are the use cases what are the products
what what is the aspect of them that

5350
01:35:43,669 --> 01:35:43,679
what what is the aspect of them that
 

5351
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,189
what what is the aspect of them that
create a fulfilling Human Experience and

5352
01:35:46,189 --> 01:35:46,199
create a fulfilling Human Experience and
 

5353
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:48,050
create a fulfilling Human Experience and
and a connection between humans that is

5354
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:48,060
and a connection between humans that is
 

5355
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,450
and a connection between humans that is
somehow distinct well I think text is

5356
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:50,460
somehow distinct well I think text is
 

5357
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,570
somehow distinct well I think text is
very accessible for people to transmit

5358
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:53,580
very accessible for people to transmit
 

5359
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:55,850
very accessible for people to transmit
ideas and to have back and forth

5360
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:55,860
ideas and to have back and forth
 

5361
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:57,709
ideas and to have back and forth
exchanges

5362
01:35:57,709 --> 01:35:57,719
exchanges
 

5363
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:01,910
exchanges
um so it I think ends up being a good

5364
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:01,920
um so it I think ends up being a good
 

5365
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,149
um so it I think ends up being a good
a good format for discussion in a lot of

5366
01:36:05,149 --> 01:36:05,159
a good format for discussion in a lot of
 

5367
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:07,669
a good format for discussion in a lot of
ways uniquely good right if you look at

5368
01:36:07,669 --> 01:36:07,679
ways uniquely good right if you look at
 

5369
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,410
ways uniquely good right if you look at
um if some of the other formats or other

5370
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:09,420
um if some of the other formats or other
 

5371
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:10,850
um if some of the other formats or other
networks that have focused on one type

5372
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:10,860
networks that have focused on one type
 

5373
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:12,350
networks that have focused on one type
of content like Tick Tock is obviously

5374
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:12,360
of content like Tick Tock is obviously

5377
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:17,390
huge right and there are comments on
Tick Tock but you know I think the

5378
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:17,400
Tick Tock but you know I think the
 

5379
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,090
Tick Tock but you know I think the
architecture of the service is very

5380
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:20,100
architecture of the service is very
 

5381
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,830
architecture of the service is very
clearly that you have the video is the

5382
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
clearly that you have the video is the
 

5383
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,510
clearly that you have the video is the
primary thing and there's you know

5384
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,520
primary thing and there's you know
 

5385
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,790
primary thing and there's you know
comments after that

5386
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:25,800
comments after that
 

5387
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,189
comments after that
um and

5388
01:36:28,189 --> 01:36:28,199
um and
 

5389
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:32,090
um and
um but I think one of the unique pieces

5390
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:32,100
um but I think one of the unique pieces
 

5391
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:33,129
um but I think one of the unique pieces
of having

5392
01:36:33,129 --> 01:36:33,139
of having
 

5393
01:36:33,139 --> 01:36:36,290
of having
text-based comments like content is that

5394
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:36,300
text-based comments like content is that
 

5395
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:39,709
text-based comments like content is that
the comments can also be first class and

5396
01:36:39,709 --> 01:36:39,719
the comments can also be first class and
 

5397
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:42,470
the comments can also be first class and
that makes it so that conversations can

5398
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:42,480
that makes it so that conversations can
 

5399
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,390
that makes it so that conversations can
just filter and Fork into all these

5400
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,400
just filter and Fork into all these
 

5401
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,370
just filter and Fork into all these
different directions and in a way that's

5402
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:46,380
different directions and in a way that's
 

5403
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,229
different directions and in a way that's
that can be super useful so I think

5404
01:36:48,229 --> 01:36:48,239
that can be super useful so I think
 

5405
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:49,310
that can be super useful so I think
there's a lot of things that are really

5406
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:49,320
there's a lot of things that are really
 

5407

there's a lot of things that are really
awesome about the experience it just

whatever the thing is that
 

5417
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:00,890

01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:00,900
um that that that basically ends up
 

5419
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,510

01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:38,940
thresholds over time where
 

5451
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:41,810

5513
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:44,450
um but I I they just haven't kind of
cracked that piece yet and I think that

5514
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:44,460
cracked that piece yet and I think that
 

5515
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,129
cracked that piece yet and I think that
that's made it's that you you're seeing

5516
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:46,139
that's made it's that you you're seeing
 

5517
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:47,270
that's made it's that you you're seeing
all these other things whether it's

5518
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,280
all these other things whether it's

all these other things whether it's
Mastodon or

5523
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,510
um or or blue sky
um that I think are you know maybe just

5524
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:53,520
um that I think are you know maybe just
 

5525
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,830
um that I think are you know maybe just
different different cuts of the same

5526
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:54,840
different different cuts of the same
 

5527
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,570
different different cuts of the same
thing but you know I think through the

5528
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:56,580
thing but you know I think through the

5531
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:00,050
last generation of of um social media
overall

5532
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:00,060
overall
 

5533
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,729
overall
one of the interesting experiments that

5534
01:39:01,729 --> 01:39:01,739
one of the interesting experiments that
 

5535
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:03,890
one of the interesting experiments that
I think should get run at larger scale

5536
01:39:03,890 --> 01:39:03,900
I think should get run at larger scale
 

5537
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,870
I think should get run at larger scale
is what happens if there's somewhat more

5538
01:39:05,870 --> 01:39:05,880
is what happens if there's somewhat more
 

5539
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,910
is what happens if there's somewhat more
decentralized control and if it's like

5540
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:07,920
decentralized control and if it's like
 

5541
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,390
decentralized control and if it's like
the stack is more open throughout and

5542
01:39:11,390 --> 01:39:11,400
the stack is more open throughout and
 

5543
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,189
the stack is more open throughout and
um I've just been pretty fascinated by

5544
01:39:13,189 --> 01:39:13,199
um I've just been pretty fascinated by
 

5545
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:15,350
um I've just been pretty fascinated by
that and seeing how that works

5546
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:15,360
that and seeing how that works
 

5547
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,189
that and seeing how that works
um

5548
01:39:16,189 --> 01:39:16,199
um
 

5549
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:19,550
um
to some degree end-to-end encryption

5550
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:19,560
to some degree end-to-end encryption
 

5551
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,169
to some degree end-to-end encryption
um on WhatsApp and as we bring it to

5552
01:39:21,169 --> 01:39:21,179
um on WhatsApp and as we bring it to
 

5553
01:39:21,179 --> 01:39:23,629
um on WhatsApp and as we bring it to
other services provides an element of it

5554
01:39:23,629 --> 01:39:23,639
other services provides an element of it
 

5555
01:39:23,639 --> 01:39:26,270
other services provides an element of it
because it pushes the service really out

5556
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:26,280
because it pushes the service really out
 

5557
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,430
because it pushes the service really out
to the edges I mean the the

5558
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:28,440
to the edges I mean the the
 

5559
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,709
to the edges I mean the the
server part of this that we run for

5560
01:39:30,709 --> 01:39:30,719
server part of this that we run for
 

5561
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:31,669
server part of this that we run for
WhatsApp

5562
01:39:31,669 --> 01:39:31,679
WhatsApp
 

5563
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,010
WhatsApp
is relatively very thin compared to what

5564
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:34,020
is relatively very thin compared to what
 

5565
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,110
is relatively very thin compared to what
we do on Facebook or Instagram

5566
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:36,120
we do on Facebook or Instagram
 

5567
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,390
we do on Facebook or Instagram
and much more of the complexity is you

5568
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:38,400
and much more of the complexity is you
 

5569
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,430
and much more of the complexity is you
know and how the apps kind of negotiate

5570
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:40,440
know and how the apps kind of negotiate
 

5571
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,709
know and how the apps kind of negotiate
with each other to pass information in a

5572
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
with each other to pass information in a
 

5573
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,169
with each other to pass information in a
in a fully intended encrypted way

5574
01:39:45,169 --> 01:39:45,179
in a fully intended encrypted way
 

5575
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:46,490
in a fully intended encrypted way
um but I don't know I think that that's

5576
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:46,500
um but I don't know I think that that's
 

5577
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,350
um but I don't know I think that that's
that is a good is a good model I think

5578
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:48,360
that is a good is a good model I think
 

5579
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,209
that is a good is a good model I think
it puts more power in individuals hands

5580
01:39:50,209 --> 01:39:50,219
it puts more power in individuals hands
 

5581
01:39:50,219 --> 01:39:51,950
it puts more power in individuals hands
and there are a lot of benefits of it if

5582
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:51,960
and there are a lot of benefits of it if
 

5583
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,629
and there are a lot of benefits of it if
you can if you can make it happen again

5584
01:39:53,629 --> 01:39:53,639
you can if you can make it happen again
 

5585
01:39:53,639 --> 01:39:55,850
you can if you can make it happen again
this is all like pretty speculative I I

5586
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:55,860
this is all like pretty speculative I I
 

5587
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,950
this is all like pretty speculative I I
mean I I think that it's it's you know

5588
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:57,960
mean I I think that it's it's you know
 

5589
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,990
mean I I think that it's it's you know
hard from the outside to know why

5590
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:00,000
hard from the outside to know why
 

5591
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,729
hard from the outside to know why
anything does or doesn't work until you

5592
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:01,739
anything does or doesn't work until you
 

5593
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:04,129
anything does or doesn't work until you
kind of take a run at it and

5594
01:40:04,129 --> 01:40:04,139
kind of take a run at it and
 

5595
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:04,729
kind of take a run at it and
um

5596
01:40:04,729 --> 01:40:04,739
um
 

5597
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:06,890
um
so I I think it's it's kind of an

5598
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:06,900
so I I think it's it's kind of an
 

5599
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,510
so I I think it's it's kind of an
interesting thing to experiment with but

5600
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:08,520
interesting thing to experiment with but
 

5601
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,770
interesting thing to experiment with but
I don't really know where this one's

5602
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:09,780
I don't really know where this one's
 

5603
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:10,610
I don't really know where this one's
going to go

5604
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:10,620
going to go
 

5605
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:13,790
going to go
so since we were talking about Twitter

5606
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:13,800
so since we were talking about Twitter
 

5607
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:17,629
so since we were talking about Twitter

01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:22,550
harsh wards

that I wish he didn't say so let me ask

the outside before you get into this
 

5635
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,850
the outside before you get into this
because I think one thing that I've

5636
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:52,860
because I think one thing that I've
 

5637
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:53,750
because I think one thing that I've
learned

5638
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:53,760
learned
 

5639
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,250
learned
is that

5640
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:55,260
is that
 

5641
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:57,169
is that
everyone has opinions on what you should

5642
01:40:57,169 --> 01:40:57,179
everyone has opinions on what you should

like running the company you see a lot

5646
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:00,840
like running the company you see a lot
 

5647
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,350
like running the company you see a lot
of specific nuances on things that are

5648
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:03,360
of specific nuances on things that are
 

5649
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:06,169
of specific nuances on things that are
not apparent externally and

5650
01:41:06,169 --> 01:41:06,179
not apparent externally and
 

5651
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:09,050
not apparent externally and
um I often

5652
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:09,060
um I often
 

5653
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,990
um I often
think that some of the discourse around

5654
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:12,000
think that some of the discourse around
 

5655
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,430
think that some of the discourse around
us would be

5656
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,440
us would be
 

5657
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,790
us would be
could be better if if there was more

5658
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:16,800
could be better if if there was more
 

5659
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,709
could be better if if there was more
kind of space for acknowledging that

5660
01:41:18,709 --> 01:41:18,719
kind of space for acknowledging that
 

5661
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:19,910
kind of space for acknowledging that
there's certain things that we're seeing

5662
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:19,920
there's certain things that we're seeing
 

5663
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,410
there's certain things that we're seeing
internally that guide what we're doing

5664
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:21,420
internally that guide what we're doing
 

5665
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:22,610
internally that guide what we're doing
but

5666
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:22,620
but
 

5667
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,110
but
um but I don't know I mean because since

5668
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:24,120
um but I don't know I mean because since
 

5669
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,669
um but I don't know I mean because since
you asked what what is what is going

5670
01:41:25,669 --> 01:41:25,679
you asked what what is what is going
 

5671
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,290
you asked what what is what is going
well

5672
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:27,300
well
 

5673
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:32,810
well
um

5674
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:32,820

 

5675
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:37,490

you know I I do think that Elon led a

5676
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:37,500
you know I I do think that Elon led a
 

5677
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,550
you know I I do think that Elon led a
push early on to make Twitter a lot

5678
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:40,560
push early on to make Twitter a lot
 

5679
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,010
push early on to make Twitter a lot
leaner and

5680
01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:43,020
leaner and
 

5681
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:46,370
leaner and
um and I think that that

5682
01:41:46,370 --> 01:41:46,380
um and I think that that
 

5683
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,229
um and I think that that
you know it's like you can you can agree

5684
01:41:48,229 --> 01:41:48,239
you know it's like you can you can agree
 

5685
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,090
you know it's like you can you can agree
or disagree with exactly all the tactics

5686
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:50,100
or disagree with exactly all the tactics
 

5687
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,770
or disagree with exactly all the tactics
and how and how we did that you know

5688
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:51,780
and how and how we did that you know
 

5689
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:54,590
and how and how we did that you know

that how you're going to execute it

5696
01:42:00,649 --> 01:42:00,659
that how you're going to execute it
 

5697
01:42:00,659 --> 01:42:03,530
that how you're going to execute it
um but a lot of the specific principles

5698
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:03,540
um but a lot of the specific principles
 

5699
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,510
um but a lot of the specific principles
that he pushed on

that he pushed on
 

5701
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,189
that he pushed on
um around

5702
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:07,199
um around
 

5703
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,050
um around
basically trying to make the

5704
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:09,060
basically trying to make the
 

5705
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:11,229
basically trying to make the
organization more technical around

5706
01:42:11,229 --> 01:42:11,239

decreasing the distance between
 

5709
01:42:13,139 --> 01:42:16,250

Engineers of the company and and him

5710
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:16,260
Engineers of the company and and him
 

5711
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:18,770
Engineers of the company and and him
like fewer layers of management

5712
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:18,780
like fewer layers of management
 

5713
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:19,729
like fewer layers of management
um

5714
01:42:19,729 --> 01:42:19,739
um
 

5715
01:42:19,739 --> 01:42:22,550
um
I think that those were generally good

5716
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:22,560
I think that those were generally good
 

5717
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,649
I think that those were generally good
changes and I'm also

5718
01:42:24,649 --> 01:42:24,659
changes and I'm also
 

5719
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:26,209
changes and I'm also
I also think that it was probably good

5720
01:42:26,209 --> 01:42:26,219
I also think that it was probably good
 

5721
01:42:26,219 --> 01:42:27,709
I also think that it was probably good
for the industry that he made those

5722
01:42:27,709 --> 01:42:27,719
for the industry that he made those
 

5723
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:29,750
for the industry that he made those
changes because my sense is that there

5724
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:29,760
changes because my sense is that there
 

5725
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,129
changes because my sense is that there
were a lot of other people who thought

5726
01:42:31,129 --> 01:42:31,139
were a lot of other people who thought
 

5727
01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:33,050
were a lot of other people who thought
that those were good changes

5728
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:33,060
that those were good changes
 

5729
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:36,290
that those were good changes
but who may have been

5730
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:36,300
but who may have been
 

5731
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,629
but who may have been
a little shy about

5732
01:42:38,629 --> 01:42:38,639
a little shy about
 

5733
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,930
a little shy about
doing them and I think he

5734
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:41,940

this push where I wanted us to become a
 

5909
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:45,109
this push where I wanted us to become a
a stronger technology company with a

5910
01:45:45,109 --> 01:45:45,119
a stronger technology company with a
 

5911
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,330
a stronger technology company with a
more of a focus on building uh more

5912
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:47,340
more of a focus on building uh more
 

5913
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,370
more of a focus on building uh more
Technical and and more of a focus on

we have around you know continuing to
 

5929
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:09,109
we have around you know continuing to
push AI forward and continuing to push

5930

forward all the metaverse work and in
 

5933
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,669
forward all the metaverse work and in
order to do that in light of the

5934
01:46:13,669 --> 01:46:13,679
order to do that in light of the
 

5935
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:16,609
order to do that in light of the
you know pretty big thrash that we had

5936
01:46:16,609 --> 01:46:16,619
you know pretty big thrash that we had
 

5937
01:46:16,619 --> 01:46:18,350
you know pretty big thrash that we had
seen over the last 18 months you know

5938
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:18,360
seen over the last 18 months you know
 

5939
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:19,790
seen over the last 18 months you know
some of it

5940
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:19,800
some of it
 

5941
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,830
some of it
um you know macroeconomic induced some

5942
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:21,840
um you know macroeconomic induced some
 

5943
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,270
um you know macroeconomic induced some
of it's specific some of it

5944
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:23,280
of it's specific some of it
 

5945
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,490
of it's specific some of it
competitively induced some of it

5946
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:25,500
competitively induced some of it
 

5947
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,410
competitively induced some of it
um just because of bad decisions right

5948
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:27,420
um just because of bad decisions right
 

5949
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,930
um just because of bad decisions right
or things that we got wrong

5950
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:29,940
or things that we got wrong
 

5951
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:31,910
or things that we got wrong
um I know I just I decided that we

5952
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:31,920
um I know I just I decided that we
 

5953
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,410
um I know I just I decided that we
needed to get to a point where we were a

5954
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:33,420
needed to get to a point where we were a
 

5955
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,149
needed to get to a point where we were a
lot leaner and

5956
01:46:35,149 --> 01:46:35,159
lot leaner and
 

5957
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:37,310
lot leaner and
but look I mean but then okay it's one

5958
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:37,320
but look I mean but then okay it's one
 

5959
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,050
but look I mean but then okay it's one
thing to do that to like decide that at

5960
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:39,060
thing to do that to like decide that at
 

5961
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:40,790
thing to do that to like decide that at
a high level then the question is how do

5962
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:40,800
a high level then the question is how do
 

5963
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,470
a high level then the question is how do
you execute that as compassionately as

5964
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:42,480
you execute that as compassionately as
 

5965
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,530
you execute that as compassionately as
possible and there's no good way

5966
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:45,540
possible and there's no good way
 

5967
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:47,629
possible and there's no good way
um there's no perfect way for sure and

5968
01:46:47,629 --> 01:46:47,639
um there's no perfect way for sure and
 

5969
01:46:47,639 --> 01:46:49,129
um there's no perfect way for sure and
it's it's it's gonna be tough no matter

5970
01:46:49,129 --> 01:46:49,139
it's it's it's gonna be tough no matter
 

5971
01:46:49,139 --> 01:46:53,270
it's it's it's gonna be tough no matter
what but I you know as a leadership team

5972
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:53,280
what but I you know as a leadership team
 

5973
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,890
what but I you know as a leadership team
here we've certainly spent a lot of time

5974
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:54,900
here we've certainly spent a lot of time
 

5975
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,990
here we've certainly spent a lot of time
just thinking okay given that this is a

5976
01:46:56,990 --> 01:46:57,000
just thinking okay given that this is a
 

5977
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,350
just thinking okay given that this is a
thing that sucks like what is the most

5978
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:00,360
thing that sucks like what is the most
 

5979
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,850
thing that sucks like what is the most
compassionate way that we can do this

5980
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:01,860
compassionate way that we can do this
 

5981
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,350
compassionate way that we can do this
and um

5982
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:03,360
and um
 

5983
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,510

and that's what we've tried to do and
 

5985
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,729
and that's what we've tried to do and
you mentioned there there's an increased

5986
01:47:07,729 --> 01:47:07,739
you mentioned there there's an increased
 

5987
01:47:07,739 --> 01:47:11,810
you mentioned there there's an increased
focus on uh engineering on Tech so

5988
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:11,820
focus on uh engineering on Tech so
 

5989
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:15,050
focus on uh engineering on Tech so
technology teams Tech Focus teams on

5990
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:15,060
technology teams Tech Focus teams on
 

5991
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,430

that the people are building things
 

6009
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,950

aren't just at like the leaf nodes of

6010
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:36,960
aren't just at like the leaf nodes of
 

6011
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,290
aren't just at like the leaf nodes of
the organization I don't want like

6012

6014
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:41,580
eight levels of management and then
 

6015
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,070
eight levels of management and then
the people actually doing the work so

01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:43,080
the people actually doing the work so
 

6017
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,050
the people actually doing the work so
yeah we made changes to make it set you

6018
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:45,060
yeah we made changes to make it set you
 

6019
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,490
yeah we made changes to make it set you
have individual contributor Engineers

6020
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:46,500
have individual contributor Engineers
 

6021
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,229
have individual contributor Engineers
reporting at almost every level up the

6022
01:47:48,229 --> 01:47:48,239
reporting at almost every level up the
 

6023
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:50,209
reporting at almost every level up the
stack which is important because you

6024
01:47:50,209 --> 01:47:50,219
stack which is important because you
 

6025
01:47:50,219 --> 01:47:51,530
stack which is important because you
know you're running a company one of the

6026
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:51,540
know you're running a company one of the
 

6027
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:53,030
know you're running a company one of the
big questions is

6028
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:53,040
big questions is
 

6029
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,729
big questions is
you know latency of of information that

6030
01:47:55,729 --> 01:47:55,739
you know latency of of information that
 

6031
01:47:55,739 --> 01:47:57,950
you know latency of of information that
you get you know we talked about this a

6032
01:47:57,950 --> 01:47:57,960
you get you know we talked about this a
 

6033
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:00,290
you get you know we talked about this a
bit earlier in terms of kind of the joy

6034
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:00,300
bit earlier in terms of kind of the joy
 

6035
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,330
bit earlier in terms of kind of the joy
of of

6036
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:01,340
of of
 

6037
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:03,590
of of
in the the feedback that you get doing

6038
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:03,600
in the the feedback that you get doing
 

6039
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,270
in the the feedback that you get doing
something like Jiu Jitsu compared to

6040
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:05,280
something like Jiu Jitsu compared to
 

6041
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,729
something like Jiu Jitsu compared to
they're running a long-term project but

6042
01:48:07,729 --> 01:48:07,739
they're running a long-term project but
 

6043
01:48:07,739 --> 01:48:09,410
they're running a long-term project but
I actually think part of the art of

6044
01:48:09,410 --> 01:48:09,420
I actually think part of the art of
 

6045
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:10,669
I actually think part of the art of
running a company is trying to

6046
01:48:10,669 --> 01:48:10,679
running a company is trying to
 

6047
01:48:10,679 --> 01:48:12,410
running a company is trying to
constantly

6048
01:48:12,410 --> 01:48:12,420
constantly
 

6049
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,330
constantly
re-engineer it so that your feedback

6050
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:14,340
re-engineer it so that your feedback
 

6051
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:15,649
re-engineer it so that your feedback
loops get shorter so you can learn

6052
01:48:15,649 --> 01:48:15,659
loops get shorter so you can learn
 

6053
01:48:15,659 --> 01:48:17,570
loops get shorter so you can learn
faster and part of the way that you do

6054
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:17,580
faster and part of the way that you do
 

6055
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:19,370
faster and part of the way that you do
that is by I kind of think that every

6056
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:19,380
that is by I kind of think that every
 

6057
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,629
that is by I kind of think that every
every layer that you have in the

6058
01:48:20,629 --> 01:48:20,639
every layer that you have in the
 

6059
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,250
every layer that you have in the
organization

6060
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:22,260
organization
 

6061
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:23,030
organization
um

6062
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:23,040
um
 

6063
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,189
um
means that information might not need to

6064
01:48:25,189 --> 01:48:25,199
means that information might not need to
 

6065
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,350
means that information might not need to
get reviewed before it it goes to you

6066
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:27,360
get reviewed before it it goes to you
 

6067
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,030
get reviewed before it it goes to you
and I think you know making a sense of

6068
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:29,040
and I think you know making a sense of
 

6069
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,590
and I think you know making a sense of
people doing the work are as close as

6070
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:30,600
people doing the work are as close as
 

6071
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,350
people doing the work are as close as
possible to you as possible is is as is

6072
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,360
possible to you as possible is is as is
 

6073
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,930
possible to you as possible is is as is
pretty important so there's that and I

6074
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:35,940
pretty important so there's that and I
 

6075
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:38,209
pretty important so there's that and I
think over time companies just build up

6076
01:48:38,209 --> 01:48:38,219
think over time companies just build up
 

6077
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:39,890
think over time companies just build up
very large

6078
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:39,900
very large
 

6079
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:41,870
very large
support functions that are not doing the

6080
01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:41,880
support functions that are not doing the
 

6081
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,209
support functions that are not doing the
kind of core technical work and those

6082
01:48:44,209 --> 01:48:44,219
kind of core technical work and those
 

6083
01:48:44,219 --> 01:48:46,250
kind of core technical work and those
functions are very important but I think

6084
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:46,260
functions are very important but I think
 

6085
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,570
functions are very important but I think
having them in the right proportion is

6086
01:48:47,570 --> 01:48:47,580
having them in the right proportion is
 

6087
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:50,209
having them in the right proportion is
is important and if um

6088
01:48:50,209 --> 01:48:50,219
is important and if um
 

6089
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:53,090
is important and if um
if you you try to do good work but you

6090
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:53,100
if you you try to do good work but you
 

6091
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:55,609
if you you try to do good work but you
don't have you know the right you know

6092
01:48:55,609 --> 01:48:55,619
don't have you know the right you know
 

6093
01:48:55,619 --> 01:48:57,649
don't have you know the right you know
marketing team or

6094
01:48:57,649 --> 01:48:57,659
marketing team or
 

6095
01:48:57,659 --> 01:48:59,390
marketing team or
um or the right legal advice like you're

6096
01:48:59,390 --> 01:48:59,400
um or the right legal advice like you're
 

6097
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,129
um or the right legal advice like you're
gonna you know make some pretty big

6098
01:49:01,129 --> 01:49:01,139
gonna you know make some pretty big
 

6099
01:49:01,139 --> 01:49:03,830
gonna you know make some pretty big
blunders but um but at the same time if

6100
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:03,840
blunders but um but at the same time if
 

6101
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,550
blunders but um but at the same time if
you have you know if if you just like

6102
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:06,560
you have you know if if you just like
 

6103
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,830
you have you know if if you just like
have too big of of things and and some

6104
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
have too big of of things and and some
 

6105
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,010
have too big of of things and and some
of these support roles then that might

6106
01:49:13,010 --> 01:49:13,020
of these support roles then that might
 

6107
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:16,250
of these support roles then that might
make it so things are just move a lot

6108
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:16,260
make it so things are just move a lot
 

6109
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,410
make it so things are just move a lot
um maybe you're too conservative or you

6110
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:18,420
um maybe you're too conservative or you
 

6111
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,030
um maybe you're too conservative or you
you move a lot slower

6112
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:20,040
you move a lot slower
 

6113
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,129
you move a lot slower
um uh then then you should otherwise

6114
01:49:22,129 --> 01:49:22,139
um uh then then you should otherwise
 

6115
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:23,990
um uh then then you should otherwise
introduce those are just examples but

6116
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:24,000
introduce those are just examples but
 

6117
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,890
introduce those are just examples but
it's um

6118
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:24,900
it's um
 

6119
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:27,050
it's um
but how do you find that balance it's

6120
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:27,060
but how do you find that balance it's
 

6121
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,790
but how do you find that balance it's
really tough yeah no but that's it's a

6122
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:28,800
really tough yeah no but that's it's a
 

6123
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,530
really tough yeah no but that's it's a
constant equilibrium that you're that

6124
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:30,540
constant equilibrium that you're that
 

6125
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,390
constant equilibrium that you're that
you're searching for yeah how many

6126
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:32,400
you're searching for yeah how many
 

6127
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,430
you're searching for yeah how many
managers to have what are the pros and

6128
01:49:34,430 --> 01:49:34,440
managers to have what are the pros and
 

6129
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:36,109
managers to have what are the pros and
cons of managers

6130
01:49:36,109 --> 01:49:36,119
cons of managers
 

6131
01:49:36,119 --> 01:49:38,209
cons of managers
well I mean I I believe a lot in

6132
01:49:38,209 --> 01:49:38,219
well I mean I I believe a lot in
 

6133
01:49:38,219 --> 01:49:39,290
well I mean I I believe a lot in
management I think there are some people

6134
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:39,300
management I think there are some people
 

6135
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:40,970
management I think there are some people
who think that it doesn't matter as much

6136
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:40,980
who think that it doesn't matter as much
 

6137
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:43,010
who think that it doesn't matter as much
but look I mean we have a lot of younger

6138
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:43,020
but look I mean we have a lot of younger
 

6139
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,390
but look I mean we have a lot of younger
people at the company for him this is

6140
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:44,400
people at the company for him this is
 

6141
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,850
people at the company for him this is
their first job and you know people need

6142
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:46,860
their first job and you know people need
 

6143
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:48,709
their first job and you know people need
to grow and learn in their career and

6144
01:49:48,709 --> 01:49:48,719
to grow and learn in their career and
 

6145
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:50,330
to grow and learn in their career and
like that all that stuff is important

6146
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:50,340
like that all that stuff is important
 

6147
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,129
like that all that stuff is important
but here's one mathematical way to look

6148
01:49:52,129 --> 01:49:52,139
but here's one mathematical way to look
 

6149
01:49:52,139 --> 01:49:53,750
but here's one mathematical way to look
at it

6150
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:53,760
at it
 

6151
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,930
at it
um you know at the beginning of this we

6152
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:56,940
um you know at the beginning of this we
 

6153
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:58,370
um you know at the beginning of this we
um

6154
01:49:58,370 --> 01:49:58,380
um
 

6155
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:01,189
um
I asked our our people team what was the

6156
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:01,199
I asked our our people team what was the
 

6157
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:03,410
I asked our our people team what was the
average number of of reports that a

6158
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:03,420
average number of of reports that a
 

6159
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:05,450
average number of of reports that a
manager had and I think it was it was

6160
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:05,460
manager had and I think it was it was
 

6161
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:08,750
manager had and I think it was it was
around three maybe three to four but

6162
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:08,760
around three maybe three to four but
 

6163
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,030
around three maybe three to four but
closer to three I was like wow like a

6164
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:11,040
closer to three I was like wow like a
 

6165
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,450
closer to three I was like wow like a
manager can you know best practices that

6166
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:14,460
manager can you know best practices that
 

6167
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:16,550
manager can you know best practices that
person can can manage you know seven or

6168
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:16,560
person can can manage you know seven or
 

6169
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:17,930
person can can manage you know seven or
eight people

6170
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:17,940
eight people
 

6171
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:19,310
eight people
um but there was a reason why it was

6172
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:19,320
um but there was a reason why it was
 

6173
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:20,930
um but there was a reason why it was
closer to three it was because we were

6174
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:20,940
closer to three it was because we were
 

6175
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:23,629
closer to three it was because we were
growing so quickly right and when you're

6176
01:50:23,629 --> 01:50:23,639
growing so quickly right and when you're
 

6177
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:25,729
growing so quickly right and when you're
hiring so many people so quickly

6178
01:50:25,729 --> 01:50:25,739
hiring so many people so quickly
 

6179
01:50:25,739 --> 01:50:28,310
hiring so many people so quickly
then that means that you need managers

6180
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:28,320
then that means that you need managers
 

6181
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,310
then that means that you need managers
who have capacity to onboard new people

6182
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:31,320
who have capacity to onboard new people
 

6183
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:32,689
who have capacity to onboard new people
um and also if you have a new manager

6184
01:50:32,689 --> 01:50:32,699
um and also if you have a new manager
 

6185
01:50:32,699 --> 01:50:34,250
um and also if you have a new manager
you may not want to have them have seven

6186
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:34,260
you may not want to have them have seven
 

6187
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:35,629
you may not want to have them have seven
direct reports immediately because you

6188
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:35,639
direct reports immediately because you
 

6189
01:50:35,639 --> 01:50:38,270
direct reports immediately because you
want them to ramp up but the thing is

6190
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:38,280
want them to ramp up but the thing is
 

6191
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,010
want them to ramp up but the thing is
going forward I don't want us to

6192
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:40,020
going forward I don't want us to
 

6193
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:41,930
going forward I don't want us to
actually hire that many people that

6194
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:41,940
actually hire that many people that
 

6195
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:43,790
actually hire that many people that
quickly right so I I actually think

6196
01:50:43,790 --> 01:50:43,800
quickly right so I I actually think
 

6197
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,350
quickly right so I I actually think
we'll just do better work if we have

6198
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:45,360
we'll just do better work if we have
 

6199
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,390
we'll just do better work if we have
more constraints and we're

6200
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:47,400
more constraints and we're
 

6201
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:49,250
more constraints and we're
um you know leaner as an organization so

6202
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:49,260
um you know leaner as an organization so
 

6203
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:50,870
um you know leaner as an organization so
in a world where we're not adding so

6204
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:50,880
in a world where we're not adding so
 

6205
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,729
in a world where we're not adding so
many people as quickly

6206
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:52,739
many people as quickly
 

6207
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:54,709
many people as quickly
is it as valuable to have a lot of

6208
01:50:54,709 --> 01:50:54,719
is it as valuable to have a lot of
 

6209
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:56,510
is it as valuable to have a lot of
managers who have extra capacity waiting

6210
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:56,520
managers who have extra capacity waiting
 

6211
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,669
managers who have extra capacity waiting
for new people no right so

6212
01:50:58,669 --> 01:50:58,679
for new people no right so
 

6213
01:50:58,679 --> 01:51:00,350
for new people no right so
um so now we can we could sort of

6214
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:00,360
um so now we can we could sort of
 

6215
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,270
um so now we can we could sort of
defragment the organization and get to a

6216
01:51:02,270 --> 01:51:02,280
defragment the organization and get to a
 

6217
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:04,129
defragment the organization and get to a
place where the average is closer to

6218
01:51:04,129 --> 01:51:04,139
place where the average is closer to
 

6219
01:51:04,139 --> 01:51:05,750
place where the average is closer to
that seven or eight

6220
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:05,760
that seven or eight
 

6221
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,729
that seven or eight
um and it's it just ends up being a

6222
01:51:07,729 --> 01:51:07,739
um and it's it just ends up being a
 

6223
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:09,770
um and it's it just ends up being a
somewhat more kind of compact management

6224
01:51:09,770 --> 01:51:09,780
somewhat more kind of compact management
 

6225
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:12,350
somewhat more kind of compact management
structure which um you know decreases

6226
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:12,360
structure which um you know decreases
 

6227
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,570
structure which um you know decreases
the latency on on information going up

6228
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:14,580
the latency on on information going up
 

6229
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:16,370
the latency on on information going up
and down the chain and

6230
01:51:16,370 --> 01:51:16,380
and down the chain and
 

6231
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:17,930
and down the chain and
um and I think empowers people more but

6232
01:51:17,930 --> 01:51:17,940
um and I think empowers people more but
 

6233
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,430
um and I think empowers people more but
I mean that's that's an example that I

6234
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:19,440
I mean that's that's an example that I
 

6235
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,070
I mean that's that's an example that I
think it doesn't kind of undervalue the

6236
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080
think it doesn't kind of undervalue the
 

6237
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,830
think it doesn't kind of undervalue the
importance of management and and the

6238
01:51:24,830 --> 01:51:24,840
importance of management and and the
 

6239
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,590
importance of management and and the
um kind of the personal

6240
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:27,600
um kind of the personal
 

6241
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,570
um kind of the personal
growth or coaching that people need in

6242
01:51:29,570 --> 01:51:29,580
growth or coaching that people need in
 

6243
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,070
growth or coaching that people need in
order to do their jobs well it's just I

6244
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:31,080
order to do their jobs well it's just I
 

6245
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:32,870
order to do their jobs well it's just I
think realistically we're just not going

6246
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:32,880
think realistically we're just not going
 

6247
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,370
think realistically we're just not going
to hire as many people going forward so

6248
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:34,380
to hire as many people going forward so
 

6249
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,270
to hire as many people going forward so
I think that you need a different

6250
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
I think that you need a different
 

6251
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:38,209
I think that you need a different
structure this whole this whole

6252
01:51:38,209 --> 01:51:38,219
structure this whole this whole
 

6253
01:51:38,219 --> 01:51:40,850
structure this whole this whole
incredible hierarchy and network of

6254
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:40,860
incredible hierarchy and network of
 

6255
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:42,350
incredible hierarchy and network of
humans that make up a company is

6256
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:42,360
humans that make up a company is
 

6257
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:46,370
humans that make up a company is
fascinating oh yeah yeah how do you uh

6258
01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:46,380
fascinating oh yeah yeah how do you uh
 

6259

6261
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,950
hire great teams how do you hire great
now with the focus on engineering and

6262
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:51,960
now with the focus on engineering and
 

6263
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:54,350
now with the focus on engineering and
Technical teams how do you hire great

6264
01:51:54,350 --> 01:51:54,360
Technical teams how do you hire great
 

6265
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,669
Technical teams how do you hire great
engineers

6266
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:55,679
engineers
 

6267
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:59,330
engineers
and uh great members of technical teams

6268
01:51:59,330 --> 01:51:59,340
and uh great members of technical teams
 

6269
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:01,790
and uh great members of technical teams
well you're asking how you select or how

6270
01:52:01,790 --> 01:52:01,800
well you're asking how you select or how
 

6271
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,109
well you're asking how you select or how
you attract them both but select I think

6272
01:52:05,109 --> 01:52:05,119
you attract them both but select I think
 

6273
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:08,510
you attract them both but select I think
uh I think attract is work on cool stuff

6274
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:08,520
uh I think attract is work on cool stuff
 

6275
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:11,090
uh I think attract is work on cool stuff
and have a vision I think that's right

6276
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:11,100
and have a vision I think that's right
 

6277
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,950
and have a vision I think that's right
and and have a track record that people

6278
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:12,960
and and have a track record that people
 

6279
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,850
and and have a track record that people
think you're actually gonna be able to

6280
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:13,860
think you're actually gonna be able to
 

6281
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:16,790
think you're actually gonna be able to
do it yeah to me the select is seems

6282
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:16,800
do it yeah to me the select is seems
 

6283
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,370
do it yeah to me the select is seems
like more of the art form more of the

6284
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:19,380
like more of the art form more of the
 

6285
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:22,189
like more of the art form more of the
tricky thing yeah do you select the

6286
01:52:22,189 --> 01:52:22,199
tricky thing yeah do you select the
 

6287
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:24,890
tricky thing yeah do you select the
people that fit the culture and can get

6288
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:24,900
people that fit the culture and can get
 

6289
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,570
people that fit the culture and can get
integrated the most effectively and so

6290
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:26,580
integrated the most effectively and so
 

6291
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:28,790
integrated the most effectively and so
on and maybe yeah especially when

6292
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:28,800
on and maybe yeah especially when
 

6293
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,010
on and maybe yeah especially when
they're young to see like

6294
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:31,020
they're young to see like
 

6295
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:35,149
they're young to see like
to see the magic through the through the

6296
01:52:35,149 --> 01:52:35,159
to see the magic through the through the
 

6297
01:52:35,159 --> 01:52:36,890
to see the magic through the through the
resumes to the paperwork and all this

6298
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:36,900
resumes to the paperwork and all this
 

6299
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,330
resumes to the paperwork and all this
kind of stuff to see that there's a

6300
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:38,340
kind of stuff to see that there's a
 

6301
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,750
kind of stuff to see that there's a
special human there that would do like

6302
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:40,760
special human there that would do like
 

6303
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,709
special human there that would do like
incredible work

6304
01:52:42,709 --> 01:52:42,719
incredible work
 

6305
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:44,870
incredible work
so there are lots of different

6306
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:44,880
so there are lots of different
 

6307
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,570
so there are lots of different
cuts on this question I mean I think

6308
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:47,580
cuts on this question I mean I think
 

6309
01:52:47,580 --> 01:52:49,850
cuts on this question I mean I think
when an organization is growing quickly

6310
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:49,860
when an organization is growing quickly
 

6311
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:52,850
when an organization is growing quickly
one of the big questions that teams face

6312
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:52,860
one of the big questions that teams face
 

6313
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:55,310
one of the big questions that teams face
is do I hire this person who's in front

6314
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:55,320
is do I hire this person who's in front
 

6315
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:58,550
is do I hire this person who's in front
of me now because they seem good or

6316
01:52:58,550 --> 01:52:58,560
of me now because they seem good or
 

6317
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:00,709
of me now because they seem good or
do I hold out to get someone who's even

6318
01:53:00,709 --> 01:53:00,719
do I hold out to get someone who's even
 

6319
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:02,570
do I hold out to get someone who's even
better and

6320
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:02,580
better and
 

6321
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:04,729
better and
the heuristic that I always

6322
01:53:04,729 --> 01:53:04,739
the heuristic that I always
 

6323
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:08,149
the heuristic that I always
focused on for myself and my own kind of

6324
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:08,159
focused on for myself and my own kind of
 

6325
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:11,149
focused on for myself and my own kind of
direct hiring that I that I think works

6326
01:53:11,149 --> 01:53:11,159
direct hiring that I that I think works
 

6327
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:12,530
direct hiring that I that I think works
so when you when you recurse it through

6328
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:12,540
so when you when you recurse it through
 

6329
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:14,570
so when you when you recurse it through
the organization is that you should only

6330
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:14,580
the organization is that you should only
 

6331
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:16,790
the organization is that you should only
hire someone to be on your team if you

6332
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:16,800
hire someone to be on your team if you
 

6333
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,649
hire someone to be on your team if you
would be happy working for them in an

6334
01:53:18,649 --> 01:53:18,659
would be happy working for them in an
 

6335
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:20,689
would be happy working for them in an
alternate universe then

6336
01:53:20,689 --> 01:53:20,699
alternate universe then
 

6337
01:53:20,699 --> 01:53:22,430
alternate universe then
something that that kind of works and

6338
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:22,440
something that that kind of works and
 

6339
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:23,750
something that that kind of works and
you know that's basically how I've tried

6340
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
you know that's basically how I've tried
 

6341
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,030
you know that's basically how I've tried
to build my team it's you know I'm not

6342
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:26,040
to build my team it's you know I'm not
 

6343
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,310
to build my team it's you know I'm not
I'm not in a rush to not be running the

6344
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:28,320
I'm not in a rush to not be running the
 

6345
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,990
I'm not in a rush to not be running the
company but I think in an alternate

6346
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:30,000
company but I think in an alternate
 

6347
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,550
company but I think in an alternate
universe where one of these other folks

6348
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:31,560
universe where one of these other folks
 

6349
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,050
universe where one of these other folks
was running the company I'd be happy to

6350
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:33,060
was running the company I'd be happy to
 

6351
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,030
was running the company I'd be happy to
work for them I feel like I'd learn from

6352
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:35,040
work for them I feel like I'd learn from
 

6353
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,550
work for them I feel like I'd learn from
them I respect their kind of General

6354
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:37,560
them I respect their kind of General
 

6355
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:39,050
them I respect their kind of General
judgment

6356
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:39,060
judgment
 

6357
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:40,970
judgment
um they're all very insightful they have

6358
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:40,980
um they're all very insightful they have
 

6359
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,590
um they're all very insightful they have
good values

6360
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:42,600
good values
 

6361
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,629
good values
um and and I think that that gives you

6362
01:53:44,629 --> 01:53:44,639
um and and I think that that gives you
 

6363
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:47,390
um and and I think that that gives you
some rubric for

6364
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:47,400
some rubric for
 

6365
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,250
some rubric for
you can apply that at every layer and I

6366
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:49,260
you can apply that at every layer and I
 

6367
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:50,510
you can apply that at every layer and I
think if you apply that at every layer

6368
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:50,520
think if you apply that at every layer
 

6369
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,490
think if you apply that at every layer
in the organization then you'll have a

6370
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:52,500
in the organization then you'll have a
 

6371
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,590
in the organization then you'll have a
pretty strong organization

6372
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:54,600
pretty strong organization
 

6373
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,450
pretty strong organization
um

6374
01:53:56,450 --> 01:53:56,460
um
 

6375
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:58,070
um
okay in an organization that's not

6376
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:58,080
okay in an organization that's not
 

6377
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,870
okay in an organization that's not
growing as quickly the questions might

6378
01:53:59,870 --> 01:53:59,880
growing as quickly the questions might
 

6379
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:01,790
growing as quickly the questions might
be a little different though

6380
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:01,800
be a little different though
 

6381
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,709
be a little different though
um and there

6382
01:54:03,709 --> 01:54:03,719
um and there
 

6383
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:05,090
um and there
you asked about young people

6384
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:05,100
you asked about young people
 

6385
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,490
you asked about young people
specifically like people out of college

6386
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:07,500
specifically like people out of college
 

6387
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,590
specifically like people out of college
and one of the things that we see

6388
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:09,600
and one of the things that we see
 

6389
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:12,890
and one of the things that we see
is it's it's a pretty basic lesson but

6390
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:12,900
is it's it's a pretty basic lesson but
 

6391
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:15,530
is it's it's a pretty basic lesson but
like we have a much better sense of who

6392
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:15,540
like we have a much better sense of who
 

6393
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,629
like we have a much better sense of who
the best people are who have interned at

6394
01:54:17,629 --> 01:54:17,639
the best people are who have interned at
 

6395
01:54:17,639 --> 01:54:19,669
the best people are who have interned at
the company for a couple of months then

6396
01:54:19,669 --> 01:54:19,679
the company for a couple of months then
 

6397
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:22,070
the company for a couple of months then
by looking at them at at kind of a

6398
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,080
by looking at them at at kind of a
 

6399
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,649
by looking at them at at kind of a
resume or short or a short um interview

6400
01:54:24,649 --> 01:54:24,659
resume or short or a short um interview
 

6401
01:54:24,659 --> 01:54:26,930
resume or short or a short um interview
Loop and obviously the in-person field

6402
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:26,940
Loop and obviously the in-person field
 

6403
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,430
Loop and obviously the in-person field
that you get from someone probably tells

6404
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:28,440
that you get from someone probably tells
 

6405
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,229
that you get from someone probably tells
you more than the resume

6406
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:30,239
you more than the resume
 

6407
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:32,209
you more than the resume
um and you can do some basic skills

6408
01:54:32,209 --> 01:54:32,219
um and you can do some basic skills
 

6409
01:54:32,219 --> 01:54:35,510
um and you can do some basic skills
assessment but a lot of the stuff really

6410
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:35,520
assessment but a lot of the stuff really
 

6411
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,490
assessment but a lot of the stuff really
just is cultural people thrive in

6412
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:37,500
just is cultural people thrive in
 

6413
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:41,810
just is cultural people thrive in
different environments and um and

6414
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:41,820
different environments and um and
 

6415
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:43,550
different environments and um and
on different teams even within a

6416
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:43,560
on different teams even within a
 

6417
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:46,910
on different teams even within a
specific company and it's it's like the

6418
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:46,920
specific company and it's it's like the
 

6419
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,129
specific company and it's it's like the
people who come for even a short period

6420
01:54:49,129 --> 01:54:49,139
people who come for even a short period
 

6421
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:51,530
people who come for even a short period
of time over a summer who do a great job

6422
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:51,540
of time over a summer who do a great job
 

6423
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:53,270
of time over a summer who do a great job
here you know that they're going to be

6424
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:53,280
here you know that they're going to be
 

6425
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,950
here you know that they're going to be
great if they if they came and joined

6426
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:54,960
great if they if they came and joined
 

6427
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,510
great if they if they came and joined
full time and that's you know one of the

6428
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:56,520
full time and that's you know one of the
 

6429
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,250
full time and that's you know one of the
reasons why we've invested so much in

6430
01:54:58,250 --> 01:54:58,260
reasons why we've invested so much in
 

6431
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:00,410
reasons why we've invested so much in
internship is um

6432
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:00,420
internship is um
 

6433
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:02,570
internship is um
is basically just it's a very useful

6434
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:02,580
is basically just it's a very useful
 

6435
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:05,090
is basically just it's a very useful
sorting function both for us and for the

6436
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:05,100
sorting function both for us and for the
 

6437
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:06,229
sorting function both for us and for the
people who want to try out the company

6438
01:55:06,229 --> 01:55:06,239
people who want to try out the company
 

6439
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,390
people who want to try out the company
you mentioned in person what do you

6440
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:08,400
you mentioned in person what do you
 

6441
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,910
you mentioned in person what do you
think about remote work a topic that's

6442
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:10,920
think about remote work a topic that's
 

6443
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,770
think about remote work a topic that's
been discussed extensively because of

6444
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:12,780
been discussed extensively because of
 

6445
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,930
been discussed extensively because of
the over the past few years because of

6446
01:55:14,930 --> 01:55:14,940
the over the past few years because of
 

6447
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:18,050
the over the past few years because of
the pandemic yeah I mean I think it's I

6448
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:18,060
the pandemic yeah I mean I think it's I
 

6449
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:19,550
the pandemic yeah I mean I think it's I
mean it's it's a thing that's here to

6450
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:19,560
mean it's it's a thing that's here to
 

6451
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,050
mean it's it's a thing that's here to
stay

6452
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:21,060
stay
 

6453
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:23,330
stay
um but I think that there's there's

6454
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:23,340
um but I think that there's there's
 

6455
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:26,990
um but I think that there's there's
value in both right it's not um

6456
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:27,000
value in both right it's not um
 

6457
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,030
value in both right it's not um
and I wouldn't want to run a fully

6458
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:29,040
and I wouldn't want to run a fully
 

6459
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:30,470
and I wouldn't want to run a fully
remote company

6460
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:30,480
remote company
 

6461
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,510
remote company
yet at least I think there's an asterisk

6462
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:32,520
yet at least I think there's an asterisk
 

6463
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,550
yet at least I think there's an asterisk
on that which is that which is that some

6464
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:34,560
on that which is that which is that some
 

6465
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:35,990
on that which is that which is that some
of the other stuff you're working on

6466
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,000
of the other stuff you're working on
 

6467
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,270
of the other stuff you're working on
yeah yeah exactly it's like all the all

6468
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:38,280
yeah yeah exactly it's like all the all
 

6469
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:40,609
yeah yeah exactly it's like all the all
the um you know metaverse work and the

6470
01:55:40,609 --> 01:55:40,619
the um you know metaverse work and the
 

6471
01:55:40,619 --> 01:55:42,649
the um you know metaverse work and the
the ability to be to feel like you're

6472
01:55:42,649 --> 01:55:42,659
the ability to be to feel like you're
 

6473
01:55:42,659 --> 01:55:44,330
the ability to be to feel like you're
truly present

6474
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:44,340
truly present
 

6475
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,850
truly present
no matter where you are I think once you

6476
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:46,860
no matter where you are I think once you
 

6477
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:49,729
no matter where you are I think once you
have that all dialed in then we may you

01:55:49,729 --> 01:55:49,739
have that all dialed in then we may you
 

6479
01:55:49,739 --> 01:55:51,169
have that all dialed in then we may you
know one day reach a point where it

6480
01:55:51,169 --> 01:55:51,179
know one day reach a point where it
 

6481
01:55:51,179 --> 01:55:52,850
know one day reach a point where it
really just doesn't matter as much where

6482
01:55:52,850 --> 01:55:52,860
really just doesn't matter as much where
 

6483
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:54,709
really just doesn't matter as much where
you are physically

6484
01:55:54,709 --> 01:55:54,719
you are physically
 

6485
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:55,490
you are physically
um

6486
01:55:55,490 --> 01:55:55,500
um
 

6487
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:58,910
um
but

6488
01:55:58,910 --> 01:55:58,920

 

6489
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:01,310

I don't know today it today it still

6490
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:01,320
I don't know today it today it still
 

6491
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,990
I don't know today it today it still
does right so

6492
01:56:02,990 --> 01:56:03,000
does right so
 

6493
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,209
does right so
yeah for people who there are all these

6494
01:56:05,209 --> 01:56:05,219
yeah for people who there are all these
 

6495
01:56:05,219 --> 01:56:07,729
yeah for people who there are all these
people who have special skills and want

6496
01:56:07,729 --> 01:56:07,739
people who have special skills and want
 

6497
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:08,810
people who have special skills and want
to live in a place where we don't have

6498
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:08,820
to live in a place where we don't have
 

6499
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,970
to live in a place where we don't have
an office or are we better off having

6500
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:10,980
an office or are we better off having
 

6501
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:13,010
an office or are we better off having
them in the company absolutely right and

company for several years and then you
 

6507
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,129
company for several years and then you
know build up the relationships

6508
01:56:19,129 --> 01:56:19,139
know build up the relationships
 

6509
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:20,750
know build up the relationships
internally

6510
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:20,760
internally
 

6511
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:21,830
internally
um

6512
01:56:21,830 --> 01:56:21,840
um
 

6513
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,570
um
and kind of have the trust and have a

6514
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:23,580
and kind of have the trust and have a
 

6515
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,310
and kind of have the trust and have a
sense of how the company Works can they

6516
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:25,320
sense of how the company Works can they
 

6517
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:26,930
sense of how the company Works can they
go work remotely now if they want and

6518
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:26,940
go work remotely now if they want and
 

6519
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:28,729
go work remotely now if they want and
still do it as effectively and we've

6520
01:56:28,729 --> 01:56:28,739
still do it as effectively and we've
 

6521
01:56:28,739 --> 01:56:30,050
still do it as effectively and we've
done all these studies that show it's

6522
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:30,060
done all these studies that show it's
 

6523
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:31,129
done all these studies that show it's
like okay does that affect their

6524
01:56:31,129 --> 01:56:31,139
like okay does that affect their
 

6525
01:56:31,139 --> 01:56:33,229
like okay does that affect their
performance it does not

6526
01:56:33,229 --> 01:56:33,239
performance it does not
 

6527
01:56:33,239 --> 01:56:35,930
performance it does not
um but you know for the new folks who

6528
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:35,940
um but you know for the new folks who
 

6529
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:37,490
um but you know for the new folks who
are joining

6530
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:37,500
are joining
 

6531
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,629
are joining
um and

6532
01:56:38,629 --> 01:56:38,639
um and
 

6533

for people who are earlier in their
career and you know need to learn how to

6536
01:56:42,109 --> 01:56:42,119
career and you know need to learn how to
 

6537
01:56:42,119 --> 01:56:43,609
career and you know need to learn how to
solve certain problems and need to get

6538
01:56:43,609 --> 01:56:43,619
solve certain problems and need to get
 

6539
01:56:43,619 --> 01:56:45,950
solve certain problems and need to get
ramped up on the culture

6540
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:45,960
ramped up on the culture
 

6541
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,770
ramped up on the culture
um you know when you're working through

6542
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:47,780
um you know when you're working through
 

6543
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:50,149
um you know when you're working through
really complicated problems where you

6544
01:56:50,149 --> 01:56:50,159
really complicated problems where you
 

6545
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:51,830
really complicated problems where you
don't just want to sit in the you don't

6546
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:51,840
don't just want to sit in the you don't
 

6547
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,149
don't just want to sit in the you don't
just want the formal meeting but you

6548
01:56:53,149 --> 01:56:53,159
just want the formal meeting but you
 

6549
01:56:53,159 --> 01:56:55,250
just want the formal meeting but you
want to be able to like brainstorm when

6550
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:55,260
want to be able to like brainstorm when
 

6551
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:56,390
want to be able to like brainstorm when
you're walking in the hallway together

6552
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:56,400
you're walking in the hallway together
 

6553
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,310
you're walking in the hallway together
after the meeting

6554
01:56:58,310 --> 01:56:58,320
after the meeting
 

6555
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,930
after the meeting
um I don't know it's like we just

6556
01:56:59,930 --> 01:56:59,940
um I don't know it's like we just
 

6557
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:01,430
um I don't know it's like we just
haven't replaced the

6558
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:01,440
haven't replaced the
 

6559
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:05,810
haven't replaced the
uh the the kind of in-person

6560
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:05,820

 

6561
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:08,270

Dynamics there yet with with anything

6562
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:08,280
Dynamics there yet with with anything
 

6563
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,669
Dynamics there yet with with anything
remote yet so yeah there's a magic to

6564
01:57:10,669 --> 01:57:10,679
remote yet so yeah there's a magic to
 

6565
01:57:10,679 --> 01:57:12,770
remote yet so yeah there's a magic to
the in person that uh we'll talk about

6566
01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:12,780
the in person that uh we'll talk about
 

6567
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:14,450
the in person that uh we'll talk about
this a little bit more but I'm really

6568
01:57:14,450 --> 01:57:14,460
this a little bit more but I'm really
 

6569
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:16,070
this a little bit more but I'm really
excited by the possibilities of the next

6570
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:16,080
excited by the possibilities of the next
 

6571
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,990
excited by the possibilities of the next
two years in virtual reality and mixed

6572
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:18,000
two years in virtual reality and mixed
 

6573
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,689
two years in virtual reality and mixed
reality that are possible with high

6574
01:57:20,689 --> 01:57:20,699
reality that are possible with high
 

6575
01:57:20,699 --> 01:57:23,689
reality that are possible with high
resolution scans I mean uh

6576
01:57:23,689 --> 01:57:23,699
resolution scans I mean uh
 

6577
01:57:23,699 --> 01:57:26,209
resolution scans I mean uh
I as a person who loves in-person

6578
01:57:26,209 --> 01:57:26,219
I as a person who loves in-person
 

6579
01:57:26,219 --> 01:57:28,729
I as a person who loves in-person
interaction like these podcasts in

6580
01:57:28,729 --> 01:57:28,739
interaction like these podcasts in
 

6581
01:57:28,739 --> 01:57:31,850
interaction like these podcasts in
person it would be incredible to achieve

6582
01:57:31,850 --> 01:57:31,860
person it would be incredible to achieve
 

6583
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:34,070
person it would be incredible to achieve
the level of realism I've gotten the

6584
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:34,080
the level of realism I've gotten the
 

6585
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,470
the level of realism I've gotten the
chance to witness but let me

6586
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:36,480
chance to witness but let me
 

6587
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:40,070
chance to witness but let me
ask about that yeah I got a chance to

6588
01:57:40,070 --> 01:57:40,080
ask about that yeah I got a chance to
 

6589
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:41,629
ask about that yeah I got a chance to
look at

6590
01:57:41,629 --> 01:57:41,639
look at
 

6591
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:44,030
look at
the quest 3 headset

6592
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:44,040
the quest 3 headset
 

6593
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:47,030
the quest 3 headset
and it is amazing

6594
01:57:47,030 --> 01:57:47,040
and it is amazing
 

6595
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,450
and it is amazing
um you've you've announced it

6596
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:49,460
um you've you've announced it
 

6597
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:52,310
um you've you've announced it
it's uh you'll get some more details in

6598
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:52,320

6599
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,350
it's uh you'll get some more details in
the fall maybe releasing the when is it

6600
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:54,360
the fall maybe releasing the when is it
 

6601
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,970
the fall maybe releasing the when is it
getting released again I forgot you you

6602
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:55,980
getting released again I forgot you you
 

6603
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,350
getting released again I forgot you you
mentioned we'll give more details to

mentioned we'll give more details to
connect okay but but it's coming it's

6606
01:57:58,550 --> 01:57:58,560
connect okay but but it's coming it's
 

6607
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,850
connect okay but but it's coming it's
coming this fall okay

coming this fall okay
 

6609
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:07,070
coming this fall okay
so uh it's uh priced at uh 4.99

6610
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:07,080
so uh it's uh priced at uh 4.99
 

6611
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,990
so uh it's uh priced at uh 4.99
what features are you most excited about

6612
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:09,000
what features are you most excited about
 

6613
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,970
what features are you most excited about
there they're basically two big new

6614
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:10,980
there they're basically two big new
 

6615
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:13,250
there they're basically two big new
things that we've added to Quest three a

6616
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:13,260
things that we've added to Quest three a
 

6617
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:15,890
things that we've added to Quest three a
request two the first is high resolution

6618
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:15,900
request two the first is high resolution
 

6619
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:18,229
request two the first is high resolution
mixed reality

6620
01:58:18,229 --> 01:58:18,239
mixed reality
 

6621
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:22,430
mixed reality
um and the the basic idea here is that

6622
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:22,440
um and the the basic idea here is that
 

6623
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,589
um and the the basic idea here is that
you can think about virtual reality as

6624
01:58:24,589 --> 01:58:24,599
you can think about virtual reality as
 

6625
01:58:24,599 --> 01:58:28,010
you can think about virtual reality as
you have the headset and like all the

6626
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:28,020
you have the headset and like all the
 

6627
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,689
you have the headset and like all the
pixels are virtual and you're basically

6628
01:58:29,689 --> 01:58:29,699
pixels are virtual and you're basically
 

6629
01:58:29,699 --> 01:58:32,030
pixels are virtual and you're basically
like immersed in a different world

6630
01:58:32,030 --> 01:58:32,040
like immersed in a different world
 

6631
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,850
like immersed in a different world
mixed reality is where you see the

6632
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:34,860
mixed reality is where you see the
 

6633
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:36,169
mixed reality is where you see the
physical world around you and you can

6634
01:58:36,169 --> 01:58:36,179
physical world around you and you can
 

6635
01:58:36,179 --> 01:58:37,669
physical world around you and you can
place virtual objects in it whether

6636
01:58:37,669 --> 01:58:37,679
place virtual objects in it whether
 

6637
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:40,010
place virtual objects in it whether
that's a screen to watch a movie

6638
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:40,020
that's a screen to watch a movie
 

6639
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:42,010
that's a screen to watch a movie
or a projection of your virtual desktop

6640
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,020
or a projection of your virtual desktop
 

6641
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:44,450
or a projection of your virtual desktop
or you're playing a game where like

6642
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:44,460
or you're playing a game where like
 

6643
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:45,830
or you're playing a game where like
zombies are coming out through the wall

6644
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:45,840
zombies are coming out through the wall
 

6645
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,510
zombies are coming out through the wall
and you need to shoot them

6646
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:47,520
and you need to shoot them
 

6647
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,950
and you need to shoot them
um or you know we're you know we're

6648
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:48,960
um or you know we're you know we're
 

6649
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,390
um or you know we're you know we're
playing Dungeons and Dragons or some

6650
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:50,400
playing Dungeons and Dragons or some
 

6651
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,830
playing Dungeons and Dragons or some
board game and we just have a virtual

6652
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:51,840
board game and we just have a virtual
 

6653
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,330
board game and we just have a virtual
version of the board in front of us

6654
01:58:53,330 --> 01:58:53,340
version of the board in front of us
 

6655
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:55,070
version of the board in front of us
while we're sitting here

6656
01:58:55,070 --> 01:58:55,080
while we're sitting here
 

6657
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:57,410
while we're sitting here
um all that's possible in mixed reality

6658
01:58:57,410 --> 01:58:57,420
um all that's possible in mixed reality
 

6659
01:58:57,420 --> 01:59:00,109
um all that's possible in mixed reality
and I think that that is going to be the

6660
01:59:00,109 --> 01:59:00,119
and I think that that is going to be the
 

6661
01:59:00,119 --> 01:59:01,910
and I think that that is going to be the
next big capability on top of virtual

6662
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:01,920
next big capability on top of virtual
 

6663
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,890
next big capability on top of virtual
reality it is done

6664
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:03,900
reality it is done
 

6665
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:07,310
reality it is done
so well I have to say as a person who

6666
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:07,320
so well I have to say as a person who
 

6667
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:10,669
so well I have to say as a person who
experienced it today with zombies having

6668
01:59:10,669 --> 01:59:10,679
experienced it today with zombies having
 

6669
01:59:10,679 --> 01:59:14,030
experienced it today with zombies having
a full awareness of the environment and

6670
01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:14,040
a full awareness of the environment and
 

6671
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,010
a full awareness of the environment and
integrating that environment in the way

6672
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:16,020
integrating that environment in the way
 

6673
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:17,689
integrating that environment in the way
they run at you while they try to kill

6674
01:59:17,689 --> 01:59:17,699
they run at you while they try to kill
 

6675
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:20,209
they run at you while they try to kill
you so it's uh it's just the mixed

6676
01:59:20,209 --> 01:59:20,219
you so it's uh it's just the mixed
 

6677
01:59:20,219 --> 01:59:21,890
you so it's uh it's just the mixed
reality the pass-through is really

6678
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:21,900
reality the pass-through is really
 

6679
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:24,169
reality the pass-through is really
really really well done and the fact

6680
01:59:24,169 --> 01:59:24,179
really really well done and the fact
 

6681
01:59:24,179 --> 01:59:27,410
really really well done and the fact
that it's only 500 is really it's uh

6682
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:27,420
that it's only 500 is really it's uh
 

6683
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:29,990
that it's only 500 is really it's uh
well done thank you I mean I'm I'm super

well done thank you I mean I'm I'm super
excited about it I mean our

6686
01:59:31,850 --> 01:59:31,860
excited about it I mean our
 

6687
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:36,950
excited about it I mean our
and we put a lot of work into making

6688
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:36,960
and we put a lot of work into making
 

6689
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,470
and we put a lot of work into making
the device both as good as possible and

6690
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:39,480
the device both as good as possible and
 

6691
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:41,270
the device both as good as possible and
as affordable as possible because a big

6692
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:41,280
as affordable as possible because a big
 

6693
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,609
as affordable as possible because a big
part of our mission and Ethos here is we

6694
01:59:43,609 --> 01:59:43,619
part of our mission and Ethos here is we
 

6695
01:59:43,619 --> 01:59:45,770
part of our mission and Ethos here is we
we want people to be able to connect

6696
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:45,780
we want people to be able to connect
 

6697
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:47,870
we want people to be able to connect
with each other we want to reach and we

6698
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:47,880
with each other we want to reach and we

want to serve a lot of people right we
want to bring this technology to to

6702
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:51,060
want to bring this technology to to
 

6703
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:52,609
want to bring this technology to to
everyone right so we're not just trying

6704
01:59:52,609 --> 01:59:52,619
everyone right so we're not just trying

like a you know an elite a wealthy crowd

6708
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:57,540
like a you know an elite a wealthy crowd
 

6709
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:59,390
like a you know an elite a wealthy crowd
we we want to

6710
01:59:59,390 --> 01:59:59,400
we we want to
 

6711
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,189
we we want to
um we really want this to be accessible

6712
02:00:01,189 --> 02:00:01,199
um we really want this to be accessible
 

6713
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:03,950
um we really want this to be accessible
so that that is in a lot of ways an

6714
02:00:03,950 --> 02:00:03,960
so that that is in a lot of ways an
 

6715
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,689
so that that is in a lot of ways an
extremely hard technical problem because

6716
02:00:05,689 --> 02:00:05,699
extremely hard technical problem because
 

6717
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:08,209
extremely hard technical problem because
you know we don't just have the ability

6718
02:00:08,209 --> 02:00:08,219
you know we don't just have the ability
 

6719
02:00:08,219 --> 02:00:10,430
you know we don't just have the ability
to put an unlimited amount of hardware

6720
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:10,440
to put an unlimited amount of hardware
 

6721
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:11,930
to put an unlimited amount of hardware
and thus we needed to basically deliver

6722
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:11,940
and thus we needed to basically deliver
 

6723
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:14,990
and thus we needed to basically deliver
something that works really well but in

6724
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:15,000
something that works really well but in
 

6725
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,669
something that works really well but in
an affordable package and we started

6726
02:00:16,669 --> 02:00:16,679
an affordable package and we started
 

6727
02:00:16,679 --> 02:00:19,550
an affordable package and we started
with Quest Pro last year it was um

6728
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:19,560
with Quest Pro last year it was um
 

6729
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:21,649
with Quest Pro last year it was um
so it's it's it was fifteen hundred

6730
02:00:21,649 --> 02:00:21,659
so it's it's it was fifteen hundred
 

6731
02:00:21,659 --> 02:00:23,030
so it's it's it was fifteen hundred
dollars

6732
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:23,040
dollars
 

6733
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,770
dollars
um and now we've we've lowered the price

6734
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:24,780
um and now we've we've lowered the price
 

6735
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:26,689
um and now we've we've lowered the price
to a thousand but in a lot of ways the

6736
02:00:26,689 --> 02:00:26,699
to a thousand but in a lot of ways the
 

6737
02:00:26,699 --> 02:00:30,350
to a thousand but in a lot of ways the
mixed reality in quest 3 is it even even

6738
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:30,360
mixed reality in quest 3 is it even even
 

6739
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:32,030
mixed reality in quest 3 is it even even
better and more advanced level than what

6740
02:00:32,030 --> 02:00:32,040
better and more advanced level than what
 

6741
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:33,830
better and more advanced level than what
we were able to deliver in quest Pro so

6742
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:33,840
we were able to deliver in quest Pro so
 

6743
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:36,050
we were able to deliver in quest Pro so
I'm really proud of where we are with

6744
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:36,060
I'm really proud of where we are with
 

6745
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:38,629
I'm really proud of where we are with
with um with Quest 3 on that it's gonna

6746
02:00:38,629 --> 02:00:38,639
with um with Quest 3 on that it's gonna
 

6747
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:40,250
with um with Quest 3 on that it's gonna
work with all of the virtual reality

6748
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:40,260
work with all of the virtual reality
 

6749
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,709
work with all of the virtual reality
titles and everything that that existed

6750
02:00:42,709 --> 02:00:42,719
titles and everything that that existed
 

6751
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:44,390
titles and everything that that existed
there so people who want to play fully

6752
02:00:44,390 --> 02:00:44,400
there so people who want to play fully
 

6753
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,370
there so people who want to play fully
immersive Games Social experiences

6754

immersive Games Social experiences
 

6755
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,950
immersive Games Social experiences
Fitness all that stuff will will work

6756
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:48,960
Fitness all that stuff will will work
 

6757
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,930
Fitness all that stuff will will work
but now you'll also get mixed reality

6758
02:00:50,930 --> 02:00:50,940
but now you'll also get mixed reality
 

6759
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:52,250
but now you'll also get mixed reality
too

6760
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:52,260
too
 

6761

it's um sometimes you want to be super
 

6767
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:00,169
it's um sometimes you want to be super
immersed in a game but a lot of the time

6768
02:01:00,169 --> 02:01:00,179
immersed in a game but a lot of the time
 

6769
02:01:00,179 --> 02:01:02,030
immersed in a game but a lot of the time
especially when you're moving around if

around you so that way you know that

6782
02:01:12,050 --> 02:01:12,060
around you so that way you know that
 

6783

fun of you if they're anything like
friends of mine and then just it yeah it

6822
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:49,560
friends of mine and then just it yeah it
 

6823
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:52,970
friends of mine and then just it yeah it
it it it's really

6824
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:52,980
it it it's really
 

6825
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:55,550
it it it's really
it's a really compelling experience I

6826
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:55,560
it's a really compelling experience I
 

6827
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,290
it's a really compelling experience I
mean VR is really interesting too but

6828
02:01:57,290 --> 02:01:57,300
mean VR is really interesting too but
 

6829
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:59,330
mean VR is really interesting too but
this is something else almost this is

6830
02:01:59,330 --> 02:01:59,340
this is something else almost this is
 

6831
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:01,430
this is something else almost this is
this is because integrated into your

6832
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:01,440
this is because integrated into your
 

6833
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,410
this is because integrated into your
life into your world

6834
02:02:03,410 --> 02:02:03,420
life into your world
 

6835
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:06,229
life into your world
yeah and it so I think it's a completely

6836
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,239
yeah and it so I think it's a completely
 

6837
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:08,089
yeah and it so I think it's a completely
new capability that will unlock a lot of

6838
02:02:08,089 --> 02:02:08,099
new capability that will unlock a lot of
 

6839
02:02:08,099 --> 02:02:10,669
new capability that will unlock a lot of
different content and I think it'll also

6840
02:02:10,669 --> 02:02:10,679
different content and I think it'll also
 

6841
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:11,930
different content and I think it'll also
just make the experience more

6842
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:11,940
just make the experience more
 

6843
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:13,490
just make the experience more
comfortable for a set of people who

6844
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:13,500
comfortable for a set of people who
 

6845
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,310
comfortable for a set of people who
didn't want to have only fully immersive

6846
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:16,320
didn't want to have only fully immersive
 

6847
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:17,510
didn't want to have only fully immersive
experiences I think if you want

6848
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:17,520
experiences I think if you want
 

6849
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,490
experiences I think if you want
experiences where you're grounded in you

6850
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:19,500
experiences where you're grounded in you
 

6851
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,510
experiences where you're grounded in you
know your living room in the physical

6852
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:20,520
know your living room in the physical
 

6853
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:22,430
know your living room in the physical
world around you now you'll be able to

6854
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:22,440
world around you now you'll be able to
 

6855
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:23,570
world around you now you'll be able to
have that too

6856
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:23,580
have that too
 

6857
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:25,010
have that too
and I think that that's pretty exciting

6858
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:25,020
and I think that that's pretty exciting
 

6859
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:29,030
and I think that that's pretty exciting
I really liked how it added Windows to a

6860
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,040
I really liked how it added Windows to a
 

6861
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,790
I really liked how it added Windows to a
room with no windows yeah me as a person

6862
02:02:31,790 --> 02:02:31,800
room with no windows yeah me as a person
 

6863
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,290
room with no windows yeah me as a person
you see the aquarium one where you could

6864
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:33,300
you see the aquarium one where you could
 

6865
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:34,970
you see the aquarium one where you could
see the shark swim up or was that just

6866
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:34,980
see the shark swim up or was that just
 

6867
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:37,310
see the shark swim up or was that just
the zombie one yeah but it's still you

6868
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:37,320
the zombie one yeah but it's still you
 

6869
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:38,450
the zombie one yeah but it's still you
know you don't you don't necessarily

6870
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:38,460
know you don't you don't necessarily
 

6871
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:40,010
know you don't you don't necessarily
want Windows added to your living room

6872
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:40,020
want Windows added to your living room
 

6873
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:42,770
want Windows added to your living room
where Zombies come out of but yeah that

6874
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:42,780
where Zombies come out of but yeah that
 

6875
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:44,689
where Zombies come out of but yeah that
game it's yeah yeah yeah I enjoyed it

6876
02:02:44,689 --> 02:02:44,699
game it's yeah yeah yeah I enjoyed it
 

6877
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:47,330
game it's yeah yeah yeah I enjoyed it
because you could see the nature outside

6878
02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:47,340
because you could see the nature outside
 

6879
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:49,490
because you could see the nature outside
and uh me as a person that doesn't have

6880
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:49,500
and uh me as a person that doesn't have
 

6881
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:51,649
and uh me as a person that doesn't have
Windows it's just nice to have nature

6882
02:02:51,649 --> 02:02:51,659
Windows it's just nice to have nature
 

6883
02:02:51,659 --> 02:02:55,609
Windows it's just nice to have nature
yeah well if even if it's a mixed

6884
02:02:55,609 --> 02:02:55,619
yeah well if even if it's a mixed
 

6885
02:02:55,619 --> 02:02:57,950
yeah well if even if it's a mixed
reality setting it was it's cut like

6886
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:57,960
reality setting it was it's cut like
 

6887
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:59,570
reality setting it was it's cut like
there was a I know it's a zombie game

6888
02:02:59,570 --> 02:02:59,580
there was a I know it's a zombie game
 

6889
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:02,629
there was a I know it's a zombie game
but there's a Zen nature Zen aspect to

6890
02:03:02,629 --> 02:03:02,639
but there's a Zen nature Zen aspect to
 

6891
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:04,729
but there's a Zen nature Zen aspect to
being able to look outside and alter

6892
02:03:04,729 --> 02:03:04,739
being able to look outside and alter
 

6893
02:03:04,739 --> 02:03:08,149
being able to look outside and alter
your environment as you know it

6894
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
your environment as you know it
 

6895
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,189
your environment as you know it
yeah in um

6896
02:03:10,189 --> 02:03:10,199
yeah in um
 

6897
02:03:10,199 --> 02:03:11,810
yeah in um
there will probably be better more Zen

6898
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:11,820
there will probably be better more Zen
 

6899
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:13,250
there will probably be better more Zen
ways to do that than this is the game

6900
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:13,260
ways to do that than this is the game
 

6901
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:14,689
ways to do that than this is the game
you're describing but you're right that

6902
02:03:14,689 --> 02:03:14,699
you're describing but you're right that
 

6903
02:03:14,699 --> 02:03:17,810
you're describing but you're right that
the the basic idea of of sort of having

6904
02:03:17,810 --> 02:03:17,820
the the basic idea of of sort of having
 

6905
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:19,790
the the basic idea of of sort of having
your physical environment on

6906
02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:19,800
your physical environment on
 

6907
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,770
your physical environment on
pass-through but then being able to

6908
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:21,780
pass-through but then being able to
 

6909
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:22,970
pass-through but then being able to
bring in

6910
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:22,980
bring in
 

6911
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:24,709
bring in
different elements

6912
02:03:24,709 --> 02:03:24,719
different elements
 

6913
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:26,689
different elements
extern I mean it's I think it's going to

6914
02:03:26,689 --> 02:03:26,699
extern I mean it's I think it's going to
 

6915
02:03:26,699 --> 02:03:29,390
extern I mean it's I think it's going to
be super powerful and in some ways I

6916
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:29,400
be super powerful and in some ways I
 

6917
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:30,530
be super powerful and in some ways I
think that these are

6918
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:30,540
think that these are
 

6919
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:32,930
think that these are
mixed reality is also a predecessor to

6920
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:32,940
mixed reality is also a predecessor to
 

6921
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:35,270
mixed reality is also a predecessor to
eventually we will get AR glasses that

6922
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:35,280
eventually we will get AR glasses that
 

6923
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,430
eventually we will get AR glasses that
are not kind of the goggles form factor

6924
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:37,440
are not kind of the goggles form factor
 

6925
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,129
are not kind of the goggles form factor
of the current generation of of headsets

6926
02:03:40,129 --> 02:03:40,139
of the current generation of of headsets
 

6927
02:03:40,139 --> 02:03:42,350
of the current generation of of headsets
that that people are making

6928
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:42,360
that that people are making
 

6929
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:43,970
that that people are making
um but I think a lot of the experiences

6930
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:43,980
um but I think a lot of the experiences
 

6931
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,950
um but I think a lot of the experiences
that developers are making for mixed

6932
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:45,960
that developers are making for mixed
 

6933
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,629
that developers are making for mixed
reality of basically you just have a

6934
02:03:47,629 --> 02:03:47,639
reality of basically you just have a
 

6935
02:03:47,639 --> 02:03:49,129
reality of basically you just have a
kind of a hologram that you're putting

6936
02:03:49,129 --> 02:03:49,139
kind of a hologram that you're putting
 

6937
02:03:49,139 --> 02:03:51,109
kind of a hologram that you're putting
in the world will hopefully apply once

6938
02:03:51,109 --> 02:03:51,119
in the world will hopefully apply once
 

6939
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:53,689
in the world will hopefully apply once
we once we get the the air glasses too

6940
02:03:53,689 --> 02:03:53,699
we once we get the the air glasses too
 

6941
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:55,189
we once we get the the air glasses too
now that's got its own whole set of

6942
02:03:55,189 --> 02:03:55,199
now that's got its own whole set of
 

6943
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:57,470
now that's got its own whole set of
challenges and it's um well the headset

6944
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:57,480
challenges and it's um well the headset

a chance to play with it yet so so so
 

6999
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,970
a chance to play with it yet so so so
kind of take everything with a grain of

kind of take everything with a grain of
 

7001
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:59,270
kind of take everything with a grain of
salt but a few high-level thoughts I

7002
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
salt but a few high-level thoughts I
 

7003
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,830
salt but a few high-level thoughts I
mean first

7004
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:00,840
mean first
 

7005
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:02,209
mean first
um

7006
02:05:02,209 --> 02:05:02,219
um
 

7007
02:05:02,219 --> 02:05:05,330
um
you know I do think that this is

7008
02:05:05,330 --> 02:05:05,340
you know I do think that this is
 

7009
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:08,570
you know I do think that this is
a certain level of validation for

7010
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:08,580
a certain level of validation for
 

7011
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:10,910
a certain level of validation for
the category right where you know when

7012
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:10,920
the category right where you know when
 

7013
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,290
the category right where you know when
we were the

7014
02:05:12,290 --> 02:05:12,300
we were the
 

7015
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:14,450
we were the
primary folks out there before saying

7016
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:14,460
primary folks out there before saying
 

7017
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:17,270
primary folks out there before saying
hey I think that this you know virtual

reality augmented reality mixed reality

7020
02:05:19,070 --> 02:05:19,080
reality augmented reality mixed reality
 

7021
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,570

this is going to be a big part of the

7022
02:05:20,570 --> 02:05:20,580
this is going to be a big part of the
 

7023
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:22,790
this is going to be a big part of the
next Computing platform

02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:22,800
next Computing platform
 

7025
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:26,330
next Computing platform
um I think having Apple come in

7026
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:26,340
um I think having Apple come in
 

7027
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:29,570
um I think having Apple come in
and share that vision

7028
02:05:29,570 --> 02:05:29,580
and share that vision
 

7029
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:31,250
and share that vision
um

7030
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:31,260
um
 

7031
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:33,290
um
will make a lot of people who are fans

7032
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:33,300
will make a lot of people who are fans
 

7033
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:35,209
will make a lot of people who are fans
of their products

7034
02:05:35,209 --> 02:05:35,219
of their products
 

7035
02:05:35,219 --> 02:05:37,370
of their products
um really consider that

7036
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:37,380
um really consider that
 

7037
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:38,930
um really consider that
um and then

7038
02:05:38,930 --> 02:05:38,940
um and then
 

7039
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:42,589
um and then
you know of course the the 3 500 price

7040
02:05:42,589 --> 02:05:42,599
you know of course the the 3 500 price
 

7041
02:05:42,599 --> 02:05:43,370
you know of course the the 3 500 price
um

7042
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:43,380
um
 

7043
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:45,290
um
you know on the one hand I get it for

7044
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:45,300
you know on the one hand I get it for
 

7045
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:46,310
you know on the one hand I get it for
with all the stuff that they're trying

7046
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:46,320
with all the stuff that they're trying
 

7047
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:47,990
with all the stuff that they're trying
to pack in there on the other hand a lot

7048
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:48,000
to pack in there on the other hand a lot
 

7049
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,910
to pack in there on the other hand a lot
of people aren't going to find that to

7050
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:49,920
of people aren't going to find that to
 

7051
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,050
of people aren't going to find that to
be affordable

7052
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:51,060
be affordable
 

7053
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:53,149
be affordable
so I think there's a chance that that

7054
02:05:53,149 --> 02:05:53,159
so I think there's a chance that that
 

7055
02:05:53,159 --> 02:05:55,750
so I think there's a chance that that
them coming in actually increases demand

7056
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:55,760
them coming in actually increases demand
 

7057
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:58,850
them coming in actually increases demand
for the overall space and that Quest 3

7058
02:05:58,850 --> 02:05:58,860
for the overall space and that Quest 3
 

7059
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:00,830
for the overall space and that Quest 3
is actually the primary beneficiary of

7060
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:00,840
is actually the primary beneficiary of
 

7061
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:02,990
is actually the primary beneficiary of
that because a lot of the people who

7062
02:06:02,990 --> 02:06:03,000
that because a lot of the people who
 

7063
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,530
that because a lot of the people who
might say Hey you know this I think I'm

7064
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:06,540
might say Hey you know this I think I'm
 

7065
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,030
might say Hey you know this I think I'm
going to give another consideration to

7066
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:08,040
going to give another consideration to
 

7067
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:10,310
going to give another consideration to
this or you know now I understand maybe

7068
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:10,320
this or you know now I understand maybe
 

7069
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,589
this or you know now I understand maybe
what mixed reality is more and in quest

7070
02:06:12,589 --> 02:06:12,599
what mixed reality is more and in quest
 

7071
02:06:12,599 --> 02:06:14,870
what mixed reality is more and in quest
3 is the best one on the market that I

7072
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:14,880
3 is the best one on the market that I
 

7073
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,729
3 is the best one on the market that I
can that I can afford

7074
02:06:16,729 --> 02:06:16,739
can that I can afford
 

7075
02:06:16,739 --> 02:06:18,589
can that I can afford
um and it's great also right it's I

7076
02:06:18,589 --> 02:06:18,599
um and it's great also right it's I
 

7077
02:06:18,599 --> 02:06:20,750
um and it's great also right it's I
think that that's um and you know in our

7078
02:06:20,750 --> 02:06:20,760
think that that's um and you know in our
 

7079
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,430
think that that's um and you know in our
own way I think where there are a lot of

7080
02:06:22,430 --> 02:06:22,440
own way I think where there are a lot of
 

7081
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,570
own way I think where there are a lot of
features that we have where we're

7082
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:23,580
features that we have where we're
 

7083
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:24,890
features that we have where we're
leading on

7084
02:06:24,890 --> 02:06:24,900
leading on
 

7085
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,470
leading on
um so I think that that's that that I

7086
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:27,480
um so I think that that's that that I
 

7087
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:28,910
um so I think that that's that that I
think is going to be a very

7088
02:06:28,910 --> 02:06:28,920
think is going to be a very
 

7089
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:30,830
think is going to be a very
that could be quite good

7090
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:30,840
that could be quite good
 

7091
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:31,790
that could be quite good
um

7092
02:06:31,790 --> 02:06:31,800
um
 

7093
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,410
um
and then obviously over time the

7094
02:06:33,410 --> 02:06:33,420
and then obviously over time the
 

7095
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:35,330
and then obviously over time the
companies are just focused on

7096
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:35,340
companies are just focused on
 

7097
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,550
companies are just focused on
somewhat different things Red Apple has

7098
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:37,560
somewhat different things Red Apple has
 

7099
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:39,050
somewhat different things Red Apple has
always

7100
02:06:39,050 --> 02:06:39,060
always
 

7101
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:42,129
always
um you know I think focused on building

7102
02:06:42,129 --> 02:06:42,139
um you know I think focused on building
 

7103
02:06:42,139 --> 02:06:46,070
um you know I think focused on building
really kind of high-end things whereas

7104
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:46,080
really kind of high-end things whereas
 

7105
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:50,149
really kind of high-end things whereas
our Focus has been on it's it's just a

7106
02:06:50,149 --> 02:06:50,159
our Focus has been on it's it's just a
 

7107
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:51,890
our Focus has been on it's it's just a
we have a more democratic ethos we want

7108
02:06:51,890 --> 02:06:51,900
we have a more democratic ethos we want
 

7109
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:54,350
we have a more democratic ethos we want
to build things that are accessible to a

7110
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:54,360
to build things that are accessible to a
 

7111
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:56,149
to build things that are accessible to a
wider number of people

7112
02:06:56,149 --> 02:06:56,159
wider number of people
 

7113
02:06:56,159 --> 02:06:58,669
wider number of people
um you know we've sold tens of millions

7114
02:06:58,669 --> 02:06:58,679
um you know we've sold tens of millions
 

7115
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:01,129
um you know we've sold tens of millions
of quest devices

7116
02:07:01,129 --> 02:07:01,139
of quest devices
 

7117
02:07:01,139 --> 02:07:02,450
of quest devices
um

7118
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:02,460
um
 

7119
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:05,209
um
my understanding just based on rumors I

7120
02:07:05,209 --> 02:07:05,219
my understanding just based on rumors I
 

7121
02:07:05,219 --> 02:07:06,350
my understanding just based on rumors I
don't have any special knowledge on this

7122
02:07:06,350 --> 02:07:06,360
don't have any special knowledge on this
 

7123
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:08,209
don't have any special knowledge on this
is that apple is building about 1

7124
02:07:08,209 --> 02:07:08,219
is that apple is building about 1
 

7125
02:07:08,219 --> 02:07:10,669
is that apple is building about 1
million of their of their device right

7126
02:07:10,669 --> 02:07:10,679
million of their of their device right
 

7127
02:07:10,679 --> 02:07:13,010
million of their of their device right
so just in terms of like what you kind

7128
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:13,020
so just in terms of like what you kind
 

7129
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:15,950
so just in terms of like what you kind
of expect in terms of sales numbers

7130
02:07:15,950 --> 02:07:15,960
of expect in terms of sales numbers
 

7131
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:18,649
of expect in terms of sales numbers
um I I just think that this is

7132
02:07:18,649 --> 02:07:18,659
um I I just think that this is
 

7133
02:07:18,659 --> 02:07:21,350
um I I just think that this is
I mean Quest is is going to be the

7134
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:21,360
I mean Quest is is going to be the
 

7135
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,990
I mean Quest is is going to be the
primary thing that people in in the

7136
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:24,000
primary thing that people in in the
 

7137
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,370
primary thing that people in in the
market will continue using for the

7138
02:07:25,370 --> 02:07:25,380
market will continue using for the
 

7139
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:26,510
market will continue using for the
foreseeable future and then obviously

7140
02:07:26,510 --> 02:07:26,520
foreseeable future and then obviously
 

7141
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:28,010
foreseeable future and then obviously
over the long term it's up to the

7142
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:28,020
over the long term it's up to the
 

7143
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:29,510
over the long term it's up to the
companies to see how how well we each

7144
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:29,520
companies to see how how well we each
 

7145
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:30,770
companies to see how how well we each
executed the different things that we're

7146
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:30,780
executed the different things that we're
 

7147
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:32,510
executed the different things that we're
doing but we kind of commented from

7148
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:32,520
doing but we kind of commented from
 

7149
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,129
doing but we kind of commented from
different places we're very focused on

7150
02:07:34,129 --> 02:07:34,139
different places we're very focused on
 

7151
02:07:34,139 --> 02:07:38,149
different places we're very focused on
social interaction communication

7152
02:07:38,149 --> 02:07:38,159
social interaction communication
 

7153
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:39,229
social interaction communication
um

7154
02:07:39,229 --> 02:07:39,239
um
 

7155
02:07:39,239 --> 02:07:41,570
um
being more active right so Fitness

7156
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:41,580
being more active right so Fitness
 

7157
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:44,750
being more active right so Fitness
there's gaming there are those things

7158
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:44,760
there's gaming there are those things
 

7159
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,370
there's gaming there are those things
um you know whereas I think a lot of the

7160
02:07:46,370 --> 02:07:46,380
um you know whereas I think a lot of the
 

7161
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:48,770
um you know whereas I think a lot of the
use cases that you saw in

7162
02:07:48,770 --> 02:07:48,780
use cases that you saw in
 

7163
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:51,109
use cases that you saw in
um in in Apple's launch material were

7164
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:51,119
um in in Apple's launch material were
 

7165
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:53,629
um in in Apple's launch material were
more around you know people sitting

7166
02:07:53,629 --> 02:07:53,639
more around you know people sitting
 

7167
02:07:53,639 --> 02:07:56,330
more around you know people sitting
um you know people looking at screens

7168
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:56,340
um you know people looking at screens
 

7169
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:57,890
um you know people looking at screens
um which are great I think that you will

7170
02:07:57,890 --> 02:07:57,900
um which are great I think that you will
 

7171
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:59,870
um which are great I think that you will
replace your laptop over time with with

7172
02:07:59,870 --> 02:07:59,880
replace your laptop over time with with
 

7173
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,209
replace your laptop over time with with
a with a headset but um but I think in

7174
02:08:02,209 --> 02:08:02,219
a with a headset but um but I think in
 

7175
02:08:02,219 --> 02:08:04,430
a with a headset but um but I think in
terms of kind of how the different use

7176
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:04,440
terms of kind of how the different use
 

7177
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,950
terms of kind of how the different use
cases that the companies are going after

7178
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:06,960
cases that the companies are going after
 

7179
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,629
cases that the companies are going after
um and they're they're they're a bit

7180
02:08:08,629 --> 02:08:08,639
um and they're they're they're a bit
 

7181
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:10,370
um and they're they're they're a bit
different for for where we are right now

7182
02:08:10,370 --> 02:08:10,380
different for for where we are right now
 

7183
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:12,950
different for for where we are right now
yeah so they're gaming wasn't a big part

7184
02:08:12,950 --> 02:08:12,960
yeah so they're gaming wasn't a big part
 

7185
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,330
yeah so they're gaming wasn't a big part
of the presentation which is an

7186
02:08:14,330 --> 02:08:14,340
of the presentation which is an
 

7187
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:16,189
of the presentation which is an
interesting

7188
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:16,199
interesting
 

7189
02:08:16,199 --> 02:08:20,030
interesting
it feels like mixed reality gaming such

7190
02:08:20,030 --> 02:08:20,040
it feels like mixed reality gaming such
 

7191
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:21,470
it feels like mixed reality gaming such
a big part of that

7192
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:21,480
a big part of that
 

7193
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:23,870
a big part of that
it was interesting to see it missing in

7194
02:08:23,870 --> 02:08:23,880
it was interesting to see it missing in
 

7195
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:25,129
it was interesting to see it missing in
the presentation well well I mean look

7196
02:08:25,129 --> 02:08:25,139
the presentation well well I mean look
 

7197
02:08:25,139 --> 02:08:27,410
the presentation well well I mean look
there are certain design trade-offs in

7198
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:27,420
there are certain design trade-offs in
 

7199
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:29,390
there are certain design trade-offs in
this where

7200
02:08:29,390 --> 02:08:29,400
this where
 

7201
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:31,490
this where
you know they I think they made this

7202
02:08:31,490 --> 02:08:31,500
you know they I think they made this
 

7203
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:32,870
you know they I think they made this
point about not wanting to have

7204
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:32,880
point about not wanting to have
 

7205
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,209
point about not wanting to have
controllers which on the one hand

7206
02:08:35,209 --> 02:08:35,219
controllers which on the one hand
 

7207
02:08:35,219 --> 02:08:36,830
controllers which on the one hand
there's a certain Elegance about just

7208
02:08:36,830 --> 02:08:36,840
there's a certain Elegance about just
 

7209
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:39,229
there's a certain Elegance about just
being able to navigate the system with

7210
02:08:39,229 --> 02:08:39,239
being able to navigate the system with
 

7211
02:08:39,239 --> 02:08:41,990
being able to navigate the system with
eye gaze and hand tracking and by the

7212
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:42,000
eye gaze and hand tracking and by the
 

7213
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,430
eye gaze and hand tracking and by the
way you'll be able to just navigate

7214
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:43,440
way you'll be able to just navigate
 

7215
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,290
way you'll be able to just navigate
quest with your hands too if that's what

7216
02:08:45,290 --> 02:08:45,300
quest with your hands too if that's what
 

7217
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,430
quest with your hands too if that's what
you want

7218
02:08:46,430 --> 02:08:46,440
you want
 

7219
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:47,689
you want
um yeah one of the things I should

7220
02:08:47,689 --> 02:08:47,699
um yeah one of the things I should
 

7221
02:08:47,699 --> 02:08:51,229
um yeah one of the things I should
mention is that the the capability from

7222
02:08:51,229 --> 02:08:51,239
mention is that the the capability from
 

7223
02:08:51,239 --> 02:08:54,050
mention is that the the capability from
the cameras to uh with computer vision

7224
02:08:54,050 --> 02:08:54,060
the cameras to uh with computer vision
 

7225
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:55,850
the cameras to uh with computer vision
to detect certain aspects of the hand

7226
02:08:55,850 --> 02:08:55,860
to detect certain aspects of the hand
 

7227
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:57,530
to detect certain aspects of the hand
allowing you to have a controller that

7228
02:08:57,530 --> 02:08:57,540
allowing you to have a controller that
 

7229
02:08:57,540 --> 02:08:59,390
allowing you to have a controller that
doesn't have that ring thing yeah like

7230
02:08:59,390 --> 02:08:59,400
doesn't have that ring thing yeah like
 

7231
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:01,490
doesn't have that ring thing yeah like
the hand tracking in in quest three and

7232
02:09:01,490 --> 02:09:01,500
the hand tracking in in quest three and
 

7233
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:03,709
the hand tracking in in quest three and
the usual tracking is is a big step up

7234
02:09:03,709 --> 02:09:03,719
the usual tracking is is a big step up
 

7235
02:09:03,719 --> 02:09:06,410
the usual tracking is is a big step up
from from the last generation

7236
02:09:06,410 --> 02:09:06,420
from from the last generation
 

7237
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:07,129
from from the last generation
um

7238
02:09:07,129 --> 02:09:07,139
um
 

7239
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:08,810
um
and one of the demos that we have is

7240
02:09:08,810 --> 02:09:08,820
and one of the demos that we have is
 

7241
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:11,330
and one of the demos that we have is
basically an MR experience teaching you

7242
02:09:11,330 --> 02:09:11,340
basically an MR experience teaching you
 

7243
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:12,890
basically an MR experience teaching you
how to play piano where it basically

7244
02:09:12,890 --> 02:09:12,900
how to play piano where it basically
 

7245
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:14,149
how to play piano where it basically
highlights the notes that you need to

7246
02:09:14,149 --> 02:09:14,159
highlights the notes that you need to
 

7247
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:15,830
highlights the notes that you need to
play and it's like just all its hands

7248
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:15,840
play and it's like just all its hands
 

7249
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:18,050
play and it's like just all its hands
it's no controllers but

7250
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:18,060
it's no controllers but
 

7251
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:20,270
it's no controllers but
I think if you care about gaming

7252
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:20,280
I think if you care about gaming
 

7253
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:21,770
I think if you care about gaming
having

7254
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:21,780
having
 

7255
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:23,330
having
um a controller

7256
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:23,340
um a controller
 

7257
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:25,490
um a controller
allows you to have a more tactile feel

7258
02:09:25,490 --> 02:09:25,500
allows you to have a more tactile feel
 

7259
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:28,370
allows you to have a more tactile feel
and allows you to capture

7260
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:28,380
and allows you to capture
 

7261
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:31,430
and allows you to capture
fine motor movement much more precisely

7262
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:31,440
fine motor movement much more precisely
 

7263
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,050
fine motor movement much more precisely
than

7264
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:33,060
than
 

7265
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:34,550
than
um than what you can do with hands

7266
02:09:34,550 --> 02:09:34,560
um than what you can do with hands
 

7267
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:35,930
um than what you can do with hands
without something that you're touching

7268
02:09:35,930 --> 02:09:35,940
without something that you're touching
 

7269
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:38,089
without something that you're touching
so again I think it's there are certain

7270
02:09:38,089 --> 02:09:38,099
so again I think it's there are certain
 

7271
02:09:38,099 --> 02:09:40,370
so again I think it's there are certain
questions which are just around what use

7272
02:09:40,370 --> 02:09:40,380
questions which are just around what use
 

7273
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:42,890
questions which are just around what use
cases are you optimizing for

7274
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:42,900
cases are you optimizing for
 

7275
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:43,669
cases are you optimizing for
um

7276
02:09:43,669 --> 02:09:43,679
um
 

7277
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:46,070
um
I I think if you want to play games then

7278
02:09:46,070 --> 02:09:46,080
I I think if you want to play games then
 

7279
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:48,169
I I think if you want to play games then
I think that that I think you want you

7280
02:09:48,169 --> 02:09:48,179
I think that that I think you want you
 

7281
02:09:48,179 --> 02:09:49,669
I think that that I think you want you
want to design the system in a different

7282
02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:49,679
want to design the system in a different
 

7283
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:52,550
want to design the system in a different
way and and we're more focused on on

7284
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:52,560
way and and we're more focused on on
 

7285
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,470
way and and we're more focused on on
kind of social experiences entertainment

7286
02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:54,480
kind of social experiences entertainment
 

7287
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:56,149
kind of social experiences entertainment
experiences

7288
02:09:56,149 --> 02:09:56,159
experiences
 

7289
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:56,810
experiences
um

7290
02:09:56,810 --> 02:09:56,820
um
 

7291
02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:59,570
um
whereas if if what you want is to make

7292
02:09:59,570 --> 02:09:59,580
whereas if if what you want is to make
 

7293
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:00,649
whereas if if what you want is to make
sure that

7294
02:10:00,649 --> 02:10:00,659
sure that
 

7295
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:03,109
sure that
the text that you read on a screen is as

7296
02:10:03,109 --> 02:10:03,119
the text that you read on a screen is as
 

7297
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:05,450
the text that you read on a screen is as
crisp as possible then you need to make

7298
02:10:05,450 --> 02:10:05,460
crisp as possible then you need to make
 

7299
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:08,330
crisp as possible then you need to make
the the design and cost trade-offs that

7300
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:08,340
the the design and cost trade-offs that
 

7301
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:10,669
the the design and cost trade-offs that
they made that that lead you to making a

7302
02:10:10,669 --> 02:10:10,679
they made that that lead you to making a
 

7303
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:13,669
they made that that lead you to making a
3 500 device so I think there is a use

7304
02:10:13,669 --> 02:10:13,679
3 500 device so I think there is a use
 

7305
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:15,410
3 500 device so I think there is a use
case for that for sure but I just think

7306
02:10:15,410 --> 02:10:15,420
case for that for sure but I just think
 

7307
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:17,149
case for that for sure but I just think
that they're they're they've the

7308
02:10:17,149 --> 02:10:17,159
that they're they're they've the
 

7309
02:10:17,159 --> 02:10:18,709
that they're they're they've the
companies we've basically made different

7310
02:10:18,709 --> 02:10:18,719
companies we've basically made different
 

7311
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:22,430
companies we've basically made different
design trade-offs to to get to the use

7312
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:22,440
design trade-offs to to get to the use
 

7313
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:24,350
design trade-offs to to get to the use
cases that we're trying to serve

7314
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:24,360
cases that we're trying to serve
 

7315
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:26,990
cases that we're trying to serve
there's a lot of other stuff I would

7316
02:10:26,990 --> 02:10:27,000
there's a lot of other stuff I would
 

7317
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,609
there's a lot of other stuff I would
love to talk to you about about the

7318
02:10:28,609 --> 02:10:28,619
love to talk to you about about the
 

7319
02:10:28,619 --> 02:10:32,030
love to talk to you about about the
metaverse especially the Kodak Avatar uh

7320
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:32,040
metaverse especially the Kodak Avatar uh
 

7321
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:33,770
metaverse especially the Kodak Avatar uh
which I've gotten to experience a lot of

7322
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:33,780
which I've gotten to experience a lot of
 

7323
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:35,510
which I've gotten to experience a lot of
different variations of recently that

7324
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:35,520
different variations of recently that
 

7325
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,729
different variations of recently that
I'm really really excited I'm excited to

7326
02:10:37,729 --> 02:10:37,739
I'm really really excited I'm excited to
 

7327
02:10:37,739 --> 02:10:39,890
I'm really really excited I'm excited to
talk about that too I'll I'll have to

7328
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:39,900
talk about that too I'll I'll have to
 

7329
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:41,750
talk about that too I'll I'll have to
wait a little bit because

7330
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:41,760
wait a little bit because
 

7331
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:42,770
wait a little bit because
um

7332
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:42,780
um
 

7333
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:46,370
um
uh uh well I think there's a lot more to

7334
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:46,380
uh uh well I think there's a lot more to
 

7335
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:48,830
uh uh well I think there's a lot more to
show off in that regard but let me step

7336
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:48,840
show off in that regard but let me step
 

7337
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:51,470
show off in that regard but let me step
back to AI I think we've mentioned it a

7338
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:51,480
back to AI I think we've mentioned it a
 

7339
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:54,169
back to AI I think we've mentioned it a
little bit but

7340
02:10:54,169 --> 02:10:54,179
little bit but
 

7341
02:10:54,179 --> 02:10:56,209
little bit but
I'd like to linger on this question that

7342
02:10:56,209 --> 02:10:56,219
I'd like to linger on this question that
 

7343
02:10:56,219 --> 02:10:59,390
I'd like to linger on this question that
uh folk folks like eliaskowski has to

7344
02:10:59,390 --> 02:10:59,400
uh folk folks like eliaskowski has to
 

7345
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:02,689
uh folk folks like eliaskowski has to
worry about uh and others of the

7346
02:11:02,689 --> 02:11:02,699
worry about uh and others of the
 

7347
02:11:02,699 --> 02:11:05,030
worry about uh and others of the
existential of the serious threats of AI

7348
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,040
existential of the serious threats of AI
 

7349
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,370
existential of the serious threats of AI
that have been reinvigorated now with

7350
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:07,380
that have been reinvigorated now with
 

7351
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:10,070
that have been reinvigorated now with
the rapid developments of AI systems uh

7352
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:10,080
the rapid developments of AI systems uh
 

7353
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:11,870
the rapid developments of AI systems uh
do you worry

7354
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:11,880
do you worry
 

7355
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:15,050
do you worry
about the existential risks of AI as

7356
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:15,060
about the existential risks of AI as
 

7357
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:17,750
about the existential risks of AI as
Eliezer does about the alignment problem

7358
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:17,760
Eliezer does about the alignment problem
 

7359
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:20,450
Eliezer does about the alignment problem
about this getting out of hand

7360
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:20,460
about this getting out of hand
 

7361
02:11:20,460 --> 02:11:22,129
about this getting out of hand
anytime where there's a number of

7362
02:11:22,129 --> 02:11:22,139
anytime where there's a number of
 

7363
02:11:22,139 --> 02:11:25,430
anytime where there's a number of
serious people who are raising a concern

7364
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:25,440
serious people who are raising a concern
 

7365
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:27,350
serious people who are raising a concern
that is that existential

7366
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:27,360
that is that existential
 

7367
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,850
that is that existential
about something that you're involved

7368
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:28,860
about something that you're involved
 

7369
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:30,410
about something that you're involved
with I think you have to think about it

7370
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:30,420
with I think you have to think about it
 

7371
02:11:30,420 --> 02:11:31,910
with I think you have to think about it
right so

7372
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:31,920
right so
 

7373
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:33,830
right so
I've spent quite a bit of time thinking

7374
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:33,840
I've spent quite a bit of time thinking
 

7375
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:36,050
I've spent quite a bit of time thinking
about it from that perspective

7376
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:36,060
about it from that perspective
 

7377
02:11:36,060 --> 02:11:37,550
about it from that perspective
um

7378
02:11:37,550 --> 02:11:37,560
um
 

7379
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:39,229
um
foreign

7380
02:11:39,229 --> 02:11:39,239
foreign
 

7381
02:11:39,239 --> 02:11:41,990
foreign
the thing that I where I basically have

7382
02:11:41,990 --> 02:11:42,000
the thing that I where I basically have
 

7383
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,790
the thing that I where I basically have
come out on this for now is I I do think

7384
02:11:43,790 --> 02:11:43,800
come out on this for now is I I do think
 

7385
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,350
come out on this for now is I I do think
that there are

7386
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:45,360
that there are
 

7387
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,270
that there are
over time I think that we need to think

7388
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:47,280
over time I think that we need to think
 

7389
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:48,950
over time I think that we need to think
about this even more as we as we

7390
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:48,960
about this even more as we as we
 

7391
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:51,050
about this even more as we as we
approach something that

7392
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:51,060
approach something that
 

7393
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:52,490
approach something that
you know could be closer to Super

7394
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:52,500
you know could be closer to Super
 

7395
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:53,689
you know could be closer to Super
intelligence I just think it's pretty

7396
02:11:53,689 --> 02:11:53,699
intelligence I just think it's pretty
 

7397
02:11:53,699 --> 02:11:55,310
intelligence I just think it's pretty
clear to anyone working on these

7398
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:55,320
clear to anyone working on these
 

7399
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:57,530
clear to anyone working on these
projects today that we're that we're not

7400
02:11:57,530 --> 02:11:57,540
projects today that we're that we're not
 

7401
02:11:57,540 --> 02:11:58,669
projects today that we're that we're not
there

7402
02:11:58,669 --> 02:11:58,679
there
 

7403
02:11:58,679 --> 02:12:02,209
there
um and one of my concerns is that we we

7404
02:12:02,209 --> 02:12:02,219
um and one of my concerns is that we we
 

7405
02:12:02,219 --> 02:12:03,830
um and one of my concerns is that we we
spend a fair amount of time on this

7406
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:03,840
spend a fair amount of time on this
 

7407
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,629
spend a fair amount of time on this
before but

7408
02:12:05,629 --> 02:12:05,639
before but
 

7409
02:12:05,639 --> 02:12:08,030
before but
there are more

7410
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:08,040
there are more
 

7411
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:09,169
there are more
um

7412
02:12:09,169 --> 02:12:09,179
um
 

7413
02:12:09,179 --> 02:12:11,450
um
uh I don't know if mundane is the right

7414
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:11,460
uh I don't know if mundane is the right
 

7415
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:13,729
uh I don't know if mundane is the right
word but there's like concerns that

7416
02:12:13,729 --> 02:12:13,739
word but there's like concerns that
 

7417
02:12:13,739 --> 02:12:16,129
word but there's like concerns that
already exist right about like people

7418
02:12:16,129 --> 02:12:16,139
already exist right about like people
 

7419
02:12:16,139 --> 02:12:19,910
already exist right about like people
using AI tools to do harmful things of

7420
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:19,920
using AI tools to do harmful things of
 

7421
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:20,990
using AI tools to do harmful things of
the type that we're already aware

7422
02:12:20,990 --> 02:12:21,000
the type that we're already aware
 

7423
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,550
the type that we're already aware
whether you know we talked about fraud

7424
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:22,560
whether you know we talked about fraud
 

7425
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:26,209
whether you know we talked about fraud
or scams or different things like that

7426
02:12:26,209 --> 02:12:26,219
or scams or different things like that
 

7427
02:12:26,219 --> 02:12:27,410
or scams or different things like that
um

7428
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:27,420
um
 

7429
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:30,350
um
and that's going to be a pretty big

7430
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:30,360
and that's going to be a pretty big
 

7431
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:32,209
and that's going to be a pretty big
set of challenges that the company is

7432
02:12:32,209 --> 02:12:32,219
set of challenges that the company is
 

7433
02:12:32,219 --> 02:12:33,290
set of challenges that the company is
working on this they're going to need to

7434
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:33,300
working on this they're going to need to
 

7435

existential concern as well at some
 

7441
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:41,930
existential concern as well at some
point down the road so I I do worry that

7442
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:41,940
point down the road so I I do worry that
 

7443
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:43,250
point down the road so I I do worry that
to some degree

7444
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:43,260
to some degree
 

7445
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:44,990
to some degree
you can

02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:45,000
you can

02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,729
you can
people can get

02:12:46,729 --> 02:12:46,739
people can get
 

7449
02:12:46,739 --> 02:12:49,669
people can get
a little too focused on

02:12:49,669 --> 02:12:49,679
a little too focused on
 

7451
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:52,609
a little too focused on
on some of the tail risk and then not do

7452
02:12:52,609 --> 02:12:52,619
on some of the tail risk and then not do
 

7453
02:12:52,619 --> 02:12:55,310
on some of the tail risk and then not do
as good of a job as we need to on the

as good of a job as we need to on the
 

7455
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:57,229
as good of a job as we need to on the
things that you are can be almost

7456
02:12:57,229 --> 02:12:57,239
things that you are can be almost
 

7457
02:12:57,239 --> 02:12:59,270
things that you are can be almost
certain are going to come down the pipe

7458
02:12:59,270 --> 02:12:59,280
certain are going to come down the pipe
 

7459
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:02,450

as um as as real risks that that that

02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:02,460
as um as as real risks that that that
 

7461
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:04,189
as um as as real risks that that that
kind of manifest themselves in the near

7462
02:13:04,189 --> 02:13:04,199
kind of manifest themselves in the near
 

7463
02:13:04,199 --> 02:13:06,530
kind of manifest themselves in the near
term so for me I've spent most of my

7464
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:06,540
term so for me I've spent most of my
 

7465
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:07,550

time

7466
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:07,560
time
 

7467
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:10,910
time
on that once I I kind of made

7468
02:13:10,910 --> 02:13:10,920
on that once I I kind of made
 

7469
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:14,149
on that once I I kind of made
the realization that the size of models

7470
02:13:14,149 --> 02:13:14,159
the realization that the size of models
 

7471
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:15,589
the realization that the size of models
that we're talking about now in terms of

that we're talking about now in terms of
 

7473
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:17,510
that we're talking about now in terms of
what we're building are are just quite

7474
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:17,520
what we're building are are just quite
 

7475
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:19,430
what we're building are are just quite
far from the super intelligence type

7476
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:19,440
far from the super intelligence type
 

7477
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:21,109
far from the super intelligence type
concerns that

7478
02:13:21,109 --> 02:13:21,119
concerns that
 

7479
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:22,850
concerns that
um that that people raise but but I

7480
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:22,860
um that that people raise but but I
 

7481
02:13:22,860 --> 02:13:24,290
um that that people raise but but I
think once we get a couple steps closer

7482
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:24,300
think once we get a couple steps closer
 

7483
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:25,550
think once we get a couple steps closer
to that

7484
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:25,560
to that
 

7485
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:27,290
to that
um I know as we do get closer I think

7486
02:13:27,290 --> 02:13:27,300
um I know as we do get closer I think
 

7487
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:29,930
um I know as we do get closer I think
that those you know there are going to

7488
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:29,940
that those you know there are going to
 

7489
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:31,370
that those you know there are going to
be some novel

7490
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:31,380
be some novel
 

7491
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:33,470
be some novel
um risks and issues about

7492
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:33,480
um risks and issues about
 

7493
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:35,209
um risks and issues about
how we make sure that the systems are

7494
02:13:35,209 --> 02:13:35,219
how we make sure that the systems are
 

7495
02:13:35,219 --> 02:13:36,589
how we make sure that the systems are
safe for sure

7496
02:13:36,589 --> 02:13:36,599
safe for sure
 

7497
02:13:36,599 --> 02:13:38,089
safe for sure
I guess here just to take the

7498
02:13:38,089 --> 02:13:38,099
I guess here just to take the
 

7499
02:13:38,099 --> 02:13:39,470
I guess here just to take the
conversation in a somewhat different

7500
02:13:39,470 --> 02:13:39,480
conversation in a somewhat different
 

7501
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:40,850
conversation in a somewhat different
direction

7502
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:40,860
direction
 

7503
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:42,410
direction
I think

7504
02:13:42,410 --> 02:13:42,420
I think
 

7505
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:45,470
I think
in some of these debates around safety

7506
02:13:45,470 --> 02:13:45,480
in some of these debates around safety
 

7507
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:48,350
in some of these debates around safety
I think the concepts of intelligence

7508
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:48,360
I think the concepts of intelligence
 

7509
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:50,870
I think the concepts of intelligence
and

7510
02:13:50,870 --> 02:13:50,880
and
 

7511
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:54,649
and
autonomy or like the the being of the

7512
02:13:54,649 --> 02:13:54,659
autonomy or like the the being of the
 

7513
02:13:54,659 --> 02:13:55,910
autonomy or like the the being of the
thing

7514
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:55,920
thing
 

7515
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:58,310
thing
um you know as an analogy they get kind

7516
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:58,320
um you know as an analogy they get kind
 

7517
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:00,890
um you know as an analogy they get kind
of conflated together and

7518
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:00,900
of conflated together and
 

7519
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:02,950
of conflated together and
I think it very well could be the case

7520
02:14:02,950 --> 02:14:02,960
I think it very well could be the case
 

7521
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:05,330
I think it very well could be the case
that you can make something and scale

7522
02:14:05,330 --> 02:14:05,340
that you can make something and scale
 

7523
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:09,169
that you can make something and scale
intelligence quite far but

7524
02:14:09,169 --> 02:14:09,179
intelligence quite far but
 

7525
02:14:09,179 --> 02:14:11,450
intelligence quite far but
that

7526
02:14:11,450 --> 02:14:11,460
that
 

7527
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:14,510
that
that may not manifest the safety

7528
02:14:14,510 --> 02:14:14,520
that may not manifest the safety
 

7529
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,189
that may not manifest the safety

concerns that people are saying in the
 

7531
02:14:16,199 --> 02:14:17,510

sense that I mean just if you if you

7532
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:17,520
sense that I mean just if you if you
 

7533
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:18,950
sense that I mean just if you if you
look at human biology it's like all

7534
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:18,960
look at human biology it's like all
 

7535
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,750
look at human biology it's like all
right we have our neocortexes we're all

7536
02:14:20,750 --> 02:14:20,760
right we have our neocortexes we're all
 

7537
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:23,569
right we have our neocortexes we're all
the the thinking happens right and it's

7538
02:14:23,569 --> 02:14:23,579
the the thinking happens right and it's
 

7539
02:14:23,579 --> 02:14:25,550
the the thinking happens right and it's
but but it's not really calling the

02:14:25,550 --> 02:14:25,560
but but it's not really calling the

shots at the end of the day we have a
 

7543
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:29,209
shots at the end of the day we have a
much more you know primitive

02:14:29,209 --> 02:14:29,219
much more you know primitive

old brain structure for which our
 

7547
02:14:32,099 --> 02:14:33,770

02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,480
Machinery is basically just a kind of
 

7551
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:39,229
Machinery is basically just a kind of
prediction and reasoning engine to help

prediction and reasoning engine to help
 

7553

it kind of like our very simple brain

02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:44,450
it kind of like our very simple brain
um

7556
02:14:44,450 --> 02:14:44,460
um
 

7557
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:46,490
um
decide

how to plan and do what it needs to do
 

7561
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:50,870
how to plan and do what it needs to do
in order to achieve these like very kind

7562
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:50,880
in order to achieve these like very kind
 

7563
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:53,810
in order to achieve these like very kind
of basic impulses and

7564
02:14:53,810 --> 02:14:53,820
of basic impulses and
 

7565
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:55,609
of basic impulses and
I think that you can think about some of

7566
02:14:55,609 --> 02:14:55,619
I think that you can think about some of
 

7567
02:14:55,619 --> 02:14:56,689
I think that you can think about some of
the

7568
02:14:56,689 --> 02:14:56,699
the
 

7569
02:14:56,699 --> 02:14:58,790
the
development of intelligence

7570
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:58,800
development of intelligence
 

7571
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,490
development of intelligence
along the same lines where just like our

7572
02:15:01,490 --> 02:15:01,500
along the same lines where just like our
 

7573
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:03,470
along the same lines where just like our
neocortex doesn't have free will or

7574
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:03,480
neocortex doesn't have free will or
 

7575
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:04,970
neocortex doesn't have free will or
autonomy

7576
02:15:04,970 --> 02:15:04,980
autonomy
 

7577
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:05,629
autonomy
um

7578
02:15:05,629 --> 02:15:05,639
um
 

7579
02:15:05,639 --> 02:15:07,490
um
we might develop these wildly

7580
02:15:07,490 --> 02:15:07,500
we might develop these wildly
 

7581
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:09,530
we might develop these wildly
intelligent systems that are you know

7582
02:15:09,530 --> 02:15:09,540
intelligent systems that are you know
 

7583
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:12,050
intelligent systems that are you know
much more intelligent than our neocortex

7584
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:12,060
much more intelligent than our neocortex
 

7585
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:14,689
much more intelligent than our neocortex
have much more capacity but are you know

7586
02:15:14,689 --> 02:15:14,699
have much more capacity but are you know
 

7587
02:15:14,699 --> 02:15:16,129
have much more capacity but are you know
the same way that our near cortex is

7588
02:15:16,129 --> 02:15:16,139
the same way that our near cortex is
 

7589
02:15:16,139 --> 02:15:18,530
the same way that our near cortex is
sort of subservient and is used as a

7590
02:15:18,530 --> 02:15:18,540
sort of subservient and is used as a
 

7591
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:21,410
sort of subservient and is used as a
tool by our our kind of simple impulse

7592
02:15:21,410 --> 02:15:21,420
tool by our our kind of simple impulse
 

7593
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:23,930
tool by our our kind of simple impulse
brain it's um you know I think that it's

7594
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:23,940
brain it's um you know I think that it's
 

7595
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:25,910
brain it's um you know I think that it's
not out of the question that very

7596
02:15:25,910 --> 02:15:25,920
not out of the question that very
 

7597
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:27,830
not out of the question that very
intelligent systems that that have the

7598
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:27,840
intelligent systems that that have the
 

7599
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,810
intelligent systems that that have the
capacity to think will will kind of act

7600
02:15:29,810 --> 02:15:29,820
capacity to think will will kind of act
 

7601
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:32,030
capacity to think will will kind of act
as that as sort of an extension of of

7602
02:15:32,030 --> 02:15:32,040
as that as sort of an extension of of
 

7603
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,790
as that as sort of an extension of of
the neocortex doing that so I think my

7604
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:34,800
the neocortex doing that so I think my
 

7605
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,530
the neocortex doing that so I think my
own view is that

7606
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:36,540
own view is that
 

7607
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:39,530
own view is that
where we really need to be careful is on

7608
02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:39,540
where we really need to be careful is on
 

7609
02:15:39,540 --> 02:15:43,310
where we really need to be careful is on
the development of autonomy and how we

7610
02:15:43,310 --> 02:15:43,320
the development of autonomy and how we
 

7611
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:45,470
the development of autonomy and how we
think about that because

7612
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:45,480
think about that because
 

7613
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:46,310
think about that because
um

7614
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:46,320
um
 

7615
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:48,290
um
it's actually the case that

7616
02:15:48,290 --> 02:15:48,300
it's actually the case that
 

7617
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,149
it's actually the case that
relatively simple and unintelligent

7618
02:15:50,149 --> 02:15:50,159
relatively simple and unintelligent
 

7619
02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:52,609
relatively simple and unintelligent
things that have runaway autonomy and

7620
02:15:52,609 --> 02:15:52,619
things that have runaway autonomy and
 

7621
02:15:52,619 --> 02:15:54,770
things that have runaway autonomy and
just spread themselves or you know it's

7622
02:15:54,770 --> 02:15:54,780
just spread themselves or you know it's
 

7623
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:56,209
just spread themselves or you know it's
like we have a word for that it's a

7624
02:15:56,209 --> 02:15:56,219
like we have a word for that it's a
 

7625
02:15:56,219 --> 02:15:58,430
like we have a word for that it's a
virus right it's I mean like it could be

7626
02:15:58,430 --> 02:15:58,440
virus right it's I mean like it could be
 

7627
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:00,229
virus right it's I mean like it could be
simple computer code that is not

7628
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:00,239
simple computer code that is not
 

7629
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:01,370
simple computer code that is not
particularly intelligent but just

7630
02:16:01,370 --> 02:16:01,380
particularly intelligent but just
 

7631
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:03,770
particularly intelligent but just
spreads itself and does a lot of harm

7632
02:16:03,770 --> 02:16:03,780
spreads itself and does a lot of harm
 

7633
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:04,850
spreads itself and does a lot of harm
um

7634
02:16:04,850 --> 02:16:04,860
um
 

7635
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:08,030
um
you know biologically or computer and

7636
02:16:08,030 --> 02:16:08,040
you know biologically or computer and
 

7637
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:10,250
you know biologically or computer and
um

7638
02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:10,260

 

7639
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,689

I just think that these are somewhat

7640
02:16:11,689 --> 02:16:11,699
I just think that these are somewhat
 

7641
02:16:11,699 --> 02:16:14,930
I just think that these are somewhat
separable things and a lot of what I

7642
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:14,940
separable things and a lot of what I
 

7643
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:16,129
separable things and a lot of what I
think we need to develop when people

7644
02:16:16,129 --> 02:16:16,139
think we need to develop when people
 

7645
02:16:16,139 --> 02:16:18,530
think we need to develop when people
talk about safety and responsibility is

7646
02:16:18,530 --> 02:16:18,540
talk about safety and responsibility is
 

7647
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:20,990
talk about safety and responsibility is
really the governance on the autonomy

7648
02:16:20,990 --> 02:16:21,000
really the governance on the autonomy
 

7649
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,189
really the governance on the autonomy
that can be given to systems and to me

7650
02:16:25,189 --> 02:16:25,199
that can be given to systems and to me
 

7651
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:27,350
that can be given to systems and to me
if you know if I were you know a policy

7652
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:27,360
if you know if I were you know a policy
 

7653
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:30,109
if you know if I were you know a policy
maker as or think about this I would

7654
02:16:30,109 --> 02:16:30,119
maker as or think about this I would
 

7655
02:16:30,119 --> 02:16:31,189
maker as or think about this I would
really want to think about that

7656
02:16:31,189 --> 02:16:31,199
really want to think about that
 

7657
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:33,049
really want to think about that
distinction between these where I think

7658
02:16:33,049 --> 02:16:33,059
distinction between these where I think
 

7659
02:16:33,059 --> 02:16:34,790
distinction between these where I think
building intelligence systems will be

7660
02:16:34,790 --> 02:16:34,800
building intelligence systems will be
 

7661
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,310
building intelligence systems will be
can create a huge advance in terms of

7662
02:16:37,310 --> 02:16:37,320
can create a huge advance in terms of
 

7663
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:39,889
can create a huge advance in terms of
people's quality of life and

7664
02:16:39,889 --> 02:16:39,899
people's quality of life and
 

7665
02:16:39,899 --> 02:16:42,169
people's quality of life and
productivity growth in the economy

7666
02:16:42,169 --> 02:16:42,179
productivity growth in the economy
 

7667
02:16:42,179 --> 02:16:44,389
productivity growth in the economy
but it's the the autonomy part of this

7668
02:16:44,389 --> 02:16:44,399
but it's the the autonomy part of this
 

7669
02:16:44,399 --> 02:16:47,209
but it's the the autonomy part of this
that I think we really need to make

7670
02:16:47,209 --> 02:16:47,219
that I think we really need to make
 

7671
02:16:47,219 --> 02:16:48,889
that I think we really need to make
progress on how to govern these things

7672
02:16:48,889 --> 02:16:48,899
progress on how to govern these things
 

7673
02:16:48,899 --> 02:16:52,549
progress on how to govern these things
responsibly before we

7674
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:52,559
responsibly before we
 

7675
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:55,310
responsibly before we
build the capacity for them to make a

7676
02:16:55,310 --> 02:16:55,320
build the capacity for them to make a
 

7677
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:57,349
build the capacity for them to make a
lot of decisions on their own or or give

7678
02:16:57,349 --> 02:16:57,359
lot of decisions on their own or or give
 

7679
02:16:57,359 --> 02:16:59,389
lot of decisions on their own or or give
them goals or

7680
02:16:59,389 --> 02:16:59,399
them goals or
 

7681
02:16:59,399 --> 02:17:01,429
them goals or
things like that and I think that's a

7682
02:17:01,429 --> 02:17:01,439
things like that and I think that's a
 

7683
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:02,810
things like that and I think that's a
research problem but I do think that to

7684
02:17:02,810 --> 02:17:02,820
research problem but I do think that to
 

7685
02:17:02,820 --> 02:17:05,150
research problem but I do think that to
some degree these are are somewhat are

7686
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:05,160
some degree these are are somewhat are
 

7687
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:07,490
some degree these are are somewhat are
somewhat separable things I love the

7688
02:17:07,490 --> 02:17:07,500
somewhat separable things I love the
 

7689
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:09,290
somewhat separable things I love the
distinction between intelligence and

7690
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:09,300
distinction between intelligence and
 

7691
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:11,209
distinction between intelligence and
autonomy and and the metaphor of the

7692
02:17:11,209 --> 02:17:11,219
autonomy and and the metaphor of the
 

7693
02:17:11,219 --> 02:17:14,030
autonomy and and the metaphor of the
neocortex

7694
02:17:14,030 --> 02:17:14,040

 

7695
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:16,790

let me ask about power

7696
02:17:16,790 --> 02:17:16,800
let me ask about power
 

7697
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,009
let me ask about power
so uh building super intelligence

7698
02:17:19,009 --> 02:17:19,019
so uh building super intelligence
 

7699
02:17:19,019 --> 02:17:21,230
so uh building super intelligence
systems even if it's not in the near

7700
02:17:21,230 --> 02:17:21,240
systems even if it's not in the near
 

7701
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:25,129
systems even if it's not in the near
term I think meta as is one of the few

7702
02:17:25,129 --> 02:17:25,139
term I think meta as is one of the few
 

7703
02:17:25,139 --> 02:17:28,669
term I think meta as is one of the few
companies if not the main company that

7704
02:17:28,669 --> 02:17:28,679
companies if not the main company that
 

7705
02:17:28,679 --> 02:17:30,349
companies if not the main company that
will develop the super intelligence

7706
02:17:30,349 --> 02:17:30,359
will develop the super intelligence
 

7707
02:17:30,359 --> 02:17:33,349
will develop the super intelligence
system and you are a man who's at the

7708
02:17:33,349 --> 02:17:33,359
system and you are a man who's at the
 

7709
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:36,169
system and you are a man who's at the
head of this company building AGI might

7710
02:17:36,169 --> 02:17:36,179
head of this company building AGI might
 

7711
02:17:36,179 --> 02:17:37,730
head of this company building AGI might
make you the most powerful man in the

7712
02:17:37,730 --> 02:17:37,740
make you the most powerful man in the
 

7713
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:39,530
make you the most powerful man in the
world do you worry that that power will

7714
02:17:39,530 --> 02:17:39,540
world do you worry that that power will
 

7715
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:42,469
world do you worry that that power will
corrupt you

7716
02:17:42,469 --> 02:17:42,479

 

7717
02:17:42,479 --> 02:17:44,450

what a question

7718
02:17:44,450 --> 02:17:44,460
what a question
 

7719
02:17:44,460 --> 02:17:46,610
what a question
um

7720
02:17:46,610 --> 02:17:46,620

 

7721
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:48,889

I mean look I think realistically this

7722
02:17:48,889 --> 02:17:48,899
I mean look I think realistically this
 

7723
02:17:48,899 --> 02:17:50,509
I mean look I think realistically this
gets back to the open source things that

7724
02:17:50,509 --> 02:17:50,519
gets back to the open source things that
 

7725
02:17:50,519 --> 02:17:53,810
gets back to the open source things that
we talked about before which is I don't

7726
02:17:53,810 --> 02:17:53,820
we talked about before which is I don't
 

7727
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:57,110
we talked about before which is I don't
think that the world will be best served

7728
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:57,120
think that the world will be best served
 

7729
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,910
think that the world will be best served
by

7730
02:17:58,910 --> 02:17:58,920
by
 

7731
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:03,349
by
any small number of organizations

7732
02:18:03,349 --> 02:18:03,359

 

7733
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:05,089

having this

7734
02:18:05,089 --> 02:18:05,099
having this
 

7735
02:18:05,099 --> 02:18:07,129
having this
without it being something that is more

7736
02:18:07,129 --> 02:18:07,139
without it being something that is more
 

7737
02:18:07,139 --> 02:18:10,070
without it being something that is more
broadly available I think if you look

7738
02:18:10,070 --> 02:18:10,080
broadly available I think if you look
 

7739
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:12,589
broadly available I think if you look
through history

7740
02:18:12,589 --> 02:18:12,599

 

7741
02:18:12,599 --> 02:18:14,629

it's when there are these sort of like

7742
02:18:14,629 --> 02:18:14,639
it's when there are these sort of like
 

7743
02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:18,169
it's when there are these sort of like
unipolar advances and things that in

7744
02:18:18,169 --> 02:18:18,179
unipolar advances and things that in
 

7745
02:18:18,179 --> 02:18:19,790
unipolar advances and things that in
like power imbalances that they're

7746
02:18:19,790 --> 02:18:19,800
like power imbalances that they're
 

7747
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:22,310
like power imbalances that they're
they're they're doing to being kind of

7748
02:18:22,310 --> 02:18:22,320
they're they're doing to being kind of
 

7749
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:25,429
they're they're doing to being kind of
weird situations so this is one of the

7750
02:18:25,429 --> 02:18:25,439
weird situations so this is one of the
 

7751
02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:27,230
weird situations so this is one of the
reasons why I think open sources is is

7752
02:18:27,230 --> 02:18:27,240
reasons why I think open sources is is
 

7753
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:29,509
reasons why I think open sources is is
generally

7754
02:18:29,509 --> 02:18:29,519
generally
 

7755
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:31,370
generally
the right approach

7756
02:18:31,370 --> 02:18:31,380
the right approach
 

7757
02:18:31,380 --> 02:18:33,530
the right approach
and you know I think it's it's a

7758
02:18:33,530 --> 02:18:33,540
and you know I think it's it's a
 

7759
02:18:33,540 --> 02:18:34,730
and you know I think it's it's a
categorically different question today

7760
02:18:34,730 --> 02:18:34,740
categorically different question today
 

7761
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:35,870
categorically different question today
when we're not close to Super

7762
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:35,880
when we're not close to Super
 

7763
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:37,549
when we're not close to Super
intelligence I think there's a good

7764
02:18:37,549 --> 02:18:37,559
intelligence I think there's a good
 

7765
02:18:37,559 --> 02:18:39,049
intelligence I think there's a good
chance that even once we get closer to

7766
02:18:39,049 --> 02:18:39,059
chance that even once we get closer to
 

7767
02:18:39,059 --> 02:18:41,509
chance that even once we get closer to
Super intelligence open sourcing Remains

7768
02:18:41,509 --> 02:18:41,519
Super intelligence open sourcing Remains
 

7769
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:42,650
Super intelligence open sourcing Remains
the right approach even though I think

7770
02:18:42,650 --> 02:18:42,660
the right approach even though I think
 

7771
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:43,730
the right approach even though I think
at that point it's a somewhat different

7772
02:18:43,730 --> 02:18:43,740
at that point it's a somewhat different
 

7773
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:45,290
at that point it's a somewhat different
debate

7774
02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:45,300
debate
 

7775
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:48,049
debate
um but I think part of that is that that

7776
02:18:48,049 --> 02:18:48,059
um but I think part of that is that that
 

7777
02:18:48,059 --> 02:18:48,889
um but I think part of that is that that
is

7778
02:18:48,889 --> 02:18:48,899
is
 

7779
02:18:48,899 --> 02:18:50,750
is
you know I think one of the best ways to

7780
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:50,760
you know I think one of the best ways to
 

7781
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:53,450
you know I think one of the best ways to
ensure that the system is as secure and

7782
02:18:53,450 --> 02:18:53,460
ensure that the system is as secure and
 

7783
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:54,889
ensure that the system is as secure and
safe as possible because it's not just

7784
02:18:54,889 --> 02:18:54,899
safe as possible because it's not just
 

7785
02:18:54,899 --> 02:18:56,629
safe as possible because it's not just
about a lot of people having access to

7786
02:18:56,629 --> 02:18:56,639
about a lot of people having access to
 

7787
02:18:56,639 --> 02:18:59,150
about a lot of people having access to
it it's the scrutiny that that kind of

7788
02:18:59,150 --> 02:18:59,160
it it's the scrutiny that that kind of
 

7789
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:01,370
it it's the scrutiny that that kind of
comes with being with building an open

7790
02:19:01,370 --> 02:19:01,380
comes with being with building an open
 

7791
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:03,290
comes with being with building an open
source system running that this is a

7792
02:19:03,290 --> 02:19:03,300
source system running that this is a
 

7793
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:04,969
source system running that this is a
pretty widely accepted thing about open

7794
02:19:04,969 --> 02:19:04,979
pretty widely accepted thing about open
 

7795
02:19:04,979 --> 02:19:06,589
pretty widely accepted thing about open
source is that

7796
02:19:06,589 --> 02:19:06,599
source is that
 

7797
02:19:06,599 --> 02:19:09,049
source is that
um now you have the code out there so

7798
02:19:09,049 --> 02:19:09,059
um now you have the code out there so
 

7799
02:19:09,059 --> 02:19:10,810
um now you have the code out there so
anyone can see the vulnerabilities

7800
02:19:10,810 --> 02:19:10,820
anyone can see the vulnerabilities
 

7801
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:13,129
anyone can see the vulnerabilities
anyone can can kind of mess with it in

7802
02:19:13,129 --> 02:19:13,139
anyone can can kind of mess with it in
 

7803
02:19:13,139 --> 02:19:14,990
anyone can can kind of mess with it in
different ways people can spin off their

7804
02:19:14,990 --> 02:19:15,000
different ways people can spin off their
 

7805
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,910
different ways people can spin off their
own projects and experiment in a ton of

7806
02:19:16,910 --> 02:19:16,920
own projects and experiment in a ton of
 

7807
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:18,950
own projects and experiment in a ton of
different ways and the net result of all

7808
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:18,960
different ways and the net result of all
 

7809
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:21,110
different ways and the net result of all
of that is that the systems just get

7810
02:19:21,110 --> 02:19:21,120
of that is that the systems just get
 

7811
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,870
of that is that the systems just get
hardened and get to be a lot safer and

7812
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:23,880
hardened and get to be a lot safer and
 

7813
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:25,549
hardened and get to be a lot safer and
more secure

7814
02:19:25,549 --> 02:19:25,559
more secure
 

7815
02:19:25,559 --> 02:19:27,290
more secure
um so

7816
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:27,300
um so
 

7817
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:29,389
um so
I think that there's a chance

7818
02:19:29,389 --> 02:19:29,399
I think that there's a chance
 

7819
02:19:29,399 --> 02:19:32,570
I think that there's a chance
that that ends up being the way that

7820
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:32,580
that that ends up being the way that
 

7821
02:19:32,580 --> 02:19:35,810
that that ends up being the way that
this goes to a pretty good chance and

7822
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:35,820
this goes to a pretty good chance and
 

7823
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:36,950
this goes to a pretty good chance and
that

7824
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:36,960
that
 

7825
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:38,929
that
having this be open

7826
02:19:38,929 --> 02:19:38,939
having this be open
 

7827
02:19:38,939 --> 02:19:41,750
having this be open
both leads to a healthier development of

7828
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
both leads to a healthier development of
 

7829
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,870
both leads to a healthier development of
the technology and also leads to a more

7830
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:44,880
the technology and also leads to a more
 

7831
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:46,070
the technology and also leads to a more
balanced

7832
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:46,080
balanced
 

7833
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:46,669
balanced
um

7834
02:19:46,669 --> 02:19:46,679
um
 

7835
02:19:46,679 --> 02:19:48,950
um
distribution of the technology

7836
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:48,960
distribution of the technology
 

7837
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:51,230
distribution of the technology
in a way that that strikes me as good

7838
02:19:51,230 --> 02:19:51,240
in a way that that strikes me as good
 

7839
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:53,810
in a way that that strikes me as good
value is to Aspire to so to you the

7840
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:53,820
value is to Aspire to so to you the
 

7841
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:56,150
value is to Aspire to so to you the
risks there's risks to open sourcing but

7842
02:19:56,150 --> 02:19:56,160
risks there's risks to open sourcing but
 

7843
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:58,429
risks there's risks to open sourcing but
the benefits outweigh the risks at the

7844
02:19:58,429 --> 02:19:58,439
the benefits outweigh the risks at the
 

7845
02:19:58,439 --> 02:20:01,370
the benefits outweigh the risks at the
two it's interesting I think the way you

7846
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:01,380
two it's interesting I think the way you
 

7847
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:02,929
two it's interesting I think the way you
put it

7848
02:20:02,929 --> 02:20:02,939
put it
 

7849
02:20:02,939 --> 02:20:05,330
put it
uh you put it well that there's a

7850
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:05,340
uh you put it well that there's a
 

7851
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:07,730
uh you put it well that there's a
different discussion now than when we

7852
02:20:07,730 --> 02:20:07,740
different discussion now than when we
 

7853
02:20:07,740 --> 02:20:10,849
different discussion now than when we
get closer to the uh to development of

7854
02:20:10,849 --> 02:20:10,859
get closer to the uh to development of
 

7855
02:20:10,859 --> 02:20:13,190
get closer to the uh to development of
super intelligence of of the benefits

7856
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,200
super intelligence of of the benefits
 

7857
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:15,889
super intelligence of of the benefits
and risks of uh open sourcing yeah and

7858
02:20:15,889 --> 02:20:15,899
and risks of uh open sourcing yeah and
 

7859
02:20:15,899 --> 02:20:18,110
and risks of uh open sourcing yeah and
to be clear I feel quite confident in

7860
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:18,120
to be clear I feel quite confident in
 

7861
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:20,450
to be clear I feel quite confident in
the assessment that open sourcing models

7862
02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:20,460
the assessment that open sourcing models
 

7863
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:24,530
the assessment that open sourcing models
now is that positive I think there's a

7864
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:24,540
now is that positive I think there's a
 

7865
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:26,630
now is that positive I think there's a
good argument that in the future it will

7866
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:26,640
good argument that in the future it will
 

7867
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:28,250
good argument that in the future it will
be too even as you get closer to Super

7868
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:28,260
be too even as you get closer to Super
 

7869
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:30,530
be too even as you get closer to Super
intelligence but I've not I'm I

7870
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:30,540
intelligence but I've not I'm I
 

7871
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:32,270
intelligence but I've not I'm I
certainly have not decided on that yet

7872
02:20:32,270 --> 02:20:32,280
certainly have not decided on that yet
 

7873
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:33,770
certainly have not decided on that yet
and I think that it becomes a somewhat

7874
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:33,780
and I think that it becomes a somewhat
 

7875
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:36,110
and I think that it becomes a somewhat
more complex set of questions that I

7876
02:20:36,110 --> 02:20:36,120
more complex set of questions that I
 

7877
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:37,370
more complex set of questions that I
think people will have time to debate

7878
02:20:37,370 --> 02:20:37,380
think people will have time to debate
 

7879
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:39,290
think people will have time to debate
and will also be informed by what

7880
02:20:39,290 --> 02:20:39,300
and will also be informed by what
 

7881
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:41,090
and will also be informed by what
happens between now and then and to make

7882
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:41,100
happens between now and then and to make
 

7883
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:42,290
happens between now and then and to make
those decisions we don't have to

7884
02:20:42,290 --> 02:20:42,300
those decisions we don't have to
 

7885
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:44,330
those decisions we don't have to
necessarily just debate that in theory

7886
02:20:44,330 --> 02:20:44,340
necessarily just debate that in theory
 

7887
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:46,309
necessarily just debate that in theory
right now uh what year do you think

7888
02:20:46,309 --> 02:20:46,319
right now uh what year do you think
 

7889
02:20:46,319 --> 02:20:49,849
right now uh what year do you think
we'll have a super intelligence

7890
02:20:49,849 --> 02:20:49,859

 

7891
02:20:49,859 --> 02:20:51,170

I don't know I mean that's pure

7892
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:51,180
I don't know I mean that's pure
 

7893
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:54,290
I don't know I mean that's pure
speculation I think it's uh I think it's

7894
02:20:54,290 --> 02:20:54,300
speculation I think it's uh I think it's
 

7895
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:55,490
speculation I think it's uh I think it's
very clear just taking a step back that

7896
02:20:55,490 --> 02:20:55,500
very clear just taking a step back that
 

7897
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:56,809
very clear just taking a step back that
we had a big breakthrough in the last

7898
02:20:56,809 --> 02:20:56,819
we had a big breakthrough in the last
 

7899
02:20:56,819 --> 02:20:59,270
we had a big breakthrough in the last
year yes right where the the llms and

7900
02:20:59,270 --> 02:20:59,280
year yes right where the the llms and
 

7901
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:01,790
year yes right where the the llms and
diffusion models basically reached a a

7902
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:01,800
diffusion models basically reached a a
 

7903
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,889
diffusion models basically reached a a
scale where they're able to do some some

7904
02:21:03,889 --> 02:21:03,899
scale where they're able to do some some
 

7905
02:21:03,899 --> 02:21:05,690
scale where they're able to do some some
pretty interesting things and then I

7906
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:05,700
pretty interesting things and then I
 

7907
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,830
pretty interesting things and then I
think the question is what happens from

7908
02:21:06,830 --> 02:21:06,840
think the question is what happens from
 

7909
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:10,370
think the question is what happens from
here and just to paint the two extremes

7910
02:21:10,370 --> 02:21:10,380
here and just to paint the two extremes
 

7911
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:12,349
here and just to paint the two extremes
on the

7912
02:21:12,349 --> 02:21:12,359
on the
 

7913
02:21:12,359 --> 02:21:13,849
on the
um

7914
02:21:13,849 --> 02:21:13,859
um
 

7915
02:21:13,859 --> 02:21:16,130
um
on on one side it's like okay we just

7916
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:16,140
on on one side it's like okay we just
 

7917
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:18,170
on on one side it's like okay we just
had one breakthrough if we just have

7918
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:18,180
had one breakthrough if we just have
 

7919
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:19,610
had one breakthrough if we just have
like another breakthrough like that or

7920
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:19,620
like another breakthrough like that or
 

7921
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:21,290
like another breakthrough like that or
maybe two then we could have something

7922
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:21,300
maybe two then we could have something
 

7923
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:24,170
maybe two then we could have something
that's truly crazy right and and is like

7924
02:21:24,170 --> 02:21:24,180
that's truly crazy right and and is like
 

7925
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:26,450
that's truly crazy right and and is like
is um

7926
02:21:26,450 --> 02:21:26,460
is um
 

7927
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:29,530
is um
just like so much more advanced and and

7928
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:29,540
just like so much more advanced and and
 

7929
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:31,790
just like so much more advanced and and
on that side of the argument it's like

7930
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:31,800
on that side of the argument it's like
 

7931
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:34,010
on that side of the argument it's like
okay well maybe we're

7932
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:34,020
okay well maybe we're
 

7933
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:35,330
okay well maybe we're
um

7934
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:35,340
um
 

7935
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:37,429
um
maybe we're only a couple of big steps

7936
02:21:37,429 --> 02:21:37,439
maybe we're only a couple of big steps
 

7937
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:40,849
maybe we're only a couple of big steps
away from uh from from from reaching

7938
02:21:40,849 --> 02:21:40,859
away from uh from from from reaching
 

7939
02:21:40,859 --> 02:21:41,990
away from uh from from from reaching
something that looks more like general

7940
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:42,000
something that looks more like general
 

7941
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,190
something that looks more like general
intelligence

7942
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,200
intelligence
 

7943
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,990
intelligence
okay that's one that's one side of the

7944
02:21:44,990 --> 02:21:45,000
okay that's one that's one side of the
 

7945
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,910
okay that's one that's one side of the
argument and the other side which is

7946
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:46,920
argument and the other side which is
 

7947
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:48,290
argument and the other side which is
what we've historically seen a lot more

7948
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:48,300
what we've historically seen a lot more
 

7949
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:52,010
what we've historically seen a lot more
is that a breakthrough leads to

7950
02:21:52,010 --> 02:21:52,020
is that a breakthrough leads to
 

7951
02:21:52,020 --> 02:21:53,570
is that a breakthrough leads to
um

7952
02:21:53,570 --> 02:21:53,580
um
 

7953
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:56,210
um
you know in that in that Gartner hype

7954
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:56,220
you know in that in that Gartner hype
 

7955
02:21:56,220 --> 02:21:58,610
you know in that in that Gartner hype
cycle there's like the hype and then

7956
02:21:58,610 --> 02:21:58,620
cycle there's like the hype and then
 

7957
02:21:58,620 --> 02:22:00,050
cycle there's like the hype and then
there's the trough of disillusionment

7958
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:00,060
there's the trough of disillusionment
 

7959
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:02,090
there's the trough of disillusionment
after when like people think that

7960
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:02,100
after when like people think that
 

7961
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:04,250
after when like people think that
there's a chance that hey okay there's a

7962
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:04,260
there's a chance that hey okay there's a
 

7963
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:05,270
there's a chance that hey okay there's a
big breakthrough maybe we're about to

7964
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:05,280
big breakthrough maybe we're about to
 

7965
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:06,349
big breakthrough maybe we're about to
get another big breakthrough and it's

7966
02:22:06,349 --> 02:22:06,359
get another big breakthrough and it's
 

7967
02:22:06,359 --> 02:22:07,730
get another big breakthrough and it's
like actually you're not about to get

7968
02:22:07,730 --> 02:22:07,740
like actually you're not about to get
 

7969
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:09,770
like actually you're not about to get
another breakthrough you're maybe you're

7970
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:09,780
another breakthrough you're maybe you're
 

7971
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:10,969
another breakthrough you're maybe you're
actually just gonna have to sit with

7972
02:22:10,969 --> 02:22:10,979
actually just gonna have to sit with
 

7973
02:22:10,979 --> 02:22:13,730
actually just gonna have to sit with
this one for a while and

7974
02:22:13,730 --> 02:22:13,740
this one for a while and
 

7975
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:16,550
this one for a while and
um and you know it could be

7976
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:16,560
um and you know it could be
 

7977
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:18,590
um and you know it could be
it could be five years it could be ten

7978
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:18,600
it could be five years it could be ten
 

7979
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:20,330
it could be five years it could be ten
years it could be 15 years until you

7980
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:20,340
years it could be 15 years until you
 

7981
02:22:20,340 --> 02:22:21,290
years it could be 15 years until you
figure out

7982
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:21,300
figure out
 

7983
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:24,110
figure out
the um the kind of the next big thing

7984
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:24,120
the um the kind of the next big thing
 

7985
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:27,410
the um the kind of the next big thing
that needs to get figured out and um but

7986
02:22:27,410 --> 02:22:27,420
that needs to get figured out and um but
 

7987
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:28,790
that needs to get figured out and um but
I think that the fact that we just had

7988
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:28,800
I think that the fact that we just had
 

7989
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:30,710
I think that the fact that we just had
this breakthrough

7990
02:22:30,710 --> 02:22:30,720
this breakthrough
 

7991
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:32,570
this breakthrough
sort of makes sense that we're at a

7992
02:22:32,570 --> 02:22:32,580
sort of makes sense that we're at a
 

7993
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:35,389
sort of makes sense that we're at a
point of almost a very wide error bars

7994
02:22:35,389 --> 02:22:35,399
point of almost a very wide error bars
 

7995
02:22:35,399 --> 02:22:38,389
point of almost a very wide error bars
on what happens next yeah um I think the

7996
02:22:38,389 --> 02:22:38,399
on what happens next yeah um I think the
 

7997
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:41,150
on what happens next yeah um I think the
traditional technical view or the like

7998
02:22:41,150 --> 02:22:41,160
traditional technical view or the like
 

7999
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:43,010
traditional technical view or the like
looking at the industry

8000
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:43,020
looking at the industry
 

8001
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:44,809
looking at the industry
would suggest that we're not just going

8002
02:22:44,809 --> 02:22:44,819
would suggest that we're not just going
 

8003
02:22:44,819 --> 02:22:45,950
would suggest that we're not just going
to stack

8004
02:22:45,950 --> 02:22:45,960
to stack
 

8005
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:47,750
to stack
in a like Breakthrough on top of

8006
02:22:47,750 --> 02:22:47,760
in a like Breakthrough on top of
 

8007
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:49,370
in a like Breakthrough on top of
breakthrough on top of breakthrough like

8008
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:49,380
breakthrough on top of breakthrough like
 

8009
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:52,250
breakthrough on top of breakthrough like
every six months or something right now

8010
02:22:52,250 --> 02:22:52,260
every six months or something right now
 

8011
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:55,010
every six months or something right now
I think it it will I'm guessing I would

8012
02:22:55,010 --> 02:22:55,020
I think it it will I'm guessing I would
 

8013
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:56,630
I think it it will I'm guessing I would
guess that it will take some longer in

8014
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:56,640
guess that it will take some longer in
 

8015
02:22:56,640 --> 02:23:00,170
guess that it will take some longer in
between these but um

8016
02:23:00,170 --> 02:23:00,180
between these but um
 

8017
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:02,210
between these but um
I don't know but I tend to be pretty

8018
02:23:02,210 --> 02:23:02,220
I don't know but I tend to be pretty
 

8019
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:03,830
I don't know but I tend to be pretty
optimistic about breakthroughs too so I

8020
02:23:03,830 --> 02:23:03,840
optimistic about breakthroughs too so I
 

8021
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,389
optimistic about breakthroughs too so I
mean so I think if you if you if you

8022
02:23:05,389 --> 02:23:05,399
mean so I think if you if you if you
 

8023
02:23:05,399 --> 02:23:07,250
mean so I think if you if you if you
normalized for for my normal optimism

8024
02:23:07,250 --> 02:23:07,260
normalized for for my normal optimism
 

8025
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:09,410
normalized for for my normal optimism
then then maybe it would be even even

8026
02:23:09,410 --> 02:23:09,420
then then maybe it would be even even
 

8027
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:11,030
then then maybe it would be even even
slower than what I'm saying but but even

8028
02:23:11,030 --> 02:23:11,040
slower than what I'm saying but but even
 

8029
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:13,670
slower than what I'm saying but but even
within that like I'm not even opining on

8030
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:13,680
within that like I'm not even opining on
 

8031
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:14,990
within that like I'm not even opining on
the question of how many breakthroughs

8032
02:23:14,990 --> 02:23:15,000
the question of how many breakthroughs
 

8033
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,130
the question of how many breakthroughs
are required to get to general

8034
02:23:16,130 --> 02:23:16,140
are required to get to general
 

8035
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:18,830
are required to get to general
intelligence because no one knows

8036
02:23:18,830 --> 02:23:18,840
intelligence because no one knows
 

8037
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,050
intelligence because no one knows
but this particular breakthrough was so

8038
02:23:21,050 --> 02:23:21,060
but this particular breakthrough was so
 

8039
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:24,830
but this particular breakthrough was so
such a small step that resulted in such

8040
02:23:24,830 --> 02:23:24,840
such a small step that resulted in such
 

8041
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:28,010
such a small step that resulted in such
a big leap in performance

8042
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:28,020
a big leap in performance
 

8043
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:30,650
a big leap in performance
as experienced by human beings that it

8044
02:23:30,650 --> 02:23:30,660
as experienced by human beings that it
 

8045
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:33,830
as experienced by human beings that it
makes you think wow are we is as we

8046
02:23:33,830 --> 02:23:33,840
makes you think wow are we is as we
 

8047
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:36,889
makes you think wow are we is as we
stumble across this very open world of

8048
02:23:36,889 --> 02:23:36,899
stumble across this very open world of
 

8049
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:39,950
stumble across this very open world of
research where we stumble

8050
02:23:39,950 --> 02:23:39,960
research where we stumble
 

8051
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:42,650
research where we stumble
um across another thing that will have a

8052
02:23:42,650 --> 02:23:42,660
um across another thing that will have a
 

8053
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:45,710
um across another thing that will have a
giant leap of performance

8054
02:23:45,710 --> 02:23:45,720
giant leap of performance
 

8055
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:49,490
giant leap of performance
and also we don't know exactly at which

8056
02:23:49,490 --> 02:23:49,500
and also we don't know exactly at which
 

8057
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:51,410
and also we don't know exactly at which
stage is it really going to be

8058
02:23:51,410 --> 02:23:51,420
stage is it really going to be
 

8059
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:53,450
stage is it really going to be
impressive because it feels like it's

8060
02:23:53,450 --> 02:23:53,460
impressive because it feels like it's
 

8061
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:56,090
impressive because it feels like it's
really encroaching on impressive levels

8062
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:56,100
really encroaching on impressive levels
 

8063
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:57,830
really encroaching on impressive levels
of intelligence

8064
02:23:57,830 --> 02:23:57,840
of intelligence
 

8065
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:00,050
of intelligence
you still didn't answer the question of

8066
02:24:00,050 --> 02:24:00,060
you still didn't answer the question of
 

8067
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:01,429
you still didn't answer the question of
what year we're going to have super

8068
02:24:01,429 --> 02:24:01,439
what year we're going to have super
 

8069
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:03,230
what year we're going to have super
intelligence I'd like to hold you to

8070
02:24:03,230 --> 02:24:03,240
intelligence I'd like to hold you to
 

8071
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:05,090
intelligence I'd like to hold you to
that no I'm just kidding but is there

8072
02:24:05,090 --> 02:24:05,100
that no I'm just kidding but is there
 

8073
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:07,250
that no I'm just kidding but is there
something you could say about the

8074
02:24:07,250 --> 02:24:07,260
something you could say about the
 

8075
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:08,450
something you could say about the
timeline

8076
02:24:08,450 --> 02:24:08,460
timeline
 

8077
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:12,110
timeline
as you think about the development of

8078
02:24:12,110 --> 02:24:12,120
as you think about the development of
 

8079
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:14,990
as you think about the development of
um AGI super intelligence systems

8080
02:24:14,990 --> 02:24:15,000
um AGI super intelligence systems
 

8081
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,469
um AGI super intelligence systems
sure so I I still don't think I have any

8082
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:18,479
sure so I I still don't think I have any
 

8083
02:24:18,479 --> 02:24:20,570
sure so I I still don't think I have any
particular Insight on when like a

8084
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:20,580
particular Insight on when like a
 

8085
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:22,429
particular Insight on when like a
singular AI system that is a general

8086
02:24:22,429 --> 02:24:22,439
singular AI system that is a general
 

8087
02:24:22,439 --> 02:24:24,410
singular AI system that is a general
intelligence will get created but I

8088
02:24:24,410 --> 02:24:24,420
intelligence will get created but I
 

8089
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:27,290
intelligence will get created but I
think the one thing that most people

8090
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:27,300
think the one thing that most people
 

8091
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:28,730
think the one thing that most people
in the discourse that I've seen about

8092
02:24:28,730 --> 02:24:28,740
in the discourse that I've seen about
 

8093
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:30,230
in the discourse that I've seen about
this haven't really grappled with is

8094
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,240
this haven't really grappled with is
 

8095
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:33,770
this haven't really grappled with is
that we do seem to have

8096
02:24:33,770 --> 02:24:33,780
that we do seem to have
 

8097
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:36,710
that we do seem to have
organiz organizations and you know

8098
02:24:36,710 --> 02:24:36,720
organiz organizations and you know
 

8099
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:38,210
organiz organizations and you know
structures in the world that exhibit

8100
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:38,220
structures in the world that exhibit
 

8101
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:39,889
structures in the world that exhibit
greater than human intelligence already

8102
02:24:39,889 --> 02:24:39,899
greater than human intelligence already
 

8103
02:24:39,899 --> 02:24:43,849
greater than human intelligence already
so you know one example is a you know a

8104
02:24:43,849 --> 02:24:43,859
so you know one example is a you know a
 

8105
02:24:43,859 --> 02:24:45,830
so you know one example is a you know a
company you know it acts as an entity it

8106
02:24:45,830 --> 02:24:45,840
company you know it acts as an entity it
 

8107
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:48,469
company you know it acts as an entity it
has you know singular brand

8108
02:24:48,469 --> 02:24:48,479
has you know singular brand
 

8109
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:50,389
has you know singular brand
um obviously it's a collection of people

8110
02:24:50,389 --> 02:24:50,399
um obviously it's a collection of people
 

8111
02:24:50,399 --> 02:24:53,090
um obviously it's a collection of people
but I I certainly hope that you know

8112
02:24:53,090 --> 02:24:53,100
but I I certainly hope that you know
 

8113
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:54,849
but I I certainly hope that you know
meta with tens of thousands of people

8114
02:24:54,849 --> 02:24:54,859
meta with tens of thousands of people
 

8115
02:24:54,859 --> 02:24:57,290
meta with tens of thousands of people
make smarter decisions than one person

8116
02:24:57,290 --> 02:24:57,300
make smarter decisions than one person
 

8117
02:24:57,300 --> 02:24:59,090
make smarter decisions than one person
but I think that would be pretty bad if

8118
02:24:59,090 --> 02:24:59,100
but I think that would be pretty bad if
 

8119
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:00,410
but I think that would be pretty bad if
it didn't

8120
02:25:00,410 --> 02:25:00,420
it didn't
 

8121
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:01,429
it didn't
um

8122
02:25:01,429 --> 02:25:01,439
um
 

8123
02:25:01,439 --> 02:25:04,309
um
another example that I think is even

8124
02:25:04,309 --> 02:25:04,319
another example that I think is even
 

8125
02:25:04,319 --> 02:25:07,130
another example that I think is even
more removed from kind of the way we

8126
02:25:07,130 --> 02:25:07,140
more removed from kind of the way we
 

8127
02:25:07,140 --> 02:25:09,170
more removed from kind of the way we
think about like the personification of

8128
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:09,180
think about like the personification of
 

8129
02:25:09,180 --> 02:25:11,690
think about like the personification of
of um of intelligence which is often

8130
02:25:11,690 --> 02:25:11,700
of um of intelligence which is often
 

8131
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:13,610
of um of intelligence which is often
implied in some of these questions is

8132
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:13,620
implied in some of these questions is
 

8133
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:14,690
implied in some of these questions is
think about something like the stock

8134
02:25:14,690 --> 02:25:14,700
think about something like the stock
 

8135
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:17,690
think about something like the stock
market where the the stock market is you

8136
02:25:17,690 --> 02:25:17,700
market where the the stock market is you
 

8137
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:19,250
market where the the stock market is you
know takes inputs it's a distributed

8138
02:25:19,250 --> 02:25:19,260
know takes inputs it's a distributed
 

8139
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:21,050
know takes inputs it's a distributed
system it's like the cybernetic organism

8140
02:25:21,050 --> 02:25:21,060
system it's like the cybernetic organism
 

8141
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:22,969
system it's like the cybernetic organism
that

8142
02:25:22,969 --> 02:25:22,979
that
 

8143
02:25:22,979 --> 02:25:24,770
that
you know probably millions of people

8144
02:25:24,770 --> 02:25:24,780
you know probably millions of people
 

8145
02:25:24,780 --> 02:25:26,270
you know probably millions of people
around the world

8146
02:25:26,270 --> 02:25:26,280
around the world
 

8147
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:28,910
around the world
are basically voting every day by

8148
02:25:28,910 --> 02:25:28,920
are basically voting every day by
 

8149
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:30,650
are basically voting every day by
choosing what to invest in

8150
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:30,660
choosing what to invest in
 

8151
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:33,230
choosing what to invest in
but it's basically this

8152
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:33,240
but it's basically this
 

8153
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:37,309
but it's basically this
this organism or or structure that is

8154
02:25:37,309 --> 02:25:37,319
this organism or or structure that is
 

8155
02:25:37,319 --> 02:25:40,010
this organism or or structure that is
smarter than any individual that we use

8156
02:25:40,010 --> 02:25:40,020
smarter than any individual that we use
 

8157
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:43,130
smarter than any individual that we use
to allocate Capital as efficiently as

02:25:43,130 --> 02:25:43,140
to allocate Capital as efficiently as
 

8159
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:46,730
to allocate Capital as efficiently as
possible around the world and

8160
02:25:46,730 --> 02:25:46,740
possible around the world and
 

8161
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:49,610
possible around the world and
that

8162
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:49,620

 

8163
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:51,889

this notion that there are already these

8164
02:25:51,889 --> 02:25:51,899
this notion that there are already these
 

8165
02:25:51,899 --> 02:25:53,590
this notion that there are already these

the intelligence of multiple people

8170
02:25:59,929 --> 02:25:59,939
the intelligence of multiple people

multiple people and Technology together

multiple people and Technology together
to form something which is

8176
02:26:07,730 --> 02:26:07,740
to form something which is
 

8177
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:10,010
to form something which is
dramatically more intelligent than any

8178
02:26:10,010 --> 02:26:10,020
dramatically more intelligent than any
 

8179
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:13,010
dramatically more intelligent than any
individual on the in the world

8180
02:26:13,010 --> 02:26:13,020
individual on the in the world
 

8181
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:14,570
individual on the in the world
um

8182
02:26:14,570 --> 02:26:14,580
um
 

8183
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:17,210
um
is something that seems to exist

8184
02:26:17,210 --> 02:26:17,220
is something that seems to exist
 

8185
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:19,969
is something that seems to exist
and that we seem to be able to harness

8186
02:26:19,969 --> 02:26:19,979
and that we seem to be able to harness
 

8187
02:26:19,979 --> 02:26:22,969
and that we seem to be able to harness
in a productive way for our society

8188
02:26:22,969 --> 02:26:22,979
in a productive way for our society
 

8189
02:26:22,979 --> 02:26:24,770
in a productive way for our society
is as long as we basically build these

8190
02:26:24,770 --> 02:26:24,780
is as long as we basically build these
 

8191
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:27,230
is as long as we basically build these
structures and balance with each other

8192
02:26:27,230 --> 02:26:27,240
structures and balance with each other
 

8193
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,690
structures and balance with each other
um so I don't know I mean that that at

8194
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:29,700
um so I don't know I mean that that at
 

8195
02:26:29,700 --> 02:26:32,570
um so I don't know I mean that that at
least gives me hope that as we advance

8196
02:26:32,570 --> 02:26:32,580
least gives me hope that as we advance
 

8197
02:26:32,580 --> 02:26:34,070
least gives me hope that as we advance
the technology and I don't know how long

8198
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:34,080
the technology and I don't know how long
 

8199
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:35,809
the technology and I don't know how long
exactly it's going to be but you asked

8200
02:26:35,809 --> 02:26:35,819
exactly it's going to be but you asked
 

8201
02:26:35,819 --> 02:26:37,370
exactly it's going to be but you asked
when is this going to exist I think to

8202
02:26:37,370 --> 02:26:37,380
when is this going to exist I think to
 

8203
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:39,290
when is this going to exist I think to
some degree we already have

8204
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:39,300
some degree we already have
 

8205
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:41,389
some degree we already have
many organizations in the world that are

8206
02:26:41,389 --> 02:26:41,399
many organizations in the world that are
 

8207
02:26:41,399 --> 02:26:43,670
many organizations in the world that are
smarter than a single human and and that

8208
02:26:43,670 --> 02:26:43,680
smarter than a single human and and that
 

8209
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:45,110
smarter than a single human and and that
seems to be something that is generally

8210
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:45,120
seems to be something that is generally
 

8211
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,210
seems to be something that is generally
productive in advancing humanity and

8212
02:26:47,210 --> 02:26:47,220
productive in advancing humanity and
 

8213
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:49,150
productive in advancing humanity and
somehow the individual AI systems

8214
02:26:49,150 --> 02:26:49,160
somehow the individual AI systems
 

8215
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:51,650
somehow the individual AI systems
empower the individual humans and the

8216
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:51,660
empower the individual humans and the
 

8217
02:26:51,660 --> 02:26:53,690
empower the individual humans and the
interaction between those humans to make

8218
02:26:53,690 --> 02:26:53,700
interaction between those humans to make
 

8219
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:56,030
interaction between those humans to make
that collective intelligence Machinery

8220
02:26:56,030 --> 02:26:56,040
that collective intelligence Machinery
 

8221
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:58,130
that collective intelligence Machinery
that you're referring to smarter so it's

8222
02:26:58,130 --> 02:26:58,140
that you're referring to smarter so it's
 

8223
02:26:58,140 --> 02:26:59,690
that you're referring to smarter so it's
not like AI is becoming super

8224
02:26:59,690 --> 02:26:59,700
not like AI is becoming super
 

8225
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:02,150
not like AI is becoming super
intelligent it's just becoming the uh

8226
02:27:02,150 --> 02:27:02,160
intelligent it's just becoming the uh
 

8227
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:04,429
intelligent it's just becoming the uh
the engine that's making the collective

8228
02:27:04,429 --> 02:27:04,439
the engine that's making the collective
 

8229
02:27:04,439 --> 02:27:06,590
the engine that's making the collective
intelligence is primarily human more

8230
02:27:06,590 --> 02:27:06,600
intelligence is primarily human more
 

8231
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:07,670
intelligence is primarily human more
intelligent

8232
02:27:07,670 --> 02:27:07,680
intelligent
 

8233
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:10,250
intelligent
yeah it's educating the humans better

8234
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:10,260
yeah it's educating the humans better
 

8235
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:14,150
yeah it's educating the humans better
it's making them better informed it's

8236
02:27:14,150 --> 02:27:14,160
it's making them better informed it's
 

8237
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:15,950
it's making them better informed it's
um making it more efficient for them to

8238
02:27:15,950 --> 02:27:15,960
um making it more efficient for them to
 

8239
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:18,490
um making it more efficient for them to
communicate effectively and debate ideas

8240
02:27:18,490 --> 02:27:18,500
communicate effectively and debate ideas
 

8241
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:21,110
communicate effectively and debate ideas
and through that process just making the

8242
02:27:21,110 --> 02:27:21,120
and through that process just making the
 

8243
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:22,670
and through that process just making the
whole collective intelligence more and

8244
02:27:22,670 --> 02:27:22,680
whole collective intelligence more and
 

8245
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:24,230
whole collective intelligence more and
more and more intelligent

8246
02:27:24,230 --> 02:27:24,240
more and more intelligent
 

8247
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:26,690
more and more intelligent
maybe faster than the individual AI

8248
02:27:26,690 --> 02:27:26,700
maybe faster than the individual AI
 

8249
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:28,490
maybe faster than the individual AI
systems that are trained on human data

8250
02:27:28,490 --> 02:27:28,500
systems that are trained on human data
 

8251
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:31,730
systems that are trained on human data
anyway are becoming maybe the collective

8252
02:27:31,730 --> 02:27:31,740
anyway are becoming maybe the collective
 

8253
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:33,230
anyway are becoming maybe the collective
intelligence of human species might

8254
02:27:33,230 --> 02:27:33,240
intelligence of human species might
 

8255
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:35,630
intelligence of human species might
outpace the development of AI

8256
02:27:35,630 --> 02:27:35,640
outpace the development of AI
 

8257
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:37,910
outpace the development of AI
just like so there's a balance in here

8258
02:27:37,910 --> 02:27:37,920
just like so there's a balance in here
 

8259
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:40,130
just like so there's a balance in here
because I mean if if like you know if a

8260
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:40,140
because I mean if if like you know if a
 

8261
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:42,349
because I mean if if like you know if a
lot of the input that

8262
02:27:42,349 --> 02:27:42,359
lot of the input that
 

8263
02:27:42,359 --> 02:27:45,050
lot of the input that
that the systems are being trained on is

8264
02:27:45,050 --> 02:27:45,060
that the systems are being trained on is
 

8265
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:46,490
that the systems are being trained on is
basically coming from feedback from

8266
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:46,500
basically coming from feedback from
 

8267
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:47,510
basically coming from feedback from
people

8268
02:27:47,510 --> 02:27:47,520
people
 

8269
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:49,910
people
then a lot of the development does need

8270
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:49,920
then a lot of the development does need
 

8271
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:52,070
then a lot of the development does need
to happen in human time right it's it's

8272
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:52,080
to happen in human time right it's it's
 

8273
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,469
to happen in human time right it's it's
not like a machined

8274
02:27:54,469 --> 02:27:54,479
not like a machined
 

8275
02:27:54,479 --> 02:27:56,270
not like a machined
or just be able to go learn all the

8276
02:27:56,270 --> 02:27:56,280
or just be able to go learn all the
 

8277
02:27:56,280 --> 02:27:57,950
or just be able to go learn all the
stuff about about how people think about

8278
02:27:57,950 --> 02:27:57,960
stuff about about how people think about
 

8279
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:59,870
stuff about about how people think about
stuff there's there's a cycle to how

8280
02:27:59,870 --> 02:27:59,880
stuff there's there's a cycle to how
 

8281
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:02,389
stuff there's there's a cycle to how
this needs to work this is an exciting

8282
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:02,399
this needs to work this is an exciting
 

8283
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:05,570
this needs to work this is an exciting
World we're living in and that you're at

8284
02:28:05,570 --> 02:28:05,580
World we're living in and that you're at
 

8285
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:07,969
World we're living in and that you're at
the Forefront of developing uh one of

8286
02:28:07,969 --> 02:28:07,979
the Forefront of developing uh one of
 

8287
02:28:07,979 --> 02:28:09,710
the Forefront of developing uh one of
the ways you keep yourself humble like

8288
02:28:09,710 --> 02:28:09,720
the ways you keep yourself humble like
 

8289
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:12,170
the ways you keep yourself humble like
we mentioned with Jiu Jitsu is doing

8290
02:28:12,170 --> 02:28:12,180
we mentioned with Jiu Jitsu is doing
 

8291
02:28:12,180 --> 02:28:14,210
we mentioned with Jiu Jitsu is doing
some uh really difficult challenges

8292
02:28:14,210 --> 02:28:14,220
some uh really difficult challenges
 

8293
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:17,389
some uh really difficult challenges
mental and physical one of those you've

8294
02:28:17,389 --> 02:28:17,399
mental and physical one of those you've
 

8295
02:28:17,399 --> 02:28:20,090
mental and physical one of those you've
done very recently is uh the Murph

8296
02:28:20,090 --> 02:28:20,100
done very recently is uh the Murph
 

8297
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:21,290
done very recently is uh the Murph
challenge

8298
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:21,300
challenge
 

8299
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:23,450
challenge
and you got a really good time it's a

8300
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:23,460
and you got a really good time it's a
 

8301
02:28:23,460 --> 02:28:25,790
and you got a really good time it's a
hundred pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 squats

8302
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:25,800
hundred pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 squats
 

8303
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:28,730
hundred pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 squats
and a mile before and a mile run after

8304
02:28:28,730 --> 02:28:28,740
and a mile before and a mile run after
 

8305
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:30,469
and a mile before and a mile run after
you got

8306
02:28:30,469 --> 02:28:30,479
you got
 

8307
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:32,870
you got
under 40 minutes on that

8308
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:32,880
under 40 minutes on that
 

8309
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:35,150
under 40 minutes on that
uh what was the hardest part

8310
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:35,160
uh what was the hardest part
 

8311
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:36,770
uh what was the hardest part
I think a lot of people were very

8312
02:28:36,770 --> 02:28:36,780
I think a lot of people were very
 

8313
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:39,710
I think a lot of people were very
impressed it's very impressive time

8314
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:39,720
impressed it's very impressive time
 

8315
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:42,410
impressed it's very impressive time
yeah how crazy are you it was the

8316
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:42,420
yeah how crazy are you it was the
 

8317
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:44,630
yeah how crazy are you it was the
question I'm asking but it wasn't my

8318
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:44,640
question I'm asking but it wasn't my
 

8319
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:46,250
question I'm asking but it wasn't my
best time but but I I'm anything under

8320
02:28:46,250 --> 02:28:46,260
best time but but I I'm anything under
 

8321
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:48,410
best time but but I I'm anything under
40 minutes I'm happy with yeah um it

8322
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:48,420
40 minutes I'm happy with yeah um it
 

8323
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:50,690
40 minutes I'm happy with yeah um it
wasn't your best time no I think I I

8324
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:50,700
wasn't your best time no I think I I
 

8325
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:52,070
wasn't your best time no I think I I
think I've done it a little faster

8326
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:52,080
think I've done it a little faster
 

8327
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:54,710
think I've done it a little faster
before but not much I mean it's um

8328
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:54,720
before but not much I mean it's um
 

8329
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:57,050
before but not much I mean it's um
um and and of my friends I I did not win

8330
02:28:57,050 --> 02:28:57,060
um and and of my friends I I did not win
 

8331
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:59,150
um and and of my friends I I did not win
on Memorial Day one of my friends did it

8332
02:28:59,150 --> 02:28:59,160
on Memorial Day one of my friends did it
 

8333
02:28:59,160 --> 02:29:00,710
on Memorial Day one of my friends did it
actually it was several minutes faster

8334
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:00,720
actually it was several minutes faster
 

8335
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:01,849
actually it was several minutes faster
than me

8336
02:29:01,849 --> 02:29:01,859
than me
 

8337
02:29:01,859 --> 02:29:03,650
than me
um but just to clear up one thing that I

8338
02:29:03,650 --> 02:29:03,660
um but just to clear up one thing that I
 

8339
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:04,730
um but just to clear up one thing that I
think was

8340
02:29:04,730 --> 02:29:04,740
think was
 

8341
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:06,290
think was
um I I saw a bunch of questions about

8342
02:29:06,290 --> 02:29:06,300
um I I saw a bunch of questions about
 

8343
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:07,790
um I I saw a bunch of questions about
this on the internet there are multiple

8344
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:07,800
this on the internet there are multiple
 

8345
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:09,469
this on the internet there are multiple
ways to do to do the Murph challenge

8346
02:29:09,469 --> 02:29:09,479
ways to do to do the Murph challenge
 

8347
02:29:09,479 --> 02:29:12,590
ways to do to do the Murph challenge
there's a kind of partitioned mode where

8348
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:12,600
there's a kind of partitioned mode where
 

8349
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:15,770
there's a kind of partitioned mode where
you do sets of pull-ups push-ups and

8350
02:29:15,770 --> 02:29:15,780
you do sets of pull-ups push-ups and
 

8351
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:18,050
you do sets of pull-ups push-ups and
squats together and then there's

8352
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:18,060
squats together and then there's
 

8353
02:29:18,060 --> 02:29:19,610
squats together and then there's
unpartitioned where you do the hundred

8354
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:19,620
unpartitioned where you do the hundred
 

8355
02:29:19,620 --> 02:29:22,730
unpartitioned where you do the hundred
pull-ups and then the 200 push-ups and

8356
02:29:22,730 --> 02:29:22,740
pull-ups and then the 200 push-ups and
 

8357
02:29:22,740 --> 02:29:24,650
pull-ups and then the 200 push-ups and
then the 300 squats

8358
02:29:24,650 --> 02:29:24,660
then the 300 squats
 

8359
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:27,469
then the 300 squats
in serial and obviously if you're you

8360
02:29:27,469 --> 02:29:27,479
in serial and obviously if you're you
 

8361
02:29:27,479 --> 02:29:28,870
in serial and obviously if you're you
know if you're doing them

8362
02:29:28,870 --> 02:29:28,880
know if you're doing them
 

8363
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:30,650
know if you're doing them
unpartitioned then

8364
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:30,660
unpartitioned then
 

8365
02:29:30,660 --> 02:29:32,090
unpartitioned then
you know it takes longer to get through

8366
02:29:32,090 --> 02:29:32,100
you know it takes longer to get through
 

8367
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:33,770
you know it takes longer to get through
the 100 pull-ups because you you know

8368
02:29:33,770 --> 02:29:33,780
the 100 pull-ups because you you know
 

8369
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:35,270
the 100 pull-ups because you you know
anytime you're resting in between the

8370
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:35,280
anytime you're resting in between the
 

8371
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:36,950
anytime you're resting in between the
pull-ups you're not also doing push-ups

8372
02:29:36,950 --> 02:29:36,960
pull-ups you're not also doing push-ups
 

8373
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:39,530
pull-ups you're not also doing push-ups
and and squats so so yeah so my I'm sure

8374
02:29:39,530 --> 02:29:39,540
and and squats so so yeah so my I'm sure
 

8375
02:29:39,540 --> 02:29:41,510
and and squats so so yeah so my I'm sure

02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:26,870
kind of a one-on-one or talking to a
couple of people I'm I I have a very

8530
02:32:26,870 --> 02:32:26,880
couple of people I'm I I have a very
 

8531
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,610
couple of people I'm I I have a very
hard time just sitting I feel like it

8532
02:32:28,610 --> 02:32:28,620
hard time just sitting I feel like it
 

8533
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:30,469
hard time just sitting I feel like it
gets super stiff it like feels really

8534
02:32:30,469 --> 02:32:30,479
gets super stiff it like feels really
 

8535
02:32:30,479 --> 02:32:31,910
gets super stiff it like feels really
bad

8536
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:31,920
bad
 

8537
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:32,809
bad
um

8538
02:32:32,809 --> 02:32:32,819
um
 

8539
02:32:32,819 --> 02:32:35,750
um
but I don't know I being physical is

8540
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:35,760
but I don't know I being physical is
 

8541
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:38,090
but I don't know I being physical is
very important to me I think it's um I

8542
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:38,100
very important to me I think it's um I
 

8543
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:39,950
very important to me I think it's um I
do not believe this gets to the question

8544
02:32:39,950 --> 02:32:39,960
do not believe this gets to the question
 

8545
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:41,270
do not believe this gets to the question
about AI

8546
02:32:41,270 --> 02:32:41,280
about AI
 

8547
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,849
about AI
I don't think that a being is just a

8548
02:32:43,849 --> 02:32:43,859
I don't think that a being is just a
 

8549
02:32:43,859 --> 02:32:45,050
I don't think that a being is just a
mind

8550
02:32:45,050 --> 02:32:45,060
mind
 

8551
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:46,730
mind
um and I think we're we're kind of meant

8552
02:32:46,730 --> 02:32:46,740
um and I think we're we're kind of meant
 

8553
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:47,630
um and I think we're we're kind of meant
to

8554
02:32:47,630 --> 02:32:47,640
to
 

8555
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:51,349
to
do things and like physically and and a

8556
02:32:51,349 --> 02:32:51,359
do things and like physically and and a
 

8557
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:54,290
do things and like physically and and a
lot of the sensations that we feel are

8558
02:32:54,290 --> 02:32:54,300
lot of the sensations that we feel are
 

8559
02:32:54,300 --> 02:32:55,910
lot of the sensations that we feel are
um are are connected to that and I think

8560
02:32:55,910 --> 02:32:55,920
um are are connected to that and I think
 

8561
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,469
um are are connected to that and I think
that that's a lot of what makes you a

8562
02:32:57,469 --> 02:32:57,479
that that's a lot of what makes you a
 

8563
02:32:57,479 --> 02:33:00,290
that that's a lot of what makes you a
human is is basically you know having

8564
02:33:00,290 --> 02:33:00,300
human is is basically you know having
 

8565
02:33:00,300 --> 02:33:01,550
human is is basically you know having
those

8566
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:01,560
those
 

8567
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:04,429
those
having you know that set of Sensations

8568
02:33:04,429 --> 02:33:04,439
having you know that set of Sensations
 

8569
02:33:04,439 --> 02:33:05,510
having you know that set of Sensations
and

8570
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:05,520
and
 

8571
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:07,969
and
experiences around that

8572
02:33:07,969 --> 02:33:07,979
experiences around that
 

8573
02:33:07,979 --> 02:33:11,330
experiences around that
coupled with a mind to reason about them

8574
02:33:11,330 --> 02:33:11,340
coupled with a mind to reason about them
 

8575
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:14,929
coupled with a mind to reason about them
um but I don't know I I think it's

8576
02:33:14,929 --> 02:33:14,939
um but I don't know I I think it's
 

8577
02:33:14,939 --> 02:33:17,570
um but I don't know I I think it's
important for balance to

8578
02:33:17,570 --> 02:33:17,580
important for balance to
 

8579
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:19,790
important for balance to
to kind of get out challenge yourself in

8580
02:33:19,790 --> 02:33:19,800
to kind of get out challenge yourself in
 

8581
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:21,530
to kind of get out challenge yourself in
different ways learn different skills

8582
02:33:21,530 --> 02:33:21,540
different ways learn different skills
 

8583
02:33:21,540 --> 02:33:25,190
different ways learn different skills
clear your mind do you think

8584
02:33:25,190 --> 02:33:25,200
clear your mind do you think
 

8585
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:27,410
clear your mind do you think
AI in order to become super intelligent

8586
02:33:27,410 --> 02:33:27,420
AI in order to become super intelligent
 

8587
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:31,490
AI in order to become super intelligent
in AGI should have a body

8588
02:33:31,490 --> 02:33:31,500

 

8589
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:35,630

it depends on on what the goal is I

8590
02:33:35,630 --> 02:33:35,640
it depends on on what the goal is I
 

8591
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:37,969
it depends on on what the goal is I
think that there's this assumption

8592
02:33:37,969 --> 02:33:37,979
think that there's this assumption
 

8593
02:33:37,979 --> 02:33:40,130
think that there's this assumption
in that question that

8594
02:33:40,130 --> 02:33:40,140
in that question that
 

8595
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:43,130
in that question that
intelligence intelligence should be kind

8596
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:43,140
intelligence intelligence should be kind
 

8597
02:33:43,140 --> 02:33:45,710
intelligence intelligence should be kind
of person-like whereas you know as we

8598
02:33:45,710 --> 02:33:45,720
of person-like whereas you know as we
 

8599
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:48,170
of person-like whereas you know as we
were just talking about

8600
02:33:48,170 --> 02:33:48,180
were just talking about
 

8601
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:51,050
were just talking about
um you can have these greater than

8602
02:33:51,050 --> 02:33:51,060
um you can have these greater than
 

8603
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:53,750
um you can have these greater than
single human intelligent organisms like

8604
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:53,760
single human intelligent organisms like
 

8605
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,730
single human intelligent organisms like
the stock market which obviously do not

8606
02:33:55,730 --> 02:33:55,740
the stock market which obviously do not
 

8607
02:33:55,740 --> 02:33:57,469
the stock market which obviously do not
have bodies and do not speak a language

8608
02:33:57,469 --> 02:33:57,479
have bodies and do not speak a language
 

8609
02:33:57,479 --> 02:33:59,929
have bodies and do not speak a language
right and like you know and and just

8610
02:33:59,929 --> 02:33:59,939
right and like you know and and just
 

8611
02:33:59,939 --> 02:34:02,809
right and like you know and and just
kind of have their own

8612
02:34:02,809 --> 02:34:02,819
kind of have their own
 

8613
02:34:02,819 --> 02:34:04,070
kind of have their own
system

8614
02:34:04,070 --> 02:34:04,080
system
 

8615
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:06,050
system
um but

8616
02:34:06,050 --> 02:34:06,060
um but
 

8617
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:07,969
um but
so I don't know my guess is

8618
02:34:07,969 --> 02:34:07,979
so I don't know my guess is
 

8619
02:34:07,979 --> 02:34:10,070
so I don't know my guess is
um it will there will be limits to what

8620
02:34:10,070 --> 02:34:10,080
um it will there will be limits to what
 

8621
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:12,170
um it will there will be limits to what
A system that is purely an intelligence

8622
02:34:12,170 --> 02:34:12,180
A system that is purely an intelligence
 

8623
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:14,870
A system that is purely an intelligence
can understand about the Human Condition

8624
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:14,880
can understand about the Human Condition
 

8625
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:18,050
can understand about the Human Condition
without having the same not just senses

8626
02:34:18,050 --> 02:34:18,060
without having the same not just senses
 

8627
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:19,790
without having the same not just senses
but like

8628
02:34:19,790 --> 02:34:19,800
but like
 

8629
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:22,670
but like
our bodies change as we get older right

8630
02:34:22,670 --> 02:34:22,680
our bodies change as we get older right
 

8631
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:25,070
our bodies change as we get older right
and we kind of evolve and

8632
02:34:25,070 --> 02:34:25,080
and we kind of evolve and
 

8633
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:28,969
and we kind of evolve and
I think that those very subtle

8634
02:34:28,969 --> 02:34:28,979
I think that those very subtle
 

8635
02:34:28,979 --> 02:34:31,190
I think that those very subtle
physical changes

8636
02:34:31,190 --> 02:34:31,200
physical changes
 

8637
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:33,650
physical changes
just drive a lot of social patterns and

8638
02:34:33,650 --> 02:34:33,660
just drive a lot of social patterns and
 

8639
02:34:33,660 --> 02:34:36,290
just drive a lot of social patterns and
behavior around like when you choose to

8640
02:34:36,290 --> 02:34:36,300
behavior around like when you choose to
 

8641
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:38,090
behavior around like when you choose to
have kids right like just like all these

8642
02:34:38,090 --> 02:34:38,100
have kids right like just like all these
 

8643
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:39,590
have kids right like just like all these
you know that's not even subtle that's a

8644
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:39,600
you know that's not even subtle that's a
 

8645
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:41,090
you know that's not even subtle that's a
major one right but like

8646
02:34:41,090 --> 02:34:41,100
major one right but like
 

8647
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:42,469
major one right but like
um you know how you design things around

8648
02:34:42,469 --> 02:34:42,479
um you know how you design things around
 

8649
02:34:42,479 --> 02:34:43,610
um you know how you design things around
the house

8650
02:34:43,610 --> 02:34:43,620
the house
 

8651
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:46,550
the house
um so yeah I mean I think I think it

8652
02:34:46,550 --> 02:34:46,560
um so yeah I mean I think I think it
 

8653
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:48,349
um so yeah I mean I think I think it
would if the goal is to understand

8654
02:34:48,349 --> 02:34:48,359
would if the goal is to understand
 

8655
02:34:48,359 --> 02:34:50,150
would if the goal is to understand
people as much as possible I think I

8656
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:50,160
people as much as possible I think I
 

8657
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,330
people as much as possible I think I
think that that's

8658
02:34:52,330 --> 02:34:52,340
think that that's
 

8659
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:54,650
think that that's
trying to model those Sensations is

8660
02:34:54,650 --> 02:34:54,660
trying to model those Sensations is
 

8661
02:34:54,660 --> 02:34:56,630
trying to model those Sensations is
probably somewhat important but I think

8662
02:34:56,630 --> 02:34:56,640
probably somewhat important but I think
 

8663
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,770
probably somewhat important but I think
there's a lot of value that can be

8664
02:34:57,770 --> 02:34:57,780
there's a lot of value that can be
 

8665
02:34:57,780 --> 02:34:59,450
there's a lot of value that can be
created by having intelligence even that

8666
02:34:59,450 --> 02:34:59,460
created by having intelligence even that
 

8667
02:34:59,460 --> 02:35:01,370
created by having intelligence even that
that is that is separate from that is a

8668
02:35:01,370 --> 02:35:01,380
that is that is separate from that is a
 

8669
02:35:01,380 --> 02:35:03,469
that is that is separate from that is a
separate thing uh so one of the features

8670
02:35:03,469 --> 02:35:03,479
separate thing uh so one of the features
 

8671
02:35:03,479 --> 02:35:07,010
separate thing uh so one of the features
of being human is that we're mortal we

8672
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:07,020
of being human is that we're mortal we
 

8673
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:10,610
of being human is that we're mortal we
die uh we've talked about AI a lot about

8674
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:10,620
die uh we've talked about AI a lot about
 

8675
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:14,270
die uh we've talked about AI a lot about
potentially replicas of ourselves uh do

8676
02:35:14,270 --> 02:35:14,280
potentially replicas of ourselves uh do
 

8677
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:15,889
potentially replicas of ourselves uh do
you think there will be AI replicas of

8678
02:35:15,889 --> 02:35:15,899
you think there will be AI replicas of
 

8679
02:35:15,899 --> 02:35:17,450
you think there will be AI replicas of
you and me that persists long after

8680
02:35:17,450 --> 02:35:17,460
you and me that persists long after
 

8681
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:18,650
you and me that persists long after
we're gone

8682
02:35:18,650 --> 02:35:18,660
we're gone
 

8683
02:35:18,660 --> 02:35:24,410
we're gone
that family and loved ones can talk to

8684
02:35:24,410 --> 02:35:24,420

 

8685
02:35:24,420 --> 02:35:26,510

I think we'll have the capacity to do

8686
02:35:26,510 --> 02:35:26,520
I think we'll have the capacity to do
 

8687
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:28,370
I think we'll have the capacity to do
something like that and I think one of

8688
02:35:28,370 --> 02:35:28,380
something like that and I think one of
 

8689
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:30,230
something like that and I think one of
the big questions

8690
02:35:30,230 --> 02:35:30,240
the big questions
 

8691
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:32,990
the big questions
that we've had to struggle with in the

8692
02:35:32,990 --> 02:35:33,000
that we've had to struggle with in the
 

8693
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,370
that we've had to struggle with in the
context of

8694
02:35:34,370 --> 02:35:34,380
context of
 

8695
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:37,790
context of
social networks is who gets to make that

8696
02:35:37,790 --> 02:35:37,800
social networks is who gets to make that
 

8697
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:40,550
social networks is who gets to make that
um and you know and my answer to that

8698
02:35:40,550 --> 02:35:40,560
um and you know and my answer to that
 

8699
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:41,990
um and you know and my answer to that
you know in the context of the work that

8700
02:35:41,990 --> 02:35:42,000
you know in the context of the work that
 

8701
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,429
you know in the context of the work that
we're doing is that that should be your

8702
02:35:43,429 --> 02:35:43,439
we're doing is that that should be your
 

8703
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:44,990
we're doing is that that should be your
choice right I don't think anyone should

8704
02:35:44,990 --> 02:35:45,000
choice right I don't think anyone should
 

8705
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,510
choice right I don't think anyone should
be able to choose to make a Lex spot

8706
02:35:47,510 --> 02:35:47,520
be able to choose to make a Lex spot
 

8707
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:50,450
be able to choose to make a Lex spot
that people can

8708
02:35:50,450 --> 02:35:50,460
that people can
 

8709
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:52,730
that people can
can choose to talk to and get to train

8710
02:35:52,730 --> 02:35:52,740
can choose to talk to and get to train
 

8711
02:35:52,740 --> 02:35:54,950
can choose to talk to and get to train
that yeah and we've kind of we have this

8712
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:54,960
that yeah and we've kind of we have this
 

8713
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:56,690
that yeah and we've kind of we have this
precedent of making some of these calls

8714
02:35:56,690 --> 02:35:56,700
precedent of making some of these calls
 

8715
02:35:56,700 --> 02:35:57,830
precedent of making some of these calls
where

8716
02:35:57,830 --> 02:35:57,840
where
 

8717
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:01,429
where
I mean someone can create a page for uh

8718
02:36:01,429 --> 02:36:01,439
I mean someone can create a page for uh
 

8719
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:04,610
I mean someone can create a page for uh
a Lex fan club but you can't create a

8720
02:36:04,610 --> 02:36:04,620
a Lex fan club but you can't create a
 

8721
02:36:04,620 --> 02:36:07,790
a Lex fan club but you can't create a
page and say that you relax yes right

8722
02:36:07,790 --> 02:36:07,800
page and say that you relax yes right
 

8723
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:08,510
page and say that you relax yes right
um

8724
02:36:08,510 --> 02:36:08,520
um
 

8725
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:11,090
um
so I think that this similarly I think

8726
02:36:11,090 --> 02:36:11,100
so I think that this similarly I think
 

8727
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:13,309
so I think that this similarly I think
I mean maybe you know someone maybe can

8728
02:36:13,309 --> 02:36:13,319
I mean maybe you know someone maybe can
 

8729
02:36:13,319 --> 02:36:15,530
I mean maybe you know someone maybe can
make a should be able to make an AI

8730
02:36:15,530 --> 02:36:15,540
make a should be able to make an AI
 

8731
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:17,750
make a should be able to make an AI
That's um that's a Lex admirer that

8732
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:17,760
That's um that's a Lex admirer that
 

8733
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:19,010
That's um that's a Lex admirer that
someone can talk to but I think it

8734
02:36:19,010 --> 02:36:19,020
someone can talk to but I think it
 

8735
02:36:19,020 --> 02:36:20,990
someone can talk to but I think it
should ultimately be your call

8736
02:36:20,990 --> 02:36:21,000
should ultimately be your call
 

8737
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,730
should ultimately be your call
whether

8738
02:36:22,730 --> 02:36:22,740
whether
 

8739
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:25,969
whether
there is a Lex AI well I'm open sourcing

8740
02:36:25,969 --> 02:36:25,979
there is a Lex AI well I'm open sourcing
 

8741
02:36:25,979 --> 02:36:28,630
there is a Lex AI well I'm open sourcing
The Lex

8742
02:36:28,630 --> 02:36:28,640

 

8743
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:32,510

so uh you're a man of Faith what what

8744
02:36:32,510 --> 02:36:32,520
so uh you're a man of Faith what what
 

8745
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:34,429
so uh you're a man of Faith what what
role has Faith played in your life and

8746
02:36:34,429 --> 02:36:34,439

8747
02:36:34,439 --> 02:36:35,929
role has Faith played in your life and
your understanding of the world and the

8748
02:36:35,929 --> 02:36:35,939
your understanding of the world and the
 

8749
02:36:35,939 --> 02:36:37,730
your understanding of the world and the
understanding of your own life

8750
02:36:37,730 --> 02:36:37,740

and how to
your work impacts the world

8756
02:36:46,670 --> 02:36:46,680

 

8757
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:47,990

yeah I think that there's a few

8758
02:36:47,990 --> 02:36:48,000
yeah I think that there's a few
 

8759
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,190
yeah I think that there's a few
different parts of this that are

8760
02:36:49,190 --> 02:36:49,200
different parts of this that are
 

8761
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:50,929
different parts of this that are
relevant

8762
02:36:50,929 --> 02:36:50,939
relevant
 

8763
02:36:50,939 --> 02:36:51,650
relevant
um

8764
02:36:51,650 --> 02:36:51,660
um
 

8765
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:53,750
um
there's sort of a philosophical part and

8766
02:36:53,750 --> 02:36:53,760
there's sort of a philosophical part and
 

8767
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:55,309
there's sort of a philosophical part and
there's a cultural part

8768
02:36:55,309 --> 02:36:55,319
there's a cultural part
 

8769
02:36:55,319 --> 02:36:59,690
there's a cultural part
and one of the most basic lessons is uh

8770
02:36:59,690 --> 02:36:59,700
and one of the most basic lessons is uh
 

8771
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:01,070
and one of the most basic lessons is uh
right at the beginning of Genesis right

8772
02:37:01,070 --> 02:37:01,080
right at the beginning of Genesis right
 

8773
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:03,710
right at the beginning of Genesis right
it's like God creates the Earth and

8774
02:37:03,710 --> 02:37:03,720
it's like God creates the Earth and
 

8775
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:05,809
it's like God creates the Earth and
creates people and creates people in

8776
02:37:05,809 --> 02:37:05,819
creates people and creates people in
 

8777
02:37:05,819 --> 02:37:08,809
creates people and creates people in
God's image and there's the question of

8778
02:37:08,809 --> 02:37:08,819
God's image and there's the question of
 

8779
02:37:08,819 --> 02:37:10,610
God's image and there's the question of
you know what does that mean and all the

8780
02:37:10,610 --> 02:37:10,620
you know what does that mean and all the
 

8781
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:12,469
you know what does that mean and all the
only context that you have about God at

8782
02:37:12,469 --> 02:37:12,479
only context that you have about God at
 

8783
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:13,730
only context that you have about God at
that point in the Old Testament is that

8784
02:37:13,730 --> 02:37:13,740
that point in the Old Testament is that
 

8785
02:37:13,740 --> 02:37:16,550
that point in the Old Testament is that
he's God has created things so I I

8786
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:16,560
he's God has created things so I I
 

8787
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:17,690
he's God has created things so I I
always thought that like one of the

8788
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:17,700
always thought that like one of the
 

8789
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:20,870
always thought that like one of the
interesting lessons from that is that

8790
02:37:20,870 --> 02:37:20,880
interesting lessons from that is that
 

8791
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:24,230
interesting lessons from that is that
there's a virtue in creating things

8792
02:37:24,230 --> 02:37:24,240
there's a virtue in creating things
 

8793
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:27,590
there's a virtue in creating things
that is like whether it's artistic or

8794
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:27,600
that is like whether it's artistic or
 

8795
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:29,210
that is like whether it's artistic or
whether you're

8796
02:37:29,210 --> 02:37:29,220
whether you're
 

8797
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:30,650
whether you're
building things that are functionally

8798
02:37:30,650 --> 02:37:30,660
building things that are functionally
 

8799
02:37:30,660 --> 02:37:33,230
building things that are functionally
useful for other people

8800
02:37:33,230 --> 02:37:33,240
useful for other people
 

8801
02:37:33,240 --> 02:37:34,250
useful for other people
um

8802
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:34,260
um
 

8803
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:37,250
um
I've got that by itself

8804
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:37,260
I've got that by itself
 

8805
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:39,290
I've got that by itself
is a good

8806
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:39,300
is a good
 

8807
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:40,730
is a good
and

8808
02:37:40,730 --> 02:37:40,740
and
 

8809
02:37:40,740 --> 02:37:42,230
and
I

8810
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:42,240
I
 

8811
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:44,150
I
that kind of drives a lot of how I think

8812
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:44,160
that kind of drives a lot of how I think
 

8813
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:45,170
that kind of drives a lot of how I think
about

8814
02:37:45,170 --> 02:37:45,180
about
 

8815
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:48,830
about
morality and my my personal philosophy

morality and my my personal philosophy
around like what what is a good life

in the world that is helping to you know
 

8829
02:38:04,439 --> 02:38:06,410
in the world that is helping to you know
bring new things into the world whether

8830
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:06,420
bring new things into the world whether
 

8831
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:08,150
bring new things into the world whether
they're you know amazing other people

8832
02:38:08,150 --> 02:38:08,160
they're you know amazing other people
 

8833
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:11,150

kids or

8834
02:38:11,150 --> 02:38:11,160
kids or
 

8835
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:13,490
kids or
um

8836
02:38:13,490 --> 02:38:13,500

 

8837
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:15,170

or just leading to the creation of

8838
02:38:15,170 --> 02:38:15,180
or just leading to the creation of
 

8839
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:16,370
or just leading to the creation of
different things that would have been

8840
02:38:16,370 --> 02:38:16,380
different things that would have been
 

8841
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:18,650
different things that would have been
possible otherwise and so that's a value

8842
02:38:18,650 --> 02:38:18,660
possible otherwise and so that's a value
 

8843
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:20,990
possible otherwise and so that's a value
for me that that that matters deeply and

8844
02:38:20,990 --> 02:38:21,000
for me that that that matters deeply and
 

8845
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,270
for me that that that matters deeply and
I I just I mean I just love you know
