me ask you this question how rare are

these events in the vastness of space
 

79
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,990
these events in the vastness of space
and time or put it in a more fun way how

80
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
and time or put it in a more fun way how
 

81
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,730
and time or put it in a more fun way how
many intelligent aliens civilizations do

you think are out there in this universe

84
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,020
you think are out there in this universe
 

85
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,530
you think are out there in this universe
us being one of them I suppose there

86
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:54,540
us being one of them I suppose there
 

87
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,510
us being one of them I suppose there
should be some statistically but we

88
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,520
should be some statistically but we
 

89
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,910
should be some statistically but we
don't have any evidence but I do think

90
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:58,920
don't have any evidence but I do think
 

91
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,249
don't have any evidence but I do think
that you know intelligence in any way

92
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:01,259
that you know intelligence in any way
 

93
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,929
that you know intelligence in any way
it's a bit overvalued

94
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:02,939
it's a bit overvalued
 

95
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,130
it's a bit overvalued
we are the most intelligent entities on

96
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,140
we are the most intelligent entities on
 

97
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,430
we are the most intelligent entities on
this planet and look what we're doing

98
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,440
this planet and look what we're doing
 

99
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,190
this planet and look what we're doing
so intelligence also tends to be

100
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
so intelligence also tends to be
 

101
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,850
so intelligence also tends to be
self-destructive which implies that if

102
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:16,860
self-destructive which implies that if
 

103
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,670
self-destructive which implies that if
there are or were intelligent life forms

104
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
there are or were intelligent life forms
 

105
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,190
there are or were intelligent life forms
elsewhere maybe they don't survive for

106
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,200
elsewhere maybe they don't survive for
 

107
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,930
elsewhere maybe they don't survive for
long so you think there's a tension

108
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:23,940
long so you think there's a tension
 

109
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,470
long so you think there's a tension
between happiness and intelligence

110
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
between happiness and intelligence
 

111
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,210
between happiness and intelligence
absolutely intelligence is definitely

112
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:29,220
absolutely intelligence is definitely
 

113
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,229
absolutely intelligence is definitely
not

114
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
not
 

115
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,190
not
something that is directed towards

116
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,200
something that is directed towards
 

117
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,890
something that is directed towards
amplifying happiness I I would also

118
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:36,900
amplifying happiness I I would also
 

119
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,570
amplifying happiness I I would also
emphasize the huge huge difference

120
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:38,580
emphasize the huge huge difference
 

121
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,990
emphasize the huge huge difference
between intelligence and Consciousness

122
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,000
between intelligence and Consciousness
 

123
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,150
between intelligence and Consciousness
which many people certainly in the tech

124
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
which many people certainly in the tech
 

125
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,550

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,410
when a computer beats you at chess or go
or whatever it doesn't feel happy if it

168
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:42,420
or whatever it doesn't feel happy if it
 

169
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,690
or whatever it doesn't feel happy if it
loses it doesn't feel sad

170
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:44,700
loses it doesn't feel sad
 

171
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,990
loses it doesn't feel sad
and uh there could be also other highly

172
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
and uh there could be also other highly
 

173
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,369
and uh there could be also other highly
intelligent

174
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:49,379
intelligent
 

175
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,729
intelligent
entities out there in the universe that

176
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:52,739
entities out there in the universe that
 

177
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,850
entities out there in the universe that
have zero Consciousness and I think that

178
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:55,860
have zero Consciousness and I think that
 

179
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,890
have zero Consciousness and I think that
Consciousness is far more important and

180
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:57,900
Consciousness is far more important and
 

181
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,750
Consciousness is far more important and
valuable than intelligence

182
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
valuable than intelligence
 

183
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,670
valuable than intelligence
can you stream on the case that

184
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
can you stream on the case that
 

185
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,890
can you stream on the case that
Consciousness and intelligence

186
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:03,900
Consciousness and intelligence
 

187
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,009
Consciousness and intelligence
are intricately connected so not just in

188
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:07,019
are intricately connected so not just in
 

189
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,589
are intricately connected so not just in
humans but anywhere else they have to go

190
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
humans but anywhere else they have to go
 

191
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,089
humans but anywhere else they have to go
hand in hand is it possible for you to

192
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:11,099
hand in hand is it possible for you to
 

193
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,710
hand in hand is it possible for you to
imagine such a universe

194
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
imagine such a universe
 

195
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,770
imagine such a universe
it it could be but we don't know yet

196
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:15,780
it it could be but we don't know yet
 

197
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,289
it it could be but we don't know yet
again we have examples certainly we know

198
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:18,299
again we have examples certainly we know
 

199
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,569
again we have examples certainly we know
of examples of high intelligence without

200
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:20,579
of examples of high intelligence without
 

201
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,530
of examples of high intelligence without
Consciousness computers are one example

202
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:24,540
Consciousness computers are one example
 

203
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,290
Consciousness computers are one example
um as far as we know

204
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,300
um as far as we know
 

205
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,390
um as far as we know
plants are not conscious

206
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,400
plants are not conscious
 

207
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,629
plants are not conscious
yet they are intelligent they can solve

208
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
yet they are intelligent they can solve
 

209
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,550
yet they are intelligent they can solve
problems they can attain goals in very

210
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
problems they can attain goals in very
 

211
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,710
problems they can attain goals in very
sophisticated ways

212
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
sophisticated ways
 

213
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,469
sophisticated ways
um so um

214
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
um so um
 

215
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,490
um so um
the other way around to have

216
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,500
the other way around to have
 

217
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,350
the other way around to have
Consciousness without any intelligence

218
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
Consciousness without any intelligence
 

219
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,450
Consciousness without any intelligence
this is probably impossible but to

220
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,460
this is probably impossible but to
 

221
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,590
this is probably impossible but to
having intelligence without

222
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
having intelligence without
 

223
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,710
having intelligence without
Consciousness yes that's possible a

224
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
Consciousness yes that's possible a
 

225
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,870
Consciousness yes that's possible a
bigger question is whether any of that

226
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
bigger question is whether any of that
 

227
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,210
bigger question is whether any of that
is tied to organic biochemistry we know

228
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:56,220
is tied to organic biochemistry we know
 

229
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,530
is tied to organic biochemistry we know
on this planet only about carbon-based

230
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:00,540
on this planet only about carbon-based
 

231
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,590
on this planet only about carbon-based
life forms whether you're an amoeba a

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
life forms whether you're an amoeba a
 

233
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,650
life forms whether you're an amoeba a
dinosaur a tree a human being you're

234
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:06,660
dinosaur a tree a human being you're
 

235
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,550
dinosaur a tree a human being you're
based on organic biochemistry

236
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
based on organic biochemistry
 

237
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,050
based on organic biochemistry
um is there an essential connection

238
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,060
um is there an essential connection
 

239
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,689
um is there an essential connection
between organic biochemistry and

240
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:14,699
between organic biochemistry and
 

241
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,330
between organic biochemistry and
Consciousness do all conscious entities

242
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,340
Consciousness do all conscious entities
 

243
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,310
Consciousness do all conscious entities
everywhere in the universe or in the

244
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,320
everywhere in the universe or in the
 

245
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,890
everywhere in the universe or in the
future on planet Earth have to be based

246
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:21,900
future on planet Earth have to be based
 

247
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,230
future on planet Earth have to be based
on carbon is there something so special

248
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
on carbon is there something so special
 

249
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,990
on carbon is there something so special
about carbon as an element that an

250
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,000
about carbon as an element that an
 

251
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,390
about carbon as an element that an
entity based on Silicon will never be

252
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:29,400
entity based on Silicon will never be
 

253
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,909
entity based on Silicon will never be
conscious I don't know maybe

254
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
conscious I don't know maybe
 

255
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,670
conscious I don't know maybe
but again this is a key question about

256
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:34,680
but again this is a key question about
 

257
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,610
but again this is a key question about
computer and computer consciousness

258
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:37,620
computer and computer consciousness
 

259
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,129
computer and computer consciousness
that can computers eventually become

260
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:40,139
that can computers eventually become
 

261
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,870
that can computers eventually become
conscious even though they are not

262
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:41,880
conscious even though they are not
 

263
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,810
conscious even though they are not
organic the jury is still out on that I

264
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:44,820
organic the jury is still out on that I
 

265
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,610
organic the jury is still out on that I
don't know I mean that we have to take

266
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:46,620
don't know I mean that we have to take
 

267
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,010
don't know I mean that we have to take
both options into account well a big

268
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,020
both options into account well a big
 

269
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,450
both options into account well a big
part of that

270
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,460
part of that
 

271
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,170
part of that
is do you think we humans would be able

272
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,180
is do you think we humans would be able
 

273
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,510
is do you think we humans would be able
to detect other intelligent beings other

274
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:56,520
to detect other intelligent beings other
 

275
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,670
to detect other intelligent beings other
conscious beings another way to ask that

276
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,680
conscious beings another way to ask that
 

277
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,170
conscious beings another way to ask that
is it possible that the aliens are

278
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,180
is it possible that the aliens are
 

279
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,510
is it possible that the aliens are
already here and we don't see them

280
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,520
already here and we don't see them
 

281
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,689
already here and we don't see them
meaning are we

282
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:04,699
meaning are we
 

283
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,610
meaning are we
very human-centric in our understanding

284
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:07,620
very human-centric in our understanding
 

285
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,890
very human-centric in our understanding
of one the definition of life to the

of one the definition of life to the

the aliens are here they are just not

think it stands for alien intelligence
 

299
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,629
think it stands for alien intelligence
because uh AI is an alien type of

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
because uh AI is an alien type of
 

301
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,689
because uh AI is an alien type of

it came from Silicon Valley but it is

at a different time scale a different
 

331
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,749
at a different time scale a different
spatial scale and I think that's all

00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:08,759
spatial scale and I think that's all
 

333
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,790
spatial scale and I think that's all
useful when starting to analyze

336
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,300
artificial intelligence
 

337
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,730
artificial intelligence
is

338
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:13,740
is
 

339
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,189
is
possible that even the language models

00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:16,199
possible that even the language models
 

341
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,809
possible that even the language models
the larger language models we have today

342
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:17,819
the larger language models we have today
 

343
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,749
the larger language models we have today
are already conscious I I highly doubt

344
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:20,759
are already conscious I I highly doubt
 

345
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,050
are already conscious I I highly doubt
it but I think Consciousness in

social convention that all human beings
are conscious it's also applies to

397
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,409
Frozen pigment you don't think about it
as a conscious entity why do you think

as a conscious entity why do you think
 

399
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,110
as a conscious entity why do you think
of your dog as conscious but not of the

of your dog as conscious but not of the

of the bacon that you buy because you
 

403
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,769
of the bacon that you buy because you
build a relationship with the dog and

you don't have a relationship with the

that the Turing test is a social test
 

415
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,750
that the Turing test is a social test
it's not a logical proof now if you

416
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:56,760
it's not a logical proof now if you
 

417
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,110
it's not a logical proof now if you
establish a a mutual relationship with

an entity
when you are invested in it emotionally

when you are invested in it emotionally
 

423
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,810
when you are invested in it emotionally
you're almost compelled to feel that the

you're almost compelled to feel that the
 

425
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,630
you're almost compelled to feel that the
other side is also conscious

426
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:11,640
other side is also conscious
 

427
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,150
other side is also conscious
and when it comes down to Ai and

428
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
and when it comes down to Ai and
 

429
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,670
and when it comes down to Ai and
computers I think and I don't think that

430
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:16,680
computers I think and I don't think that
 

431
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,410

at the present moment computers are

at the present moment computers are
 

433
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,150
at the present moment computers are
conscious but people are already forming

therefore

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
therefore
 

439
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,570
therefore
almost irresist it's almost irresistible

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:29,580
almost irresist it's almost irresistible

they're compelled to to increasingly

they're compelled to to increasingly
 

443
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,670
they're compelled to to increasingly
feel that these are conscious entities

444
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680
feel that these are conscious entities
 

445
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,810
feel that these are conscious entities
and I think

446
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:35,820
and I think
 

447
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,329
and I think
we are quite close to the point when the

448
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:38,339
we are quite close to the point when the
 

449
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,550
we are quite close to the point when the
legal system will have to take this into

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
legal system will have to take this into
 

451
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,650
legal system will have to take this into
account

452
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:41,660
account
 

453
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,630
account
that even though I don't think computers

454
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
that even though I don't think computers
 

455
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,370
that even though I don't think computers
have Consciousness I think we are close

456
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:46,380
have Consciousness I think we are close
 

457
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,130
have Consciousness I think we are close
to the point the legal system will start

458
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,140
to the point the legal system will start
 

459
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,889
to the point the legal system will start
treating them as conscious entities

460
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:51,899
treating them as conscious entities

because of this social convention

because of this social convention
 

463
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,449
because of this social convention
what to you is uh social convention

464
00:09:59,449 --> 00:09:59,459
what to you is uh social convention
 

465
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,470
what to you is uh social convention
just a funny little side effect a little

466
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
just a funny little side effect a little
 

467
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,210
just a funny little side effect a little
artifact or is it fundamental to what

468
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,220
artifact or is it fundamental to what
 

469
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,009
artifact or is it fundamental to what
Consciousness is because if it is

470
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:07,019
Consciousness is because if it is
 

471
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,470
Consciousness is because if it is
fundamental then it seems like AI is

472
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:09,480
fundamental then it seems like AI is
 

473
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,850
fundamental then it seems like AI is
very good at forming these kinds of deep

474
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:10,860
very good at forming these kinds of deep
 

475
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,710
very good at forming these kinds of deep
relationships with humans yeah and

476
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
relationships with humans yeah and
 

477
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,130
relationships with humans yeah and
therefore it will be able to be a nice

478
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:15,140
therefore it will be able to be a nice
 

479

therefore it will be able to be a nice

this is one of the biggest obstacles in

this is one of the biggest obstacles in

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,269
this is one of the biggest obstacles in
human relationships and computers don't

human relationships and computers don't
 

551
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,190
human relationships and computers don't
have this problem because they don't

552
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
have this problem because they don't
 

553
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,889
have this problem because they don't
have any emotions of their own so you

554
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:51,899
have any emotions of their own so you
 

555
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,449
have any emotions of their own so you
know when a computer is talking to you

556
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:53,459
know when a computer is talking to you
 

557
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,150

its own and paradoxically this means
 

567
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,810
its own and paradoxically this means
that computers can

that computers can
 

569
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,430
that computers can
fool people

570
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:10,440
fool people
 

571
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,850
fool people
into feeling that oh there is a

I feel and they often don't and now you

592
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,220
I feel and they often don't and now you
 

593
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,910
I feel and they often don't and now you
have this entity which a hundred percent

594
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:40,920
have this entity which a hundred percent
 

595
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,129
have this entity which a hundred percent
of its attention is just on what what I

596

of its attention is just on what what I
 

597
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,949
of its attention is just on what what I
feel and this is a huge huge Temptation

598
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:45,959
feel and this is a huge huge Temptation
 

599
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,370
feel and this is a huge huge Temptation
and I think also a huge huge danger well

600
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,380
and I think also a huge huge danger well
 

601
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,069
and I think also a huge huge danger well
the interesting Catch-22 there is you

602
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
the interesting Catch-22 there is you
 

603
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,949
the interesting Catch-22 there is you
said somebody to listen to us yes we

604
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
said somebody to listen to us yes we
 

605
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,930
said somebody to listen to us yes we
want somebody to listen to us but for us

606

want somebody to listen to us but for us
 

607
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,690
want somebody to listen to us but for us
to respect that somebody

608
00:12:59,690 --> 00:12:59,700
to respect that somebody
 

609
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,990
to respect that somebody
they sometimes have to also not listen

610
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,000
they sometimes have to also not listen
 

611
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,310
they sometimes have to also not listen
it's like

612
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
it's like
 

613
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,990
it's like
um they kind of have to be an

614
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
um they kind of have to be an
 

615
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,430
um they kind of have to be an
sometimes they have to have moods

616
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
sometimes they have to have moods
 

617
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,990
sometimes they have to have moods
sometimes they have to have like

618
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,000
sometimes they have to have like
 

619
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,150
sometimes they have to have like
self-importance and confidence and and

620
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,160
self-importance and confidence and and
 

621
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,250
self-importance and confidence and and
we should have a little bit of fear that

622
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,260
we should have a little bit of fear that
 

623
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,050
we should have a little bit of fear that
they can walk away at any moment there

624
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,060
they can walk away at any moment there
 

625
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,850
they can walk away at any moment there
should be a little bit of that tension

626
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:16,860
should be a little bit of that tension
 

627
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,850
should be a little bit of that tension
so it's like absolutely but even that I

628
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:19,860
so it's like absolutely but even that I
 

629
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,970
so it's like absolutely but even that I
mean the thing is if social scientists

630
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:22,980
mean the thing is if social scientists
 

631
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,910
mean the thing is if social scientists
and psychologists establish that I don't

632
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
and psychologists establish that I don't
 

633
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,329
and psychologists establish that I don't
know 17 inattention is good for a

634
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:29,339
know 17 inattention is good for a
 

635
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,710
know 17 inattention is good for a
conversation because then you feel

636
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
conversation because then you feel
 

637
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,210
conversation because then you feel
challenged or you need to grab this

638
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,220
challenged or you need to grab this
 

639
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,430
challenged or you need to grab this
person's attention you can program the

640
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:34,440
person's attention you can program the
 

641
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,970
person's attention you can program the
AI to have 17 exactly 17 in attention

642

AI to have 17 exactly 17 in attention
 

643
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,329
AI to have 17 exactly 17 in attention
not one percentage more or less or it

is the the ideal percentage again you
you can create over the last 10 years we

have creating machines for grabbing
 

653
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,550
have creating machines for grabbing
people's attention

654
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:55,560
people's attention
 

655
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,110
people's attention
this is what has been happening on

656
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
this is what has been happening on
 

657
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,329
this is what has been happening on
social media

658
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:58,339
social media
 

659
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,730
social media
now we are designing machines for

660
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:01,740
now we are designing machines for
 

661
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,009
now we are designing machines for
grabbing human intimacy

662
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,019
grabbing human intimacy
 

663
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,590
grabbing human intimacy
which in many ways is much much more

664
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:06,600
which in many ways is much much more
 

665
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,870
which in many ways is much much more
dangerous and scary already the machines

666
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
dangerous and scary already the machines
 

667
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,329
dangerous and scary already the machines
for grabbing attention we've seen how

668
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:11,339
for grabbing attention we've seen how
 

669
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,150
for grabbing attention we've seen how
much social and political damage they

670
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
much social and political damage they
 

671
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,090
much social and political damage they
could do by in in when you buy kind of

672
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,100
could do by in in when you buy kind of
 

673
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,790
could do by in in when you buy kind of
distorting the public conversation

674
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
distorting the public conversation
 

675
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,730

and social weapons of mass destruction
 

683
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,069
and social weapons of mass destruction
if we don't

00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:33,079
if we don't
 

685
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,170
if we don't
regulate it if we don't train ourselves

686
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,180
regulate it if we don't train ourselves
 

687
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,350
regulate it if we don't train ourselves
to deal with it it could destroy the

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
to deal with it it could destroy the
 

689
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,930
to deal with it it could destroy the
foundations of human society well one of

um the not widely accepted conspiracy
 

735
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,490
um the not widely accepted conspiracy
theories but that here's the kind of

theories but that here's the kind of
 

737
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,050
theories but that here's the kind of
backing for those conspiracies it just

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,060
backing for those conspiracies it just
 

739
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,329
backing for those conspiracies it just
lays it all out and with a calm language

It All it's it's quite refreshing of

750
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:47,699
It All it's it's quite refreshing of
 

751
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,730
It All it's it's quite refreshing of
course those are the early days and you

752
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:49,740
course those are the early days and you
 

753
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,670
course those are the early days and you
know people can step in and start to

754
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:52,680
know people can step in and start to
 

755
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,889
know people can step in and start to
censor to manipulate those algorithms to

756
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:54,899
censor to manipulate those algorithms to
 

757
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,810
censor to manipulate those algorithms to
start to input some of the human biases

758
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:56,820
start to input some of the human biases
 

759
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,090
start to input some of the human biases
in there as opposed to the what's

760
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,100
in there as opposed to the what's
 

761
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,790
in there as opposed to the what's
currently happening is kind of

762
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:01,800
currently happening is kind of
 

763
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,889
currently happening is kind of
the internet is input

764
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:03,899
the internet is input
 

765
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,889
the internet is input
uh compress it and have a nice little

766
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:06,899
uh compress it and have a nice little
 

767
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,009
uh compress it and have a nice little
output that uh gives an overview of the

768
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:10,019
output that uh gives an overview of the
 

769
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,569
output that uh gives an overview of the
different issues so I mean there's a lot

770
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:11,579
different issues so I mean there's a lot
 

771
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,850
different issues so I mean there's a lot
of promise there also right absolutely I

772
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:13,860
of promise there also right absolutely I
 

773
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,530
of promise there also right absolutely I
mean if there was no problems promise

774
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:15,540
mean if there was no problems promise
 

775
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,150
mean if there was no problems promise
there was no problem you know if this

776
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,160
there was no problem you know if this
 

777
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,769
there was no problem you know if this
technology could not accomplish anything

778
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:18,779
technology could not accomplish anything
 

779
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,170
technology could not accomplish anything
good nobody would develop it now

780
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:21,180
good nobody would develop it now
 

781
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,389
good nobody would develop it now
obviously it has tremendous positive

782
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:23,399
obviously it has tremendous positive
 

783
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,670
obviously it has tremendous positive
potential in things like what you just

784
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
potential in things like what you just
 

785
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,410
potential in things like what you just
described in you know better medicine

786
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:27,420
described in you know better medicine
 

787
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,810
described in you know better medicine
better Healthcare better education so

788
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:29,820
better Healthcare better education so
 

789
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,970
better Healthcare better education so
many promises and but this is also why

790
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:31,980
many promises and but this is also why
 

791
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,030
many promises and but this is also why
it's so dangerous because uh the the the

792
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
it's so dangerous because uh the the the
 

793
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,930
it's so dangerous because uh the the the
drive to develop it faster and faster is

794
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:38,940
drive to develop it faster and faster is
 

795
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,509
drive to develop it faster and faster is
there and it has some dangerous

796
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
there and it has some dangerous
 

797
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,970
there and it has some dangerous
potential also and we shouldn't ignore

798
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:43,980
potential also and we shouldn't ignore
 

799
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,889
potential also and we shouldn't ignore
it again I'm not advocating Banning it

800
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:45,899
it again I'm not advocating Banning it
 

801
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,650
it again I'm not advocating Banning it
uh just to be you know careful about how

802
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:48,660
uh just to be you know careful about how
 

803
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,290
uh just to be you know careful about how
we not not so much develop it but most

804
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:51,300
we not not so much develop it but most
 

805
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,509
we not not so much develop it but most
importantly how we deploy it into the

806
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
importantly how we deploy it into the
 

807
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,189
importantly how we deploy it into the
public sphere this is the key question

808
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
public sphere this is the key question
 

809
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,290
public sphere this is the key question
and you know you look back at history

810
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:57,300
and you know you look back at history
 

811
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,930
and you know you look back at history
and one of the things we we know from

812
00:16:59,930 --> 00:16:59,940
and one of the things we we know from
 

813
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,050
and one of the things we we know from
history humans are not good with new

814
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,060
history humans are not good with new
 

815
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,630
history humans are not good with new
technologies I hear many people now say

816
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:05,640
technologies I hear many people now say
 

817
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,850
technologies I hear many people now say
you know AI it's uh we've been here

818
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:07,860
you know AI it's uh we've been here
 

819
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,949
you know AI it's uh we've been here
before we had the radio we had the

820
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:09,959
before we had the radio we had the
 

821
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,449
before we had the radio we had the
printing press we had the Industrial

822
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:11,459
printing press we had the Industrial
 

823
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,490
printing press we had the Industrial
Revolution every time there is a big new

824
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:13,500
Revolution every time there is a big new
 

825
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,829
Revolution every time there is a big new
technology people are afraid and it will

826
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
technology people are afraid and it will
 

827
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,470
technology people are afraid and it will
take jobs and build up the Bad actors

828
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
take jobs and build up the Bad actors
 

829
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,449
take jobs and build up the Bad actors
and in the end it's okay

830
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:20,459
and in the end it's okay
 

831
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,030
and in the end it's okay
and as a historian my tendency is yes in

832
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,040
and as a historian my tendency is yes in
 

833
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,929
and as a historian my tendency is yes in
the end it's okay but in the end there

834
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:26,939
the end it's okay but in the end there
 

835
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,590
the end it's okay but in the end there
is a learning curve there is a kind of a

836
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:30,600
is a learning curve there is a kind of a
 

837
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,370
is a learning curve there is a kind of a
lot of failed experiments on the way to

838
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:34,380
lot of failed experiments on the way to
 

839
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,110
lot of failed experiments on the way to
to learning how to use the new

840
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,120
to learning how to use the new
 

841
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,110
to learning how to use the new
technology and these failed experiments

842
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
technology and these failed experiments
 

843
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,690
technology and these failed experiments
could cause the lives of hundreds of

844
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:41,700
could cause the lives of hundreds of
 

845
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,490
could cause the lives of hundreds of
millions of people if you think about

846
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:43,500
millions of people if you think about
 

847
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,590
millions of people if you think about
the last really big revolution the

848
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
the last really big revolution the
 

849
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,409
the last really big revolution the
Industrial Revolution yes in the end we

850
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:48,419
Industrial Revolution yes in the end we
 

851
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,870
Industrial Revolution yes in the end we
learned how to use the powers of

852
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
learned how to use the powers of
 

853
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,110
learned how to use the powers of
Industry electricity radio trains

854
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,120
Industry electricity radio trains
 

855
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,110
Industry electricity radio trains
whatever to build better human societies

856
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
whatever to build better human societies
 

857
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,789
whatever to build better human societies
on the way

858
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
on the way
 

859
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,850
on the way
we had all these experiments like

860
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:01,860
we had all these experiments like
 

861
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,789
we had all these experiments like
European imperialism which was driven by

862
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
European imperialism which was driven by
 

863
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,110
European imperialism which was driven by
the Industrial Revolution it was a

864
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,120
the Industrial Revolution it was a
 

865
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,730
the Industrial Revolution it was a
question how do you build an industrial

866
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:07,740
question how do you build an industrial
 

867
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,890
question how do you build an industrial
society oh you build an Empire and you

868
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:09,900
society oh you build an Empire and you
 

869
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,710
society oh you build an Empire and you
take you you control all the resources

870
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
take you you control all the resources
 

871
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,810
take you you control all the resources
the raw materials the markets and then

872
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:14,820
the raw materials the markets and then
 

873
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,330
the raw materials the markets and then
you had communism another big experiment

874
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:17,340
you had communism another big experiment
 

875
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,669
you had communism another big experiment
on how to build an industrial society

876
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
on how to build an industrial society
 

877
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,250
on how to build an industrial society
and you had Fascism and Nazism which

878
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,260
and you had Fascism and Nazism which
 

879
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,190
and you had Fascism and Nazism which
were essentially an experiment in how to

880
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
were essentially an experiment in how to
 

881
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,130
were essentially an experiment in how to
build an industrial society including

882
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,140
build an industrial society including
 

883
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,830
build an industrial society including
even how do you exterminate minorities

884
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:30,840
even how do you exterminate minorities
 

885
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,310
even how do you exterminate minorities
using the powers of of industry and we

886
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
using the powers of of industry and we
 

887
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,470
using the powers of of industry and we
had all these failed experiments on the

888
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
had all these failed experiments on the
 

889
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,890
had all these failed experiments on the
way and if we now have the same type of

890
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:39,900
way and if we now have the same type of
 

891
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,870
way and if we now have the same type of
failed experiments with the Technologies

892
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:41,880
failed experiments with the Technologies
 

893
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,810
failed experiments with the Technologies
of the 21st century with AI with

894
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:44,820
of the 21st century with AI with
 

895
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,810
of the 21st century with AI with
bioengineering it could cost the lives

896
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:47,820
bioengineering it could cost the lives
 

897
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,850
bioengineering it could cost the lives
of again hundreds of millions of people

898
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:49,860
of again hundreds of millions of people
 

899
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,789
of again hundreds of millions of people
and maybe destroy the species

900
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
and maybe destroy the species
 

901
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,810
and maybe destroy the species
so um as a historian when people talk

902
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:56,820
so um as a historian when people talk
 

903
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,210
so um as a historian when people talk
about the examples from history from

904
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,220
about the examples from history from
 

905
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,029
about the examples from history from
from new technologies I'm not so

906
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,039
from new technologies I'm not so
 

907
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,630
from new technologies I'm not so
optimistic we need to to to think about

908
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:05,640
optimistic we need to to to think about
 

909
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,730
optimistic we need to to to think about
the failed experiment which accompanied

910
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:07,740
the failed experiment which accompanied
 

911
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,850
the failed experiment which accompanied
every major new technology so this

912
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:10,860
every major new technology so this
 

913
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,950
every major new technology so this
intelligence thing like you were saying

914
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
intelligence thing like you were saying
 

915
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,690
intelligence thing like you were saying
is a double-edged sword

916
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:14,700
is a double-edged sword
 

917
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,289
is a double-edged sword
is that every new thing it helps us

918
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:18,299
is that every new thing it helps us
 

919
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,810
is that every new thing it helps us
create it can uh both save us and

920
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:20,820
create it can uh both save us and
 

921
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,870
create it can uh both save us and
destroy us and it's unclear each time

922
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:23,880
destroy us and it's unclear each time
 

923
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,150
destroy us and it's unclear each time
which will happen and that's maybe why

924
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
which will happen and that's maybe why
 

925
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,010
which will happen and that's maybe why
we don't see any aliens

926
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,020
we don't see any aliens
 

927
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,230
we don't see any aliens
um yeah I mean I think each time he does

928
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
um yeah I mean I think each time he does
 

929
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,990
um yeah I mean I think each time he does
both things each time he does both good

930
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,000
both things each time he does both good
 

931
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,630
both things each time he does both good
things and bad things and the more

932
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,640
things and bad things and the more
 

933
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,090
things and bad things and the more
powerful the technology the greater both

934
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,100
powerful the technology the greater both
 

935
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,669
powerful the technology the greater both
the positive and the negative outcomes

936
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:40,679
the positive and the negative outcomes
 

937
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,950
the positive and the negative outcomes
now we are here

938
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
now we are here
 

939
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,830
now we are here
because we are the descendants of the

940
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
because we are the descendants of the
 

941
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,190
because we are the descendants of the
survivors of the surviving cultures the

942
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
survivors of the surviving cultures the
 

943
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,090
survivors of the surviving cultures the
surviving uh civilizations so when we

944
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,100
surviving uh civilizations so when we
 

945
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,370
surviving uh civilizations so when we
look back we say in the end everything

946
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:55,380
look back we say in the end everything
 

947
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,710
look back we say in the end everything
was okay hey we are here

948
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:57,720
was okay hey we are here
 

949
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,230
was okay hey we are here
but the people for whom it wasn't okay

950
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
but the people for whom it wasn't okay
 

951
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,330
but the people for whom it wasn't okay
they are just not here

952
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:02,340
they are just not here
 

953
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,630
they are just not here
and and okay has a lot of possible

954
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:05,640
and and okay has a lot of possible
 

955
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,850
and and okay has a lot of possible
variations to it because there's a lot

956
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:07,860
variations to it because there's a lot
 

957
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,470
variations to it because there's a lot
of suffering along the way even for the

958
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:09,480
of suffering along the way even for the
 

959
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,630
of suffering along the way even for the
people that survived so the the quality

960
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:11,640
people that survived so the the quality
 

961
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,909
people that survived so the the quality
of life and all of this but let's

962
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
of life and all of this but let's
 

963
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,610
of life and all of this but let's
actually go back there uh to our with

964
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:16,620
actually go back there uh to our with
 

965
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,049
actually go back there uh to our with
deep gratitude to our ancestors how did

966
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:21,059
deep gratitude to our ancestors how did
 

967
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,110
deep gratitude to our ancestors how did
it all start how did Homo sapiens

968
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,120
it all start how did Homo sapiens
 

969
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,570
it all start how did Homo sapiens
uh I'll compete the others the other

970
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:26,580
uh I'll compete the others the other
 

971
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,510
uh I'll compete the others the other
human-like species the Neanderthals and

972
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
human-like species the Neanderthals and
 

973
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,950
human-like species the Neanderthals and
the other

974
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
the other
 

975
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,870
the other

now create AIS which use this to

1608
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,200
now create AIS which use this to
 

1609
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,470
now create AIS which use this to
manipulate us this is a terrible thing

1610
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
manipulate us this is a terrible thing
 

1611
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,529
manipulate us this is a terrible thing
you've kind of I think mentioned this uh

1612
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:51,539
you've kind of I think mentioned this uh
 

1613
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,289
you've kind of I think mentioned this uh
do you think it should be illegal

1614
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:54,299
do you think it should be illegal
 

1615
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,950
do you think it should be illegal
to to do these kinds of things with AI

1616
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:56,960
to to do these kinds of things with AI
 

1617
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,970
to to do these kinds of things with AI
to create the perception of

1618
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:58,980
to create the perception of
 

1619
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,830
to create the perception of
consciousness of saying please don't

1620
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:00,840
consciousness of saying please don't
 

1621
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,470
consciousness of saying please don't
leave me or sort of basically

1622
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:03,480
leave me or sort of basically
 

1623
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,970
leave me or sort of basically
um simulate some of the human-like

1624
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:04,980
um simulate some of the human-like
 

1625
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,190
um simulate some of the human-like
qualities yes I think again we have to

1626
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
qualities yes I think again we have to
 

1627
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,790
qualities yes I think again we have to
be very careful about it and uh and if

1628
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
be very careful about it and uh and if
 

1629
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,909
be very careful about it and uh and if
it if it emerges

1630
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:12,919
it if it emerges
 

1631
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:15,770
it if it emerges
spontaneously we need to be careful and

1632
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:15,780
spontaneously we need to be careful and
 

1633
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,230
spontaneously we need to be careful and
we can't rule out the possibility that

1634
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
we can't rule out the possibility that
 

1635
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,629
we can't rule out the possibility that
AI will develop Consciousness we don't

1636
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
AI will develop Consciousness we don't
 

1637
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,909
AI will develop Consciousness we don't
know enough about Consciousness to be

1638
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:22,919
know enough about Consciousness to be
 

1639
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,310
know enough about Consciousness to be
sure so if it develops spontaneously we

1640
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:25,320
sure so if it develops spontaneously we
 

1641
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,310
sure so if it develops spontaneously we
need to be uh uh to to

1642
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
need to be uh uh to to
 

1643
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,530
need to be uh uh to to
um be very careful about how we

1644
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:30,540
um be very careful about how we
 

1645
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,770
um be very careful about how we
understand it but if people

1646
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:32,780
understand it but if people
 

1647
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,530
understand it but if people
intentionally design an AI that they

1648
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:36,540
intentionally design an AI that they
 

1649
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,629
intentionally design an AI that they
know they assume it has no consciousness

1650
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
know they assume it has no consciousness
 

1651
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,530
know they assume it has no consciousness
but in order to manipulate people

1652
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:41,540
but in order to manipulate people
 

1653
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,470
but in order to manipulate people
they use again this human strength this

1654
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:45,480
they use again this human strength this
 

1655
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,409
they use again this human strength this
human uh the the noble part of our

1656
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:48,419
human uh the the noble part of our
 

1657
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,750
human uh the the noble part of our
nature against us this should be should

1658
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:50,760
nature against us this should be should
 

1659
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,909
nature against us this should be should
be forbidden and similarly a more

1660
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:52,919
be forbidden and similarly a more
 

1661
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,829
be forbidden and similarly a more
General level that it should be

1662
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:54,839
General level that it should be
 

1663
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,250
General level that it should be
forbidden for an AI to pretend to be a

1664
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:58,260
forbidden for an AI to pretend to be a
 

1665
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,390
forbidden for an AI to pretend to be a
human being

1666
00:34:59,390 --> 00:34:59,400
human being
 

1667
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,490
human being
that it's okay you know there's so many

1668
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:01,500
that it's okay you know there's so many
 

1669
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,710
that it's okay you know there's so many
things we can use AIS as teachers as

1670
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:03,720
things we can use AIS as teachers as
 

1671
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,230
things we can use AIS as teachers as
doctors and so forth and it's good as

1672
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
doctors and so forth and it's good as
 

1673
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,270
doctors and so forth and it's good as
long as we know that we are interacting

1674
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,280
long as we know that we are interacting
 

1675
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,109
long as we know that we are interacting
with an AI we should the same way we ban

1676
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:12,119
with an AI we should the same way we ban
 

1677
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,349
with an AI we should the same way we ban
fake money we should ban fake humans

1678
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:15,359
fake money we should ban fake humans
 

1679
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,349
fake money we should ban fake humans
it's not just Banning deep fakes of

1680
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:18,359
it's not just Banning deep fakes of
 

1681
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,569
it's not just Banning deep fakes of
specific individuals

1682
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:20,579
specific individuals
 

1683
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,930
specific individuals
it's also Banning deep fake of generic

1684
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:23,940
it's also Banning deep fake of generic
 

1685
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,130
it's also Banning deep fake of generic
humans

1686
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,140
humans
 

1687
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,870
humans
you know which is already happening to

1688
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
you know which is already happening to
 

1689
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,510
you know which is already happening to
some extent on social media like if you

1690
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
some extent on social media like if you
 

1691
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,790
some extent on social media like if you
have lots of bots retweeting something

1692
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:31,800
have lots of bots retweeting something
 

1693
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,490
have lots of bots retweeting something
then you have the impression oh lots of

1694
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:34,500
then you have the impression oh lots of
 

1695
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,750
then you have the impression oh lots of
people are interested in that that's

1696
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:35,760
people are interested in that that's
 

1697
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,950
people are interested in that that's
important

1698
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
important
 

1699
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,530
important
and this is basically the Bots

1700
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:38,540
and this is basically the Bots
 

1701
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,990
and this is basically the Bots
pretending to be humans because if you

1702
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,000
pretending to be humans because if you
 

1703
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,530
pretending to be humans because if you
see a twit which says 500 people

1704
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:45,540
see a twit which says 500 people
 

1705
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,069
see a twit which says 500 people
retwitted it or you you see a a tweet

1706
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:49,079
retwitted it or you you see a a tweet
 

1707
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,010
retwitted it or you you see a a tweet
and it says 500 Bots which would delete

1708
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,020
and it says 500 Bots which would delete
 

1709
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,690
and it says 500 Bots which would delete
I don't care what the parts we created

1710
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:53,700
I don't care what the parts we created
 

1711
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,609
I don't care what the parts we created
but if it's humans okay that's that's

1712
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:55,619
but if it's humans okay that's that's
 

1713
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,370
but if it's humans okay that's that's
interesting so we need to be very

1714
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:58,380
interesting so we need to be very
 

1715
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,609
interesting so we need to be very
careful that Bots can't do that they are

1716
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:01,619
careful that Bots can't do that they are
 

1717
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,470
careful that Bots can't do that they are
doing it at present and it should be

1718
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:03,480
doing it at present and it should be
 

1719
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,810
doing it at present and it should be
banned now some people say yes but we

1720
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:05,820
banned now some people say yes but we
 

1721
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,410
banned now some people say yes but we
know of expression no Bots don't have

1722
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:09,420
know of expression no Bots don't have
 

1723
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,270
know of expression no Bots don't have
freedom of expression

1724
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
freedom of expression
 

1725
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,630
freedom of expression
there is no cost in terms of freedom of

1726
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
there is no cost in terms of freedom of
 

1727
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,089
there is no cost in terms of freedom of
expression when you ban Bots

1728
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:17,099
expression when you ban Bots
 

1729
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,790
expression when you ban Bots
so again in some situations yes AIS

1730
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:19,800
so again in some situations yes AIS
 

1731
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,310
so again in some situations yes AIS
should interact with us but it should be

1732
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
should interact with us but it should be
 

1733
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,250
should interact with us but it should be
very clear this is an AI talking to you

1734
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:25,260
very clear this is an AI talking to you
 

1735
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,970
very clear this is an AI talking to you
oh this is an AI retweeting this story

1736
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:28,980
oh this is an AI retweeting this story
 

1737
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,550
oh this is an AI retweeting this story
it is not a human being making a

1738
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:31,560
it is not a human being making a
 

1739
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,370
it is not a human being making a
conscious decision to push back on this

1740
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:34,380
conscious decision to push back on this
 

1741
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,730
conscious decision to push back on this
line of fake humans because I think it

1742
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:37,740
line of fake humans because I think it
 

1743
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,829
line of fake humans because I think it
might be a spectrum first of all you

1744
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
might be a spectrum first of all you
 

1745
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,310
might be a spectrum first of all you
might have ai systems that are offended

1746
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:43,320
might have ai systems that are offended
 

1747
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,030
might have ai systems that are offended
uh hurt when you say that they're fake

1748
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,040
uh hurt when you say that they're fake
 

1749
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,490
uh hurt when you say that they're fake
humans

1750
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:49,500
humans
 

1751
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,410
humans
um in fact they might start identifying

1752
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:51,420
um in fact they might start identifying
 

1753
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,670
um in fact they might start identifying
as humans and and you just talked about

1754
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
as humans and and you just talked about
 

1755
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,950
as humans and and you just talked about
the power of us humans with our

1756
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:57,960
the power of us humans with our
 

1757
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,810
the power of us humans with our
collective intelligence to take fake

1758
00:36:59,810 --> 00:36:59,820
collective intelligence to take fake
 

1759
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,390
collective intelligence to take fake
stories and make them quite real

1760
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,400
stories and make them quite real
 

1761
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,750
stories and make them quite real
and so if the feelings you have for the

1762
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:05,760
and so if the feelings you have for the
 

1763
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,730
and so if the feelings you have for the

Communist takeover but it was such an
unlikely event

2242
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480
unlikely event
 

2243
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,270
unlikely event
and it happened and the Little Steps

2244
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:26,280
and it happened and the Little Steps
 

2245
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,770
and it happened and the Little Steps
along the way the little options you

2246
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:27,780
along the way the little options you
 

2247
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,150
along the way the little options you
have along the way because you know

2248
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:29,160
have along the way because you know
 

2249
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,430
have along the way because you know
Stalin versus Trotsky you could have the

2250
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:31,440
Stalin versus Trotsky you could have the
 

2251
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,730
Stalin versus Trotsky you could have the
rubber Frost poem there's always

2252
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:33,740
rubber Frost poem there's always
 

2253
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,069
rubber Frost poem there's always
and history often takes you know there

2254
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:37,079
and history often takes you know there
 

2255
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:39,470
and history often takes you know there
is a Highway and there is a kind of

2256
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:39,480
is a Highway and there is a kind of
 

2257
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,050
is a Highway and there is a kind of
sideway and history takes the sideways

2258
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:42,060
sideway and history takes the sideways
 

2259
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,870
sideway and history takes the sideways
many many times and is perhaps tempting

2260
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:44,880
many many times and is perhaps tempting
 

2261
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,370
many many times and is perhaps tempting
to tell some of that history through

2262
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:46,380
to tell some of that history through
 

2263
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,770
to tell some of that history through
charismatic leaders and maybe it's an

2264
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:48,780
charismatic leaders and maybe it's an
 

2265
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,569
charismatic leaders and maybe it's an
open question

2266
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:50,579
open question
 

2267
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,210
open question
how much power charismatic leaders have

2268
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:53,220
how much power charismatic leaders have
 

2269
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,870
how much power charismatic leaders have
to affect the trajectory of History

2270
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:55,880
to affect the trajectory of History

2280
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:08,460
vision so I I have a sense that there's
 

2281
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,630
vision so I I have a sense that there's
an importance uh for a leader

00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:11,640
an importance uh for a leader
 

2283

in the 1990s this made a huge huge
 

2399
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,890
in the 1990s this made a huge huge
difference so you have this interplay

2400
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:42,900
difference so you have this interplay
 

2401
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,230
difference so you have this interplay
between the structural forces which are

2402
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:45,240
between the structural forces which are
 

2403
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,809
between the structural forces which are
beyond the control of any single

2404
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:47,819
beyond the control of any single
 

2405
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:50,329
beyond the control of any single
charismatic leader but then the the

2406
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:50,339
charismatic leader but then the the
 

2407
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,809
charismatic leader but then the the
small changes they can have a big effect

2408
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:52,819
small changes they can have a big effect
 

2409
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:55,130
small changes they can have a big effect
and I think for instance about the war

2410
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:55,140
and I think for instance about the war
 

2411
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,950
and I think for instance about the war
in Ukraine there was a moment now it's

2412
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:57,960
in Ukraine there was a moment now it's
 

2413
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,770
in Ukraine there was a moment now it's
now it's a struggle between nations

2414
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:00,780
now it's a struggle between nations
 

2415
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,530
now it's a struggle between nations
but there was a moment when the decision

2416
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:03,540
but there was a moment when the decision
 

2417
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,750
but there was a moment when the decision
was taken in the mind of a single

2418
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,760
was taken in the mind of a single
 

2419
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,450
was taken in the mind of a single
individual of Vladimir Putin and he

2420
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:08,460
individual of Vladimir Putin and he
 

2421
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,210
individual of Vladimir Putin and he
could have decided otherwise and the the

2422
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:11,220
could have decided otherwise and the the
 

2423
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,950
could have decided otherwise and the the
the world would look completely

2424
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:12,960
the world would look completely
 

2425
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,970
the world would look completely
different

2426
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:13,980
different
 

2427
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,329
different
and another leader Volare zalanski could

2428
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:17,339
and another leader Volare zalanski could
 

2429
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,430
and another leader Volare zalanski could
have decided to leave Kiev in the early

2430

have decided to leave Kiev in the early
 

2431

the rise of the Third Reich

00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:14,760

 

2477
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,950

the why

2478
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:15,960
the why
 

2479
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,170
the why
I can tell you the how I don't think it

2480
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:18,180
I can tell you the how I don't think it
 

2481
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,170
I can tell you the how I don't think it
was inevitable I think that a few if a

2482
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:21,180
was inevitable I think that a few if a
 

2483
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,910
was inevitable I think that a few if a
few things were different there would

2484
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:22,920
few things were different there would
 

2485
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,890
few things were different there would
have been no no Third Reich that would

2486
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:24,900
have been no no Third Reich that would
 

2487
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,690
have been no no Third Reich that would
have been no Nazism no no Holocaust

2488
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:26,700
have been no Nazism no no Holocaust
 

2489
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,849
have been no Nazism no no Holocaust
again this is the tragedy if it would

2490
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:28,859
again this is the tragedy if it would
 

2491
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:30,770
again this is the tragedy if it would
have been inevitable then you know what

2492
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:30,780
have been inevitable then you know what
 

2493
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,390
have been inevitable then you know what
can you do this is the the laws of of

2494
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:32,400
can you do this is the the laws of of
 

2495
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,490
can you do this is the the laws of of
history or the laws of physics but the

2496
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:34,500
history or the laws of physics but the
 

2497
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,390
history or the laws of physics but the
tragedy is no it was Decisions by humans

2498
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:37,400
tragedy is no it was Decisions by humans
 

2499
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,309
tragedy is no it was Decisions by humans
that led to that direction

2500
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
that led to that direction
 

2501
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,650
that led to that direction
and you know even from the Viewpoint of

2502
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:42,660
and you know even from the Viewpoint of
 

2503
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,230
and you know even from the Viewpoint of
of the Germans

00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:45,240
of the Germans
 

2505
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,930
of the Germans
um we know for for a fact it was an

2506
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:47,940
um we know for for a fact it was an
 

2507
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,930
um we know for for a fact it was an
unnecessary path to take because you

2508
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:50,940
unnecessary path to take because you
 

2509
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,589
unnecessary path to take because you
know in the 1920s and 30s the Nazis said

2510
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:54,599
know in the 1920s and 30s the Nazis said
 

2511
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,150
know in the 1920s and 30s the Nazis said
that

2512
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,160
that
 

2513
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,290
that
um this unless Germany take this road it

2514
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:00,300
um this unless Germany take this road it
 

2515
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,329
um this unless Germany take this road it
will never be prosperous it will never

2516
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:02,339
will never be prosperous it will never
 

2517
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:04,430
will never be prosperous it will never
be successful all the other countries

2518
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:04,440
be successful all the other countries
 

2519
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,890

00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:06,900
will keep stepping on it this was their
 

2521
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,370
will keep stepping on it this was their
their their uh claim and we know for a

2522
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:10,380
their their uh claim and we know for a
 

2523
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,730
their their uh claim and we know for a
fact this is this is false why because

2524
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:13,740
fact this is this is false why because
 

2525
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,710
fact this is this is false why because
they took that road

2526
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:15,720
they took that road
 

2527
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,770
they took that road
they lost the Second World War

2528
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:18,780
they lost the Second World War
 

2529
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,910
they lost the Second World War
and after they lost then they became one

2530
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:22,920
and after they lost then they became one
 

2531
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,069
and after they lost then they became one
of the most prosperous countries in the

2532
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:25,079
of the most prosperous countries in the
 

2533
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,010
of the most prosperous countries in the
world because their enemies that

2534
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:28,020
world because their enemies that
 

2535
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,710
world because their enemies that
defeated them evidently supported them

2536
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:30,720
defeated them evidently supported them
 

2537
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,470
defeated them evidently supported them
and allowed them to become such a

2538
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:33,480
and allowed them to become such a
 

2539
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,349
and allowed them to become such a
prosperous successful Nation so you know

prosperous successful Nation so you know
 

2541
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:40,069
prosperous successful Nation so you know
if you can lose the war and still be so

2542
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:40,079
if you can lose the war and still be so
 

2543
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,109
if you can lose the war and still be so
successful obviously you could just have

a few years maybe a decade or two it is
 

3735
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,510
a few years maybe a decade or two it is
morphing into a religious conflict which

morphing into a religious conflict which
 

3737
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,370
morphing into a religious conflict which
is again a very worrying development

is again a very worrying development
 

3739
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,189
is again a very worrying development
when nations are in Conflict you can

3740
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:04,199
when nations are in Conflict you can
 

3741
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,410
when nations are in Conflict you can
reach them compromise okay you have this

3742
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:06,420
reach them compromise okay you have this
 

3743
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,630
reach them compromise okay you have this
bit of land we have this bit of land but

Messianic people compromise is becomes

3750
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:16,260
Messianic people compromise is becomes
 

3751
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,530
Messianic people compromise is becomes
much more difficult because you don't

3752
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:18,540
much more difficult because you don't
 

3753
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,630
much more difficult because you don't

you don't compromise on God

3756
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:23,340
you don't compromise on God
 

3757
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,490
you don't compromise on God
uh and and this is where we are heading

3758
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:25,500
uh and and this is where we are heading
 

3759
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,390
uh and and this is where we are heading
right now

3760
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
right now
 

3761
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,090
right now
so I know you said it's a small nation

3762
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:29,100
so I know you said it's a small nation
 

3763
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,890
so I know you said it's a small nation
somewhere in the Middle East

3764
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:30,900
somewhere in the Middle East
 

3765
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,649
somewhere in the Middle East
but it also happens to be the epicenter

3766
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:33,659
but it also happens to be the epicenter
 

3767
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:35,630
but it also happens to be the epicenter
of one of the longest running one of the

3768
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:35,640
of one of the longest running one of the
 

3769
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,209
of one of the longest running one of the
most tense conflicts and crises in human

3770
01:19:38,209 --> 01:19:38,219
most tense conflicts and crises in human
 

3771
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:39,070

so at the very least it serves as a

3774
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:42,120
so at the very least it serves as a
 

3775
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:46,490
so at the very least it serves as a
study of how conflict can be resolved so

3776
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:46,500
study of how conflict can be resolved so
 

3777
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,010
study of how conflict can be resolved so

01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:31,980
and again we can go into the reasons why
 

3813
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:35,990
and again we can go into the reasons why
but the fact is that on neither side is

but the fact is that on neither side is

but the fact is that on neither side is
there enough motivation if there was

there enough motivation if there was
 

3817
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,330
there enough motivation if there was
motivation the solution would have been

easy is there an important distinction

3820
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:42,840

01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:52,040
in power in terms of motivation so
 

3827
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,890
in power in terms of motivation so
are most people

3828
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:54,900

uh motivated and hoping for peace and
the leaders are motivated and

3832
01:20:59,689 --> 01:20:59,699
the leaders are motivated and
 

3833
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:01,610
the leaders are motivated and
incentivized to continue War I don't

3834
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:01,620
incentivized to continue War I don't
 

3835
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,830
incentivized to continue War I don't
think so or the people also I think it's

3836
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840
think so or the people also I think it's
 

3837
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,630
think so or the people also I think it's
it's a deep problem it's also the people

3838
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:05,640
it's a deep problem it's also the people
 

3839

it's a deep problem it's also the people
it's not just the leaders is it even a

3840
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:08,820
it's not just the leaders is it even a
 

3841
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:11,990
it's not just the leaders is it even a
human problem of literally hate in

3842
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:12,000
human problem of literally hate in
 

3843
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,149
human problem of literally hate in
people's heart yeah there is a lot of

3844
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:14,159
people's heart yeah there is a lot of
 

3845
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,130
people's heart yeah there is a lot of
hate one of the things that happened in

3846
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:16,140
hate one of the things that happened in
 

3847
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,930
hate one of the things that happened in
Israel over the last

3848
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:17,940
Israel over the last
 

3849
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,930
Israel over the last
um 10 years or so Israel became much

3850
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:20,940
um 10 years or so Israel became much
 

3851
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,990
um 10 years or so Israel became much
stronger than it was before largely

3852
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,000
stronger than it was before largely
 

3853
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,270
stronger than it was before largely
thanks to technological development

3854
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:26,280
thanks to technological development
 

3855
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,850
thanks to technological development
and it feels that it no longer needs to

3856
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:28,860
and it feels that it no longer needs to
 

3857
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,290
and it feels that it no longer needs to
compromise

3858
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:30,300
compromise
 

3859
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,630
compromise
that and this is there are many reasons

3860
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:32,640
that and this is there are many reasons
 

3861
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,250
that and this is there are many reasons
for it but some of them are

3862
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:34,260
for it but some of them are
 

3863
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,130
for it but some of them are
technological uh being one of the

3864
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:37,140
technological uh being one of the
 

3865
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,209
technological uh being one of the
leading

3866
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:38,219
leading
 

3867
01:21:38,219 --> 01:21:44,870
leading
powers in cyber in AI in in high tech

3868
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:44,880
powers in cyber in AI in in high tech
 

3869
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,410
powers in cyber in AI in in high tech
we have developed a very sophisticated

3870
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:48,420
we have developed a very sophisticated
 

3871
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:51,709
we have developed a very sophisticated
ways to more easily control the

3872
01:21:51,709 --> 01:21:51,719
ways to more easily control the
 

3873
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:53,209
ways to more easily control the
Palestinian population

3874
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:53,219
Palestinian population
 

3875
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:57,050
Palestinian population
in the early 2000s it seemed that it is

3876
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:57,060
in the early 2000s it seemed that it is
 

3877
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,390
in the early 2000s it seemed that it is
becoming impossible to control millions

3878
01:21:59,390 --> 01:21:59,400
becoming impossible to control millions
 

3879
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,790
becoming impossible to control millions
of people against the will it took too

3880
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:01,800
of people against the will it took too
 

3881
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,209
of people against the will it took too
much power it spilled too much blood on

3882
01:22:05,209 --> 01:22:05,219
much power it spilled too much blood on
 

3883
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:06,649
much power it spilled too much blood on
both sides

3884
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:06,659
both sides
 

3885
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:09,050
both sides
uh so there was an impression oh this is

3886
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:09,060
uh so there was an impression oh this is
 

3887
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,729
uh so there was an impression oh this is
becoming untenable

3888
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:10,739
becoming untenable
 

3889
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:13,130
becoming untenable
and there are several reasons why it

3890
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:13,140
and there are several reasons why it
 

3891
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,570
and there are several reasons why it
changed but one of them was new

3892
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:14,580
changed but one of them was new
 

3893
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,590
changed but one of them was new
technology

3894
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:15,600
technology
 

3895
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,350
technology
Israel developed very sophisticated

3896
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:18,360
Israel developed very sophisticated
 

3897
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,390
Israel developed very sophisticated
surveillance technology

3898
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:20,400
surveillance technology
 

3899
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,850
surveillance technology
that has made it much easier

3900
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:22,860
that has made it much easier
 

3901
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,310
that has made it much easier
for Israeli Security Forces to control

3902
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:25,320
for Israeli Security Forces to control
 

3903
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,189
for Israeli Security Forces to control
2.5 million Palestinians in the West

3904
01:22:28,189 --> 01:22:28,199
2.5 million Palestinians in the West
 

3905
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:30,890
2.5 million Palestinians in the West
Bank against their will

3906
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:30,900
Bank against their will
 

3907
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:35,390
Bank against their will
uh with a lot less effort less boots on

3908
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:35,400
uh with a lot less effort less boots on
 

3909
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,149
uh with a lot less effort less boots on
the ground also less blood

3910
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
the ground also less blood
 

3911
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:41,810
the ground also less blood
and Israel is also now exporting this

3912
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:41,820
and Israel is also now exporting this
 

3913
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,970
and Israel is also now exporting this
technology to many other regimes around

3914
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:43,980
technology to many other regimes around
 

3915
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,649
technology to many other regimes around
the world

3916
01:22:45,649 --> 01:22:45,659
the world
 

3917
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:47,330
the world
um again I heard Netanyahu speaking

3918

about all the wonderful things that
Israel is exporting to the world and

3922
01:22:50,209 --> 01:22:50,219
Israel is exporting to the world and
 

3923
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:51,950
Israel is exporting to the world and
it's true we are exporting some nice

3924
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:51,960
it's true we are exporting some nice
 

3925
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,790

things
 

3927
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,669
things
water systems and and to make new kinds

3928
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:55,679
water systems and and to make new kinds
 

3929
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,669
water systems and and to make new kinds
of tomatoes we are also exposing a lot

3930
01:22:58,669 --> 01:22:58,679
of tomatoes we are also exposing a lot
 

3931
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:02,750
of tomatoes we are also exposing a lot
of weapons and especially uh

3932
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:02,760
of weapons and especially uh
 

3933
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,510
of weapons and especially uh
surveillance systems sometimes to

3934
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
surveillance systems sometimes to
 

3935
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,169
surveillance systems sometimes to
unsavory regimes in order to control

3936
01:23:09,169 --> 01:23:09,179
unsavory regimes in order to control
 

3937
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:11,450
unsavory regimes in order to control
their populations

3938
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:11,460
their populations
 

3939
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:14,570
their populations
can you comment on um I think you've

3940
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:14,580
can you comment on um I think you've
 

3941
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:16,370
can you comment on um I think you've
mentioned that the current state of

3942
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:16,380
mentioned that the current state of
 

3943
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:19,790
mentioned that the current state of
affairs is the de facto three class

3944
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:19,800
affairs is the de facto three class
 

3945
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,310
affairs is the de facto three class
State can you describe what you mean by

3946
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
State can you describe what you mean by
 

3947
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,610
State can you describe what you mean by
that yes for many years the kind of

3948
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:25,620
that yes for many years the kind of
 

3949
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:27,590
that yes for many years the kind of
the israeli-palestinian conflict is the

3950
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
the israeli-palestinian conflict is the
 

3951
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,450
the israeli-palestinian conflict is the
two-state solution can you describe what

3952
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:29,460
two-state solution can you describe what
 

3953
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,729
two-state solution can you describe what
that means by the way yes two states

3954
01:23:31,729 --> 01:23:31,739
that means by the way yes two states
 

3955
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:33,950
that means by the way yes two states
um within between the Jordan River and

3956
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:33,960
um within between the Jordan River and
 

3957
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,450
um within between the Jordan River and
the Mediterranean will have two states

3958
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:35,460
the Mediterranean will have two states
 

3959
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:38,450
the Mediterranean will have two states
uh Israeli Israel as a predominantly

3960
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:38,460
uh Israeli Israel as a predominantly
 

3961
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,090
uh Israeli Israel as a predominantly
Jewish State and Palestine as a

3962
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:41,100
Jewish State and Palestine as a
 

3963
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,010
Jewish State and Palestine as a
predominantly Palestinian state

predominantly Palestinian state
 

3965
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,870
predominantly Palestinian state
uh again into a lot of discussions where

3966
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
uh again into a lot of discussions where
 

3967
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,550
uh again into a lot of discussions where
the Border passes what happens with

3968
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:46,560
the Border passes what happens with
 

3969
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,530
the Border passes what happens with
security Arrangement and whatever but

3970
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:48,540
security Arrangement and whatever but
 

3971
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:51,290
security Arrangement and whatever but
this was the big solution Israel is

3972
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:51,300
this was the big solution Israel is
 

3973
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,330
this was the big solution Israel is
basically abandoned the two-state

3974
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:53,340
basically abandoned the two-state
 

3975
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,189
basically abandoned the two-state
solution maybe they don't say so

3976
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
solution maybe they don't say so
 

3977
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,169
solution maybe they don't say so
officially the people in power but in

3978
01:23:57,169 --> 01:23:57,179
officially the people in power but in
 

3979
01:23:57,179 --> 01:23:58,970
officially the people in power but in
terms of how they actually what they do

3980
01:23:58,970 --> 01:23:58,980
terms of how they actually what they do
 

3981
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,370
terms of how they actually what they do
on the ground they abandoned it now they

3982
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:01,380
on the ground they abandoned it now they
 

3983
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,590
on the ground they abandoned it now they
are effectively promoting the three

3984
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:03,600
are effectively promoting the three
 

3985
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,430
are effectively promoting the three
class uh solution which means there is

01:33:59,149 --> 01:33:59,159
it goes back a little to what I said
 

4463
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:00,770
it goes back a little to what I said
earlier about the Marxist view of

4464
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:00,780
earlier about the Marxist view of
 

4465
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,470
earlier about the Marxist view of
History

4466
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:02,480
History
 

4467
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,030
History
one of the problematic things I see

4468
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:05,040
one of the problematic things I see
 

4469
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:08,510
one of the problematic things I see
today in in many academic circles is

4470
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:08,520
today in in many academic circles is
 

4471
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,270
today in in many academic circles is
that people focus too much on power

4472
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
that people focus too much on power
 

4473
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,090
that people focus too much on power
they think that the whole of history of

4474
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:14,100
they think that the whole of history of
 

4475
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:17,390
they think that the whole of history of
the whole of politics is just a power

4476
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:17,400
the whole of politics is just a power
 

4477
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,410
the whole of politics is just a power
structure it's just struggle about power

4478
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:20,420
structure it's just struggle about power
 

4479
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,910
structure it's just struggle about power
now if you think

4480
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:22,920
now if you think
 

4481
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,709
now if you think
that the whole of history and the Hall

4482
01:34:24,709 --> 01:34:24,719
that the whole of history and the Hall
 

4483
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:27,709
that the whole of history and the Hall
of politics is only Power

4484
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:27,719
of politics is only Power
 

4485
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:31,189
of politics is only Power
then there is no room for conversation

4486
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:31,199
then there is no room for conversation
 

4487
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,470
then there is no room for conversation
because if what you have is a struggle

4488
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:33,480
because if what you have is a struggle
 

4489
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,470
because if what you have is a struggle
between different powerful interests

4490
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480
between different powerful interests
 

4491
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,110
between different powerful interests
there is no point talking the only thing

4492
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:39,120
there is no point talking the only thing
 

4493
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:43,250
there is no point talking the only thing
that changes it is is fighting

4494
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:43,260
that changes it is is fighting
 

4495
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,890
that changes it is is fighting
um my view is that no it's not all about

4496
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:45,900
um my view is that no it's not all about
 

4497
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:48,050
um my view is that no it's not all about
power structures it's not all about

4498
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:48,060
power structures it's not all about
 

4499
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,390
power structures it's not all about
power dynamics underneath the power

4500
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:50,400
power dynamics underneath the power
 

4501
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,390
power dynamics underneath the power
structure there are stories

4502
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:53,400
structure there are stories
 

4503
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,790
structure there are stories
stories in human mind

4504
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:55,800
stories in human mind
 

4505
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,790
stories in human mind
and this is great new if it's true this

4506
01:34:58,790 --> 01:34:58,800
and this is great new if it's true this
 

4507
01:34:58,800 --> 01:34:59,990
and this is great new if it's true this
is good news

4508
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
is good news
 

4509
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,990
is good news
because unlike power that can only be

4510
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:03,000
because unlike power that can only be
 

4511
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,090
because unlike power that can only be
changed through fighting

4512
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:05,100
changed through fighting
 

4513
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:08,510
changed through fighting
stories can sometimes it's not easy but

4514
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:08,520
stories can sometimes it's not easy but

sometimes stories can be changed through
 

4517
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,649
sometimes stories can be changed through

if you think it's power therapy it's all

4526
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:22,860
if you think it's power therapy it's all
 

4527

place for a conversation
 

4531
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,990
place for a conversation
but if to some extent it's the stories

4532
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:30,000
but if to some extent it's the stories
 

4533
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,470
but if to some extent it's the stories
in people's minds if you can enable one

4534
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:33,480
in people's minds if you can enable one
 

4535
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,290
in people's minds if you can enable one
person to see the story in the in the

4536
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:36,300
person to see the story in the in the
 

4537
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,330
person to see the story in the in the
mind of another person and more

4538
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:38,340
mind of another person and more
 

4539
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,850
mind of another person and more
importantly if you can have some kind of

01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:40,860
importantly if you can have some kind of
 

4541
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:43,790
importantly if you can have some kind of
of critical distance from the story in

4542
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:43,800
of critical distance from the story in
 

4543
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,310
of critical distance from the story in
your own mind and maybe you can change

4544
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:46,320
your own mind and maybe you can change
 

4545
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,709
your own mind and maybe you can change
it a little and then you don't need to

4546
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:48,719
it a little and then you don't need to
 

4547
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:49,610
it a little and then you don't need to
fight

4548
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:49,620
fight

01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:22,790
the world
and this is why

4622
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800

 

4623
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,310

I'm going to talk with some of the most

4624
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:25,320
I'm going to talk with some of the most
 

4625
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,590
I'm going to talk with some of the most
difficult characters around in the world

4626
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:27,600
difficult characters around in the world
 

4627
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,209
difficult characters around in the world
today

4628
01:37:29,209 --> 01:37:29,219
today
 

4629
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:33,770
today
um and with with this basic belief that

4630
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:33,780
um and with with this basic belief that
 

4631
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:36,470
um and with with this basic belief that
by talking maybe we can move them an

4632
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:36,480
by talking maybe we can move them an
 

4633
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,370
by talking maybe we can move them an
inch

4634
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:37,380
inch
 

4635
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,830
inch
which is a lot when it comes to people

4636
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:39,840
which is a lot when it comes to people
 

4637
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,470
which is a lot when it comes to people
with with so much power like I think one

01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:42,480
with with so much power like I think one
 

4639
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,209
with with so much power like I think one
of the biggest success stories in in

4640
01:37:44,209 --> 01:37:44,219
of the biggest success stories in in
 

4641
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:46,430
of the biggest success stories in in
modern history I would say is is

4642
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:46,440
modern history I would say is is
 

4643
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:47,870
modern history I would say is is
feminism

4644
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:47,880
feminism
 

4645
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,770
feminism
uh because feminism believed uh in the

01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:51,780
uh because feminism believed uh in the
 

4647
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:55,370
uh because feminism believed uh in the
power of stories not so much in the

01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:55,380
power of stories not so much in the
 

4649
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:59,570
power of stories not so much in the
power of violence of armed conflict by

4650
01:37:59,570 --> 01:37:59,580
power of violence of armed conflict by
 

4651

power of violence of armed conflict by
many measures feminism has been maybe

4652
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:01,920
many measures feminism has been maybe
 

4653
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,490
many measures feminism has been maybe
the most successful social movement of

4654
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:04,500
the most successful social movement of
 

4655

Age
you know the systems of Oppression which

4660
01:38:10,729 --> 01:38:10,739
you know the systems of Oppression which
 

4661
01:38:10,739 --> 01:38:12,950
you know the systems of Oppression which
were in place throughout the world for

4662

were in place throughout the world for
 

4663
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,649
were in place throughout the world for
thousands of years and they seem to be

4664
01:38:15,649 --> 01:38:15,659
thousands of years and they seem to be
 

4665
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:16,910
thousands of years and they seem to be
just natural

4666

just natural

revolutions and one thing would remain
 

4673
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,590
revolutions and one thing would remain
constant and this is the patriarchal

system and the operation of women
 

4677
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,990
system and the operation of women
and then feminism came along and

4678
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
and then feminism came along and
 

4679
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,910
and then feminism came along and
um you know you had leaders like Lenin

4680
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:31,920
um you know you had leaders like Lenin
 

4681
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,729

and the family said no
 

4695
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:50,810
and the family said no
we won't use the power of the gun

4696
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:50,820
we won't use the power of the gun
 

4697
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:53,030
we won't use the power of the gun
we will make an omelet without breaking

4698
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:53,040
we will make an omelet without breaking
 

4699
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,169
we will make an omelet without breaking
any eggs

4700
01:38:54,169 --> 01:38:54,179
any eggs
 

4701
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:56,270
any eggs
and they made a much better omelette

4702
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:56,280
and they made a much better omelette
 

4703
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,510
and they made a much better omelette
than Lenin or Mao or any of these

4704
01:38:59,510 --> 01:38:59,520
than Lenin or Mao or any of these
 

4705
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,850
than Lenin or Mao or any of these
violent revolutionaries I don't think

4706
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:01,860
violent revolutionaries I don't think
 

4707
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:04,189
violent revolutionaries I don't think
you know that they that they certainly

4708
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:04,199
you know that they that they certainly
 

4709
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:05,689
you know that they that they certainly
didn't start any wars or built any

4710
01:39:05,689 --> 01:39:05,699
didn't start any wars or built any
 

4711
01:39:05,699 --> 01:39:07,850
didn't start any wars or built any
gulags I don't think they even murdered

4712
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:07,860
gulags I don't think they even murdered
 

4713
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,490
gulags I don't think they even murdered
a single politician I don't think there

4714
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:10,500
a single politician I don't think there
 

4715
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,709
a single politician I don't think there
was any political assassination anywhere

4716
01:39:12,709 --> 01:39:12,719
was any political assassination anywhere
 

4717
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,590
was any political assassination anywhere
but but by feminists there was a lot of

4718
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:15,600
but but by feminists there was a lot of
 

4719
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,990
but but by feminists there was a lot of
violence against them

4720
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,000
violence against them
 

4721
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,890
violence against them
both verbal but also physical and they

4722
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:21,900
both verbal but also physical and they
 

4723
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:25,310
both verbal but also physical and they
didn't reply by waging violence and they

4724
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:25,320
didn't reply by waging violence and they
 

4725
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,709
didn't reply by waging violence and they
succeeded

4726
01:39:26,709 --> 01:39:26,719
succeeded
 

4727
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:30,970
succeeded
in changing this deep

4728
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:30,980
in changing this deep
 

4729
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:35,450
in changing this deep
in a a structure of of Oppression

4730
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:35,460
in a a structure of of Oppression
 

4731
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,550
in a a structure of of Oppression
in a way which benefited not just women

4732
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:37,560
in a way which benefited not just women
 

4733
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,530
in a way which benefited not just women
but also men

4734
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:39,540
but also men
 

4735
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:43,250
but also men
so um this gives me hope that it's not

4736
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:43,260
so um this gives me hope that it's not
 

4737
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:46,250
so um this gives me hope that it's not
easy in many cases we fail but it is

4738
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:46,260
easy in many cases we fail but it is
 

4739
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:49,310
easy in many cases we fail but it is
possible sometimes in history to make a

4740
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:49,320
possible sometimes in history to make a
 

4741
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:53,510
possible sometimes in history to make a
very very big change positive change uh

4742
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:53,520
very very big change positive change uh
 

4743
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,570
very very big change positive change uh
mainly by talking and demonstrating and

4744
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:56,580
mainly by talking and demonstrating and
 

4745
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,790
mainly by talking and demonstrating and
changing the story in people people's

4746
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
changing the story in people people's
 

4747
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,310
changing the story in people people's
minds and not by using violence it's

4748
01:40:01,310 --> 01:40:01,320
minds and not by using violence it's
 

4749
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,250
minds and not by using violence it's
fascinating that feminism and communism

4750
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:04,260
fascinating that feminism and communism
 

4751
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,169
fascinating that feminism and communism
and all these things happen in the 20th

4752
01:40:06,169 --> 01:40:06,179
and all these things happen in the 20th
 

4753
01:40:06,179 --> 01:40:07,729
and all these things happen in the 20th
century so many interesting things

4754
01:40:07,729 --> 01:40:07,739
century so many interesting things
 

4755
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:09,709
century so many interesting things
happen in the 20th century so many

4756
01:40:09,709 --> 01:40:09,719
happen in the 20th century so many
 

4757
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:12,290
happen in the 20th century so many
movements so many ideas nuclear weapons

4758
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:12,300
movements so many ideas nuclear weapons
 

4759
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:15,290
movements so many ideas nuclear weapons
all of it computers it's just like it

4760
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:15,300
all of it computers it's just like it
 

4761
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:16,790
all of it computers it's just like it
seems like a lot of stuff like really

4762
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
seems like a lot of stuff like really
 

4763
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,890
seems like a lot of stuff like really
quickly percolated and it's accelerating

4764
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:18,900
quickly percolated and it's accelerating
 

4765
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,810
quickly percolated and it's accelerating
it's still accelerating I mean history

4766
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:20,820
it's still accelerating I mean history
 

4767
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,129
it's still accelerating I mean history
is just accelerating you know for

4768
01:40:22,129 --> 01:40:22,139
is just accelerating you know for
 

4769
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:25,010
is just accelerating you know for
centuries and the 20th century you know

4770
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:25,020
centuries and the 20th century you know
 

4771
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,530
centuries and the 20th century you know
you we squeezed into it things that

4772
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:27,540
you we squeezed into it things that
 

4773
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:29,870
you we squeezed into it things that
previously took thousands of years and

4774
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:29,880
previously took thousands of years and
 

4775
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,550
previously took thousands of years and
now I mean we are squeezing it into

4776
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:31,560
now I mean we are squeezing it into
 

4777
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,129
now I mean we are squeezing it into
decades and you very well could be one

4778
01:40:34,129 --> 01:40:34,139
decades and you very well could be one
 

4779
01:40:34,139 --> 01:40:36,530
decades and you very well could be one
of the last historians human historians

around in a century or two we could
 

4789
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,870
around in a century or two we could
destroy ourselves

4790

destroy ourselves
 

4791
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,090

collapse uh by giving too much power to

4794
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:53,100
collapse uh by giving too much power to
 

4795
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:56,209
collapse uh by giving too much power to
AI that goes out out of our control

4796
01:40:56,209 --> 01:40:56,219
AI that goes out out of our control
 

4797
01:40:56,219 --> 01:40:59,629
AI that goes out out of our control
but if we survive we'll probably have so

4798
01:40:59,629 --> 01:40:59,639
but if we survive we'll probably have so
 

4799
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:02,270
but if we survive we'll probably have so
much power that we will change ourselves

4800
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:02,280
much power that we will change ourselves
 

4801
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:06,169
much power that we will change ourselves
using various Technologies uh so that

4802
01:41:06,169 --> 01:41:06,179
using various Technologies uh so that
 

4803
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:10,129
using various Technologies uh so that
our descendants will no longer be Homo

4804
01:41:10,129 --> 01:41:10,139
our descendants will no longer be Homo
 

4805
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:13,310
our descendants will no longer be Homo
sapiens like us they will be more

4806
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:13,320

4807
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:14,930

um so maybe they'll have historians but

4812
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:19,860
um so maybe they'll have historians but
 

4813
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:22,310
um so maybe they'll have historians but
it will no longer be human historians or

01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:22,320
it will no longer be human historians or
 

4815
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,530
it will no longer be human historians or
sapiens historians like me

4817
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:27,410

I think it's an extremely dangerous uh

4818
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:27,420
I think it's an extremely dangerous uh
 

4819
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,570
I think it's an extremely dangerous uh
development and the chances that this

4820
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:29,580
development and the chances that this
 

4821
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,790
development and the chances that this
will go wrong that will this will you

4822
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:31,800
will go wrong that will this will you
 

4823
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,290
will go wrong that will this will you
people will use the new technologies

4824
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:33,300
people will use the new technologies
 

4825
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:36,229
people will use the new technologies
trying to upgrade humans but actually

4826
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:36,239
trying to upgrade humans but actually
 

4827
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,990
trying to upgrade humans but actually
downgrading them this is a very very big

4828
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:39,000
downgrading them this is a very very big
 

4829
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,649
downgrading them this is a very very big
danger if you let corporations and

it's very likely that they will try to
 

4839
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:56,810
it's very likely that they will try to

sort of removes the flaws of humans
 

4921
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,970
sort of removes the flaws of humans
maybe it removes the diversity in humans

4922
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:46,980
maybe it removes the diversity in humans
 

4923
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:49,850
maybe it removes the diversity in humans
and makes us all kind of uh these

4924
01:43:49,850 --> 01:43:49,860
and makes us all kind of uh these

worried about that so it's it seems like
 

4961
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:35,209
worried about that so it's it seems like
humans are

of it together we are better than
 

4967
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,370
of it together we are better than
anything that we can intentionally

anything that we can intentionally
 

4969
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,830
anything that we can intentionally
design at present yeah like any

4970
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
design at present yeah like any
 

4971
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,050

cabal of fellow humans
the problem with many of these

5418
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:58,800
the problem with many of these
 

5419
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,669
the problem with many of these
conspiracy theories that yes we have a

5420
01:54:01,669 --> 01:54:01,679
conspiracy theories that yes we have a
 

5421
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:05,270
conspiracy theories that yes we have a
problem with a new AI technology

5422
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,280
problem with a new AI technology
 

5423
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,930
problem with a new AI technology
but if you now direct the fire against

01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:13,570
certain people
so instead of all humans cooperating

5428
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:13,580
so instead of all humans cooperating
 

5429
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:18,290
so instead of all humans cooperating
against our real common threats whether

5430
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:18,300
against our real common threats whether
 

5431
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:21,169
against our real common threats whether
it's the rise of AI whether it's a

it's the rise of AI whether it's a

fight each other
 

5437
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:27,229
fight each other
and I think that the key question that

and I think that the key question that
 

5439
01:54:27,239 --> 01:54:28,970
and I think that the key question that
people who spread these ideas I mean

many of them they honestly believe it's
not malicious that they honestly believe

not malicious that they honestly believe
 

5445
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:37,250
not malicious that they honestly believe
in in these theories is do you want to

01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:05,100
frustrating because it
 

5555
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:08,169
frustrating because it
makes it very difficult to respond

5556
01:57:08,169 --> 01:57:08,179
makes it very difficult to respond
 

5557
01:57:08,179 --> 01:57:11,209
makes it very difficult to respond
because I sense that people have the

5558

because I sense that people have the
 

5559
01:57:11,219 --> 01:57:13,430
because I sense that people have the
right intentions like we said they have

01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:19,910
uh nervousness of
fear of power and the abuses of power

fear of power and the abuses of power
 

5565
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,070
fear of power and the abuses of power
and uh

5566
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:22,080
and uh
 

5567

the threat of it uh let's look like at

5684
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:53,580
the threat of it uh let's look like at
 

5685
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:56,270
the threat of it uh let's look like at
the threat side so folks like Elias

the threat side so folks like Elias
 

5687

the threat side so folks like Elias
yadkowski worry that AI might

kill all of us
 

5691
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:04,430
kill all of us
do you worry about that range of

5692
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:04,440
do you worry about that range of
 

5693
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,470
do you worry about that range of
possibilities where artificial

5694

intelligence systems
 

5697
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:11,149
intelligence systems
in a variety of ways might

5698
02:00:11,149 --> 02:00:11,159
in a variety of ways might
 

5699
02:00:11,159 --> 02:00:13,729
in a variety of ways might
destroy human civilization

yes you know I I talk a lot about it

5702
02:00:16,129 --> 02:00:16,139
yes you know I I talk a lot about it
 

5703
02:00:16,139 --> 02:00:17,990
yes you know I I talk a lot about it
about the dangers of AI I sometimes get

5704
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:18,000
about the dangers of AI I sometimes get
 

5705
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,510
about the dangers of AI I sometimes get
into trouble because I depict these

5706
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:20,520
into trouble because I depict these
 

5707
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,430
into trouble because I depict these
scenarios of how AI becoming very

5708
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:22,440
scenarios of how AI becoming very
 

5709
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:23,870
scenarios of how AI becoming very
dangerous and then people say that I'm

5710
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:23,880
dangerous and then people say that I'm
 

5711
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:26,209
dangerous and then people say that I'm
encouraging these scenarios but I'm I'm

5712
02:00:26,209 --> 02:00:26,219
encouraging these scenarios but I'm I'm
 

5713
02:00:26,219 --> 02:00:28,189
encouraging these scenarios but I'm I'm
you know I'm talking about it as a

5714
02:00:28,189 --> 02:00:28,199
you know I'm talking about it as a
 

5715
02:00:28,199 --> 02:00:31,609
you know I'm talking about it as a
warning I'm not so terrified of the

5716
02:00:31,609 --> 02:00:31,619
warning I'm not so terrified of the
 

5717
02:00:31,619 --> 02:00:34,370
warning I'm not so terrified of the
simplistic idea again the Terminator

5718

shooting everybody
 

5723
02:00:39,260 --> 02:00:43,910
shooting everybody
I'm more worried about AI accumulating

5724
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:43,920
I'm more worried about AI accumulating
 

5725
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,850
I'm more worried about AI accumulating
more and more power and basically taking

5726
02:00:46,850 --> 02:00:46,860
more and more power and basically taking
 

5727
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:50,510
more and more power and basically taking
over Society based taking over our lives

5728
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:50,520
over Society based taking over our lives
 

5729
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:53,930
over Society based taking over our lives
taking power away from us until we don't

5730
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:53,940
taking power away from us until we don't
 

5731
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:56,209
taking power away from us until we don't
understand what is happening and we lose

5732
02:00:56,209 --> 02:00:56,219
understand what is happening and we lose
 

5733
02:00:56,219 --> 02:00:59,750
understand what is happening and we lose
control of our lives and of the future

5734
02:00:59,750 --> 02:00:59,760
control of our lives and of the future
 

5735
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,970
control of our lives and of the future
the two most important things to realize

5736
02:01:01,970 --> 02:01:01,980
the two most important things to realize
 

5737
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,589
the two most important things to realize
about AI you know so many things are

5738
02:01:03,589 --> 02:01:03,599
about AI you know so many things are
 

5739
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:05,270
about AI you know so many things are
being said now about AI but I think

5740
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:05,280
being said now about AI but I think
 

5741
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,189
being said now about AI but I think
there are two things that every person

5742
02:01:07,189 --> 02:01:07,199
there are two things that every person
 

5743
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:09,169
there are two things that every person
should know about AI

5744
02:01:09,169 --> 02:01:09,179
should know about AI
 

5745
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:12,890
should know about AI
first is that AI is the First Tool in

5746
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:12,900
first is that AI is the First Tool in
 

5747
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:15,109
first is that AI is the First Tool in
history that can make decisions by

5748
02:01:15,109 --> 02:01:15,119
history that can make decisions by
 

5749
02:01:15,119 --> 02:01:16,250
history that can make decisions by
itself

5750
02:01:16,250 --> 02:01:16,260
itself
 

5751
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:18,589
itself
all previous Tools in history couldn't

5752
02:01:18,589 --> 02:01:18,599
all previous Tools in history couldn't
 

5753
02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:20,570
all previous Tools in history couldn't
make decisions this is why they

5754
02:01:20,570 --> 02:01:20,580
make decisions this is why they
 

5755
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:23,810
make decisions this is why they
empowered us you invent a knife you

5756
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:23,820
empowered us you invent a knife you
 

5757
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:26,629
empowered us you invent a knife you
invent an atom bomb the atom bomb cannot

5758
02:01:26,629 --> 02:01:26,639
invent an atom bomb the atom bomb cannot
 

5759
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:28,729
invent an atom bomb the atom bomb cannot
decide to start a war cannot decide

5760
02:01:28,729 --> 02:01:28,739
decide to start a war cannot decide
 

5761
02:01:28,739 --> 02:01:30,649
decide to start a war cannot decide
which city to own

5762
02:01:30,649 --> 02:01:30,659
which city to own
 

5763
02:01:30,659 --> 02:01:34,930
which city to own
AI can make decisions by itself

5764
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:34,940
AI can make decisions by itself
 

5765
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:38,870
AI can make decisions by itself
an autonomous weapon systems can decide

5766
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:38,880
an autonomous weapon systems can decide
 

5767
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:42,950
an autonomous weapon systems can decide
by themselves who to kill who to bomb

5768
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:42,960
by themselves who to kill who to bomb
 

5769
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,070
by themselves who to kill who to bomb
the second thing is that AI is the First

5770
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:46,080
the second thing is that AI is the First
 

5771
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,930
the second thing is that AI is the First
Tool in history that can create new

02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:47,940
Tool in history that can create new
 

5773
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:49,550
Tool in history that can create new
ideas by itself

the printing press could print our ideas

5776
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:52,800
the printing press could print our ideas
 

5777
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:57,109
the printing press could print our ideas
but could not create new ideas AI can

5778
02:01:57,109 --> 02:01:57,119
but could not create new ideas AI can
 

5779
02:01:57,119 --> 02:02:00,589
but could not create new ideas AI can
create new ideas entirely by itself

5780
02:02:00,589 --> 02:02:00,599
create new ideas entirely by itself
 

5781
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:03,709
create new ideas entirely by itself
this is unprecedented therefore it is

5782
02:02:03,709 --> 02:02:03,719
this is unprecedented therefore it is
 

5783
02:02:03,719 --> 02:02:05,810
this is unprecedented therefore it is
the first technology in history that

5784
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:05,820
the first technology in history that
 

5785
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:09,229
the first technology in history that
instead of giving power to humans it

5786
02:02:09,229 --> 02:02:09,239
instead of giving power to humans it
 

5787
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:11,810
instead of giving power to humans it
takes power away from us

5788
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:11,820
takes power away from us
 

5789
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:14,330
takes power away from us
and the danger is that if it will

5790
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:14,340
and the danger is that if it will
 

5791
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:16,550
and the danger is that if it will
increasingly take more and more power

5792
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:16,560
increasingly take more and more power

is done by AI the idea generation
 

5827
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:05,870
is done by AI the idea generation
is it that we become stale in our

is it that we become stale in our

so fundamental to like the evolution of

02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:11,760
so fundamental to like the evolution of
 

5833
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,850
so fundamental to like the evolution of
humanity that we can't resist the idea

humanity that we can't resist the idea
 

5835
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:16,490
humanity that we can't resist the idea
is to to resist an idea you need to have

5836
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:16,500
is to to resist an idea you need to have
 

5837
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:19,790
is to to resist an idea you need to have
some some vision of of the creative

some some vision of of the creative
 

5839
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:23,390
some some vision of of the creative

um you go back to Plato's Cave

5842
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:25,800
um you go back to Plato's Cave
 

5843
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:27,770
um you go back to Plato's Cave
some of this idea that people are

5844
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:27,780
some of this idea that people are
 

5845
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:31,189
some of this idea that people are
sitting chained in a cave and seeing

sitting chained in a cave and seeing
 

5847
02:03:31,199 --> 02:03:33,950
sitting chained in a cave and seeing
shadows on a screen on a wall and

02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:33,960
shadows on a screen on a wall and
 

5849
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:35,810
shadows on a screen on a wall and
thinking this is reality

5850
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:35,820
thinking this is reality

you go back to to the cart and he has

5852
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:38,880
you go back to to the cart and he has
 

5853
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,270
you go back to to the cart and he has
this thought experiment of the of the

5854
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:41,280
this thought experiment of the of the
 

5855
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,910
this thought experiment of the of the
demon and Descartes asks himself how do

5856
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:43,920
demon and Descartes asks himself how do

I know that any of this is real maybe

5858
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:46,320
I know that any of this is real maybe
 

5859
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:49,310
I know that any of this is real maybe
there is a demon who is creating all of

5860
02:03:49,310 --> 02:03:49,320
there is a demon who is creating all of
 

5861
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:52,729
there is a demon who is creating all of
this and is basically enslaving Me by

5862
02:03:52,729 --> 02:03:52,739
this and is basically enslaving Me by
 

5863
02:03:52,739 --> 02:03:55,850
this and is basically enslaving Me by
surrounding me with these Illusions you

5864
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:55,860
surrounding me with these Illusions you
 

5865
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:57,709
surrounding me with these Illusions you
go back to Buddha it's the same question

5866
02:03:57,709 --> 02:03:57,719
go back to Buddha it's the same question
 

5867
02:03:57,719 --> 02:04:00,530
go back to Buddha it's the same question
what if we are living in a world of

5868
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:00,540
what if we are living in a world of
 

5869
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:02,810
what if we are living in a world of
Illusions and because we have been

5870
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:02,820
Illusions and because we have been
 

5871
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:05,149
Illusions and because we have been
living in it throughout our lives all

5872
02:04:05,149 --> 02:04:05,159
living in it throughout our lives all
 

5873
02:04:05,159 --> 02:04:08,810
living in it throughout our lives all
our ideas or our desires how do we

5874
02:04:08,810 --> 02:04:08,820
our ideas or our desires how do we
 

5875
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:10,609
our ideas or our desires how do we
understand ourselves this is all the

5876
02:04:10,609 --> 02:04:10,619
understand ourselves this is all the
 

5877
02:04:10,619 --> 02:04:13,330
understand ourselves this is all the
product of the same illusions

5878
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:13,340
product of the same illusions
 

5879
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:16,250
product of the same illusions
and this was a big philosophical

5880
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:16,260
and this was a big philosophical
 

5881
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:18,830
and this was a big philosophical
question for thousands of years now it's

5882
02:04:18,830 --> 02:04:18,840
question for thousands of years now it's
 

5883
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:21,050
question for thousands of years now it's
becoming a practical question of

5884
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:21,060
becoming a practical question of
 

5885
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:23,810
becoming a practical question of
engineering because previously all the

5886
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:23,820
engineering because previously all the
 

5887
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:25,970
engineering because previously all the
ideas as far as we know maybe we are

5888
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:25,980
ideas as far as we know maybe we are
 

5889
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:27,970
ideas as far as we know maybe we are
living inside a computer simulation of

02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
um so an AI based on our float
 

6051
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,689
um so an AI based on our float
understanding of ourselves is a very

6052
02:08:11,689 --> 02:08:11,699
understanding of ourselves is a very
 

6053
02:08:11,699 --> 02:08:13,870
understanding of ourselves is a very
dangerous thing

6054
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:13,880
dangerous thing
 

6055
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:18,950
dangerous thing
I think that we need first of all to

6056
02:08:18,950 --> 02:08:18,960
I think that we need first of all to
 

6057
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:21,410
I think that we need first of all to
keep developing ourselves

6058
02:08:21,410 --> 02:08:21,420
keep developing ourselves
 

6059
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:24,649
keep developing ourselves
if if for every dollar and every minute

6060
02:08:24,649 --> 02:08:24,659
if if for every dollar and every minute
 

6061
02:08:24,659 --> 02:08:27,410
if if for every dollar and every minute
that we spend on developing AI

6062
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:27,420
that we spend on developing AI
 

6063
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:30,229
that we spend on developing AI
artificial intelligence we spend another

6064
02:08:30,229 --> 02:08:30,239
artificial intelligence we spend another
 

6065
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:32,990
artificial intelligence we spend another
dollar and another minute in developing

6066
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:33,000
dollar and another minute in developing
 

6067
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,629
dollar and another minute in developing
human consciousness the human mind will

6068
02:08:35,629 --> 02:08:35,639
human consciousness the human mind will
 

6069
02:08:35,639 --> 02:08:36,950
human consciousness the human mind will
be okay

6070
02:08:36,950 --> 02:08:36,960
be okay
 

6071
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,290
be okay
the danger is that we spend all our

6072
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:39,300
the danger is that we spend all our
 

6073
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:42,290
the danger is that we spend all our
effort on developing an AI at the time

6074
02:08:42,290 --> 02:08:42,300
effort on developing an AI at the time
 

6075
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:44,750
effort on developing an AI at the time
that we don't understand ourselves

6076
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:44,760
that we don't understand ourselves
 

6077
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:47,750
that we don't understand ourselves
and then letting the AI take over that's

6078
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:47,760
and then letting the AI take over that's
 

6079
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,450
and then letting the AI take over that's
that's a road to a human catastrophe

6080
02:08:50,450 --> 02:08:50,460
that's a road to a human catastrophe
 

6081
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:52,970
that's a road to a human catastrophe
does that surprise you how well large

6082
02:08:52,970 --> 02:08:52,980
does that surprise you how well large
 

6083
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:55,310
does that surprise you how well large
language models work I mean has it

6084
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:55,320
language models work I mean has it
 

6085
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,169
language models work I mean has it
modified your understanding of the

6086
02:08:57,169 --> 02:08:57,179
modified your understanding of the
 

6087
02:08:57,179 --> 02:08:59,810
modified your understanding of the
nature of intelligence yes I mean you

6088
02:08:59,810 --> 02:08:59,820
nature of intelligence yes I mean you
 

6089
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:02,149
nature of intelligence yes I mean you
know I've been writing about AI for

6090
02:09:02,149 --> 02:09:02,159
know I've been writing about AI for
 

6091
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:04,189
know I've been writing about AI for
I know like eight years now

6092
02:09:04,189 --> 02:09:04,199
I know like eight years now
 

6093
02:09:04,199 --> 02:09:07,250
I know like eight years now
and engage with all these predictions

6094
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:07,260
and engage with all these predictions
 

6095
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:09,950
and engage with all these predictions
and speculations and when it actually

6096
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:09,960
and speculations and when it actually
 

6097
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:12,470
and speculations and when it actually
came it was much faster and more

6098
02:09:12,470 --> 02:09:12,480
came it was much faster and more
 

6099
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:15,589
came it was much faster and more
powerful than I thought it would be

6100
02:09:15,589 --> 02:09:15,599
powerful than I thought it would be
 

6101
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:17,570
powerful than I thought it would be
um I didn't think that we would have in

6102
02:09:17,570 --> 02:09:17,580
um I didn't think that we would have in
 

6103
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:21,470
um I didn't think that we would have in
2023 an AI that can hold the

6104
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:21,480
2023 an AI that can hold the
 

6105
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:23,870
2023 an AI that can hold the
conversation that you can't know if it's

6106
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:23,880
conversation that you can't know if it's
 

6107
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:27,050
conversation that you can't know if it's
a human being or an AI that can write

6108
02:09:27,050 --> 02:09:27,060
a human being or an AI that can write
 

6109
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:30,350
a human being or an AI that can write
beautiful texts in telling I mean I I

6110
02:09:30,350 --> 02:09:30,360
beautiful texts in telling I mean I I
 

6111
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:33,470
beautiful texts in telling I mean I I
read the texts written by AI

6112
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:33,480
read the texts written by AI
 

6113
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:35,990
read the texts written by AI
and the thing that strikes me most is

6114
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:36,000
and the thing that strikes me most is
 

6115
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,550
and the thing that strikes me most is
the coherence

6116
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:37,560
the coherence
 

6117
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,050
the coherence
you know people think oh it's nothing

6118
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:39,060
you know people think oh it's nothing
 

6119
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:41,390
you know people think oh it's nothing
that just takes ideas from here and

6120
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:41,400
that just takes ideas from here and
 

6121
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:44,270
that just takes ideas from here and
their words from and putting no it's so

6122
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:44,280
their words from and putting no it's so
 

6123
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:47,689
their words from and putting no it's so
current I mean you read in not sentences

6124
02:09:47,689 --> 02:09:47,699
current I mean you read in not sentences
 

6125
02:09:47,699 --> 02:09:50,629
current I mean you read in not sentences
you read paragraphs you read entire

6126
02:09:50,629 --> 02:09:50,639
you read paragraphs you read entire
 

6127
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:53,990
you read paragraphs you read entire
texts and there is logic that there is a

6128
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:54,000
texts and there is logic that there is a
 

6129
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,930
texts and there is logic that there is a
structure not only go here and it's

6130
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:56,940
structure not only go here and it's
 

6131
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:58,729
structure not only go here and it's
convincing yes and the beautiful thing

6132
02:09:58,729 --> 02:09:58,739
convincing yes and the beautiful thing
 

6133
02:09:58,739 --> 02:10:00,950
convincing yes and the beautiful thing
about it that has to do with your work

6134
02:10:00,950 --> 02:10:00,960
about it that has to do with your work
 

6135
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:03,970
about it that has to do with your work
it doesn't have to be true

6136
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:03,980
it doesn't have to be true
 

6137
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:06,770
it doesn't have to be true
gets facts wrong but it still is

6138
02:10:06,770 --> 02:10:06,780
gets facts wrong but it still is
 

6139
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:08,030
gets facts wrong but it still is
convincing

6140
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:08,040
convincing
 

6141
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:11,030
convincing
and it is both scary and beautiful yeah

6142
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:11,040
and it is both scary and beautiful yeah
 

6143
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:14,510
and it is both scary and beautiful yeah
that our brains love language so much

6144
02:10:14,510 --> 02:10:14,520
that our brains love language so much
 

6145
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,570
that our brains love language so much
that we don't

6146
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:16,580
that we don't
 

6147
02:10:16,580 --> 02:10:19,729
that we don't
need the facts to be correct we just

6148
02:10:19,729 --> 02:10:19,739
need the facts to be correct we just
 

6149
02:10:19,739 --> 02:10:22,430
need the facts to be correct we just
needed to be a beautiful story yeah and

6150
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:22,440
needed to be a beautiful story yeah and
 

6151
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:24,410
needed to be a beautiful story yeah and
that's been the secret of politics and

6152
02:10:24,410 --> 02:10:24,420
that's been the secret of politics and
 

6153
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:27,470
that's been the secret of politics and
religion for thousands of years and now

6154
02:10:27,470 --> 02:10:27,480
religion for thousands of years and now
 

6155
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:30,530
religion for thousands of years and now
it's coming with AI so you as a person

6156
02:10:30,530 --> 02:10:30,540
it's coming with AI so you as a person
 

6157
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:31,910
it's coming with AI so you as a person
who has written some of the most

6158
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:31,920
who has written some of the most
 

6159
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,790
who has written some of the most
impactful words ever written in your

6160
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:34,800
impactful words ever written in your
 

6161
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,669
impactful words ever written in your
books uh how does that make you feel

6162
02:10:37,669 --> 02:10:37,679
books uh how does that make you feel
 

6163
02:10:37,679 --> 02:10:40,490
books uh how does that make you feel
that you might be one of the last

6164
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:40,500
that you might be one of the last
 

6165
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:43,129
that you might be one of the last
effective human writers that's a good

6166
02:10:43,129 --> 02:10:43,139
effective human writers that's a good
 

6167
02:10:43,139 --> 02:10:44,930
effective human writers that's a good
question first of all do you think

6168
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:44,940
question first of all do you think
 

6169
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:47,930
question first of all do you think
that's possible I think it is possible

6170
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:47,940
that's possible I think it is possible
 

6171
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:51,350
that's possible I think it is possible
um I I've seen a lot of examples of AI

6172
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:51,360
um I I've seen a lot of examples of AI
 

6173
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,390
um I I've seen a lot of examples of AI
being told right like Yuval no Harare

6174
02:10:53,390 --> 02:10:53,400
being told right like Yuval no Harare
 

6175
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,430
being told right like Yuval no Harare
and what it produces has it ever done

6176
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:55,440
and what it produces has it ever done
 

6177
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:56,810
and what it produces has it ever done
better than you think you could have

6178
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:56,820
better than you think you could have
 

6179
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:58,250
better than you think you could have
written yourself

6180
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:58,260
written yourself
 

6181
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:02,330
written yourself
I mean on the level of content of ideas

6182
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:02,340
I mean on the level of content of ideas
 

6183
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:05,149
I mean on the level of content of ideas
no there are things I say I would I

6184
02:11:05,149 --> 02:11:05,159
no there are things I say I would I
 

6185
02:11:05,159 --> 02:11:06,770
no there are things I say I would I
would never say that

6186
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:06,780
would never say that
 

6187
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:09,589
would never say that
but when it comes to the you know I mean

6188
02:11:09,589 --> 02:11:09,599
but when it comes to the you know I mean
 

6189
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:12,770
but when it comes to the you know I mean
there is again the currents and the

6190
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:12,780
there is again the currents and the
 

6191
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:15,169
there is again the currents and the
quality of writing is such

6192
02:11:15,169 --> 02:11:15,179
quality of writing is such
 

6193
02:11:15,179 --> 02:11:18,169
quality of writing is such
that I say it's it's unbelievable how

6194
02:11:18,169 --> 02:11:18,179
that I say it's it's unbelievable how
 

6195
02:11:18,179 --> 02:11:19,550
that I say it's it's unbelievable how
good it is

6196
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:19,560
good it is
 

6197
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:22,310
good it is
yeah and who knows in 10 years in 20

6198
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:22,320
yeah and who knows in 10 years in 20
 

6199
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:26,390
yeah and who knows in 10 years in 20
years maybe it can do better even on in

6200
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,400
years maybe it can do better even on in
 

6201
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:29,390
years maybe it can do better even on in
according to certain measures of on the

6202
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:29,400
according to certain measures of on the
 

6203
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:31,669
according to certain measures of on the
level of of content

6204
02:11:31,669 --> 02:11:31,679
level of of content
 

6205
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:33,530
level of of content
so that people would be able to do like

6206
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:33,540
so that people would be able to do like
 

6207

so that people would be able to do like
a style transfer to uh in the style of

02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:37,320
a style transfer to uh in the style of
 

6209
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:40,729
a style transfer to uh in the style of
Yuval no Harare right anything right why

6210
02:11:40,729 --> 02:11:40,739
Yuval no Harare right anything right why
 

6211
02:11:40,739 --> 02:11:43,910
Yuval no Harare right anything right why
I should have ice cream tonight

6212
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:43,920
I should have ice cream tonight
 

6213
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:45,830
I should have ice cream tonight
and and make it convinced I don't know

6214
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:45,840
and and make it convinced I don't know
 

6215
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,390
and and make it convinced I don't know
if I have anything convincing to say

6216
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:47,400
if I have anything convincing to say
 

6217
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,250
if I have anything convincing to say
about this I think you'll be surprised I

6218
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:49,260
about this I think you'll be surprised I
 

6219
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:50,450
about this I think you'll be surprised I
think you'd be surprised there could be

6220
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:50,460
think you'd be surprised there could be
 

6221
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:52,729
think you'd be surprised there could be
an evolutionary biology explanation for

6222
02:11:52,729 --> 02:11:52,739
an evolutionary biology explanation for
 

6223
02:11:52,739 --> 02:11:55,010
an evolutionary biology explanation for
why yeah ice cream is good for you yeah

6224
02:11:55,010 --> 02:11:55,020
why yeah ice cream is good for you yeah
 

6225
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:57,649
why yeah ice cream is good for you yeah
so I mean uh

6226
02:11:57,649 --> 02:11:57,659
so I mean uh
 

6227
02:11:57,659 --> 02:11:59,209
so I mean uh
I mean that changes the nature of

6228
02:11:59,209 --> 02:11:59,219
I mean that changes the nature of
 

6229
02:11:59,219 --> 02:12:02,149
I mean that changes the nature of
writing ultimately I I think it it goes

6230
02:12:02,149 --> 02:12:02,159
writing ultimately I I think it it goes
 

6231
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:03,109
writing ultimately I I think it it goes
back

6232
02:12:03,109 --> 02:12:03,119
back
 

6233
02:12:03,119 --> 02:12:04,609
back
um

6234
02:12:04,609 --> 02:12:04,619
um
 

6235
02:12:04,619 --> 02:12:07,250
um
much of of my writing

6236
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:07,260
much of of my writing
 

6237
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:12,050
much of of my writing
is suspicious of itself I write stories

6238
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:12,060
is suspicious of itself I write stories
 

6239
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:15,790
is suspicious of itself I write stories
about the danger of stories I write

6240
02:12:15,790 --> 02:12:15,800
about the danger of stories I write
 

6241
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:18,830
about the danger of stories I write
about intelligence but highlighting the

6242
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:18,840
about intelligence but highlighting the
 

6243
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:22,189
about intelligence but highlighting the
dangers of intelligence ultimately I

6244
02:12:22,189 --> 02:12:22,199
dangers of intelligence ultimately I
 

6245
02:12:22,199 --> 02:12:25,189
dangers of intelligence ultimately I
don't think that in terms of power

6246
02:12:25,189 --> 02:12:25,199
don't think that in terms of power
 

6247
02:12:25,199 --> 02:12:28,609
don't think that in terms of power
human power comes from intelligence and

6248
02:12:28,609 --> 02:12:28,619
human power comes from intelligence and
 

6249
02:12:28,619 --> 02:12:31,250
human power comes from intelligence and
from stories but I think that the

6250
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:31,260
from stories but I think that the
 

6251
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:33,890
from stories but I think that the
deepest and best qualities of humans are

6252
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:33,900
deepest and best qualities of humans are
 

6253
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:34,729
deepest and best qualities of humans are
not

6254
02:12:34,729 --> 02:12:34,739
not
 

6255
02:12:34,739 --> 02:12:37,729
not
intelligence and not storytelling and

6256
02:12:37,729 --> 02:12:37,739
intelligence and not storytelling and
 

6257
02:12:37,739 --> 02:12:40,910
intelligence and not storytelling and
not power again with all our power with

6258
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:40,920
not power again with all our power with
 

6259
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:42,370
not power again with all our power with
all our cooperation with our

6260
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:42,380
all our cooperation with our
 

6261
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:44,870
all our cooperation with our
intelligence we are on the verge of

6262
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:44,880
intelligence we are on the verge of
 

6263
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:47,629
intelligence we are on the verge of
destroying ourselves and destroying much

6264
02:12:47,629 --> 02:12:47,639
destroying ourselves and destroying much
 

6265
02:12:47,639 --> 02:12:49,689
destroying ourselves and destroying much
of the ecosystem

6266
02:12:49,689 --> 02:12:49,699
of the ecosystem
 

6267
02:12:49,699 --> 02:12:53,450
of the ecosystem
our our best qualities are not there

6268
02:12:53,450 --> 02:12:53,460
our our best qualities are not there
 

6269
02:12:53,460 --> 02:12:56,990
our our best qualities are not there
our best qualities are non-verbal again

6270
02:12:56,990 --> 02:12:57,000
our best qualities are non-verbal again
 

6271
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,030
our best qualities are non-verbal again
they come from things like compassion

6272
02:12:59,030 --> 02:12:59,040
they come from things like compassion
 

6273
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:02,510
they come from things like compassion
from introspection and introspection for

6274
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:02,520
from introspection and introspection for
 

6275
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:05,149
from introspection and introspection for
my experience is not verbal if you try

6276
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:05,159
my experience is not verbal if you try
 

6277
02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:07,430
my experience is not verbal if you try
to understand yourself with words you

6278
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:07,440
to understand yourself with words you
 

6279
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:11,149
to understand yourself with words you
will never succeed there is a a place

6280
02:13:11,149 --> 02:13:11,159
will never succeed there is a a place
 

6281
02:13:11,159 --> 02:13:12,830
will never succeed there is a a place
where you need the words

6282
02:13:12,830 --> 02:13:12,840
where you need the words
 

6283
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:15,350
where you need the words
but the deepest insights they don't come

6284
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
but the deepest insights they don't come
 

6285
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:18,109
but the deepest insights they don't come
from words

6286
02:13:18,109 --> 02:13:18,119

 

6287
02:13:18,119 --> 02:13:20,089

um and you can't write about it that

6288
02:13:20,089 --> 02:13:20,099
um and you can't write about it that
 

6289
02:13:20,099 --> 02:13:21,530
um and you can't write about it that
that's second it goes back to to

6290
02:13:21,530 --> 02:13:21,540
that's second it goes back to to
 

6291
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:23,870
that's second it goes back to to
Wittgenstein to Buddha to so many of

6292
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:23,880
Wittgenstein to Buddha to so many of
 

6293
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:26,810
Wittgenstein to Buddha to so many of
these sages before that uh this these

6294
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:26,820
these sages before that uh this these
 

6295
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:28,729
these sages before that uh this these
are the things we are silent about

6296
02:13:28,729 --> 02:13:28,739
are the things we are silent about
 

6297
02:13:28,739 --> 02:13:30,229
are the things we are silent about
yeah but eventually you have to project

6298
02:13:30,229 --> 02:13:30,239
yeah but eventually you have to project
 

6299
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:32,569
yeah but eventually you have to project
it as a writer you have to

6300
02:13:32,569 --> 02:13:32,579
it as a writer you have to
 

6301
02:13:32,579 --> 02:13:35,270
it as a writer you have to
uh do the silent introspection but

6302
02:13:35,270 --> 02:13:35,280
uh do the silent introspection but
 

6303
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,910
uh do the silent introspection but
projected onto a page yes but you still

6304
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:37,920
projected onto a page yes but you still
 

6305
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:40,569
projected onto a page yes but you still
have to warn people you will never find

6306
02:13:40,569 --> 02:13:40,579
have to warn people you will never find
 

6307
02:13:40,579 --> 02:13:43,729
have to warn people you will never find
the deepest truth in a book you will

6308
02:13:43,729 --> 02:13:43,739
the deepest truth in a book you will
 

6309
02:13:43,739 --> 02:13:46,129
the deepest truth in a book you will
never find it in words

6310
02:13:46,129 --> 02:13:46,139
never find it in words
 

6311
02:13:46,139 --> 02:13:49,310
never find it in words
uh you can only find it in I think in

6312
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:49,320
uh you can only find it in I think in
 

6313
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:51,530
uh you can only find it in I think in
direct experience which is non-verbal

6314
02:13:51,530 --> 02:13:51,540
direct experience which is non-verbal
 

6315
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:54,229
direct experience which is non-verbal
which is pretty verbal in the Silence of

6316
02:13:54,229 --> 02:13:54,239
which is pretty verbal in the Silence of
 

6317
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:58,189
which is pretty verbal in the Silence of
your own mind yes somewhere in there yes

6318

then uh a ridiculously big question

6322
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:04,440
then uh a ridiculously big question
 

6323
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:07,250
then uh a ridiculously big question
you have done a lot of deep thinking

6324
02:14:07,250 --> 02:14:07,260
you have done a lot of deep thinking
 

6325
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:09,229
you have done a lot of deep thinking
about the world about yourself this kind

6326
02:14:09,229 --> 02:14:09,239
about the world about yourself this kind
 

6327
02:14:09,239 --> 02:14:11,089
about the world about yourself this kind
of introspection

6328
02:14:11,089 --> 02:14:11,099
of introspection
 

6329
02:14:11,099 --> 02:14:13,490
of introspection
how do you think

6330
02:14:13,490 --> 02:14:13,500
how do you think
 

6331

how do you think
If You by way of advice but just

If You by way of advice but just
 

6333
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:19,370
If You by way of advice but just
practically speaking day to day how do

6334
02:14:19,370 --> 02:14:19,380
practically speaking day to day how do
 

6335
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:20,810
practically speaking day to day how do
you think about difficult problems with

diet
so for instance I read long books

6470
02:17:05,389 --> 02:17:05,399
so for instance I read long books
 

6471
02:17:05,399 --> 02:17:07,490

6477
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:17,990
interviews two five minutes interviews
uh the long format is in it's not always

6478
02:17:17,990 --> 02:17:18,000
uh the long format is in it's not always
 

6479
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,490
uh the long format is in it's not always
feasible

6480
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:19,500
feasible
 

6481
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:23,570
feasible
but you can go much much deeper

6482

preconceived idea solution and then try
 

6513
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,150
preconceived idea solution and then try

how to code because they'll need a lot
 

6863
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:20,090
how to code because they'll need a lot
of coders in the 2030s think again maybe

6864
02:25:20,090 --> 02:25:20,100
of coders in the 2030s think again maybe
 

6865
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:21,830
of coders in the 2030s think again maybe
AI is doing all the coding you don't

6866
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:21,840
AI is doing all the coding you don't
 

6867
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:23,510
AI is doing all the coding you don't
need any coders

6868
02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:23,520
need any coders
 

6869
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:25,429

you're going to I don't know you learn

6870

what skills will be needed
 

6877
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:35,510
what skills will be needed
so the most important skill is the skill

mind
 

6897
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:01,610
mind
if traditionally

6898
02:26:01,610 --> 02:26:01,620
if traditionally
 

6899
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:03,469
if traditionally
people thought about

6900
02:26:03,469 --> 02:26:03,479
people thought about
 

6901
02:26:03,479 --> 02:26:06,170
people thought about
education

6902
02:26:06,170 --> 02:26:06,180
education
 

6903
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:10,309
education
like building a stone house with very

6904
02:26:10,309 --> 02:26:10,319
like building a stone house with very
 

6905
02:26:10,319 --> 02:26:12,050
like building a stone house with very
deep foundations

6906
02:26:12,050 --> 02:26:12,060
deep foundations
 

6907
02:26:12,060 --> 02:26:14,570
deep foundations
now it's more like setting up a tent

6908
02:26:14,570 --> 02:26:14,580
now it's more like setting up a tent
 

6909
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:17,150
now it's more like setting up a tent
that you can fold and move to the next

that you can fold and move to the next
 

6911
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:19,490
that you can fold and move to the next
place very very quickly because that's

6912
02:26:19,490 --> 02:26:19,500
place very very quickly because that's
 

6913
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:21,770
place very very quickly because that's
the 21st century

6914
02:26:21,770 --> 02:26:21,780
the 21st century
 

6915
02:26:21,780 --> 02:26:25,610
the 21st century
which also raises questions about the

6916
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:25,620
which also raises questions about the
 

6917
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:27,650
which also raises questions about the
the the future of Education what that

6918
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:27,660
the the future of Education what that
 

6919
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:29,990
the the future of Education what that
looks like yeah let me ask you about

6920
02:26:29,990 --> 02:26:30,000

um

6924
02:26:33,650 --> 02:26:33,660
um
 

6925
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:36,290
um
what were some of the challenges what

6926
02:26:36,290 --> 02:26:36,300
what were some of the challenges what
 

6927
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:38,510
what were some of the challenges what
were some of the lessons uh about love

6928
02:26:38,510 --> 02:26:38,520
were some of the lessons uh about love

were some of the lessons uh about love
about life that you learned from coming

out as gay hmm
 

6933
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:45,590
out as gay hmm
in many ways it goes back to the stories

6934
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:45,600
in many ways it goes back to the stories
 

6935
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:48,650
in many ways it goes back to the stories
I think this is one of the

6936
02:26:48,650 --> 02:26:48,660
I think this is one of the
 

6937
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:50,570
I think this is one of the
one of the reasons I became so

6938
02:26:50,570 --> 02:26:50,580
one of the reasons I became so
 

6939
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:53,090
one of the reasons I became so
interested in stories and in their power

6940
02:26:53,090 --> 02:26:53,100
interested in stories and in their power
 

6941
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:56,690
interested in stories and in their power
was I grew up in um

6942
02:26:56,690 --> 02:26:56,700
was I grew up in um
 

6943
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:59,750
was I grew up in um
small Israeli town in the 1980s early

6944
02:26:59,750 --> 02:26:59,760
small Israeli town in the 1980s early
 

6945
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:04,450
small Israeli town in the 1980s early
1990s which was very homophobic

6946
02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:04,460
1990s which was very homophobic
 

6947
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:09,050
1990s which was very homophobic
and I basically embraced it I I breathed

6948
02:27:09,050 --> 02:27:09,060
and I basically embraced it I I breathed
 

6949
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:10,010
and I basically embraced it I I breathed
it

6950
02:27:10,010 --> 02:27:10,020
it
 

6951
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:11,750
it
because

6952
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:11,760
because
 

6953
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:13,670
because
you could hardly even think

6954
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:13,680
you could hardly even think
 

6955
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:15,469
you could hardly even think
differently

6956
02:27:15,469 --> 02:27:15,479
differently
 

6957
02:27:15,479 --> 02:27:17,389
differently
so you had these two powerful stories

6958
02:27:17,389 --> 02:27:17,399
so you had these two powerful stories
 

6959
02:27:17,399 --> 02:27:22,610
so you had these two powerful stories
around one that God hates gay people and

6960
02:27:22,610 --> 02:27:22,620
around one that God hates gay people and
 

6961
02:27:22,620 --> 02:27:25,429
around one that God hates gay people and
that uh he will punish them if if they

6962
02:27:25,429 --> 02:27:25,439
that uh he will punish them if if they
 

6963
02:27:25,439 --> 02:27:28,550
that uh he will punish them if if they
for who they are or for what they do

6964
02:27:28,550 --> 02:27:28,560
for who they are or for what they do
 

6965
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:31,130
for who they are or for what they do
secondly that it's not God it's nature

6966
02:27:31,130 --> 02:27:31,140
secondly that it's not God it's nature
 

6967
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:33,950
secondly that it's not God it's nature
that there is something diseased or sick

6968
02:27:33,950 --> 02:27:33,960
that there is something diseased or sick
 

6969
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:37,190
that there is something diseased or sick
about it and these people maybe they are

6970
02:27:37,190 --> 02:27:37,200
about it and these people maybe they are
 

6971
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:40,130
about it and these people maybe they are
not Sinners but uh they are they are

6972
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:40,140
not Sinners but uh they are they are
 

6973
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:43,570
not Sinners but uh they are they are
sick they are defective

6974
02:27:43,570 --> 02:27:43,580
sick they are defective
 

6975
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:46,490
sick they are defective
and nobody wanted to identify with such

6976
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:46,500
and nobody wanted to identify with such
 

6977
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:48,349
and nobody wanted to identify with such
a thing if your options okay you can be

gay and was hiding it I was hiding it
from myself successfully that I I don't

7028
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:52,380
from myself successfully that I I don't
 

7029
02:28:52,380 --> 02:28:53,870
from myself successfully that I I don't
understand how it is possible looking

7030
02:28:53,870 --> 02:28:53,880
understand how it is possible looking
 

7031

7105
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:32,690
of nature that you can't move faster
than the speed of light now you don't

7106
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:32,700
than the speed of light now you don't
 

7107
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:35,330

7111
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:40,309
the laws of nature by going faster than
the speed of light and then nature comes

7112
02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:40,319
the speed of light and then nature comes
 

7113
02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:42,290
the speed of light and then nature comes
