sort of second guessing and things like
 

497
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,269
sort of second guessing and things like
that so that was always uh

this is what our goal is and these are
 

663
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,990
this is what our goal is and these are
the metrics by which we'll agree to

664
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
the metrics by which we'll agree to
 

665
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,590
the metrics by which we'll agree to
measure them by

666
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
measure them by
 

667
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,550
measure them by
because

668
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
because
 

669
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,590
because
if you don't have that shared

670

if you don't have that shared
 

671
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,030
if you don't have that shared
you know hey we're going to take this

672
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
you know hey we're going to take this
 

673
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,790
you know hey we're going to take this
journey

674
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
journey
 

675

then i think that's where people get

676
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
then i think that's where people get
 

677
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,949
then i think that's where people get
upset disappointed etc

678
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
upset disappointed etc
 

679
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,230
upset disappointed etc
what about

680
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
what about
 

681
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,710
what about
this is a weird question but constraints

682
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
this is a weird question but constraints
 

683
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,230
this is a weird question but constraints
so this is both for filmmaking and

684
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
so this is both for filmmaking and
 

685
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,629
so this is both for filmmaking and
investment

686

so i

692
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
so i
 

693
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,670
so i
i like constraints a lot

694
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
i like constraints a lot
 

695
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,230
i like constraints a lot
it's like constraints

696
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
it's like constraints
 

697
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,470
it's like constraints

would or many others would fail at this

00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
something is difficult when
 

855
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,870
something is difficult when
when people tell you that something is

856
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
when people tell you that something is
 

857
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,430
when people tell you that something is
impossible i love that because it's like

people would believe
 

863
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,870
people would believe
and that gives you an opportunity to be

864
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
and that gives you an opportunity to be
 

865
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,949
and that gives you an opportunity to be
the person who shows it's not impossible

866
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
the person who shows it's not impossible
 

867

953
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,110
that was
pretty surreal

954
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
pretty surreal
 

955
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,230
pretty surreal
um

956
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240

know dark knight rises was it was an
expensive film but again to me there's a

962
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
expensive film but again to me there's a
 

963
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,710
expensive film but again to me there's a
difference between expensive and

964
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
difference between expensive and
 

965
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,389
difference between expensive and
irresponsible

966
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
irresponsible
 

967
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,790
irresponsible
and expensive because the vision

968
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
and expensive because the vision
 

969
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,389
and expensive because the vision
warranted

970
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
warranted
 

971
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,990
warranted
and it turned out financially it

972
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000

you know
there's a drive there to invent to

2266
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:18,640
there's a drive there to invent to
 

2267
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,150
there's a drive there to invent to

it's like that hopeful optimistic spirit
 

2277
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,069
it's like that hopeful optimistic spirit
especially in the engineering space like

2278
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:32,079
especially in the engineering space like
 

2279
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,510
especially in the engineering space like
if you pay attention to the internet

stuff and the the doing part when you
 

2293
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,109
stuff and the the doing part when you

wilke who used to be at amazon
 

2353
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,390
wilke who used to be at amazon
and we all felt the same way that

2354
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,400
and we all felt the same way that
 

2355
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,630
and we all felt the same way that
you know america needed to make sure

2356
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:54,640
you know america needed to make sure
 

2357
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,470
you know america needed to make sure
that it didn't lose its edge in that way

2358
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:56,480
that it didn't lose its edge in that way
 

2359
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,670
that it didn't lose its edge in that way
so

2360
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680
so
 

2361
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,309
so
it's uh it's a company that invests in

2362
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:00,319
it's uh it's a company that invests in
 

2363
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,430
it's uh it's a company that invests in
american

2364
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440

high-tech manufacturing

2366
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,079
high-tech manufacturing
 

2367
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,670
high-tech manufacturing
and i think the way that we do that is

2368
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
and i think the way that we do that is
 

2369
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,430
and i think the way that we do that is
provide capital

2370
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
provide capital
 

2371
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,430
provide capital
provide training

2372
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
provide training
 

2373
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,829
provide training
to me this is also fertile ground for

2374
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:11,839
to me this is also fertile ground for
 

2375
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,630
to me this is also fertile ground for
good sustainable high-paying jobs um and

2376
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:16,640
good sustainable high-paying jobs um and
 

2377
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,829
good sustainable high-paying jobs um and
you know we have to we have to make it

2378
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:19,839
you know we have to we have to make it
 

2379
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,230
you know we have to we have to make it
economically feasible to do that again

2380
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,240
economically feasible to do that again
 

2381
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,670
economically feasible to do that again
here in this country

2382
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,680
here in this country
 

2383
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,069
here in this country
uh and not to say to companies that

2384
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
uh and not to say to companies that
 

2385
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,430
uh and not to say to companies that
again are being weighed and measured

2386
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,440
again are being weighed and measured
 

2387
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,589
again are being weighed and measured
quarter by quarter hey this is three

2388
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
quarter by quarter hey this is three
 

2389
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,670
quarter by quarter hey this is three
times as expensive to do it here but you

2390
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
times as expensive to do it here but you
 

2391
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,030
times as expensive to do it here but you
should do it here

2392
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,040
should do it here
 

2393
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,270
should do it here
we need to innovate and and we need to

2394
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
we need to innovate and and we need to
 

2395
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,150
we need to innovate and and we need to
create processes and and

2396
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,160
create processes and and
 

2397
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,630
create processes and and
companies and opportunity that balance

2398
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640
companies and opportunity that balance
 

2399
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,990
companies and opportunity that balance
that equation

2400
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,000
that equation
 

2401
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,510
that equation
and i think as we saw during the

2402
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:43,520
and i think as we saw during the
 

2403
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,109
and i think as we saw during the
pandemic

2404
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
pandemic
 

2405
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,870
pandemic
you know i don't think in this day and

2406
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
you know i don't think in this day and
 

2407
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,069
you know i don't think in this day and
age you can be an isolationist that

2408
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
age you can be an isolationist that
 

2409
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,470
age you can be an isolationist that
that doesn't make any sense to me but

2410
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
that doesn't make any sense to me but
 

2411
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,790
that doesn't make any sense to me but
being self-reliant and self-determinate

2412
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:54,800
being self-reliant and self-determinate
 

2413
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,470
being self-reliant and self-determinate
and making sure

2414
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:56,480
and making sure
 

2415
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,589
and making sure
that you

2416
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
that you
 

2417
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,230
that you
are never in a position as a nation

2418
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,240
are never in a position as a nation
 

2419
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,069
are never in a position as a nation
that we can't do basic things because

2420
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079
that we can't do basic things because
 

2421
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,630
that we can't do basic things because
we're relying on supply chain in other

2422
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:04,640
we're relying on supply chain in other
 

2423
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,470
we're relying on supply chain in other
countries and whether it's

2424
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480
countries and whether it's
 

2425
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,670
countries and whether it's
you know uh we're not friends anymore or

2426
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:09,680
you know uh we're not friends anymore or
 

2427
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,230
you know uh we're not friends anymore or
a natural disaster or a virus or

2428
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,240
a natural disaster or a virus or
 

2429
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,750
a natural disaster or a virus or
something pops up

2430
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
something pops up
 

2431
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,750
something pops up
i think those are

2432
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
i think those are
 

2433
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,670
i think those are
costs of doing business that we have to

2434
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:17,680
costs of doing business that we have to
 

2435
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,910
costs of doing business that we have to
put into the calculus

2436
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
put into the calculus
 

2437
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,870
put into the calculus
of

2438
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:20,880
of
 

2439
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,589
of
uh

2440
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
uh
 

2441
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,950
uh
being able to make things here there's

2442
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:22,960
being able to make things here there's
 

2443
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,109
being able to make things here there's
an extremely high cost to making supply

2444
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
an extremely high cost to making supply
 

2445
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,870
an extremely high cost to making supply
chain resilient that we really have to

2446
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
chain resilient that we really have to
 

2447
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,510
chain resilient that we really have to
consider and it's so

2448
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:29,520
consider and it's so
 

2449
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,670
consider and it's so
if you really consider that cost it

2450
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:31,680
if you really consider that cost it
 

2451
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,950
if you really consider that cost it
makes a lot of sense to invest

2452
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:32,960
makes a lot of sense to invest
 

2453
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,430
makes a lot of sense to invest
especially long term in building up

2454
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:35,440
especially long term in building up
 

2455
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,829
especially long term in building up
manufacturing in a way where like you're

2456
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:37,839
manufacturing in a way where like you're
 

2457
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,230
manufacturing in a way where like you're
making most of the stuff in one place

2458
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,240
making most of the stuff in one place
 

2459
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,710
making most of the stuff in one place
sort of uh

2460
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:42,720
sort of uh
 

2461
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,390
sort of uh
bringing it all

2462
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
bringing it all
 

2463
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,190
bringing it all
not all but as much in as possible and

2464
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
not all but as much in as possible and
 

2465
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,750
not all but as much in as possible and
um building it almost like from scratch

2466
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
um building it almost like from scratch
 

2467
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,829
um building it almost like from scratch
here in the united states i mean what

2468
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
here in the united states i mean what
 

2469
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,589
here in the united states i mean what
i guess the

2470
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:53,599
i guess the
 

2471
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,710
i guess the
your thought is with innovation

2472
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:56,720
your thought is with innovation
 

2473
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,710
your thought is with innovation
uh it's possible to sort of

2474
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
uh it's possible to sort of
 

2475
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,990
uh it's possible to sort of
revolutionize the way we do

2476
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,000
revolutionize the way we do
 

2477
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,910
revolutionize the way we do
manufacturing so reduce the amount of

2478
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
manufacturing so reduce the amount of
 

2479
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,550
manufacturing so reduce the amount of
supply chain stuff and like build stuff

2480
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:04,560
supply chain stuff and like build stuff
 

2481
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,109
supply chain stuff and like build stuff
from scratch like do a high-tech

2482
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
from scratch like do a high-tech
 

2483
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,630
from scratch like do a high-tech
manufacturing

2484
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
manufacturing
 

2485
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,589
manufacturing
so like

2486
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
so like
 

2487
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,950
so like
optimize all aspects of the

2488
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:10,960
optimize all aspects of the
 

2489
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,510
optimize all aspects of the
manufacturing all that kind of stuff

2490
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:13,520
manufacturing all that kind of stuff
 

2491
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,430
manufacturing all that kind of stuff
yeah and i think where technology

2492
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
yeah and i think where technology
 

2493
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,430
yeah and i think where technology
is the most efficient

2494
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
is the most efficient
 

2495
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,349
is the most efficient
uh is is the human machine interface

2496
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
uh is is the human machine interface
 

2497
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,349
uh is is the human machine interface
right it's not let's automate everything

2498
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:25,359
right it's not let's automate everything
 

2499
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,309
right it's not let's automate everything
and have nobody work anywhere i i

2500
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
and have nobody work anywhere i i
 

2501
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,710
and have nobody work anywhere i i
for a long time that's neither feasible

2502
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
for a long time that's neither feasible
 

2503
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,309
for a long time that's neither feasible
nor desirable

2504
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:32,319
nor desirable
 

2505
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,790
nor desirable
but where we can enhance

2506
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:34,800
but where we can enhance
 

2507
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,349
but where we can enhance
jobs

2508
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:37,359
jobs
 

2509
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,150
jobs
and

2510
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
and
 

2511
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,230
and
make that interface immensely productive

2512
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,240
make that interface immensely productive
 

2513
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,910
make that interface immensely productive
with the right training and so forth i

2514

um
 

2557
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,030
um
have never really delved deeply into it

2558
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,040
have never really delved deeply into it
 

2559
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,270
have never really delved deeply into it
or made investments in it but i think

2560
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
or made investments in it but i think
 

2561
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,190
or made investments in it but i think
what's exciting about it is everything

2562
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
what's exciting about it is everything
 

2563
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,069
what's exciting about it is everything
from

2564
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,079
from
 

2565
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,550
from
doing jobs that are very dangerous for

2566
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
doing jobs that are very dangerous for
 

2567
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,829
doing jobs that are very dangerous for
humans

humans
 

2569
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:38,630
humans
um

2570
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,640
um
 

2571
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,430
um
enhancing the human experience

2572
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
enhancing the human experience
 

2573
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,790
enhancing the human experience
when you look at really repetitive labor

2574
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:44,800
when you look at really repetitive labor
 

2575
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,710
when you look at really repetitive labor
things that

2576
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
things that
 

2577
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,670
things that
you know

2578
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:47,680
you know
 

2579
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,430
you know
it might take away a job but is it a

2580
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
it might take away a job but is it a
 

2581
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,990
it might take away a job but is it a
good job for that that person is you

2582
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,000
good job for that that person is you
 

2583
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,829
good job for that that person is you
know spending 30 years doing something

2584
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:53,839
know spending 30 years doing something
 

2585
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,150
know spending 30 years doing something
highly repetitious is that

2586
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
highly repetitious is that
 

2587
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,870
highly repetitious is that
is that a good experience in life

2588
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:58,880
is that a good experience in life
 

2589
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,790
is that a good experience in life
so i think um and then when you think

2590
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,800
so i think um and then when you think
 

2591
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,349
so i think um and then when you think
about everything from military

2592
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:03,359
about everything from military
 

2593
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,870
about everything from military
applications

2594
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880
applications
 

2595
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,670
applications
uh

2596
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:05,680
uh
 

2597
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,829
uh
you know rescue we're already seeing a

2598
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
you know rescue we're already seeing a
 

2599
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,230
you know rescue we're already seeing a
bunch of those things and then

2600
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
bunch of those things and then
 

2601
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,630
bunch of those things and then
just lastly when you talk about that

2602
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
just lastly when you talk about that
 

2603
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,430
just lastly when you talk about that
human interaction with robots when you

2604
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
human interaction with robots when you
 

2605
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,790
human interaction with robots when you
start to have

2606
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:16,800
start to have
 

2607
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,430
start to have
the combination so you have some level

2608
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:19,440
the combination so you have some level
 

2609
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,990
the combination so you have some level
of intelligence and interaction

2610
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,000
of intelligence and interaction
 

2611
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,270
of intelligence and interaction
i mean

2612
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:23,280
i mean
 

2613
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,670
i mean
that's why we always love the droids in

2614
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
that's why we always love the droids in
 

2615
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,470
that's why we always love the droids in
star wars right i mean it's uh

2616
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:28,480
star wars right i mean it's uh
 

2617
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,710
star wars right i mean it's uh
it it's it's exciting it captures the

2618
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
it it's it's exciting it captures the
 

2619
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,230
it it's it's exciting it captures the
imagination

2620
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
imagination
 

2621
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,589
imagination
um

2622
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
um
 

2623
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,309
um
and i i think look

2624
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:36,319
and i i think look
 

2625
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,470
and i i think look
many many hours and

2626
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
many many hours and
 

2627
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,109
many many hours and
have been spent on debating artificial

2628
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,119
have been spent on debating artificial
 

2629
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,710
have been spent on debating artificial
intelligence

2630
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:42,720
intelligence
 

2631
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,589
intelligence
and the the ramifications if things go

2632
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:45,599
and the the ramifications if things go
 

2633
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,510
and the the ramifications if things go
sideways and so forth

2634
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:47,520
sideways and so forth
 

2635
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,069
sideways and so forth
um and i think those are all

2636
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:50,079
um and i think those are all
 

2637
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,990
um and i think those are all
you know those are appropriate

2638
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,000
you know those are appropriate
 

2639
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,069
you know those are appropriate
conversations to be having

2640
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:54,079
conversations to be having
 

2641
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,870
conversations to be having
ai is happening uh i think it's actually

2642
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:56,880
ai is happening uh i think it's actually
 

2643
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,550
ai is happening uh i think it's actually
happening slower than most people

2644
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
happening slower than most people
 

2645
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,829
happening slower than most people
realize

2646
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
realize
 

2647
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,510
realize
um

2648
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:01,520
um
 

2649
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,470
um
because there are tasks that humans do

2650
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:04,480
because there are tasks that humans do
 

2651
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,710
because there are tasks that humans do
every minute of every day

2652
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
every minute of every day
 

2653
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,109
every minute of every day
standing up without losing your sense of

2654
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:09,119
standing up without losing your sense of
 

2655
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,589
standing up without losing your sense of
balance i mean these are really hard

2656
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
balance i mean these are really hard
 

2657
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,790
balance i mean these are really hard
things

2658
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
things
 

2659
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,309
things
but i think

2660
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
but i think
 

2661
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,750
but i think
there's enough

2662
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:15,760
there's enough
 

2663
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,990
there's enough
investment both in private industry as

2664
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:18,000
investment both in private industry as
 

2665
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,390
investment both in private industry as
well as nation states now on artificial

2666
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
well as nation states now on artificial
 

2667
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,670

intelligence that it is coming

2668
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
intelligence that it is coming
 

2669
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,349
intelligence that it is coming
so both in the software space in the

2670
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:25,359
so both in the software space in the
 

2671
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,270
so both in the software space in the
digital space

2672
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:27,280
digital space
 

2673
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,589
digital space
and in the physical space so we talked

2674
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:29,599
and in the physical space so we talked
 

2675
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,030
and in the physical space so we talked
about manufacturing so industrial

2676
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,040
about manufacturing so industrial
 

2677
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,710
about manufacturing so industrial
robotics

2678
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:32,720
robotics
 

2679
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,950
robotics
is very true that even in the factory

2680
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:34,960
is very true that even in the factory
 

2681
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,190
is very true that even in the factory
even the tasks that you think are

2682
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:37,200
even the tasks that you think are
 

2683
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,270
even the tasks that you think are
pretty um

2684
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,280
pretty um
 

2685
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,470
pretty um
basic

2686
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:40,480
basic
 

2687
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,190
basic
you know the amount of small

2688
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,200
you know the amount of small
 

2689
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,190
you know the amount of small
intuitive decisions that humans make is

2690
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:45,200
intuitive decisions that humans make is
 

2691
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,230
intuitive decisions that humans make is
quite incredible so we have to be kind

2692
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
quite incredible so we have to be kind
 

2693
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,549
quite incredible so we have to be kind
of explicit about saying which tasks are

2694
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:50,559
of explicit about saying which tasks are
 

2695
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,950
of explicit about saying which tasks are
actually really hard and humans are just

2696
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:52,960
actually really hard and humans are just
 

2697
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,630
actually really hard and humans are just
really good at them

2698
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:54,640
really good at them
 

2699
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,710
really good at them
and uh so

2700
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:56,720
and uh so
 

2701
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,710
and uh so
on and on the flip side in the digital

2702
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
on and on the flip side in the digital
 

2703
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,549
on and on the flip side in the digital
space was the social networks of

2704
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:00,559
space was the social networks of
 

2705
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,870
space was the social networks of
recommender systems with all kinds of

2706
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
recommender systems with all kinds of
 

2707
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,109
recommender systems with all kinds of
like personal assistants in terms of

2708
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119
like personal assistants in terms of
 

2709
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,030
like personal assistants in terms of
voice

2710
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:07,040

2711
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,150
voice
voice based ai systems all of that

2712
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,160
voice based ai systems all of that
 

2713
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,030
voice based ai systems all of that
there's

2714
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
there's
 

2715
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,190
there's
opportunities there to find niches where

2716
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
opportunities there to find niches where
 

2717
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,870
opportunities there to find niches where
ai can really have

2718
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
ai can really have
 

2719
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,190
ai can really have
a transformative effects

2720
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:17,200
a transformative effects
 

2721
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,470
a transformative effects
i think one of the

2722
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,480
i think one of the
 

2723
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,870
i think one of the
places that really haven't

2724
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:24,880

 

2725
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,470

this is where like you're worried to say

2726
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,480
this is where like you're worried to say
 

2727
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,549
this is where like you're worried to say
stupid things but i believe this very

2728
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:28,559
stupid things but i believe this very
 

2729
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,349
stupid things but i believe this very
much

much
that um

2732
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
that um
 

2733
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,549
that um
when we have ai systems in the home

2734
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:32,559
when we have ai systems in the home
 

2735
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,470
when we have ai systems in the home
currently you have somebody like alexa

2736
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:34,480
currently you have somebody like alexa
 

2737
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,710
currently you have somebody like alexa
and google home and so on they're kind

2738
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
and google home and so on they're kind
 

2739
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,710
and google home and so on they're kind
of

of
 

2741
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,630
of
very basic servants

2742
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
very basic servants
 

2743
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,230

i think there's a lot of value in
 

2753
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,470
i think there's a lot of value in
systems that

2754
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
systems that
 

2755
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,349
systems that
form relationships with us in the way

2756
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:55,359

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,109
acquaintances you have lifelong friends
all that that that friendship you have

2788
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:25,119
all that that that friendship you have
 

2789
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,270
all that that that friendship you have
i really believe that there is some

2790
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:27,280
i really believe that there is some
 

2791
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,589
i really believe that there is some
aspect of the human experience

2792
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599
aspect of the human experience
 

2793
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,790
aspect of the human experience
that

2794
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:30,800
that
 

2795
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,910
that
is deeply enriched by interacting with

2796
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
is deeply enriched by interacting with
 

2797
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,270
is deeply enriched by interacting with
other beings

2798
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
other beings
 

2799
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,750
other beings
and for

2800
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:37,760
and for
 

2801
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,710

world to have the capability to engage
 

2807
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,309
world to have the capability to engage
in some of that i think is not just an

2808
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:48,319
in some of that i think is not just an
 

2809
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,390
in some of that i think is not just an
opportunity to

2810
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:50,400
opportunity to
 

2811
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,109
opportunity to
to to uh help people grow become better

2812
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,119
to to uh help people grow become better
 

2813
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,470
to to uh help people grow become better
people but it's also just a good

2814
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
people but it's also just a good
 

2815
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,710
people but it's also just a good
business opportunity too and that hasn't

2816
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:56,720
business opportunity too and that hasn't
 

2817
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,870
business opportunity too and that hasn't
really been explored enough so that to

2818
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:58,880
really been explored enough so that to
 

2819
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,630
really been explored enough so that to
me is really

2820
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
me is really
 

2821
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,710
me is really
that's a whole exciting space that i

2822
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:02,720
that's a whole exciting space that i
 

2823
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,510
that's a whole exciting space that i
think

2824
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,520
think
 

2825
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,710
think
will enable better industrial

2826
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:06,720
will enable better industrial
 

2827
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,870
will enable better industrial
industrial robotics it will it it will

2828
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
industrial robotics it will it it will
 

2829
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,670
industrial robotics it will it it will

a better social network a competitor to
 

2833
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,910
a better social network a competitor to
facebook that overthrows facebook so

2834

it'll it'll create better technologies

2836
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:19,680
it'll it'll create better technologies
 

2837
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,630
it'll it'll create better technologies
that uh currently don't have that human

2838
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
that uh currently don't have that human

i don't know that's super exciting to me

2842
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:27,599
i don't know that's super exciting to me
 

2843
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,190
i don't know that's super exciting to me
but that that has to deal with the mess

2844
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,200
but that that has to deal with the mess
 

2845
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,630
but that that has to deal with the mess
of

2846
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:32,640
of
 

2847
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,230
of
human nature

2848
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
human nature
 

2849
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,390
human nature
the the the reason that most robotics

2850
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
the the the reason that most robotics
 

2851
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,390
the the the reason that most robotics
people and ai people stay away from

humans
 

2855
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,470
humans
they stay away from the human robot

2856
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
they stay away from the human robot
 

2857
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,630
they stay away from the human robot
interaction problem it's because humans

2858
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:44,640
interaction problem it's because humans
 

2859
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,510
interaction problem it's because humans
are complicated they're messy they're

2860
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
are complicated they're messy they're
 

2861
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,030
are complicated they're messy they're
hard to control

2862
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,040
hard to control
 

2863
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,870
hard to control
they're hard to

2864
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880

 

2865
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,750

predict stuff about they're hard to make

2866
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:55,760
predict stuff about they're hard to make
 

2867
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,790
predict stuff about they're hard to make
sense of or like test repeatedly because

2868
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:58,800
sense of or like test repeatedly because
 

2869
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,670
sense of or like test repeatedly because
one human can be drastically different

2870
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:01,680
one human can be drastically different
 

2871
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,750
one human can be drastically different
from another human and so for to deal

2872
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
from another human and so for to deal
 

2873
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,190
from another human and so for to deal
with that as the robotics problem is

2874
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,200
with that as the robotics problem is
 

2875
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,950
with that as the robotics problem is
super hard

2876
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:06,960
super hard
 

2877
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,950
super hard
and so one of the questions

2878
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:08,960
and so one of the questions
 

2879
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,470
and so one of the questions
is uh

2880
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:10,480
is uh
 

2881
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,950
is uh
which problems can you remove the human

2882
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:12,960
which problems can you remove the human
 

2883
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,470
which problems can you remove the human
from consideration when you're trying to

2884
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,480
from consideration when you're trying to
 

2885
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,710
from consideration when you're trying to
solve the problem so like elon musk is

2886
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:16,720
solve the problem so like elon musk is
 

2887
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,790
solve the problem so like elon musk is
an example of somebody who believes

2891
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,670
autonomous driving we can remove the
human from consideration we can solve

2892
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:23,680
human from consideration we can solve
 

2893
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,309
human from consideration we can solve
autonomous driving as a robotics problem

2894

the board
 

3069
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,870
the board
so how do you it seems like a lot of the

3070
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
so how do you it seems like a lot of the
 

3071
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,589
so how do you it seems like a lot of the
disruption has to do with

3072
00:54:37,589 --> 00:54:37,599
disruption has to do with
 

3073
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,670
disruption has to do with
like uh

3074
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:39,680
like uh
 

3075
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,710
like uh
almost the first dumb step of we've been

3076
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:42,720
almost the first dumb step of we've been
 

3077
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,670
almost the first dumb step of we've been
using mostly paper

3078
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:45,680
using mostly paper
 

3079
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,670
using mostly paper
like it's not digitized

3080
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:47,680
like it's not digitized
 

3081
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,990
like it's not digitized
you have to basically convert uh create

3082
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,000
you have to basically convert uh create
 

3083
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,230
you have to basically convert uh create
a uh infrastructure in a framework where

3084
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:52,240
a uh infrastructure in a framework where
 

3085
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,870
a uh infrastructure in a framework where
like everybody is using the same digital

3086
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:54,880
like everybody is using the same digital
 

3087
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,990
like everybody is using the same digital
system like databases and just organize

3088
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
system like databases and just organize
 

3089
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,069
system like databases and just organize
the data that it seems like that's a

3090
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,079
the data that it seems like that's a
 

3091
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,150
the data that it seems like that's a
huge leap that basically can

3092
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,160
huge leap that basically can
 

3093
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,150
huge leap that basically can
revolutionize major industries that

3094
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
revolutionize major industries that
 

3095
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,069

later we would be like that was a really

4230
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:35,360
later we would be like that was a really
 

4231
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,270

a lot about that as i'm as i'm
 

4239
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,709
a lot about that as i'm as i'm
dissecting problems

4240
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:46,719
dissecting problems
 

4241
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,870
dissecting problems
so there is uh

4242
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:48,880
so there is uh
 

4243
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,590
so there is uh
like

4244
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:49,600
like

01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,510
like
that's a kind of long-term thinking if

4246
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:51,520

01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,590
or if you uh if you simplify ever
just focus on those simple steps

4252
01:14:59,590 --> 01:14:59,600
just focus on those simple steps
 

4253
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,590
just focus on those simple steps
all it takes is just do that for a long

4254
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:01,600
all it takes is just do that for a long
 

4255
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,310

constantly about what's right for the
league what's right for the players

league what's right for the players
you know what what

7054
02:05:17,189 --> 02:05:17,199
you know what what

you know what what
what's the right thing to do here and

7056
02:05:19,109 --> 02:05:19,119
what's the right thing to do here and
 

7057
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:20,709
what's the right thing to do here and
that that's something i would hear mr

7058
02:05:20,709 --> 02:05:20,719
that that's something i would hear mr

rooney say
all the time so i think that legacy is

02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:24,880
all the time so i think that legacy is
 

7063
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:27,030
all the time so i think that legacy is
important because ultimately

7064
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,040
important because ultimately
 

7065
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,510
important because ultimately
the team belongs to that city right

7066
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:29,520

02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,589
the team belongs to that city right
belongs to those fans

7068
02:05:31,589 --> 02:05:31,599
belongs to those fans
 

7069
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:33,189
belongs to those fans
and you know the owners are the

7070
02:05:33,189 --> 02:05:33,199
and you know the owners are the
 

7071
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:35,350
and you know the owners are the
custodians of that

7072
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:35,360
custodians of that
 

7073
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,510
custodians of that
so i think

7074
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:37,520
so i think
 

7075
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,709
