yeah i think it's one of those films
where there's so many interesting things

430
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
where there's so many interesting things
 

431
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,110
where there's so many interesting things
about it but

432
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
about it but
 

433
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,710
about it but
you know i'm sure one of them is just

434
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
you know i'm sure one of them is just
 

435
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,510
you know i'm sure one of them is just
the contradiction of him being

436
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
the contradiction of him being
 

437
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,070
the contradiction of him being
a caring person and reluctant to get

438
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
a caring person and reluctant to get
 

439
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,230
a caring person and reluctant to get
attached to her you know he tries to i

440
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
attached to her you know he tries to i
 

441
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,390
attached to her you know he tries to i
think he knows he's he's very reluctant

442
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
think he knows he's he's very reluctant
 

443
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,469
think he knows he's he's very reluctant
to get attached to her in the beginning

444
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
to get attached to her in the beginning
 

445
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,430
to get attached to her in the beginning
um

446
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
um
 

447
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,710
um
and

448
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
and
 

449
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,710
and
so you see all of his humanity but yet

450
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
so you see all of his humanity but yet
 

451
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,469
so you see all of his humanity but yet
he's also an assassin that kills people

452
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
he's also an assassin that kills people
 

453
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,430
he's also an assassin that kills people
so

454
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
so
 

455
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,710
so
um

456
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
um
 

457
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,430
um
that's interesting and i think

458
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
that's interesting and i think
 

459
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,869
that's interesting and i think
probably a psychoanalyst would have a

that depicts her in the beginning
 

473
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,629
that depicts her in the beginning

it seems clear that she's sort of out of

trial but in particular be incredibly
 

2753
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,870
trial but in particular be incredibly
stressful not knowing the outcome um and

2754
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:30,880
stressful not knowing the outcome um and
 

2755
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,510
stressful not knowing the outcome um and
then money and expense i didn't have and

2756
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,520
then money and expense i didn't have and
 

2757
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,230
then money and expense i didn't have and
so

2758
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,240
so
 

2759
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,510
so
you know people plead guilty all the

2760
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:35,520
you know people plead guilty all the
 

2761
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,990
you know people plead guilty all the
time even if they don't think that they

2762
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,000
time even if they don't think that they
 

2763
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,069
time even if they don't think that they
that they should um

2764
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
that they should um
 

2765
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,109
that they should um
and my situation was so complicated

2766
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:43,119
and my situation was so complicated
 

2767
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,349
and my situation was so complicated
and hard to understand

2768
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
and hard to understand
 

2769
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,990
and hard to understand
that it just was the easier thing to do

2770
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,000
that it just was the easier thing to do
 

2771
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,670
that it just was the easier thing to do
but also i just was kind of going on the

2772
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
but also i just was kind of going on the
 

2773
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,549
but also i just was kind of going on the
advice of lawyers and um

2774
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:52,559
advice of lawyers and um
 

2775
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,349
advice of lawyers and um
so the the choice just so i understand

2776
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
so the the choice just so i understand
 

2777
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,030
so the the choice just so i understand
was to plead guilty

2778
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
was to plead guilty
 

2779
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,710
was to plead guilty
or to go through a lengthy trial

2780
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:00,720
or to go through a lengthy trial
 

2781
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,230
or to go through a lengthy trial
and that trial

2782
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,240
and that trial
 

2783
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,870
and that trial
would stretch

2784
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
would stretch
 

2785
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,630
would stretch
a long time and it would be extremely

2786
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:06,640
a long time and it would be extremely
 

2787
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,870
a long time and it would be extremely
stressful and extremely expensive

2788
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880
stressful and extremely expensive
 

2789
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,470
stressful and extremely expensive
because you have to pay the lawyers

2790
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,480
because you have to pay the lawyers
 

2791
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,710
because you have to pay the lawyers
right and i didn't have anything

2792
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
right and i didn't have anything
 

2793
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,990
right and i didn't have anything
right

2794
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,000
right
 

2795
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,549
right
and so a lot of people in that situation

2796
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
and so a lot of people in that situation
 

2797
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,270
and so a lot of people in that situation
might choose to plead guilty and so that

2798
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
might choose to plead guilty and so that
 

2799
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,069
might choose to plead guilty and so that
doesn't necessarily mean

2800
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
doesn't necessarily mean
 

2801
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,230
doesn't necessarily mean
the full heaviness of that statement of

2802
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
the full heaviness of that statement of
 

2803
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,430
the full heaviness of that statement of
guilt

2804
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
guilt
 

2805
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,430
guilt
right and i think people plead guilty

2806
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
right and i think people plead guilty
 

2807
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,190
right and i think people plead guilty
all the time in situations where they're

2808
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
all the time in situations where they're
 

2809
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,510
all the time in situations where they're
being threatened with uh

2810
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
being threatened with uh
 

2811
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,630
being threatened with uh
like a heavy sentence um

2812
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:34,640
like a heavy sentence um
 

2813
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,910
like a heavy sentence um
and they sort of feel like they have no

2814
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:35,920
and they sort of feel like they have no
 

2815
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,390
and they sort of feel like they have no
choice but that's kind of part of

2816
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,400
choice but that's kind of part of
 

2817
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,230
choice but that's kind of part of
a lot of things that are messed up about

2818
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:40,240
a lot of things that are messed up about
 

2819
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,670
a lot of things that are messed up about
the system overall that didn't

2820
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
the system overall that didn't
 

2821
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,829
the system overall that didn't
necessarily apply in my case but

2822
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:43,839
necessarily apply in my case but
 

2823
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,910
necessarily apply in my case but
so we'll talk about to what degree

2824
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:45,920

2921
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,069
the time was just
like

2922
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:24,079
like
 

2923
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,990
like
so you didn't really tell anybody about

2924
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,000
so you didn't really tell anybody about
 

2925

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,630
what i did was i raised money to reopen
the restaurant and i think i raised

2934
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:36,640

the restaurant and i think i raised
something like

2936
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,920

eight

2938
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
eight
 

2939
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,030
eight
maybe like 900 grand

2940
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:43,040

 

2941
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,589

and probably 90 of that went to reopen

2942
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:45,599
and probably 90 of that went to reopen
 

2943
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,430
and probably 90 of that went to reopen
the restaurant

2944
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,440
the restaurant
 

2945
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,069

in some cases i think like if it's
voluntary but in other cases um somebody

3066
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:00,480
voluntary but in other cases um somebody

voluntary but in other cases um somebody
pulls you in

pulls you in
 

3069
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,910
pulls you in
so it's not like you're drawn towards

00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:03,920
so it's not like you're drawn towards
 

3071
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,870
so it's not like you're drawn towards
them they they pull you in so just to

them they they pull you in so just to

them they they pull you in so just to
clarify even when it's not physical when

clarify even when it's not physical when
 

3075
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,309
clarify even when it's not physical when
it's when the pull is with words

3076
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:12,319
it's when the pull is with words

3430
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:06,880
do that why would anybody do that
 

3431
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,670
do that why would anybody do that
um

3432
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:07,680
um
 

3433
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,630
um
and

3434
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:08,640
and
 

3435
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,630
and
one of the things that i tried to do

3436
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
one of the things that i tried to do
 

3437
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,630
one of the things that i tried to do
towards the end was i was trying to get

3438
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,640
towards the end was i was trying to get
 

3439
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,470
towards the end was i was trying to get
myself off the bank accounts because i

3440
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:14,480
myself off the bank accounts because i
 

3441
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,230
myself off the bank accounts because i
didn't want him to be able to get money

3442
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,240
didn't want him to be able to get money
 

3443
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,270
didn't want him to be able to get money
out of me

3444
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:17,280
out of me
 

3445
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,910
out of me
and so there was uh one time when i

3446
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:19,920
and so there was uh one time when i
 

3447
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,349
and so there was uh one time when i
tried to get one of the investors we

3448
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
tried to get one of the investors we
 

3449
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,349
tried to get one of the investors we
went to the bank together to put her on

3450
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:23,359
went to the bank together to put her on
 

3451
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,750
went to the bank together to put her on
as the signer and take me off

3452
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:25,760
as the signer and take me off
 

3453
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,510
as the signer and take me off
and because we didn't have the operating

3454
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:27,520
and because we didn't have the operating
 

3455
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,190
and because we didn't have the operating
agreement they wouldn't let us do it so

3456
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,200
agreement they wouldn't let us do it so
 

3457
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,109
agreement they wouldn't let us do it so
it was like this little snafu

3458
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
it was like this little snafu
 

3459
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,470
it was like this little snafu
and um

3460
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:32,480
and um
 

3461
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,069
and um
so all of these things are

3462
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:36,079
so all of these things are
 

3463
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,390
so all of these things are
sort of the opposite of criminal intent

3464
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,400
sort of the opposite of criminal intent
 

3465
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,309
sort of the opposite of criminal intent
but that's a that's a legal thing what's

3466
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:40,319
but that's a that's a legal thing what's
 

3467
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,910
but that's a that's a legal thing what's
what's going on in your mind at this

3468
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:41,920
what's going on in your mind at this
 

3469
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,190
what's going on in your mind at this
time

do
and

3580
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,400
and
 

3581
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,230
and
in part i mean there was

3582
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:30,240
in part i mean there was
 

3583
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,030
in part i mean there was
financial harm um

3584
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:33,040
financial harm um
 

3585
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,270
financial harm um
but

3586
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:35,280

 

3587
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,470

i don't i don't know whether it's more

3588
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,480
i don't i don't know whether it's more
 

3589
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,549
i don't i don't know whether it's more
important or not but

3590
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:38,559
important or not but
 

3591
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:39,750
important or not but
you know it was

3592
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,760
you know it was
 

3593
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,349
you know it was
taking a place that

3594
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:41,359
taking a place that
 

3595
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,750
taking a place that
was very much like a family to them

3596
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:43,760
was very much like a family to them
 

3597
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,630
was very much like a family to them
um

3598
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:44,640
um
 

3599
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,589
um
and it was as if i destroyed it

3600
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:47,599
and it was as if i destroyed it
 

3601
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,710
and it was as if i destroyed it
and so i think that

3602
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,720

 

3603
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,309

because we were so much like a family it

3604
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
because we were so much like a family it
 

3605
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,470
because we were so much like a family it
was almost as if

3606
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,480
was almost as if
 

3607
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,870
was almost as if
like mom went off the deep end and

3608
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880
like mom went off the deep end and
 

3609
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,510
like mom went off the deep end and
got together with some

3610
01:01:59,510 --> 01:01:59,520
got together with some
 

3611
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,589
got together with some
cuckoo abusive guy and and sort of

3612
01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:01,599
cuckoo abusive guy and and sort of
 

3613
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,270
cuckoo abusive guy and and sort of
abandoned them and they didn't know what

3614
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,280
abandoned them and they didn't know what
 

3615
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,510
abandoned them and they didn't know what
was going on and what was happening and

3616
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:05,520
was going on and what was happening and
 

3617
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,069
was going on and what was happening and
so do you regret lying to them

3618
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:08,079
so do you regret lying to them
 

3619
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,990
so do you regret lying to them
i regret lying to anybody

3620
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:12,000

 

3621
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,029

in all of those circumstances but

3622
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:15,039
in all of those circumstances but
 

3623
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,270
in all of those circumstances but
i wasn't lying

3624
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,280

 

3625
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,549

you know

3626
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
you know
 

3627
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,230
you know
he made me think that you know

3628
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:22,240
he made me think that you know
 

3629
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,750
he made me think that you know
everything was going to be reversed and

3630
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:23,760
everything was going to be reversed and
 

3631
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,910
everything was going to be reversed and
okay and anybody that

3632
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:25,920
okay and anybody that
 

3633
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,349
okay and anybody that
money was borrowed from they would get

3634
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,359
money was borrowed from they would get
 

3635
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,430
money was borrowed from they would get
it back you know maybe tenfold and so it

3636
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
it back you know maybe tenfold and so it
 

3637
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,910
it back you know maybe tenfold and so it
was this weird situation of

3638
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:31,920
was this weird situation of
 

3639
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,190
was this weird situation of
having like one foot in his reality

3640
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:35,200
having like one foot in his reality
 

3641
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,150
having like one foot in his reality
and

3642
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:36,160
and
 

3643
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,910
and
potentially believing the things he was

3644
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
potentially believing the things he was
 

3645
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,430
potentially believing the things he was
saying or

3646
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,440
saying or
 

3647
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,349
saying or
even over time

3648
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:41,359
even over time
 

3649
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:42,870
even over time
wanting to believe them more and more

3650
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:42,880
wanting to believe them more and more
 

3651
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,190
wanting to believe them more and more
because the alternative was so

3652
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,200

 

3653
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,029

the alternative was worse the

3654
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:49,039
the alternative was worse the
 

3655
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,670
the alternative was worse the
alternative was like

3656
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:51,680
alternative was like
 

3657
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,190
alternative was like
was increasingly a bigger and bigger

3658
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:53,200
was increasingly a bigger and bigger
 

3659
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,630
was increasingly a bigger and bigger
nightmare so so there's this whole

3660
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:54,640
nightmare so so there's this whole
 

3661
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,710
nightmare so so there's this whole
situation where you're constantly giving

3662
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
situation where you're constantly giving

3665
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,230
them money you're constantly borrowing

3993
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,550
about a third of the way through she
talks about um

3994
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:20,560
talks about um
 

3995

some of the things in the brain

3996
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
some of the things in the brain
 

3997
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,349
some of the things in the brain
structure that are particular to

4002
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:27,120
and so then it makes you think well what
 

4003
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,870
and so then it makes you think well what
if that could be

4004
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:28,880
if that could be
 

4005
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,590
if that could be
tweaked in some way like could you

4006
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:31,600
tweaked in some way like could you
 

4007

is it nature or nurture i suppose is the

4010
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:36,239
is it nature or nurture i suppose is the
 

4011
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:38,709
is it nature or nurture i suppose is the
question i think it's both

4012
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:38,719
question i think it's both
 

4013
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:40,309
question i think it's both
um i think it's genetic and then it's

4014
01:08:40,309 --> 01:08:40,319
um i think it's genetic and then it's
 

4015
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,390
um i think it's genetic and then it's
like genes that are turned on

4016
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:44,400

 

4017
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,749

by

4018
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:45,759
by
 

4019
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,510
by
things like a particularly violent

4020
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
things like a particularly violent
 

4021
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,709
things like a particularly violent
childhood or some sort of dysfunction so

4022
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:50,719
childhood or some sort of dysfunction so
 

4023
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,229
childhood or some sort of dysfunction so
i think somebody could have the gene

4024
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:52,239
i think somebody could have the gene
 

4025
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:54,550
i think somebody could have the gene
it's not turned on and then

4026
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:54,560
it's not turned on and then
 

4027
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,349
it's not turned on and then
um

4028
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:55,359
um
 

4029
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,510
um
the sociopaths

4030
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,520
the sociopaths
 

4031
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,070
the sociopaths
have the gene and it's turned on

4032
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,080
have the gene and it's turned on
 

4033
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,669
have the gene and it's turned on
so so sociopath means that you're not

4034
01:09:03,669 --> 01:09:03,679
so so sociopath means that you're not
 

4035
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,430
so so sociopath means that you're not
able to be empathetic or you're

suffering of others or to the emotions
 

4041
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,829

4050
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:20,960
mean it's tragic because they
 

4051
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,269

4053
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,349

01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,669
um
because

5194
01:28:37,669 --> 01:28:37,679
because
 

5195
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,669
because
that's what happens first that the more

5196
01:28:39,669 --> 01:28:39,679
that's what happens first that the more
 

5197
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:40,950
that's what happens first that the more
you learn about them you'll sort of

5198
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:40,960
you learn about them you'll sort of
 

5199
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,470
you learn about them you'll sort of
rationalize away

5200
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,480
rationalize away
 

5201
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,629
rationalize away
things that might be red flags or things

5202
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:44,639
things that might be red flags or things
 

5203
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,070
things that might be red flags or things
that you don't like

5204
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080
that you don't like
 

5205
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,870
that you don't like
so

5206
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:46,880

so
i think um

5208
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:49,840

 

5209
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,430

i think it's

5210
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:51,440
i think it's
 

5211
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,790
i think it's
safer to

01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800

01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,990
safer to
fall in love in a

01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:08,880
it's like being in a cult of one
 

5569
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,910
it's like being in a cult of one
so

5570
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:09,920
so
 

5571
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,350
so
the people who've been in cults and

5572
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:11,360
the people who've been in cults and
 

5573
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,430
the people who've been in cults and
gotten out we understand each other very

5574
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:13,440
gotten out we understand each other very
 

5575
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,470
gotten out we understand each other very
well

5576
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:14,480
well
 

5577
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,470
well
um because the same

5578
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480
um because the same
 

5579
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,270
um because the same
psychology was used

5580
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:19,280
psychology was used
 

5581
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,590
psychology was used
the same psychological tactics were used

5582
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,600
the same psychological tactics were used
 

5583
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,790
the same psychological tactics were used
on us

5584
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
on us
 

5585
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,310
on us
and then we experienced the same thing

5586
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,320
and then we experienced the same thing
 

5587
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,669
and then we experienced the same thing
on the other side of it which is it's

5588
01:35:25,669 --> 01:35:25,679
on the other side of it which is it's
 

5589
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,350
on the other side of it which is it's
hard for us to understand and it's hard

5590
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
hard for us to understand and it's hard
 

5591
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,030
hard for us to understand and it's hard
for other people to understand and

5592
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
for other people to understand and
 

5593
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,229
for other people to understand and

the answers or it takes a really long
 

5609
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:44,550
the answers or it takes a really long
time of self-reflection and reading and

5610
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:44,560
time of self-reflection and reading and
 

5611
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,270
time of self-reflection and reading and
investigation to try and figure out

5612
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:47,280
investigation to try and figure out

um

6522
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:06,560
um
 

6523
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,870

with all the best intentions
and i think that a lot of that judgment

6528
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:13,840
and i think that a lot of that judgment
 

6529
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,430
and i think that a lot of that judgment
comes from people who are just seeing

6530
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:15,440
comes from people who are just seeing
 

6531
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,350
comes from people who are just seeing
little clips yeah because it's probably

6532
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:17,360
little clips yeah because it's probably
 

6533
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,030
little clips yeah because it's probably
easy to take little clips from him that

6534
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:19,040
easy to take little clips from him that

6794
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:34,560
one of the things that andrew told me
 

6795
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,109
one of the things that andrew told me
that i'm like i are you sure because it

6796
01:55:37,109 --> 01:55:37,119
that i'm like i are you sure because it
 

6797
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:38,629
that i'm like i are you sure because it
just doesn't seem like an [\h__\h] thing

6798
01:55:38,629 --> 01:55:38,639
just doesn't seem like an [\h__\h] thing
 

6799
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,550
just doesn't seem like an [\h__\h] thing
to do i don't i guess it depends on the

6800
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:40,560
to do i don't i guess it depends on the
 

6801
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,229
to do i don't i guess it depends on the
context if we're in a business meeting

6802
01:55:42,229 --> 01:55:42,239
context if we're in a business meeting
 

6803
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:44,229
context if we're in a business meeting
and and somebody you know talks over you

6804
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:44,239
and and somebody you know talks over you
 

6805
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:46,390
and and somebody you know talks over you
to kind of make their point heard but if

6806
01:55:46,390 --> 01:55:46,400
to kind of make their point heard but if
 

6807
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,149
to kind of make their point heard but if
it's a one-on-one situation then it's

6808
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:48,159
it's a one-on-one situation then it's
 

6809
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:48,950
it's a one-on-one situation then it's
not

6810

listened to it almost like you would
 

6833
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:10,550
listened to it almost like you would
listen to a podcast where i was doing

6834
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:10,560
listen to a podcast where i was doing
 

6835

other things like cleaning my apartment
 

6837
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:14,310
other things like cleaning my apartment
and i was fascinated listening to it to

6838
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:14,320
and i was fascinated listening to it to
 

6839
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:15,830
and i was fascinated listening to it to
a fight so

a fight so
 

6841
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,189
a fight so
and it's interesting too because it's

6842
01:56:17,189 --> 01:56:17,199
and it's interesting too because it's
 

6843
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:19,430
and it's interesting too because it's
just the audio not so you're not looking

6844
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:19,440
just the audio not so you're not looking
 

6845
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,189
just the audio not so you're not looking
at their body language

6846
01:56:21,189 --> 01:56:21,199
at their body language
 

6847
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:23,350
at their body language
um which can be completely misleading

6848
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:23,360
um which can be completely misleading
 

6849
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:24,709
um which can be completely misleading
and there was another podcast where they

6850
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:24,719
and there was another podcast where they
 

6851
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:26,709
and there was another podcast where they
talked about how judges make worse

6852
01:56:26,709 --> 01:56:26,719
talked about how judges make worse
 

6853
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:29,589

decisions on whether or not somebody

6854
01:56:29,589 --> 01:56:29,599
decisions on whether or not somebody
 

6855
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:32,070
decisions on whether or not somebody
deserves you know parole or to be

6856
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:32,080
deserves you know parole or to be
 

6857
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,589
deserves you know parole or to be
released on bail when they see the

6858
01:56:33,589 --> 01:56:33,599
released on bail when they see the
 

6859
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:34,629
released on bail when they see the
person

6860
01:56:34,629 --> 01:56:34,639
person
 

6861
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:36,950
person
in person versus if they're just

6862
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:36,960
in person versus if they're just
 

6863
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,270
in person versus if they're just
looking at the information on paper

6864
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:39,280
looking at the information on paper
 

6865
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,350
looking at the information on paper
so i think body language and those kinds

6866
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:41,360
so i think body language and those kinds
 

6867
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,270
so i think body language and those kinds
of things can be can actually be

6868
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:43,280
of things can be can actually be
 

6869
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,550
of things can be can actually be
misleading

6870
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:44,560
misleading
 

6871
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,790
misleading
um or we think that like by looking

6872
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:46,800
um or we think that like by looking
 

6873
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,149
um or we think that like by looking
somebody in the eye will know if they're

6874
01:56:48,149 --> 01:56:48,159
somebody in the eye will know if they're
 

6875
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:50,950
somebody in the eye will know if they're
lying or not but the skilled liars are

6876
01:56:50,950 --> 01:56:50,960
lying or not but the skilled liars are
 

6877
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,390
lying or not but the skilled liars are
able to

6878
01:56:52,390 --> 01:56:52,400
able to
 

6879
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:55,430
able to
um bypass that or they

6880
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,440
um bypass that or they
 

6881
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,709
um bypass that or they
because

6882
01:56:56,709 --> 01:56:56,719
because
 

6883
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:58,070
because
i'm jumping all over the place but one

6884
01:56:58,070 --> 01:56:58,080
i'm jumping all over the place but one
 

6885
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:59,990
i'm jumping all over the place but one
of the things about sociopaths is

6886
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:00,000
of the things about sociopaths is
 

6887
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,669
of the things about sociopaths is
they're not going to have the same tell

6888
01:57:01,669 --> 01:57:01,679
they're not going to have the same tell
 

6889
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:03,430
they're not going to have the same tell
so like if i was lying somebody would

6890
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,440
so like if i was lying somebody would
 

6891
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,629
so like if i was lying somebody would
know because

6892
01:57:04,629 --> 01:57:04,639
know because
 

6893
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:07,030
know because
i'm like stressed out mortified i'm

6894
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:07,040
i'm like stressed out mortified i'm
 

6895
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,470
i'm like stressed out mortified i'm
probably doing all the things that we do

6896
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:08,480
probably doing all the things that we do
 

6897
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,550
probably doing all the things that we do
when we lie because it's stressful for

6898
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:10,560
when we lie because it's stressful for
 

6899
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,870
when we lie because it's stressful for
me whereas they don't

6900
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:12,880
me whereas they don't
 

6901
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,510
me whereas they don't
have those things so i think that

6902
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:15,520
have those things so i think that
 

6903
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,189
have those things so i think that
you know they could for example i think

6904
01:57:17,189 --> 01:57:17,199
you know they could for example i think
 

6905
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:19,510
you know they could for example i think
that they could pass a lie detector test

6906
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:19,520
that they could pass a lie detector test
 

6907
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,189
that they could pass a lie detector test
they also don't have like a startle

6908
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:21,199
they also don't have like a startle
 

6909
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:22,390
they also don't have like a startle
response

6910
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:22,400
response
 

6911
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,910
response
so

6912
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:23,920
so
 

6913
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,510
so
the activity in their brain like if you

6914
01:57:25,510 --> 01:57:25,520
the activity in their brain like if you
 

6915
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,270
the activity in their brain like if you
and i watched something

6916
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,280
and i watched something
 

6917
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,910
and i watched something
graphic and tragic on tv or watched

6918
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:29,920
graphic and tragic on tv or watched
 

6919
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,270
graphic and tragic on tv or watched
something happen like things would

6920
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:31,280
something happen like things would
 

6921
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,270
something happen like things would
happen in our brains that don't happen

6922
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:33,280
happen in our brains that don't happen
 

6923
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:34,709
happen in our brains that don't happen
in the brains of sociopaths so they

6924
01:57:34,709 --> 01:57:34,719
in the brains of sociopaths so they
 

6925
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:36,390
in the brains of sociopaths so they
don't react to things in the same way

6926
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:36,400
don't react to things in the same way
 

6927
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,350
don't react to things in the same way
that

6928
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:37,360
that
 

6929
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,109
that
that we do again but that makes sense

6930
01:57:39,109 --> 01:57:39,119
that we do again but that makes sense
 

6931
01:57:39,119 --> 01:57:40,790
that we do again but that makes sense
keep assuming i'm not associated i

6932
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:40,800
keep assuming i'm not associated i
 

6933
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,470
keep assuming i'm not associated i
didn't say i'm not a sociopath this

6934
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:42,480
didn't say i'm not a sociopath this
 

6935
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:43,750
didn't say i'm not a sociopath this
assumption you keep making it's very

6936
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:43,760
assumption you keep making it's very
 

6937
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:44,790
assumption you keep making it's very
interesting

6938
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:44,800
interesting
 

6939
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,629
interesting
then why did i murder all those people

6940
01:57:46,629 --> 01:57:46,639
then why did i murder all those people
 

6941
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:48,790
then why did i murder all those people
let's get back to the um

6942
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:48,800
let's get back to the um
 

6943
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,229

interaction by the way i do think it's a
very healthy thing to do in a

01:58:09,669 --> 01:58:09,679
very healthy thing to do in a
 

6965
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:11,589
very healthy thing to do in a
relationship is to record each other for

relationship is to record each other for
 

6967
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:12,950
relationship is to record each other for
months at a time

months at a time
 

6969

6975
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,030
understand how that because they both
recorded each other

6976
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:21,040
recorded each other
 

6977
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,990

6985
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,070
doing
but when you're in it you don't

right i wondered that too like who made
 

6989
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,830
right i wondered that too like who made
the recording and why and

6990
01:58:35,830 --> 01:58:35,840
the recording and why and
 

6991
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,669
the recording and why and
um

6992
01:58:37,669 --> 01:58:37,679
um
 

6993
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,750
um
and did they both know about it that it

6994
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:39,760
and did they both know about it that it
 

6995
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,189
and did they both know about it that it
was being recorded

6996
01:58:41,189 --> 01:58:41,199
was being recorded
 

6997
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:43,750

7005
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,629
sort of um
movement about the whole thing it's

7006
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:54,639
movement about the whole thing it's
 

7007
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:57,109
movement about the whole thing it's
interesting it makes you wonder what's

7008
01:58:57,109 --> 01:58:57,119
interesting it makes you wonder what's
 

7009
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:59,750
interesting it makes you wonder what's
real maybe this is whole

7010
01:58:59,750 --> 01:58:59,760
real maybe this is whole
 

7011
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,669
real maybe this is whole
maybe maybe they're both in love and

7012
01:59:01,669 --> 01:59:01,679
maybe maybe they're both in love and
 

7013
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:03,910
maybe maybe they're both in love and
this is like a a troll that they played

7014
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:03,920
this is like a a troll that they played
 

7015
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,750
this is like a a troll that they played
on the world i don't know

7016
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:05,760
on the world i don't know
 

7017
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,750
on the world i don't know
it makes me wonder what's real at all

7018
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:09,760
it makes me wonder what's real at all
 

7019
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,109
it makes me wonder what's real at all
like i

01:59:11,109 --> 01:59:11,119
like i
 

7021
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:12,550
like i
because there you have to remember their

7022
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:12,560
because there you have to remember their
 

7023
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:14,149
because there you have to remember their
actors too

7024
01:59:14,149 --> 01:59:14,159
actors too
 

7025
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:15,990
actors too

yeah i don't think he would have filed
 

7027
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,030

yes yeah

7032
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:24,000
yes yeah
 

7033
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,189
yes yeah
if somebody was trying to make the

7034
01:59:25,189 --> 01:59:25,199
if somebody was trying to make the
 

7035
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:28,790
if somebody was trying to make the
argument that like he's the abuser

7036
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:28,800
argument that like he's the abuser
 

7037
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,229
argument that like he's the abuser
and that he's lying and he's full of

7038
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:30,239
and that he's lying and he's full of
 

7039
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,149
and that he's lying and he's full of
[\h__\h] it sort of doesn't make sense that

7040
01:59:32,149 --> 01:59:32,159
[\h__\h] it sort of doesn't make sense that
 

7041
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:33,910
[\h__\h] it sort of doesn't make sense that
he would have

7042
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:33,920
he would have
 

7043
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:36,229
he would have
filed a lawsuit unless he's trying to

7044
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:36,239
filed a lawsuit unless he's trying to
 

7045
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:38,950
filed a lawsuit unless he's trying to
have this all

7046
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:38,960
have this all
 

7047
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,109
have this all
come out in the open

7048
01:59:41,109 --> 01:59:41,119
come out in the open
 

7049
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:42,950
come out in the open
because he believes he's in the right

7050
01:59:42,950 --> 01:59:42,960
because he believes he's in the right
 

7051
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,790
because he believes he's in the right
you know again i don't i have no idea i

7052
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:44,800
you know again i don't i have no idea i

agree with you i agree with you
as a fan of

7056
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:47,840
as a fan of
 

7057
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,830
as a fan of
love and human nature i appreciate the

7058
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:49,840
love and human nature i appreciate the
 

7059
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,589
love and human nature i appreciate the
fact that they went through this i know

7060
01:59:51,589 --> 01:59:51,599
fact that they went through this i know
 

7061
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:53,669
fact that they went through this i know
it's probably extremely painful

7062
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:53,679
it's probably extremely painful
 

7063
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:54,470
it's probably extremely painful
but

7064
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:54,480
but
 

7065
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:57,030
but
it's it's fascinating to watch

7066
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:57,040
it's it's fascinating to watch
 

7067
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,430
it's it's fascinating to watch
human relationships be presented in such

7068
01:59:59,430 --> 01:59:59,440
human relationships be presented in such
 

7069
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,990
human relationships be presented in such
raw way and it made me realize how rare

7070
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,000
raw way and it made me realize how rare
 

7071
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,229
raw way and it made me realize how rare
it is to get a glimpse like that

7072
02:00:04,229 --> 02:00:04,239
it is to get a glimpse like that
 

7073
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,149
it is to get a glimpse like that
yeah and i think one of the reasons i

7074
02:00:06,149 --> 02:00:06,159
yeah and i think one of the reasons i
 

7075
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:07,270
yeah and i think one of the reasons i
like that book confessions of a

7076
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:07,280
like that book confessions of a
 

7077
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,669
like that book confessions of a
sociopath also is

7078
02:00:09,669 --> 02:00:09,679
sociopath also is
 

7079
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:10,790
sociopath also is
it's you know

7080
02:00:10,790 --> 02:00:10,800
it's you know
 

7081
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:13,990
it's you know
female who's writing it and i think

7082
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:14,000
female who's writing it and i think
 

7083
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,470
female who's writing it and i think
um statistically men are more likely to

7084
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:16,480
um statistically men are more likely to
 

7085
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,070
um statistically men are more likely to
be sociopaths

7086
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:18,080
be sociopaths
 

7087
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:20,629
be sociopaths
maybe not i mean these are all

7088
02:00:20,629 --> 02:00:20,639
maybe not i mean these are all
 

7089
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:21,990
maybe not i mean these are all
things where

7090
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:22,000
things where
 

7091
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,510
things where
a lot of times

7092
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:23,520
a lot of times
 

7093
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:24,790
a lot of times
there exist

7094
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:24,800
there exist
 

7095
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,790
there exist
statistics that

7096
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:26,800
statistics that
 

7097
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:29,109
statistics that
would be inherently hard to get

7098
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:29,119
would be inherently hard to get
 

7099
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:31,750
would be inherently hard to get
so who knows but

7100
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:31,760
so who knows but
 

7101
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,750
so who knows but
i think that people tend to think of

7102
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:33,760
i think that people tend to think of
 

7103
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,990
i think that people tend to think of
sociopaths more as men

7104
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:36,000
sociopaths more as men
 

7105
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,470
sociopaths more as men
and then which probably gives female

7106
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:38,480
and then which probably gives female
 

7107
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,790
and then which probably gives female
sociopaths the advantage and that people

7108
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:40,800
sociopaths the advantage and that people
 

7109
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,589
sociopaths the advantage and that people
are less likely to

7110
02:00:43,589 --> 02:00:43,599
are less likely to
 

7111
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:45,189
are less likely to
um

that kind of right or if nothing else i
had like i was trying to get money

understands
 

8085
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:15,990
understands
what

8086
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,000
what
 

8087
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,669
what
i went through

8088
02:17:17,669 --> 02:17:17,679
i went through
 

8089
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:20,309
i went through
is the person who put me through it yeah

8090
02:17:20,309 --> 02:17:20,319
is the person who put me through it yeah
 

8091
02:17:20,319 --> 02:17:21,750
is the person who put me through it yeah
right so

8092
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:21,760
right so
 

8093
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,150
right so
so is it were you also just a little bit

8094
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:24,160
so is it were you also just a little bit
 

8095
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:26,549
so is it were you also just a little bit
seeking closure of some kind

8096
02:17:26,549 --> 02:17:26,559
seeking closure of some kind
 

8097
02:17:26,559 --> 02:17:28,309
seeking closure of some kind
probably a lot but also with the

8098
02:17:28,309 --> 02:17:28,319
probably a lot but also with the
 

8099
02:17:28,319 --> 02:17:29,990
probably a lot but also with the
awareness that i probably wasn't gonna

8100
02:17:29,990 --> 02:17:30,000
awareness that i probably wasn't gonna
 

8101
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,230
awareness that i probably wasn't gonna
get it you know and i mean i

8102
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:32,240
get it you know and i mean i
 

8103
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:34,629
get it you know and i mean i
i know for a fact i would never get it

8104
02:17:34,629 --> 02:17:34,639
i know for a fact i would never get it
 

8105
02:17:34,639 --> 02:17:35,990
i know for a fact i would never get it
in the same way that

8106
02:17:35,990 --> 02:17:36,000
in the same way that
 

8107
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,910
in the same way that
which is why

8108
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:37,920
which is why
 

8109
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:39,509
which is why
um

8110
02:17:39,509 --> 02:17:39,519
um
 

8111
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:42,549
um
which is why i was able to later on

8112
02:17:42,549 --> 02:17:42,559
which is why i was able to later on
 

8113
02:17:42,559 --> 02:17:44,230
which is why i was able to later on
like in the context of recording those

8114
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:44,240
like in the context of recording those
 

8115
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:45,509
like in the context of recording those
calls

8116
02:17:45,509 --> 02:17:45,519
calls
 

8117
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:48,150
calls
i was able to talk to him

8118
02:17:48,150 --> 02:17:48,160
i was able to talk to him
 

8119
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:50,070
i was able to talk to him
in this detached way

8120
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:50,080
in this detached way
 

8121
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:53,270
in this detached way
because i know he doesn't give a [\h__\h]

8122
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:53,280
because i know he doesn't give a [\h__\h]
 

8123
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:54,950
because i know he doesn't give a [\h__\h]
that like he doesn't give any shits

8124
02:17:54,950 --> 02:17:54,960
that like he doesn't give any shits
 

8125
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:58,070
that like he doesn't give any shits
about what he did to my mother or me or

8126
02:17:58,070 --> 02:17:58,080
about what he did to my mother or me or
 

8127
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:01,110
about what he did to my mother or me or
anybody or anything just doesn't care so

8128
02:18:01,110 --> 02:18:01,120
anybody or anything just doesn't care so
 

8129
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:04,070
anybody or anything just doesn't care so
he's certainly not going to care if i

8130
02:18:04,070 --> 02:18:04,080
he's certainly not going to care if i
 

8131
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:05,750
he's certainly not going to care if i
you know he's never going to say like

8132
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:05,760
you know he's never going to say like
 

8133
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:07,990
you know he's never going to say like
i'm sorry or

8134
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:08,000
i'm sorry or
 

8135
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,549
i'm sorry or
i did a bad thing or

8136
02:18:10,549 --> 02:18:10,559
i did a bad thing or
 

8137
02:18:10,559 --> 02:18:12,389
i did a bad thing or
or like he's not gonna be affected if

8138
02:18:12,389 --> 02:18:12,399
or like he's not gonna be affected if
 

8139
02:18:12,399 --> 02:18:14,150
or like he's not gonna be affected if
like if i yelled and screamed at him

8140
02:18:14,150 --> 02:18:14,160
like if i yelled and screamed at him
 

8141
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:15,990
like if i yelled and screamed at him
that would just be frustrating for me

8142
02:18:15,990 --> 02:18:16,000
that would just be frustrating for me
 

8143
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,349
that would just be frustrating for me
and he would actually probably be

8144
02:18:17,349 --> 02:18:17,359
and he would actually probably be
 

8145
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,509
and he would actually probably be
gratified by that

8146
02:18:19,509 --> 02:18:19,519
gratified by that
 

8147
02:18:19,519 --> 02:18:20,309
gratified by that
so

8148
02:18:20,309 --> 02:18:20,319
so
 

8149
02:18:20,319 --> 02:18:22,230
so
so that that gave you uh that empowered

8150
02:18:22,230 --> 02:18:22,240
so that that gave you uh that empowered
 

8151
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:24,709
so that that gave you uh that empowered
you in being

8152
02:18:24,709 --> 02:18:24,719
you in being
 

8153
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:27,509
you in being
cold and sort of yes and i had a distant

8154
02:18:27,509 --> 02:18:27,519
cold and sort of yes and i had a distant
 

8155
02:18:27,519 --> 02:18:29,589
cold and sort of yes and i had a distant
prior experience

8156
02:18:29,589 --> 02:18:29,599
prior experience
 

8157
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:31,509
prior experience
where i had to do the same thing where

8158
02:18:31,509 --> 02:18:31,519
where i had to do the same thing where
 

8159
02:18:31,519 --> 02:18:34,549
where i had to do the same thing where
like if you're if you're able to

8160
02:18:34,549 --> 02:18:34,559
like if you're if you're able to
 

8161
02:18:34,559 --> 02:18:36,389
like if you're if you're able to
be very

8162
02:18:36,389 --> 02:18:36,399
be very
 

8163
02:18:36,399 --> 02:18:39,110
be very
cold and not allow somebody to push your

8164
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:39,120
cold and not allow somebody to push your
 

8165
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,469
cold and not allow somebody to push your
buttons

8166
02:18:40,469 --> 02:18:40,479
buttons
 

8167
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:42,549
buttons
then you're taking away their power and

8168
02:18:42,549 --> 02:18:42,559
then you're taking away their power and
 

8169
02:18:42,559 --> 02:18:44,549
then you're taking away their power and
then that feels empowering or feels like

8170
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:44,559
then that feels empowering or feels like
 

8171
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:45,910
then that feels empowering or feels like
we're claiming a little bit of your

8172
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:45,920
we're claiming a little bit of your
 

8173
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:47,990
we're claiming a little bit of your
power so

8174
02:18:47,990 --> 02:18:48,000
power so
 

8175
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:49,830
power so

how bad i was feeling but in a
 

8407
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:59,510
how bad i was feeling but in a
hyperbolic way and so then suddenly

8408
02:22:59,510 --> 02:22:59,520
hyperbolic way and so then suddenly
 

8409
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,190
hyperbolic way and so then suddenly
somebody told somebody

8410
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:01,200
somebody told somebody
 

8411
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:03,190

02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:03,200
and then the loss in translation and
 

8413
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:04,630
and then the loss in translation and
then they were worried that i might kill

8414
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:04,640
then they were worried that i might kill
 

8415
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:05,750
then they were worried that i might kill
myself

8416
02:23:05,750 --> 02:23:05,760
myself
 

8417
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,349

so i didn't answer the phone
so then

8424
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:11,920
so then
 

8425
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:13,110
so then
somebody called the police to do a

02:23:13,110 --> 02:23:13,120
somebody called the police to do a

knowing that
 

8433
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,429
knowing that
um

8434

um
 

8435
02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:23,190
um
if i had handled it the right if i had

8436
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:23,200
if i had handled it the right if i had
 

8437
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,550
if i had handled it the right if i had
immediately

immediately
um

8440
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:25,920
um
 

8441
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,429
um
if i'd sort of understood what was going

if i'd sort of understood what was going
 

8443
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:28,630
if i'd sort of understood what was going
on and handled it the right way

02:23:28,630 --> 02:23:28,640
on and handled it the right way
 

8445
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:30,309
on and handled it the right way
immediately i probably could have gotten

8446
02:23:30,309 --> 02:23:30,319
immediately i probably could have gotten
 

8447
02:23:30,319 --> 02:23:32,630
immediately i probably could have gotten
out of it but they err on the side of

8448
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:32,640
out of it but they err on the side of
 

8449
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:33,830
out of it but they err on the side of
taking you to the hospital no matter

well i mean the conditions were
different later on but in some sense i

9284
02:38:00,309 --> 02:38:00,319
different later on but in some sense i

before when he would take my phone and
 

9305
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:19,349

infuriating
 

9309
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:22,230
infuriating
and he sort of

9310
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:22,240
and he sort of
 

9311
02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:25,830
and he sort of
forced me to get used to it

9312
02:38:25,830 --> 02:38:25,840

 

9313
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:27,190

and this is again something that like

9314
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:27,200
and this is again something that like
 

9315
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:28,309
and this is again something that like
people have been in cults would

9316
02:38:28,309 --> 02:38:28,319
people have been in cults would
 

9317
02:38:28,319 --> 02:38:29,270
people have been in cults would
understand because it's like they

9318
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:29,280
understand because it's like they
 

9319
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:31,750
understand because it's like they
condition you to not

9320
02:38:31,750 --> 02:38:31,760
condition you to not
 

9321
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,270
condition you to not
react negatively to things that you

9322
02:38:33,270 --> 02:38:33,280
react negatively to things that you
 

9323
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:35,750
react negatively to things that you
would normally react negatively to

9324
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:35,760
would normally react negatively to
 

9325
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:36,790
would normally react negatively to
um

9326
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:36,800
um
 

9327
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:39,510
um
and like if i was in a relationship like

9328
02:38:39,510 --> 02:38:39,520
and like if i was in a relationship like
 

9329
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:41,429
and like if i was in a relationship like
if somebody

9330
02:38:41,429 --> 02:38:41,439
if somebody
 

9331
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:44,150
if somebody
i would never ever look in somebody's

9332
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:44,160
i would never ever look in somebody's
 

9333
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:45,750
i would never ever look in somebody's
phone

9334
02:38:45,750 --> 02:38:45,760
phone
 

9335
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:46,710
phone
and

9336
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:46,720
and
 

9337
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:48,389
and
and if somebody did that to me i would

9338
02:38:48,389 --> 02:38:48,399
and if somebody did that to me i would
 

9339
02:38:48,399 --> 02:38:50,550
and if somebody did that to me i would
be like goodbye

9340
02:38:50,550 --> 02:38:50,560
be like goodbye
 

9341
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:52,309
be like goodbye
um so

9342
02:38:52,309 --> 02:38:52,319
um so
 

9343
02:38:52,319 --> 02:38:54,630
um so
i'm pretty sensitive about that

9344
02:38:54,630 --> 02:38:54,640
i'm pretty sensitive about that
 

9345
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:56,469
i'm pretty sensitive about that
and um

9346
02:38:56,469 --> 02:38:56,479
and um
 

9347
02:38:56,479 --> 02:38:57,990
and um
so it was very infuriating when he would

9348
02:38:57,990 --> 02:38:58,000
so it was very infuriating when he would
 

9349
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,150
so it was very infuriating when he would
take my phone and look at it and it it

9350
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:00,160
take my phone and look at it and it it
 

9351
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:02,630
take my phone and look at it and it it
got to the point where

02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:02,640
got to the point where
 

9353
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:05,429
got to the point where
not only did i feel like everything i

9354
02:39:05,429 --> 02:39:05,439

you kind of can't disprove
 

9409
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:00,309
you kind of can't disprove
so it's almost like you know people

9410

um and so
one could argue why

9418
02:40:07,590 --> 02:40:07,600

9419
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:10,790
one could argue why
is it that much crazier for me to have

9420
02:40:10,790 --> 02:40:10,800
is it that much crazier for me to have

just seemed too weird and crazy so i
 

9609
02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:31,590
just seemed too weird and crazy so i
think that this happens sometimes where

9610
02:43:31,590 --> 02:43:31,600
think that this happens sometimes where
 

9611
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:34,950
think that this happens sometimes where
um you believe somebody because

it seems so weird that they would
 

9615
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:41,030
it seems so weird that they would
lie about it i think that somebody has

9616

lie about it i think that somebody has
or it's been said sometimes that like

02:43:42,950 --> 02:43:42,960
or it's been said sometimes that like
 

9619
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:44,870
or it's been said sometimes that like
the more fantastical the lie the more

9620
02:43:44,870 --> 02:43:44,880
the more fantastical the lie the more
 

9621
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:47,510
the more fantastical the lie the more
believable it is because you don't you

9622
02:43:47,510 --> 02:43:47,520
believable it is because you don't you
 

9623
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:49,269
believable it is because you don't you
don't believe that somebody would tell

9624
02:43:49,269 --> 02:43:49,279
don't believe that somebody would tell

that lie
 

9627
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:52,469
that lie
and i think um

9628
02:43:52,469 --> 02:43:52,479
and i think um
 

9629
02:43:52,479 --> 02:43:55,110
and i think um
something also that mr fox people like

9630
02:43:55,110 --> 02:43:55,120
something also that mr fox people like
 

9631
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:57,030
something also that mr fox people like
him are capable of doing is going out

9632
02:43:57,030 --> 02:43:57,040
him are capable of doing is going out
 

9633
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:58,150
him are capable of doing is going out
and lying

9634
02:43:58,150 --> 02:43:58,160
and lying
 

9635
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:00,150
and lying
in very brazen ways that normal people

9636
02:44:00,150 --> 02:44:00,160
in very brazen ways that normal people
 

9637
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:01,830
in very brazen ways that normal people
would be terrified to do

9638
02:44:01,830 --> 02:44:01,840
would be terrified to do
 

9639
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:03,349
would be terrified to do
so that kind of also makes it more

9640
02:44:03,349 --> 02:44:03,359
so that kind of also makes it more
 

9641
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:05,429
so that kind of also makes it more
believable yeah so if somebody could go

9642
02:44:05,429 --> 02:44:05,439
believable yeah so if somebody could go
 

9643
02:44:05,439 --> 02:44:08,790

9645
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:09,910
out on a world stage and lie
and not

02:44:09,910 --> 02:44:09,920
and not
 

9647
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:11,590
and not
kind of

9648
02:44:11,590 --> 02:44:11,600
kind of
 

9649
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:13,830
kind of
feel weird about that or

9650
02:44:13,830 --> 02:44:13,840
feel weird about that or
 

9651
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:16,150
feel weird about that or
even knowing that it's a lie that can be

9652
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:16,160
even knowing that it's a lie that can be
 

9653
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:19,750

9656
02:44:21,990 --> 02:44:22,000
and then there's also the the
 

9657
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,389
and then there's also the the
layer of to what extent is this person

9658
02:44:24,389 --> 02:44:24,399
layer of to what extent is this person
 

9659
02:44:24,399 --> 02:44:27,030
layer of to what extent is this person
in some way also delusional themselves

9733
02:45:40,399 --> 02:45:43,349
radar right so i mean that's obviously a
huge red flag now going forward is like

02:45:43,349 --> 02:45:43,359
huge red flag now going forward is like
 

9735

huge red flag now going forward is like
if somebody

9736

9741
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:51,590
information pretty quickly that's itself
a red flag but

9742
02:45:51,590 --> 02:45:51,600
a red flag but

but you know conveniently if he
 

9753
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:02,389
but you know conveniently if he
say

9754
02:46:02,389 --> 02:46:02,399

there are areas there with cells but a
lot of the areas there are

10268
02:54:45,110 --> 02:54:45,120
lot of the areas there are
 

10269
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:46,389
lot of the areas there are
um

10270
02:54:46,389 --> 02:54:46,399
um
 

10271
02:54:46,399 --> 02:54:47,590
um
rooms with

10272
02:54:47,590 --> 02:54:47,600
rooms with
 

10273
02:54:47,600 --> 02:54:49,910
rooms with
50 beds so and they're about three feet

10274
02:54:49,910 --> 02:54:49,920
50 beds so and they're about three feet
 

10275
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:51,429
50 beds so and they're about three feet
apart from each other so

10276
02:54:51,429 --> 02:54:51,439
apart from each other so
 

10277
02:54:51,439 --> 02:54:53,269
apart from each other so
during covid there was certainly no

and that just felt kind of
 

10285
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,469
and that just felt kind of
sickening especially because

10286
02:55:00,469 --> 02:55:00,479

compassion for
um

10594
03:00:19,190 --> 03:00:19,200
um
 

10595
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:20,710
um
those who

10596
03:00:20,710 --> 03:00:20,720
those who
 

10597
03:00:20,720 --> 03:00:22,550
those who
you know didn't

10598
03:00:22,550 --> 03:00:22,560
you know didn't

out
and because i think

10604
03:00:27,429 --> 03:00:27,439
and because i think
 

10605
03:00:27,439 --> 03:00:29,830
and because i think
what happens in those situations

10606
03:00:29,830 --> 03:00:29,840
what happens in those situations
 

10607
03:00:29,840 --> 03:00:33,830
what happens in those situations
is um

10608
03:00:33,830 --> 03:00:33,840

 

10609
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:34,790

you know there's all kinds of

10610
03:00:34,790 --> 03:00:34,800
you know there's all kinds of
 

10611
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:36,230
you know there's all kinds of
uncertainty in the moment and you sort

10612
03:00:36,230 --> 03:00:36,240
uncertainty in the moment and you sort
 

10613
03:00:36,240 --> 03:00:39,190
uncertainty in the moment and you sort
of freeze and then you'll if

10614
03:00:39,190 --> 03:00:39,200
of freeze and then you'll if
 

10615
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:40,630
of freeze and then you'll if
i'm probably one of those people that

10616
03:00:40,630 --> 03:00:40,640
i'm probably one of those people that
 

10617
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:41,510
i'm probably one of those people that
would

10618
03:00:41,510 --> 03:00:41,520
would
 

10619
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:44,710
would
sit there and somehow in the moment

10620
03:00:44,710 --> 03:00:44,720
sit there and somehow in the moment
 

10621
03:00:44,720 --> 03:00:46,790
sit there and somehow in the moment
without clarity

10622
03:00:46,790 --> 03:00:46,800
without clarity
 

10623
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:48,630
without clarity
just instinctively feel like somehow i

10624
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:48,640
just instinctively feel like somehow i
 

10625
03:00:48,640 --> 03:00:50,150
just instinctively feel like somehow i
must have done something wrong and it's

10626
03:00:50,150 --> 03:00:50,160
must have done something wrong and it's
 

10627
03:00:50,160 --> 03:00:53,750
must have done something wrong and it's
my fault and and like i led him on and

10628
03:00:53,750 --> 03:00:53,760
my fault and and like i led him on and
 

10629
03:00:53,760 --> 03:00:56,710
my fault and and like i led him on and
or just being afraid and then and then

10630
03:00:56,710 --> 03:00:56,720
or just being afraid and then and then
 

10631
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:58,230
or just being afraid and then and then
you don't know how to deal with it and

10632
03:00:58,230 --> 03:00:58,240
you don't know how to deal with it and
 

10633
03:00:58,240 --> 03:00:59,830
you don't know how to deal with it and
so you freeze

10634
03:00:59,830 --> 03:00:59,840
so you freeze
 

10635
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:00,950
so you freeze
um

10636
03:01:00,950 --> 03:01:00,960
um
 

10637
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:04,710
um
so i think that

10638
03:01:04,710 --> 03:01:04,720

 

10639
03:01:04,720 --> 03:01:06,630

you know if you're somebody that

10640
03:01:06,630 --> 03:01:06,640
you know if you're somebody that
 

10641
03:01:06,640 --> 03:01:08,550
you know if you're somebody that
maybe was raised differently or you have

10642
03:01:08,550 --> 03:01:08,560
maybe was raised differently or you have
 

10643
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:11,110
maybe was raised differently or you have
a lot of self-confidence or

10644
03:01:11,110 --> 03:01:11,120
a lot of self-confidence or
 

10645
03:01:11,120 --> 03:01:13,110
a lot of self-confidence or
um you might have

10646
03:01:13,110 --> 03:01:13,120
um you might have
 

10647
03:01:13,120 --> 03:01:15,349
um you might have
reacted differently and kind of

10648
03:01:15,349 --> 03:01:15,359
reacted differently and kind of
 

10649
03:01:15,359 --> 03:01:17,429
reacted differently and kind of
pushed them away and stormed out

10650
03:01:17,429 --> 03:01:17,439
pushed them away and stormed out
 

10651
03:01:17,439 --> 03:01:19,269
pushed them away and stormed out
um

10652
03:01:19,269 --> 03:01:19,279
um
 

10653
03:01:19,279 --> 03:01:21,349
um
but i am probably not one of those

10654
03:01:21,349 --> 03:01:21,359
but i am probably not one of those
 

10655
03:01:21,359 --> 03:01:22,469
but i am probably not one of those
people

10656
03:01:22,469 --> 03:01:22,479
people
 

10657
03:01:22,479 --> 03:01:25,110
people
but i did not ever meet jeffrey epstein

10658
03:01:25,110 --> 03:01:25,120

just kind of the way he would get
 

10673
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:42,469

about that relationship like it was as
if he was under jeffrey's spell you know

10770
03:03:16,790 --> 03:03:16,800
if he was under jeffrey's spell you know
 

10771
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:17,990
if he was under jeffrey's spell you know
observers would say i couldn't

10772
03:03:17,990 --> 03:03:18,000
observers would say i couldn't
 

10773
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:19,510
observers would say i couldn't
understand it it was as if he was under

10774
03:03:19,510 --> 03:03:19,520
understand it it was as if he was under
 

10775
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:22,389
understand it it was as if he was under
his spell and so somebody observing

10776
03:03:22,389 --> 03:03:22,399
his spell and so somebody observing
 

10777
03:03:22,399 --> 03:03:25,030
his spell and so somebody observing
me and mr fox could have possibly said

10778
03:03:25,030 --> 03:03:25,040
me and mr fox could have possibly said
 

10779
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,389
me and mr fox could have possibly said
the same thing about me

10780
03:03:26,389 --> 03:03:26,399
the same thing about me
 

10781
03:03:26,399 --> 03:03:27,349
the same thing about me
but it's a bit different because it

10782
03:03:27,349 --> 03:03:27,359
but it's a bit different because it
 

10783
03:03:27,359 --> 03:03:28,950
but it's a bit different because it
wasn't all charm i think

10784
03:03:28,950 --> 03:03:28,960
wasn't all charm i think
 

10785
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:31,269
wasn't all charm i think
um epstein used his charm and then was

10786
03:03:31,269 --> 03:03:31,279
um epstein used his charm and then was
 

10787
03:03:31,279 --> 03:03:34,070
um epstein used his charm and then was
probably very very very crafty and

10788
03:03:34,070 --> 03:03:34,080
probably very very very crafty and
 

10789
03:03:34,080 --> 03:03:36,230
probably very very very crafty and
getting um another thing that people

10790
03:03:36,230 --> 03:03:36,240
getting um another thing that people
 

10791
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:39,750
getting um another thing that people
like him do and cults do also is to get

10792
03:03:39,750 --> 03:03:39,760
like him do and cults do also is to get
 

10793
03:03:39,760 --> 03:03:40,950
like him do and cults do also is to get
um

10794
03:03:40,950 --> 03:03:40,960
um
 

10795
03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:43,190
um
is to get you somehow compromised

10796
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:43,200
is to get you somehow compromised
 

10797
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:44,950
is to get you somehow compromised
because then they've got you

10798
03:03:44,950 --> 03:03:44,960
because then they've got you
 

10799
03:03:44,960 --> 03:03:46,389
because then they've got you
so i think

10800
03:03:46,389 --> 03:03:46,399
so i think
 

10801
03:03:46,399 --> 03:03:47,429
so i think
some kind of

10802
03:03:47,429 --> 03:03:47,439
some kind of
 

10803
03:03:47,439 --> 03:03:49,590
some kind of
usually sex related

10804
03:03:49,590 --> 03:03:49,600
usually sex related
 

10805
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:51,910
usually sex related
yeah and with epstein certainly you know

10806
03:03:51,910 --> 03:03:51,920
yeah and with epstein certainly you know
 

10807
03:03:51,920 --> 03:03:54,469
yeah and with epstein certainly you know
he was known to have cameras everywhere

10808
03:03:54,469 --> 03:03:54,479
he was known to have cameras everywhere
 

10809
03:03:54,479 --> 03:03:56,790
he was known to have cameras everywhere
and so if he got any of these people on

10810
03:03:56,790 --> 03:03:56,800
and so if he got any of these people on
 

10811
03:03:56,800 --> 03:03:58,870
and so if he got any of these people on
camera doing something compromising and

10812
03:03:58,870 --> 03:03:58,880
camera doing something compromising and
 

10813
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:00,870
camera doing something compromising and
all very powerful people

10814
03:04:00,870 --> 03:04:00,880
all very powerful people
 

10815
03:04:00,880 --> 03:04:02,630
all very powerful people
then he's got them

10816
03:04:02,630 --> 03:04:02,640
then he's got them
 

10817
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:04,710
then he's got them
um and i think he was also very smart to

10818
03:04:04,710 --> 03:04:04,720
um and i think he was also very smart to
 

10819
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:08,630
um and i think he was also very smart to
do that to target people of both parties

10820
03:04:08,630 --> 03:04:08,640
do that to target people of both parties
 

10821
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:10,230
do that to target people of both parties
so that politically

10822
03:04:10,230 --> 03:04:10,240
so that politically
 

10823
03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:12,309
so that politically
that he was able to maintain his power

10824
03:04:12,309 --> 03:04:12,319
that he was able to maintain his power
 

10825
03:04:12,319 --> 03:04:14,469
that he was able to maintain his power
like no matter

10826
03:04:14,469 --> 03:04:14,479
like no matter
 

10827
03:04:14,479 --> 03:04:15,349
like no matter
like

10828
03:04:15,349 --> 03:04:15,359
like
 

10829
03:04:15,359 --> 03:04:17,990
like
nobody wanted him to be totally exposed

10830
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:18,000
nobody wanted him to be totally exposed
 

10831
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:19,030
nobody wanted him to be totally exposed
because then

10832
03:04:19,030 --> 03:04:19,040
because then
 

10833
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:20,070
because then
people

10834
03:04:20,070 --> 03:04:20,080
people
 

10835
03:04:20,080 --> 03:04:22,630
people
a lot of people would be exposed um by

03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:29,110
that's all kind of
conspiracy right

10842
03:04:29,110 --> 03:04:29,120
conspiracy right
 

10843
03:04:29,120 --> 03:04:31,269
conspiracy right
right we don't know that

10844
03:04:31,269 --> 03:04:31,279
right we don't know that
 

10845

believe that because that makes sense
but it's also possible that

10854
03:04:40,150 --> 03:04:40,160
but it's also possible that
 

10855
03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:42,710
but it's also possible that

10971
03:06:38,160 --> 03:06:40,150

one might say that it could require a

but at the same time
i think

10984

10993
03:06:58,720 --> 03:07:00,550
was fascinating to me because it's clear
that at the very least it's like it's

10994
03:07:00,550 --> 03:07:00,560
that at the very least it's like it's
 

10995
03:07:00,560 --> 03:07:01,910
that at the very least it's like it's
like all of these things could be true

10996
03:07:01,910 --> 03:07:01,920

and
um

11068
03:08:18,630 --> 03:08:18,640
um
 

11069
03:08:18,640 --> 03:08:20,950
um
and just the way that

11070
03:08:20,950 --> 03:08:20,960
and just the way that
 

11071
03:08:20,960 --> 03:08:23,269
and just the way that
things that are described about the way

11072
03:08:23,269 --> 03:08:23,279
things that are described about the way
 

11073
03:08:23,279 --> 03:08:25,590
things that are described about the way
that she

11074
03:08:25,590 --> 03:08:25,600
that she
 

11075
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:27,590
that she
um

11076
03:08:27,590 --> 03:08:27,600
um
 

11077
03:08:27,600 --> 03:08:30,950
um
like was so subservient to him

11078
03:08:30,950 --> 03:08:30,960
like was so subservient to him
 

11079
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:33,590
like was so subservient to him
in this kind of astonishing way

11080
03:08:33,590 --> 03:08:33,600
in this kind of astonishing way
 

11081
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:36,230
in this kind of astonishing way
that seems really weird and abnormal

11082
03:08:36,230 --> 03:08:36,240
that seems really weird and abnormal
 

11083
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:38,469
that seems really weird and abnormal
and yet i think she had a lot of

11084
03:08:38,469 --> 03:08:38,479
and yet i think she had a lot of
 

11085
03:08:38,479 --> 03:08:40,309
and yet i think she had a lot of
money and connections and i think she

11086
03:08:40,309 --> 03:08:40,319
money and connections and i think she
 

11087
03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:41,990
money and connections and i think she
lost the money but had all the

11088
03:08:41,990 --> 03:08:42,000
lost the money but had all the
 

11089
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,230
lost the money but had all the
connections either way there was a lot

11090
03:08:44,230 --> 03:08:44,240
connections either way there was a lot
 

11091
03:08:44,240 --> 03:08:48,550
connections either way there was a lot
that a ton that epstein gained via his

11092
03:08:48,550 --> 03:08:48,560
that a ton that epstein gained via his
 

11093
03:08:48,560 --> 03:08:51,510
that a ton that epstein gained via his
relationship with her like a ton

11094
03:08:51,510 --> 03:08:51,520
relationship with her like a ton
 

11095
03:08:51,520 --> 03:08:52,870
relationship with her like a ton
so

11096
03:08:52,870 --> 03:08:52,880
so
 

11097
03:08:52,880 --> 03:08:54,070
so
it makes sense that he would have

11098
03:08:54,070 --> 03:08:54,080
it makes sense that he would have
 

11099
03:08:54,080 --> 03:08:56,950
it makes sense that he would have
manipulated her he manipulates everybody

11100
03:08:56,950 --> 03:08:56,960
manipulated her he manipulates everybody
 

11101
03:08:56,960 --> 03:08:58,230
manipulated her he manipulates everybody
so he

11102
03:08:58,230 --> 03:08:58,240
so he
 

11103
03:08:58,240 --> 03:09:00,230
so he
without question i think one could argue

11104
03:09:00,230 --> 03:09:00,240
without question i think one could argue
 

11105
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:02,950
without question i think one could argue
he definitely manipulated her and again

11106
03:09:02,950 --> 03:09:02,960
he definitely manipulated her and again
 

11107
03:09:02,960 --> 03:09:06,469
he definitely manipulated her and again
i want to be like careful not to be

11108
03:09:06,469 --> 03:09:06,479
i want to be like careful not to be
 

11109
03:09:06,479 --> 03:09:08,150
i want to be like careful not to be
saying like that's an excuse for what

11110
03:09:08,150 --> 03:09:08,160
saying like that's an excuse for what
 

11111
03:09:08,160 --> 03:09:09,750
saying like that's an excuse for what
she did

11112
03:09:09,750 --> 03:09:09,760
she did
 

11113
03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:11,030
she did
i just think that

11114
03:09:11,030 --> 03:09:11,040
i just think that
 

11115
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:13,750
i just think that
that's one possibility it's important to

11116
03:09:13,750 --> 03:09:13,760
that's one possibility it's important to
 

11117
03:09:13,760 --> 03:09:14,630
that's one possibility it's important to
like

11118
03:09:14,630 --> 03:09:14,640
like
 

11119
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:16,469
like
explore these things and be open to them

11120
03:09:16,469 --> 03:09:16,479
explore these things and be open to them
 

11121
03:09:16,479 --> 03:09:18,150
explore these things and be open to them
as opposed to just

11122
03:09:18,150 --> 03:09:18,160
as opposed to just
 

11123
03:09:18,160 --> 03:09:19,990
as opposed to just
like broad brush painting her as a

11124
03:09:19,990 --> 03:09:20,000
like broad brush painting her as a
 

11125
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:21,830
like broad brush painting her as a
horrible person i mean

horrible person i mean
because people could say that based on

11128
03:09:23,830 --> 03:09:23,840
because people could say that based on
 

11129
03:09:23,840 --> 03:09:25,110
because people could say that based on
things they've

11130
03:09:25,110 --> 03:09:25,120
things they've
 

11131

11137
03:09:31,279 --> 03:09:32,309
very different because what she did

and
 

11589
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:15,990
and
i've heard it said and discussed that

11590
03:17:15,990 --> 03:17:16,000
i've heard it said and discussed that
 

11591
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,070
i've heard it said and discussed that
there's a great deal to sort of what

11592
03:17:18,070 --> 03:17:18,080
there's a great deal to sort of what
 

11593
03:17:18,080 --> 03:17:20,150
there's a great deal to sort of what
your body's used to what your ancestors

11594
03:17:20,150 --> 03:17:20,160
your body's used to what your ancestors
 

11595
03:17:20,160 --> 03:17:22,710
your body's used to what your ancestors
ate where you where

11596
03:17:22,710 --> 03:17:22,720
ate where you where
 

11597
03:17:22,720 --> 03:17:24,070
ate where you where
because it seems like the human body is

11598
03:17:24,070 --> 03:17:24,080
because it seems like the human body is
 

11599
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:25,750
because it seems like the human body is
pretty adaptable so

11600
03:17:25,750 --> 03:17:25,760
pretty adaptable so
 

11601
03:17:25,760 --> 03:17:27,750
pretty adaptable so
you can adapt to eating a certain type

11602
03:17:27,750 --> 03:17:27,760
you can adapt to eating a certain type
 

11603
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:29,349
you can adapt to eating a certain type
of a

11604
03:17:29,349 --> 03:17:29,359
of a
 

11605

it wouldn't work well for somebody else

11634
03:17:57,110 --> 03:17:57,120
it wouldn't work well for somebody else
 

11635
03:17:57,120 --> 03:17:58,550
it wouldn't work well for somebody else
and i think there's also an element of

11636
03:17:58,550 --> 03:17:58,560
and i think there's also an element of
 

11637
03:17:58,560 --> 03:18:00,550
and i think there's also an element of
people who try these things

11638
03:18:00,550 --> 03:18:00,560
people who try these things
 

11639
03:18:00,560 --> 03:18:02,790
people who try these things
and then feel really good

11640
03:18:02,790 --> 03:18:02,800
and then feel really good
 

11641
03:18:02,800 --> 03:18:04,550
and then feel really good
or feel really bad and they make a

11642
03:18:04,550 --> 03:18:04,560
or feel really bad and they make a
 

11643
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:06,870
or feel really bad and they make a
conclusion based on that initial

11644
03:18:06,870 --> 03:18:06,880
conclusion based on that initial
 

11645
03:18:06,880 --> 03:18:09,030
conclusion based on that initial
period of time when it might be

11646
03:18:09,030 --> 03:18:09,040
period of time when it might be
 

11647
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:10,630
period of time when it might be
something where it makes you feel really

11648
03:18:10,630 --> 03:18:10,640
something where it makes you feel really
 

11649
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:12,229
something where it makes you feel really
good temporarily

11650
03:18:12,229 --> 03:18:12,239
good temporarily
 

11651
03:18:12,239 --> 03:18:13,830
good temporarily
but then over time you're going to be

11652
03:18:13,830 --> 03:18:13,840
but then over time you're going to be
 

11653
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:15,830
but then over time you're going to be
depleted of certain things

11654
03:18:15,830 --> 03:18:15,840
depleted of certain things
 

11655
03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:17,349
depleted of certain things
and then we also live in a world where

11656
03:18:17,349 --> 03:18:17,359
and then we also live in a world where
 

11657
03:18:17,359 --> 03:18:19,670
and then we also live in a world where
like our soil is depleted and

11658
03:18:19,670 --> 03:18:19,680
like our soil is depleted and
 

11659
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:21,510
like our soil is depleted and
there's a lot of processing that takes

11660
03:18:21,510 --> 03:18:21,520
there's a lot of processing that takes
 

11661
03:18:21,520 --> 03:18:23,190
there's a lot of processing that takes
out of foods a lot of things that we

11662
03:18:23,190 --> 03:18:23,200
out of foods a lot of things that we
 

11663
03:18:23,200 --> 03:18:26,710
out of foods a lot of things that we
need so

11664
03:18:26,710 --> 03:18:26,720

 

11665
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:28,550

i just think that there's no

11666
03:18:28,550 --> 03:18:28,560
i just think that there's no
 

11667
03:18:28,560 --> 03:18:30,790
i just think that there's no
kind of one right answer you can look at

11668
03:18:30,790 --> 03:18:30,800
kind of one right answer you can look at
 

11669
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:32,469
kind of one right answer you can look at
it from just a health perspective and

11670
03:18:32,469 --> 03:18:32,479
it from just a health perspective and
 

11671
03:18:32,479 --> 03:18:34,070
it from just a health perspective and
then you can also look at it from like a

11672
03:18:34,070 --> 03:18:34,080
then you can also look at it from like a
 

11673
03:18:34,080 --> 03:18:35,910
then you can also look at it from like a
morality and ethics perspective and then

11674
03:18:35,910 --> 03:18:35,920
morality and ethics perspective and then
 

11675
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:37,269
morality and ethics perspective and then
also like what's the impact on the

11676
03:18:37,269 --> 03:18:37,279
also like what's the impact on the
 

11677
03:18:37,279 --> 03:18:38,550
also like what's the impact on the
environment and all those things are

11678
03:18:38,550 --> 03:18:38,560
environment and all those things are
 

11679
03:18:38,560 --> 03:18:40,950
environment and all those things are
important and i think that i've watched

11680
03:18:40,950 --> 03:18:40,960
important and i think that i've watched
 

11681
03:18:40,960 --> 03:18:44,469
important and i think that i've watched
a lot of films and things and

11682
03:18:44,469 --> 03:18:44,479
a lot of films and things and
 

11683
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:46,309
a lot of films and things and
for a while right after that i might

11684
03:18:46,309 --> 03:18:46,319
for a while right after that i might
 

11685
03:18:46,319 --> 03:18:48,070
for a while right after that i might
think oh my god i can't believe i ate

11686
03:18:48,070 --> 03:18:48,080
think oh my god i can't believe i ate
 

11687
03:18:48,080 --> 03:18:49,590
think oh my god i can't believe i ate
this thing last week and now i'm going

11688
03:18:49,590 --> 03:18:49,600
this thing last week and now i'm going
 

11689
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:52,389
this thing last week and now i'm going
to go back to being 100 vegan because i

11690
03:18:52,389 --> 03:18:52,399
to go back to being 100 vegan because i
 

11691
03:18:52,399 --> 03:18:53,910
to go back to being 100 vegan because i
just watched this thing and it's fresh

11692
03:18:53,910 --> 03:18:53,920
just watched this thing and it's fresh
 

11693
03:18:53,920 --> 03:18:55,349
just watched this thing and it's fresh
in my mind and now i'm thinking about it

11694
03:18:55,349 --> 03:18:55,359
in my mind and now i'm thinking about it
 

11695
03:18:55,359 --> 03:18:57,429
in my mind and now i'm thinking about it
in a certain way but then over time that

11696
03:18:57,429 --> 03:18:57,439
in a certain way but then over time that
 

11697
03:18:57,439 --> 03:18:58,389
in a certain way but then over time that
sort of

11698
03:18:58,389 --> 03:18:58,399
sort of
 

11699
03:18:58,399 --> 03:18:59,590
sort of
fades

11700
03:18:59,590 --> 03:18:59,600
fades
 

11701
03:18:59,600 --> 03:19:00,870
fades
and then you start to get a bit more

11702
03:19:00,870 --> 03:19:00,880
and then you start to get a bit more
 

11703
03:19:00,880 --> 03:19:01,910
and then you start to get a bit more
loose

11704
03:19:01,910 --> 03:19:01,920
loose
 

11705
03:19:01,920 --> 03:19:03,830
loose
and

11706
03:19:03,830 --> 03:19:03,840
and
 

11707
03:19:03,840 --> 03:19:04,710
and
for me

11708
03:19:04,710 --> 03:19:04,720
for me
 

11709
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:07,429
for me
i

11710
03:19:07,429 --> 03:19:07,439

 

11711
03:19:07,439 --> 03:19:09,110

i will end up eating a lot of things

11712
03:19:09,110 --> 03:19:09,120
i will end up eating a lot of things
 

11713
03:19:09,120 --> 03:19:10,550
i will end up eating a lot of things
that

11714
03:19:10,550 --> 03:19:10,560
that
 

11715
03:19:10,560 --> 03:19:12,309
that
aren't vegan

11716
03:19:12,309 --> 03:19:12,319
aren't vegan
 

11717
03:19:12,319 --> 03:19:15,590
aren't vegan
usually in the context where i'm not

11718
03:19:15,590 --> 03:19:15,600
usually in the context where i'm not
 

11719
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:19,910
usually in the context where i'm not
adding to the consumption of it so

11720
03:19:19,910 --> 03:19:19,920
adding to the consumption of it so
 

11721
03:19:19,920 --> 03:19:21,190
adding to the consumption of it so
um

thigh
 

11755
03:19:53,600 --> 03:19:56,070
thigh
and it was cooked surprisingly well

11756
03:19:56,070 --> 03:19:56,080
and it was cooked surprisingly well
 

11757
03:19:56,080 --> 03:19:58,550
and it was cooked surprisingly well
and so i would always eat it i don't

11758
03:19:58,550 --> 03:19:58,560
and so i would always eat it i don't
 

11759
03:19:58,560 --> 03:20:02,150
and so i would always eat it i don't
know i mean yeah it's there and

11760
03:20:02,150 --> 03:20:02,160
know i mean yeah it's there and
 

11761
03:20:02,160 --> 03:20:03,429
know i mean yeah it's there and
it's not

11762
03:20:03,429 --> 03:20:03,439
it's not
 

11763
03:20:03,439 --> 03:20:05,110
it's not
from a health perspective one could say

11764
03:20:05,110 --> 03:20:05,120
from a health perspective one could say
 

11765
03:20:05,120 --> 03:20:06,550
from a health perspective one could say
well that's probably the shittiest of

11766
03:20:06,550 --> 03:20:06,560
well that's probably the shittiest of
 

11767
03:20:06,560 --> 03:20:07,910
well that's probably the shittiest of
the shitty chickens that are full of

11768
03:20:07,910 --> 03:20:07,920
the shitty chickens that are full of
 

11769
03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:09,750
the shitty chickens that are full of
antibiotics and hormones and terrible

11770
03:20:09,750 --> 03:20:09,760
antibiotics and hormones and terrible
 

11771
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:10,790
antibiotics and hormones and terrible
things and

11772
03:20:10,790 --> 03:20:10,800
things and
 

11773
03:20:10,800 --> 03:20:12,790
things and
so it's not optimal from that point of

11774
03:20:12,790 --> 03:20:12,800
so it's not optimal from that point of
 

11775
03:20:12,800 --> 03:20:13,590
so it's not optimal from that point of
view

11776
03:20:13,590 --> 03:20:13,600
view
 

11777
03:20:13,600 --> 03:20:14,389
view
um

11778
03:20:14,389 --> 03:20:14,399
um
 

11779
03:20:14,399 --> 03:20:15,670
um
but

11780
03:20:15,670 --> 03:20:15,680
but
 

11781
03:20:15,680 --> 03:20:17,030
but
it's like if it's otherwise going to be

11782
03:20:17,030 --> 03:20:17,040
it's like if it's otherwise going to be
 

11783
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:19,269
it's like if it's otherwise going to be
thrown in the trash then

11784
03:20:19,269 --> 03:20:19,279
thrown in the trash then
 

11785
03:20:19,279 --> 03:20:21,269
thrown in the trash then
yeah you're not adding to it right or

11786
03:20:21,269 --> 03:20:21,279
yeah you're not adding to it right or
 

11787
03:20:21,279 --> 03:20:23,510
yeah you're not adding to it right or
you know like i've been drunk at a party

11788
03:20:23,510 --> 03:20:23,520
you know like i've been drunk at a party
 

11789
03:20:23,520 --> 03:20:24,469
you know like i've been drunk at a party
and

11790
03:20:24,469 --> 03:20:24,479

03:22:24,229 --> 03:22:24,239
then just get a bunch of tomatoes
 

11915
03:22:24,239 --> 03:22:26,150
then just get a bunch of tomatoes
because it's probably something in there

11916
03:22:26,150 --> 03:22:26,160
because it's probably something in there
 

11917
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:27,830
because it's probably something in there
it was like

11923
03:22:32,239 --> 03:22:33,590
mother no but that that's exactly what i
was saying is that somehow your body

many but that's all right
 

11935
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:46,469
many but that's all right
or maybe not enough

11936
03:22:46,469 --> 03:22:46,479
or maybe not enough
 

11937
03:22:46,479 --> 03:22:49,910
or maybe not enough
there you go see what you were saying

11938
03:22:49,910 --> 03:22:49,920
there you go see what you were saying
 

11939
03:22:49,920 --> 03:22:51,590
there you go see what you were saying
anyway i think these things like shift

11940
03:22:51,590 --> 03:22:51,600
anyway i think these things like shift
 

11941
03:22:51,600 --> 03:22:53,590
anyway i think these things like shift
and change and there's not like a right

11942
03:22:53,590 --> 03:22:53,600
and change and there's not like a right
 

11943
03:22:53,600 --> 03:22:54,950
and change and there's not like a right
answer and then there's something where

11944
03:22:54,950 --> 03:22:54,960
answer and then there's something where
 

11945
03:22:54,960 --> 03:22:56,950
answer and then there's something where
it's like one person might do well on

11946
03:22:56,950 --> 03:22:56,960
it's like one person might do well on
 

11947
03:22:56,960 --> 03:22:59,830
it's like one person might do well on
something another person doesn't or you

11948
03:22:59,830 --> 03:22:59,840
something another person doesn't or you
 

11949
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:02,150
something another person doesn't or you
might do well on something for like i

11950
03:23:02,150 --> 03:23:02,160
might do well on something for like i
 

11951
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:04,309
might do well on something for like i
might you know maybe if i ate a bunch of

11952
03:23:04,309 --> 03:23:04,319
might you know maybe if i ate a bunch of
 

11953
03:23:04,319 --> 03:23:05,910
might you know maybe if i ate a bunch of
liver i'd feel better because i'm

11954
03:23:05,910 --> 03:23:05,920
liver i'd feel better because i'm
 

11955
03:23:05,920 --> 03:23:07,110
liver i'd feel better because i'm
getting

11956
03:23:07,110 --> 03:23:07,120
getting
 

11957
03:23:07,120 --> 03:23:09,190
getting
vitamins that i don't that i that i'm

11958
03:23:09,190 --> 03:23:09,200
vitamins that i don't that i that i'm
 

11959
03:23:09,200 --> 03:23:10,150
vitamins that i don't that i that i'm
lacking

11960
03:23:10,150 --> 03:23:10,160
lacking
 

11961
03:23:10,160 --> 03:23:12,389
lacking
but then once i get them i'm fine and i

11962
03:23:12,389 --> 03:23:12,399
but then once i get them i'm fine and i
 

11963
03:23:12,399 --> 03:23:14,309
but then once i get them i'm fine and i
don't need that anymore and i could

11964
03:23:14,309 --> 03:23:14,319
don't need that anymore and i could
 

11965
03:23:14,319 --> 03:23:16,070
don't need that anymore and i could
potentially get those from other sources

11966
03:23:16,070 --> 03:23:16,080
potentially get those from other sources
 

11967
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:17,030
potentially get those from other sources
or

11968
03:23:17,030 --> 03:23:17,040
or
 

11969
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:19,830
or
um

11970
03:23:19,830 --> 03:23:19,840

 

11971
03:23:19,840 --> 03:23:21,110

but yeah when i was little i used to

11972
03:23:21,110 --> 03:23:21,120

11979
03:23:28,399 --> 03:23:30,469
sardines but i wouldn't eat the pieces i
would only eat the whole ones which have

11980
03:23:30,469 --> 03:23:30,479
would only eat the whole ones which have
 

11981
03:23:30,479 --> 03:23:32,870
would only eat the whole ones which have
the bones in them and i used to chew on

11982
03:23:32,870 --> 03:23:32,880
the bones in them and i used to chew on
 

11983

the bones in them and i used to chew on
chicken bones and try to eat eggshells

11984
03:23:35,750 --> 03:23:35,760
chicken bones and try to eat eggshells
 

11985
03:23:35,760 --> 03:23:38,150
chicken bones and try to eat eggshells
when i was like a top like little so i

11986
03:23:38,150 --> 03:23:38,160
when i was like a top like little so i
 

11987
03:23:38,160 --> 03:23:41,269
when i was like a top like little so i
think all of those things have um

11988
03:23:41,269 --> 03:23:41,279
think all of those things have um
 

11989
03:23:41,279 --> 03:23:43,269
think all of those things have um
calcium and other minerals and commons

11990
03:23:43,269 --> 03:23:43,279
calcium and other minerals and commons
 

11991
03:23:43,279 --> 03:23:44,550
calcium and other minerals and commons
there's probably something there that i

11992
03:23:44,550 --> 03:23:44,560
there's probably something there that i
 

11993
03:23:44,560 --> 03:23:45,830
there's probably something there that i
needed because you'd think as a little

11994
03:23:45,830 --> 03:23:45,840
needed because you'd think as a little
 

11995
03:23:45,840 --> 03:23:49,269
needed because you'd think as a little
kid i wouldn't be drawn to oily fish

11996
03:23:49,269 --> 03:23:49,279
kid i wouldn't be drawn to oily fish
 

11997
03:23:49,279 --> 03:23:51,990
kid i wouldn't be drawn to oily fish
and bones and eggshells yeah it's

11998
03:23:51,990 --> 03:23:52,000
and bones and eggshells yeah it's
 

11999
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:53,910
and bones and eggshells yeah it's
interesting because like you're saying

12000
03:23:53,910 --> 03:23:53,920
interesting because like you're saying
 

12001
03:23:53,920 --> 03:23:55,510
interesting because like you're saying
the explanation for the craving is

12002
03:23:55,510 --> 03:23:55,520
the explanation for the craving is
 

12003
03:23:55,520 --> 03:23:57,269
the explanation for the craving is
probably the nutrients you're getting

12004
03:23:57,269 --> 03:23:57,279
probably the nutrients you're getting
 

12005
03:23:57,279 --> 03:23:59,510
probably the nutrients you're getting
but when you're imagining the craving

12006
03:23:59,510 --> 03:23:59,520
but when you're imagining the craving
 

12007
03:23:59,520 --> 03:24:00,870
but when you're imagining the craving
you're not obviously imagining the

12008
03:24:00,870 --> 03:24:00,880
you're not obviously imagining the
 

12009
03:24:00,880 --> 03:24:02,870
you're not obviously imagining the
nutrients you're imagining the texture

12010
03:24:02,870 --> 03:24:02,880
nutrients you're imagining the texture
 

12011
03:24:02,880 --> 03:24:04,229
nutrients you're imagining the texture
the taste

12012
03:24:04,229 --> 03:24:04,239
the taste
 

12013
03:24:04,239 --> 03:24:06,309
the taste
the feel the i mean a lot of the things

12014
03:24:06,309 --> 03:24:06,319
the feel the i mean a lot of the things
 

12015
03:24:06,319 --> 03:24:07,990
the feel the i mean a lot of the things
that we actually experience as we're

12016
03:24:07,990 --> 03:24:08,000
that we actually experience as we're
 

12017
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:10,150
that we actually experience as we're
eating that's our brain probably

12018
03:24:10,150 --> 03:24:10,160
eating that's our brain probably
 

12019
03:24:10,160 --> 03:24:12,070
eating that's our brain probably
tricking us right but do you love

12020
03:24:12,070 --> 03:24:12,080
tricking us right but do you love
 

12021
03:24:12,080 --> 03:24:14,389
tricking us right but do you love
tomatoes

12022
03:24:14,389 --> 03:24:14,399
tomatoes
 

12023
03:24:14,399 --> 03:24:15,910
tomatoes
well um

12024
03:24:15,910 --> 03:24:15,920
well um
 

12025
03:24:15,920 --> 03:24:18,389
well um
i think we determined that love is

12026
03:24:18,389 --> 03:24:18,399
i think we determined that love is
 

12027
03:24:18,399 --> 03:24:20,150
i think we determined that love is
impossible to define

12028
03:24:20,150 --> 03:24:20,160
impossible to define
 

12029
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:20,790
impossible to define
so

12030
03:24:20,790 --> 03:24:20,800
so
 

12031
03:24:20,800 --> 03:24:22,950

03:30:47,349 --> 03:30:47,359
they're hitting the tops of our eyes but
 

12417
03:30:47,359 --> 03:30:49,429
they're hitting the tops of our eyes but
it's the light coming from above that's

12418
03:30:49,429 --> 03:30:49,439
it's the light coming from above that's
 

12419
03:30:49,439 --> 03:30:51,429
it's the light coming from above that's
destructive at night because it's

12420
03:30:51,429 --> 03:30:51,439
destructive at night because it's
 

12421
03:30:51,439 --> 03:30:52,950
destructive at night because it's
hitting the bottom of your eyes so it's

12422
03:30:52,950 --> 03:30:52,960
hitting the bottom of your eyes so it's
 

12423
03:30:52,960 --> 03:30:54,710
hitting the bottom of your eyes so it's
like mimicking the sun

12424
03:30:54,710 --> 03:30:54,720
like mimicking the sun
 

12425
03:30:54,720 --> 03:30:56,229
like mimicking the sun
which is signaling your body that it's

12426
03:30:56,229 --> 03:30:56,239
which is signaling your body that it's
 

12427
03:30:56,239 --> 03:30:57,670
which is signaling your body that it's
time to be awake

12428
03:30:57,670 --> 03:30:57,680
time to be awake
 

12429
03:30:57,680 --> 03:30:58,389
time to be awake
so

12430
03:30:58,389 --> 03:30:58,399

12436
03:31:03,750 --> 03:31:03,760
lights i try to dim the lights as much
 

12437
03:31:03,760 --> 03:31:06,630
lights i try to dim the lights as much
as i can and and i turn on like a lamp

12438
03:31:06,630 --> 03:31:06,640
as i can and and i turn on like a lamp
 

12439
03:31:06,640 --> 03:31:08,309
as i can and and i turn on like a lamp
versus an overhead light

12440
03:31:08,309 --> 03:31:08,319
versus an overhead light
 

12441
03:31:08,319 --> 03:31:09,990
versus an overhead light

i mean this question i think a mutual

12480
03:31:54,229 --> 03:31:54,239
i mean this question i think a mutual
 

12481
03:31:54,239 --> 03:31:56,870
i mean this question i think a mutual
respect is a big part of it

12482
03:31:56,870 --> 03:31:56,880
respect is a big part of it
 

12483
03:31:56,880 --> 03:31:58,710

mutual respect
 

12485
03:31:58,720 --> 03:32:00,870
mutual respect
that's interesting well and

12486
03:32:00,870 --> 03:32:00,880
that's interesting well and
 

12487
03:32:00,880 --> 03:32:03,830
that's interesting well and
understanding it in a way that you want

12488
03:32:03,830 --> 03:32:03,840
understanding it in a way that you want
 

12489
03:32:03,840 --> 03:32:06,150
understanding it in a way that you want
what's best for the other person not in

12490
03:32:06,150 --> 03:32:06,160
what's best for the other person not in
 

12491
03:32:06,160 --> 03:32:07,990
what's best for the other person not in
a way that you would sacrifice yourself

12492
03:32:07,990 --> 03:32:08,000
a way that you would sacrifice yourself
 

12493
03:32:08,000 --> 03:32:10,229
a way that you would sacrifice yourself
for them necessarily

12494
03:32:10,229 --> 03:32:10,239
for them necessarily
 

12495
03:32:10,239 --> 03:32:11,349
for them necessarily
but

12496
03:32:11,349 --> 03:32:11,359
but
 

12497
03:32:11,359 --> 03:32:13,429
but
in a very healthy way

12498
03:32:13,429 --> 03:32:13,439
in a very healthy way
 

12499
03:32:13,439 --> 03:32:15,190
in a very healthy way
so i think a healthy relationship is

12500
03:32:15,190 --> 03:32:15,200
so i think a healthy relationship is
 

12501
03:32:15,200 --> 03:32:16,870
so i think a healthy relationship is
where you know you want what's best for

12502
03:32:16,870 --> 03:32:16,880
where you know you want what's best for
 

12503
03:32:16,880 --> 03:32:18,229
where you know you want what's best for
the other person so i always find it

12504
03:32:18,229 --> 03:32:18,239
the other person so i always find it
 

12505
03:32:18,239 --> 03:32:19,830
the other person so i always find it
tragic

12506
03:32:19,830 --> 03:32:19,840
tragic
 

12507
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:20,950
tragic
um

12508
03:32:20,950 --> 03:32:20,960
um
 

12509
03:32:20,960 --> 03:32:23,349
um
like say

12510
03:32:23,349 --> 03:32:23,359
like say
 

12511
03:32:23,359 --> 03:32:26,150
like say
you started dating somebody who then

12512
03:32:26,150 --> 03:32:26,160
you started dating somebody who then
 

12513
03:32:26,160 --> 03:32:28,710
you started dating somebody who then
would get jealous or upset if you spent

12514
03:32:28,710 --> 03:32:28,720
would get jealous or upset if you spent
 

12515
03:32:28,720 --> 03:32:31,269
would get jealous or upset if you spent
too much time working on something

12516
03:32:31,269 --> 03:32:31,279
too much time working on something
 

12517
03:32:31,279 --> 03:32:33,269
too much time working on something
right and but but that's like your life

12518
03:32:33,269 --> 03:32:33,279
right and but but that's like your life
 

12519
03:32:33,279 --> 03:32:34,950
right and but but that's like your life
so if you're working on

12520
03:32:34,950 --> 03:32:34,960
so if you're working on
 

12521
03:32:34,960 --> 03:32:36,950
so if you're working on
some robotics thing and you're having

12522
03:32:36,950 --> 03:32:36,960
some robotics thing and you're having
 

12523
03:32:36,960 --> 03:32:38,469
some robotics thing and you're having
some breakthrough and so you just want

12524
03:32:38,469 --> 03:32:38,479
some breakthrough and so you just want
 

12525
03:32:38,479 --> 03:32:40,070
some breakthrough and so you just want
to spend a lot of time

12526
03:32:40,070 --> 03:32:40,080
to spend a lot of time
 

12527
03:32:40,080 --> 03:32:41,990
to spend a lot of time
wherever you spend a lot of time doing

12528
03:32:41,990 --> 03:32:42,000
wherever you spend a lot of time doing
 

12529
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:43,910
wherever you spend a lot of time doing
those things and then that other person

12530
03:32:43,910 --> 03:32:43,920
those things and then that other person
 

12531
03:32:43,920 --> 03:32:45,750
those things and then that other person
got all bent out of shape and it became

12532
03:32:45,750 --> 03:32:45,760
got all bent out of shape and it became
 

12533
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:48,550
got all bent out of shape and it became
like a competition that to me seems very

12534
03:32:48,550 --> 03:32:48,560
like a competition that to me seems very
 

12535
03:32:48,560 --> 03:32:51,110
like a competition that to me seems very
unhealthy because if somebody

12536
03:32:51,110 --> 03:32:51,120
unhealthy because if somebody
 

12537
03:32:51,120 --> 03:32:52,550
unhealthy because if somebody
if it was

12538
03:32:52,550 --> 03:32:52,560
if it was
 

12539
03:32:52,560 --> 03:32:54,870
if it was
if it was like a genuine

12540
03:32:54,870 --> 03:32:54,880
if it was like a genuine
 

12541
03:32:54,880 --> 03:32:57,990
if it was like a genuine
healthy love

12542
03:32:57,990 --> 03:32:58,000

 

12543
03:32:58,000 --> 03:33:00,389

she would want you to

12544
03:33:00,389 --> 03:33:00,399
she would want you to
 

12545
03:33:00,399 --> 03:33:02,070
she would want you to
be doing those things

12546
03:33:02,070 --> 03:33:02,080
be doing those things
 

12547
03:33:02,080 --> 03:33:05,590
be doing those things
yeah that's a good observation but

12548
03:33:05,590 --> 03:33:05,600
yeah that's a good observation but
 

12549
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:11,429
yeah that's a good observation but
to me i think the way to achieve that

12550
03:33:11,429 --> 03:33:11,439

 

12551
03:33:11,439 --> 03:33:13,269

is actually or the easiest way to

12552
03:33:13,269 --> 03:33:13,279
is actually or the easiest way to
 

12553
03:33:13,279 --> 03:33:15,110
is actually or the easiest way to
achieve at least for me is actually

12554
03:33:15,110 --> 03:33:15,120
achieve at least for me is actually
 

12555
03:33:15,120 --> 03:33:17,670
achieve at least for me is actually
legitimately be excited by

12556
03:33:17,670 --> 03:33:17,680
legitimately be excited by
 

12557
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:19,269
legitimately be excited by
the things the other person is excited

12558
03:33:19,269 --> 03:33:19,279
the things the other person is excited
 

12559
03:33:19,279 --> 03:33:20,309
the things the other person is excited
by

12560
03:33:20,309 --> 03:33:20,319
by
 

12561
03:33:20,319 --> 03:33:21,349
by
so like

12562
03:33:21,349 --> 03:33:21,359
so like
 

12563
03:33:21,359 --> 03:33:23,750
so like
not in some generic sense it's good for

12564
03:33:23,750 --> 03:33:23,760
not in some generic sense it's good for
 

12565
03:33:23,760 --> 03:33:26,389
not in some generic sense it's good for
them to be doing the robotics thing

12566
03:33:26,389 --> 03:33:26,399
them to be doing the robotics thing
 

12567
03:33:26,399 --> 03:33:28,150
them to be doing the robotics thing
like it's more like

12568
03:33:28,150 --> 03:33:28,160
like it's more like
 

12569
03:33:28,160 --> 03:33:30,550
like it's more like
you become a fan of all the cool things

12570
03:33:30,550 --> 03:33:30,560
you become a fan of all the cool things
 

12571
03:33:30,560 --> 03:33:32,469
you become a fan of all the cool things
that they're doing in their life so like

12572
03:33:32,469 --> 03:33:32,479
that they're doing in their life so like
 

12573
03:33:32,479 --> 03:33:34,790
that they're doing in their life so like

out of it so you would be excited when
 

12671
03:35:08,960 --> 03:35:10,710
out of it so you would be excited when
they get a chance to practice or or

12672
03:35:10,710 --> 03:35:10,720
they get a chance to practice or or
 

12673
03:35:10,720 --> 03:35:12,469

conversation number like seven that he

12698
03:35:38,630 --> 03:35:38,640
conversation number like seven that he
 

12699
03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:40,630
conversation number like seven that he
actually answers it

12700
03:35:40,630 --> 03:35:40,640
actually answers it
 

12701
03:35:40,640 --> 03:35:42,389
actually answers it
well what was interesting

12702
03:35:42,389 --> 03:35:42,399
well what was interesting
 

12703
03:35:42,399 --> 03:35:44,469
well what was interesting
that i found admirable was this sort of

12704
03:35:44,469 --> 03:35:44,479
that i found admirable was this sort of
 

12705
03:35:44,479 --> 03:35:47,670
that i found admirable was this sort of
like a duty to humanity

like a duty to humanity
 

12707
03:35:47,680 --> 03:35:50,070
like a duty to humanity
i think you asked about it not in a

12708
03:35:50,070 --> 03:35:50,080
i think you asked about it not in a
 

12709
03:35:50,080 --> 03:35:53,590
i think you asked about it not in a
about person but about the work

12710
03:35:53,590 --> 03:35:53,600
about person but about the work
 

12711
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:56,469
about person but about the work
and so it was like it was like a to do

12712
03:35:56,469 --> 03:35:56,479
and so it was like it was like a to do
 

12713
03:35:56,479 --> 03:35:58,150
and so it was like it was like a to do
to put all this

12714
03:35:58,150 --> 03:35:58,160
to put all this
 

12715
03:35:58,160 --> 03:36:00,229
to put all this
energy to try to kind of like move

12716
03:36:00,229 --> 03:36:00,239
energy to try to kind of like move
 

12717
03:36:00,239 --> 03:36:02,950
energy to try to kind of like move
things forward knowing that he will

12718
03:36:02,950 --> 03:36:02,960
things forward knowing that he will
 

12719
03:36:02,960 --> 03:36:05,110
things forward knowing that he will
probably die before it gets there you're

12720
03:36:05,110 --> 03:36:05,120
probably die before it gets there you're
 

12721
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:06,870
probably die before it gets there you're
talking about like a something related

12722
03:36:06,870 --> 03:36:06,880
talking about like a something related
 

12723
03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:09,349
talking about like a something related
to the science of

03:36:09,349 --> 03:36:09,359
to the science of
 

12725
03:36:09,359 --> 03:36:11,190
to the science of
rocketry

12726
03:36:11,190 --> 03:36:11,200
rocketry
 

12727
03:36:11,200 --> 03:36:12,070
rocketry
yeah

12728
03:36:12,070 --> 03:36:12,080
yeah
 

12729
03:36:12,080 --> 03:36:14,150
yeah
right he's kind of a rocket scientist

12730
03:36:14,150 --> 03:36:14,160
right he's kind of a rocket scientist
 

12731
03:36:14,160 --> 03:36:15,429
right he's kind of a rocket scientist

something about their character that's
 

12947
03:39:55,680 --> 03:39:57,110
something about their character that's
challenging

12948
03:39:57,110 --> 03:39:57,120
challenging
 

12949
03:39:57,120 --> 03:39:59,429
challenging
you could appreciate that

12950
03:39:59,429 --> 03:39:59,439
you could appreciate that
 

12951
03:39:59,439 --> 03:40:01,910
you could appreciate that
or understand it

12952
03:40:01,910 --> 03:40:01,920
or understand it
 

12953
03:40:01,920 --> 03:40:04,309
or understand it
but it's not something that like they're

12954
03:40:04,309 --> 03:40:04,319
but it's not something that like they're
 

12955
03:40:04,319 --> 03:40:06,309
but it's not something that like they're
intentionally trying to use to deceive

12956
03:40:06,309 --> 03:40:06,319
intentionally trying to use to deceive
 

12957
03:40:06,319 --> 03:40:09,030
intentionally trying to use to deceive
you i think red flags it's like

12958
03:40:09,030 --> 03:40:09,040
you i think red flags it's like
 

12959
03:40:09,040 --> 03:40:10,950
you i think red flags it's like
i guess it's more about like

12960
03:40:10,950 --> 03:40:10,960
i guess it's more about like
 

12961
03:40:10,960 --> 03:40:13,429
i guess it's more about like
manipulation and or like somebody's kind

12962
03:40:13,429 --> 03:40:13,439
manipulation and or like somebody's kind
 

12963
03:40:13,439 --> 03:40:15,830
manipulation and or like somebody's kind
of extreme dysfunction or something

12964
03:40:15,830 --> 03:40:15,840
of extreme dysfunction or something
 

12965
03:40:15,840 --> 03:40:17,429
of extreme dysfunction or something
would be red flags but i think there

12966
03:40:17,429 --> 03:40:17,439
would be red flags but i think there

03:40:17,439 --> 03:40:19,269
would be red flags but i think there
could be things that

quirky or weird or

03:40:21,990 --> 03:40:22,000
quirky or weird or
 

12973
03:40:22,000 --> 03:40:24,469
quirky or weird or
even dark about somebody

12974
03:40:24,469 --> 03:40:24,479
even dark about somebody

even dark about somebody

but
i think in part because i never had kids

13062

to maybe understand themselves a little
 

13079
03:42:11,120 --> 03:42:13,269
to maybe understand themselves a little
better along the way because i think

13080
03:42:13,269 --> 03:42:13,279
better along the way because i think
 

13081
03:42:13,279 --> 03:42:14,950
better along the way because i think
that you know a lot of mistakes that i

03:42:44,560 --> 03:42:46,630
relationships
being really careful to understand why

13114
03:42:46,630 --> 03:42:46,640
being really careful to understand why
 

13115
03:42:46,640 --> 03:42:48,229
being really careful to understand why
you're there or if you're repeating a

13116
03:42:48,229 --> 03:42:48,239
you're there or if you're repeating a
 

13117
03:42:48,239 --> 03:42:50,469
you're there or if you're repeating a
pattern that's something that

13118
03:42:50,469 --> 03:42:50,479
pattern that's something that
 

13119
03:42:50,479 --> 03:42:52,389
pattern that's something that
is sort of cliche but i feel like it's

13120
03:42:52,389 --> 03:42:52,399
is sort of cliche but i feel like it's
 

13121
03:42:52,399 --> 03:42:55,189
is sort of cliche but i feel like it's
very i mean art cliche

13122
03:42:55,189 --> 03:42:55,199
very i mean art cliche
 

13123
03:42:55,199 --> 03:42:57,590
very i mean art cliche
cliches are things that are true they're

13124
03:42:57,590 --> 03:42:57,600
cliches are things that are true they're
 

13125
03:42:57,600 --> 03:43:00,150
cliches are things that are true they're
just repeated a lot but they're

13126
03:43:00,150 --> 03:43:00,160
just repeated a lot but they're
 

13127
03:43:00,160 --> 03:43:01,349
just repeated a lot but they're
but anyway

13128
03:43:01,349 --> 03:43:01,359
but anyway
 

13129
03:43:01,359 --> 03:43:03,189
but anyway
the idea that people repeat patterns

13130
03:43:03,189 --> 03:43:03,199
the idea that people repeat patterns
 

13131
03:43:03,199 --> 03:43:04,550
the idea that people repeat patterns
right yes so

13132
03:43:04,550 --> 03:43:04,560
right yes so
 

13133
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:06,790
right yes so
i think that's very true

13134
03:43:06,790 --> 03:43:06,800
i think that's very true
 

13135
03:43:06,800 --> 03:43:07,830
i think that's very true
right

13136
03:43:07,830 --> 03:43:07,840
right
 

13137
03:43:07,840 --> 03:43:10,389
right
and so to be aware of that and to figure

13138
03:43:10,389 --> 03:43:10,399
and so to be aware of that and to figure
 

13139
03:43:10,399 --> 03:43:12,309
and so to be aware of that and to figure
it out sooner rather than later so you

13140
03:43:12,309 --> 03:43:12,319
it out sooner rather than later so you
 

13141
03:43:12,319 --> 03:43:15,189
it out sooner rather than later so you
don't keep stepping into the same

13142
03:43:15,189 --> 03:43:15,199
don't keep stepping into the same
 

13143
03:43:15,199 --> 03:43:17,590
don't keep stepping into the same
thing over and over again you mentioned

13144
03:43:17,590 --> 03:43:17,600
thing over and over again you mentioned
 

13145
03:43:17,600 --> 03:43:19,590
thing over and over again you mentioned
sort of giving yourself

13146
03:43:19,590 --> 03:43:19,600
sort of giving yourself
 

13147
03:43:19,600 --> 03:43:22,389
sort of giving yourself
time and space to think

13148
03:43:22,389 --> 03:43:22,399
time and space to think
 

13149
03:43:22,399 --> 03:43:24,389
time and space to think
yeah which sometimes isn't possible but

13150
03:43:24,389 --> 03:43:24,399
yeah which sometimes isn't possible but
 

13151
03:43:24,399 --> 03:43:27,189
yeah which sometimes isn't possible but
don't let momentum of life sort of carry

13152
03:43:27,189 --> 03:43:27,199
don't let momentum of life sort of carry
 

13153
03:43:27,199 --> 03:43:30,229
don't let momentum of life sort of carry
you away right and i think for me one of

13154
03:43:30,229 --> 03:43:30,239
you away right and i think for me one of
 

13155
03:43:30,239 --> 03:43:32,150
you away right and i think for me one of
the things that would have scared me

time early on i instead just pushed him

13332
03:46:39,110 --> 03:46:39,120
time early on i instead just pushed him

03:46:42,550 --> 03:46:42,560
wildly different
 

13337
03:46:42,560 --> 03:46:43,670
wildly different
um

13338

um
 

13339
03:46:43,680 --> 03:46:45,429
um
it's hard to

13340
03:46:45,429 --> 03:46:45,439
it's hard to
 

13341
03:46:45,439 --> 03:46:46,950
it's hard to
so that's the biggest mistake of your

13342
03:46:46,950 --> 03:46:46,960
so that's the biggest mistake of your
 

13343
03:46:46,960 --> 03:46:50,389
so that's the biggest mistake of your
life i would say just

13344
03:46:50,389 --> 03:46:50,399
life i would say just
 

13345
03:46:50,399 --> 03:46:51,830
life i would say just
letting

anthony to your life i think yes i think
 

13349
03:46:53,840 --> 03:46:55,510
anthony to your life i think yes i think
one could argue that's the biggest

13350
03:46:55,510 --> 03:46:55,520
one could argue that's the biggest
 

13351
03:46:55,520 --> 03:46:57,349
one could argue that's the biggest
mistake but then at the same time you

13352
03:46:57,349 --> 03:46:57,359
mistake but then at the same time you
 

13353
03:46:57,359 --> 03:46:59,510
mistake but then at the same time you
never know because

13354
03:46:59,510 --> 03:46:59,520
never know because
 

13355
03:46:59,520 --> 03:47:00,389
never know because
like

13356
03:47:00,389 --> 03:47:00,399
like
 

13357
03:47:00,399 --> 03:47:02,150
like
when i um

13358
03:47:02,150 --> 03:47:02,160

when i um
i was in a sort of a dark relationship

13360
03:47:04,630 --> 03:47:04,640
i was in a sort of a dark relationship
 

13361
03:47:04,640 --> 03:47:06,550
i was in a sort of a dark relationship
that then led to

13362
03:47:06,550 --> 03:47:06,560
that then led to
 

13363
03:47:06,560 --> 03:47:08,229
that then led to
the restaurant am i having the one lucky

13364

13639
03:51:37,920 --> 03:51:40,389
just try to understand that it's
inevitable and um

inevitable and um
i mean

13642
03:51:41,590 --> 03:51:41,600
i mean
 

13643
03:51:41,600 --> 03:51:43,189
i mean
yeah

13644
03:51:43,189 --> 03:51:43,199
yeah
 

13645
03:51:43,199 --> 03:51:45,510
yeah
assuming i'm still around

13646
03:51:45,510 --> 03:51:45,520
assuming i'm still around
 

13647
03:51:45,520 --> 03:51:47,910
assuming i'm still around
then um

13648
03:51:47,910 --> 03:51:47,920
then um
 

13649
03:51:47,920 --> 03:51:50,389
then um
that's i think one of the things about

13650
03:51:50,389 --> 03:51:50,399
that's i think one of the things about
 

13651
03:51:50,399 --> 03:51:53,510
that's i think one of the things about
having adopting a dog or getting or

13652
03:51:53,510 --> 03:51:53,520
having adopting a dog or getting or
 

13653
03:51:53,520 --> 03:51:55,750
having adopting a dog or getting or
caring for an animal unless it's one of

13654
03:51:55,750 --> 03:51:55,760
caring for an animal unless it's one of
 

13655
03:51:55,760 --> 03:51:57,189
caring for an animal unless it's one of
those animals that lives a really long

13656
03:51:57,189 --> 03:51:57,199
those animals that lives a really long
 

13657
03:51:57,199 --> 03:52:00,870
those animals that lives a really long
time i just found out that parrots live

13658
03:52:00,870 --> 03:52:00,880
time i just found out that parrots live
 

13659
03:52:00,880 --> 03:52:03,110
time i just found out that parrots live
an extraordinarily long time

13660
03:52:03,110 --> 03:52:03,120
an extraordinarily long time
 

13661
03:52:03,120 --> 03:52:05,030
an extraordinarily long time
um but they're annoying

13662
03:52:05,030 --> 03:52:05,040
um but they're annoying
 

13663
03:52:05,040 --> 03:52:07,189
um but they're annoying
so you get it's a trade-off

13664
03:52:07,189 --> 03:52:07,199
so you get it's a trade-off
 

13665
03:52:07,199 --> 03:52:09,349
so you get it's a trade-off
the ones we love live a short time the

13666
03:52:09,349 --> 03:52:09,359
the ones we love live a short time the
 

13667
03:52:09,359 --> 03:52:10,870
the ones we love live a short time the
ones that enjoy

13668
03:52:10,870 --> 03:52:10,880
ones that enjoy
 

13669
03:52:10,880 --> 03:52:13,030
ones that enjoy
right live a long time so i just think

13670
03:52:13,030 --> 03:52:13,040
right live a long time so i just think
 

13671
03:52:13,040 --> 03:52:14,790
right live a long time so i just think
it's one of those things

13672
03:52:14,790 --> 03:52:14,800
it's one of those things
 

13673
03:52:14,800 --> 03:52:15,670
it's one of those things
that

13674
03:52:15,670 --> 03:52:15,680
that
 

13675
03:52:15,680 --> 03:52:17,349
that
you just know what's gonna happen and

13676
03:52:17,349 --> 03:52:17,359
you just know what's gonna happen and
 

13677
03:52:17,359 --> 03:52:19,510
you just know what's gonna happen and
it's just part of life and i think it's

13678
03:52:19,510 --> 03:52:19,520
it's just part of life and i think it's
 

13679
03:52:19,520 --> 03:52:20,550
it's just part of life and i think it's
one of those

13680
03:52:20,550 --> 03:52:20,560
one of those
 

13681
03:52:20,560 --> 03:52:23,110
one of those
pains that's

13682
03:52:23,110 --> 03:52:23,120
pains that's
 

13683
03:52:23,120 --> 03:52:24,950
pains that's
it's painful but you just kind of have

13684
03:52:24,950 --> 03:52:24,960
it's painful but you just kind of have
 

13685
03:52:24,960 --> 03:52:27,030
it's painful but you just kind of have
to go through it um

13686
03:52:27,030 --> 03:52:27,040

but something about those feelings
lingered where i'm less afraid of it

13776
03:53:59,750 --> 03:53:59,760
lingered where i'm less afraid of it
 

13777
03:53:59,760 --> 03:54:01,830

03:54:03,670 --> 03:54:03,680
less afraid of it but hoping it's not
 

13781

some sort of a gruesome way
 

13783
03:54:05,680 --> 03:54:07,269
some sort of a gruesome way
i mean some people are really afraid of

03:54:09,040 --> 03:54:11,349
flying and i feel like well
statistically it's extremely safe and if

13788
03:54:11,349 --> 03:54:11,359
statistically it's extremely safe and if
 

13789
03:54:11,359 --> 03:54:12,229
statistically it's extremely safe and if
it's going to happen it's going to

13790
03:54:12,229 --> 03:54:12,239
it's going to happen it's going to
 

13791
03:54:12,239 --> 03:54:14,870
it's going to happen it's going to
happen there's nothing you can do

13792
03:54:14,870 --> 03:54:14,880
happen there's nothing you can do
 

13793
03:54:14,880 --> 03:54:16,630
happen there's nothing you can do
like there's really nothing you can do

13794
03:54:16,630 --> 03:54:16,640
like there's really nothing you can do
 

13795
03:54:16,640 --> 03:54:19,189
like there's really nothing you can do
unless you're gonna like

13796
03:54:19,189 --> 03:54:19,199
unless you're gonna like
 

13797
03:54:19,199 --> 03:54:20,710
unless you're gonna like
do what that guy and that small plane

13798
03:54:20,710 --> 03:54:20,720
do what that guy and that small plane
 

13799
03:54:20,720 --> 03:54:22,309
do what that guy and that small plane
did the other day and like leap over and

13800
03:54:22,309 --> 03:54:22,319
did the other day and like leap over and
 

13801
03:54:22,319 --> 03:54:23,830
did the other day and like leap over and
was able to take control of the plane

13802
03:54:23,830 --> 03:54:23,840
was able to take control of the plane
 

13803
03:54:23,840 --> 03:54:26,070
was able to take control of the plane
but i mean like a commercial flight

13804
03:54:26,070 --> 03:54:26,080
but i mean like a commercial flight
 

13805
03:54:26,080 --> 03:54:27,429
but i mean like a commercial flight
so it's like if you're gonna die you're

13806
03:54:27,429 --> 03:54:27,439
so it's like if you're gonna die you're
 

13807
03:54:27,439 --> 03:54:28,710
so it's like if you're gonna die you're
gonna die and it's just your time and

13808
03:54:28,710 --> 03:54:28,720
gonna die and it's just your time and
 

13809
03:54:28,720 --> 03:54:31,990
gonna die and it's just your time and
all you can do is hope that

13810
03:54:31,990 --> 03:54:32,000
all you can do is hope that
 

13811
03:54:32,000 --> 03:54:34,070
all you can do is hope that
i would i would probably prefer to have

13812
03:54:34,070 --> 03:54:34,080
i would i would probably prefer to have
 

13813
03:54:34,080 --> 03:54:36,630
i would i would probably prefer to have
as little awareness about it as possible

13814
03:54:36,630 --> 03:54:36,640
as little awareness about it as possible
 

13815
03:54:36,640 --> 03:54:38,229
as little awareness about it as possible
you know it's like if you'd rather have

somebody
if you're gonna get shot you'd rather

13820
03:54:41,429 --> 03:54:41,439
if you're gonna get shot you'd rather
 

13821
03:54:41,439 --> 03:54:42,630
if you're gonna get shot you'd rather
have somebody shoot you in the back of

13822
03:54:42,630 --> 03:54:42,640
have somebody shoot you in the back of
 

13823
03:54:42,640 --> 03:54:44,710
have somebody shoot you in the back of
the head and you didn't see it coming

13824
03:54:44,710 --> 03:54:44,720

somebody holding a gun to your head and
 

13829

03:55:02,479 --> 03:55:04,790
in the way that some people
argue that

13842
03:55:04,790 --> 03:55:04,800
argue that
 

13843
03:55:04,800 --> 03:55:06,469
argue that
because of the conditions and the fear

13844
03:55:06,469 --> 03:55:06,479
because of the conditions and the fear
 

13845
03:55:06,479 --> 03:55:09,349
because of the conditions and the fear
that that's like

13846
03:55:09,349 --> 03:55:09,359

 

13847
03:55:09,359 --> 03:55:11,269

that's like in their bodies when they're

13848
03:55:11,269 --> 03:55:11,279
that's like in their bodies when they're
 

13849
03:55:11,279 --> 03:55:12,870
that's like in their bodies when they're
killed which is an interesting thing to

13850
03:55:12,870 --> 03:55:12,880
killed which is an interesting thing to
 

13851
03:55:12,880 --> 03:55:14,550
killed which is an interesting thing to
think about

13852
03:55:14,550 --> 03:55:14,560
think about
 

13853
03:55:14,560 --> 03:55:16,229
think about
um

13854
03:55:16,229 --> 03:55:16,239
um
 

13855
03:55:16,239 --> 03:55:19,429
um
yeah i clearly struggle with the ethics

13856
03:55:19,429 --> 03:55:19,439
yeah i clearly struggle with the ethics
 

13857
03:55:19,439 --> 03:55:22,309
yeah i clearly struggle with the ethics
of

13858
03:55:22,309 --> 03:55:22,319

 

13859
03:55:22,319 --> 03:55:23,429

i just

13860
03:55:23,429 --> 03:55:23,439
i just
 

13861
03:55:23,439 --> 03:55:25,349
i just
i think about it a lot

13862
03:55:25,349 --> 03:55:25,359
i think about it a lot
 

13863
03:55:25,359 --> 03:55:26,469
i think about it a lot
about

13864
03:55:26,469 --> 03:55:26,479
about
 

13865
03:55:26,479 --> 03:55:30,070
about
um

13866
03:55:30,070 --> 03:55:30,080

 

13867
03:55:30,080 --> 03:55:32,790

you know like our current food system

13868
03:55:32,790 --> 03:55:32,800
you know like our current food system
 

13869
03:55:32,800 --> 03:55:34,389
you know like our current food system
which involves

13870
03:55:34,389 --> 03:55:34,399
which involves
 

13871
03:55:34,399 --> 03:55:37,590
which involves
uh a system that everybody has sort of

13872
03:55:37,590 --> 03:55:37,600
uh a system that everybody has sort of
 

13873
03:55:37,600 --> 03:55:41,349
uh a system that everybody has sort of
accepted and normalized where

13874
03:55:41,349 --> 03:55:41,359
accepted and normalized where
 

13875
03:55:41,359 --> 03:55:43,269
accepted and normalized where
um

13876
03:55:43,269 --> 03:55:43,279
um
 

13877
03:55:43,279 --> 03:55:46,309
um
like say aliens did come down

13878
03:55:46,309 --> 03:55:46,319
like say aliens did come down
 

13879
03:55:46,319 --> 03:55:47,590
like say aliens did come down
yeah and

13880
03:55:47,590 --> 03:55:47,600
yeah and
 

13881
03:55:47,600 --> 03:55:48,790
yeah and
looked at us

13882
03:55:48,790 --> 03:55:48,800
looked at us
 

13883
03:55:48,800 --> 03:55:50,630
looked at us
and realized that were a particularly

13884
03:55:50,630 --> 03:55:50,640
and realized that were a particularly
 

13885
03:55:50,640 --> 03:55:53,510
and realized that were a particularly
good source of whatever fuel they need

13886
03:55:53,510 --> 03:55:53,520
good source of whatever fuel they need
 

13887
03:55:53,520 --> 03:55:55,110
good source of whatever fuel they need
so then they

13888
03:55:55,110 --> 03:55:55,120
so then they
 

13889
03:55:55,120 --> 03:55:56,469
so then they
imprisoned us all

13890
03:55:56,469 --> 03:55:56,479
imprisoned us all
 

13891
03:55:56,479 --> 03:55:57,670
imprisoned us all
in

13892
03:55:57,670 --> 03:55:57,680
in
 

13893
03:55:57,680 --> 03:55:59,269
in
cages that were like the equivalent of

13894
03:55:59,269 --> 03:55:59,279
cages that were like the equivalent of
 

13895
03:55:59,279 --> 03:56:02,389
cages that were like the equivalent of
like sardines and jammed in an elevator

13896
03:56:02,389 --> 03:56:02,399
like sardines and jammed in an elevator
 

13897
03:56:02,399 --> 03:56:03,830
like sardines and jammed in an elevator
and then

13898
03:56:03,830 --> 03:56:03,840
and then
 

13899
03:56:03,840 --> 03:56:06,150
and then
we were bred

13900
03:56:06,150 --> 03:56:06,160
we were bred
 

13901
03:56:06,160 --> 03:56:06,870
we were bred
and

13902
03:56:06,870 --> 03:56:06,880
and
 

13903
03:56:06,880 --> 03:56:09,269
and
we would get sick and we'd go crazy and

13904
03:56:09,269 --> 03:56:09,279
we would get sick and we'd go crazy and
 

13905
03:56:09,279 --> 03:56:11,830
we would get sick and we'd go crazy and
we'd do the equivalent of like pecking

13906
03:56:11,830 --> 03:56:11,840
we'd do the equivalent of like pecking
 

13907
03:56:11,840 --> 03:56:15,110
we'd do the equivalent of like pecking
and then we'd get abused and then

13908
03:56:15,110 --> 03:56:15,120
and then we'd get abused and then
 

13909
03:56:15,120 --> 03:56:17,990
and then we'd get abused and then
like grotesquely and brutally killed and

13910
03:56:17,990 --> 03:56:18,000
like grotesquely and brutally killed and
 

13911
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:20,790
like grotesquely and brutally killed and
that was like our entire lives and so

13912
03:56:20,790 --> 03:56:20,800
that was like our entire lives and so
 

13913
03:56:20,800 --> 03:56:23,349
that was like our entire lives and so
if like aliens came down and

13914
03:56:23,349 --> 03:56:23,359
if like aliens came down and
 

13915
03:56:23,359 --> 03:56:25,750
if like aliens came down and
started and did all of that

13916
03:56:25,750 --> 03:56:25,760
started and did all of that
 

13917
03:56:25,760 --> 03:56:28,950
started and did all of that
we would have to be okay with that

13918
03:56:28,950 --> 03:56:28,960
we would have to be okay with that
 

13919
03:56:28,960 --> 03:56:30,710
we would have to be okay with that
which is something that

13920
03:56:30,710 --> 03:56:30,720
which is something that
 

13921
03:56:30,720 --> 03:56:33,030
which is something that
my um

13922
03:56:33,030 --> 03:56:33,040
my um
 

13923
03:56:33,040 --> 03:56:34,710
my um
was said to me after watching this movie

13924
03:56:34,710 --> 03:56:34,720
was said to me after watching this movie
 

13925
03:56:34,720 --> 03:56:37,110
was said to me after watching this movie
called our daily bread many years ago

13926
03:56:37,110 --> 03:56:37,120
called our daily bread many years ago
 

13927
03:56:37,120 --> 03:56:39,510
called our daily bread many years ago
um but it's an interesting way to think

13928
03:56:39,510 --> 03:56:39,520
um but it's an interesting way to think
 

13929
03:56:39,520 --> 03:56:42,710
um but it's an interesting way to think
about it because

13930
03:56:42,710 --> 03:56:42,720

 

13931
03:56:42,720 --> 03:56:44,550

i mean we would have to be okay with it

13932
03:56:44,550 --> 03:56:44,560
i mean we would have to be okay with it
 

13933
03:56:44,560 --> 03:56:45,830
i mean we would have to be okay with it
because that's kind of what we're doing

13934
03:56:45,830 --> 03:56:45,840
because that's kind of what we're doing
 

13935
03:56:45,840 --> 03:56:47,030
because that's kind of what we're doing
now

13936
03:56:47,030 --> 03:56:47,040
now
 

13937
03:56:47,040 --> 03:56:49,590
now
right yeah we've normalized certain

13938
03:56:49,590 --> 03:56:49,600
right yeah we've normalized certain
 

13939
03:56:49,600 --> 03:56:51,910
right yeah we've normalized certain
kinds of cruelty and i don't people

13940
03:56:51,910 --> 03:56:51,920
kinds of cruelty and i don't people
 

13941
03:56:51,920 --> 03:56:53,510
kinds of cruelty and i don't people
think yeah people think that like i

13942
03:56:53,510 --> 03:56:53,520
think yeah people think that like i
 

13943
03:56:53,520 --> 03:56:55,269
think yeah people think that like i
would object to

13944
03:56:55,269 --> 03:56:55,279
would object to
 

13945
03:56:55,279 --> 03:56:56,469
would object to
hunting

13946
03:56:56,469 --> 03:56:56,479
hunting
 

13947
03:56:56,479 --> 03:56:58,469
hunting
uh hunting for sport i think is

13948
03:56:58,469 --> 03:56:58,479
uh hunting for sport i think is
 

13949
03:56:58,479 --> 03:56:59,990
uh hunting for sport i think is
grotesque

13950
03:56:59,990 --> 03:57:00,000
grotesque
 

13951
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:01,110
grotesque
but if you're

13952
03:57:01,110 --> 03:57:01,120
but if you're
 

13953
03:57:01,120 --> 03:57:02,870
but if you're
hunting and then

13954
03:57:02,870 --> 03:57:02,880
hunting and then
 

13955
03:57:02,880 --> 03:57:05,510
hunting and then
you're gonna eat the entire animal

13956
03:57:05,510 --> 03:57:05,520
you're gonna eat the entire animal
 

13957
03:57:05,520 --> 03:57:06,870
you're gonna eat the entire animal
and you're hunting in a way where it's

13958
03:57:06,870 --> 03:57:06,880
and you're hunting in a way where it's
 

13959
03:57:06,880 --> 03:57:09,510
and you're hunting in a way where it's
kind of like

13960
03:57:09,510 --> 03:57:09,520

 

13961
03:57:09,520 --> 03:57:11,189

you know that that animal like lived a

13962
03:57:11,189 --> 03:57:11,199
you know that that animal like lived a
 

13963
03:57:11,199 --> 03:57:13,110
you know that that animal like lived a
free and happy life until that moment in

13964
03:57:13,110 --> 03:57:13,120
free and happy life until that moment in
 

13965
03:57:13,120 --> 03:57:14,950
free and happy life until that moment in
the same way that the animal lived a

13966
03:57:14,950 --> 03:57:14,960
the same way that the animal lived a
 

13967
03:57:14,960 --> 03:57:16,790
the same way that the animal lived a
free and happy moment

13968
03:57:16,790 --> 03:57:16,800
free and happy moment
 

13969
03:57:16,800 --> 03:57:18,950
free and happy moment
lived a free and happy

13970
03:57:18,950 --> 03:57:18,960
lived a free and happy
 

13971
03:57:18,960 --> 03:57:20,389
lived a free and happy
life or we don't know maybe they were

13972
03:57:20,389 --> 03:57:20,399
life or we don't know maybe they were
 

13973
03:57:20,399 --> 03:57:21,750
life or we don't know maybe they were
depressed but

13974
03:57:21,750 --> 03:57:21,760
depressed but
 

13975
03:57:21,760 --> 03:57:23,910
depressed but
they lived a free life until

13976
03:57:23,910 --> 03:57:23,920
they lived a free life until
 

13977
03:57:23,920 --> 03:57:27,590
they lived a free life until
like the lion came and took it down

13978
03:57:27,590 --> 03:57:27,600
like the lion came and took it down
 

13979
03:57:27,600 --> 03:57:28,950
like the lion came and took it down
so

13980
03:57:28,950 --> 03:57:28,960
so
 

13981
03:57:28,960 --> 03:57:30,229
so
is a human

13982
03:57:30,229 --> 03:57:30,239
is a human
 

13983
03:57:30,239 --> 03:57:32,710
is a human
shooting an animal for food somehow more

13984
03:57:32,710 --> 03:57:32,720
shooting an animal for food somehow more
 

13985
03:57:32,720 --> 03:57:36,389
shooting an animal for food somehow more
tragic or horrible than a lion attacking

13986
03:57:36,389 --> 03:57:36,399
tragic or horrible than a lion attacking
 

13987
03:57:36,399 --> 03:57:37,750
tragic or horrible than a lion attacking
an elk

13988
03:57:37,750 --> 03:57:37,760
an elk
 

13989
03:57:37,760 --> 03:57:39,510
an elk
yeah well so

13990
03:57:39,510 --> 03:57:39,520
yeah well so
 

13991
03:57:39,520 --> 03:57:40,950
yeah well so
there's a lot of complexities to it on

13992
03:57:40,950 --> 03:57:40,960
there's a lot of complexities to it on
 

13993
03:57:40,960 --> 03:57:43,189
there's a lot of complexities to it on
top of all of that so one you said

13994
03:57:43,189 --> 03:57:43,199
top of all of that so one you said
 

13995
03:57:43,199 --> 03:57:45,910
top of all of that so one you said
so hunting for sport is bad but there's

13996
03:57:45,910 --> 03:57:45,920
so hunting for sport is bad but there's
 

13997
03:57:45,920 --> 03:57:48,309
so hunting for sport is bad but there's
this like complex ethical equation of

13998
03:57:48,309 --> 03:57:48,319
this like complex ethical equation of
 

13999
03:57:48,319 --> 03:57:50,550
this like complex ethical equation of
the fact that hunting for sport is the

14000
03:57:50,550 --> 03:57:50,560
the fact that hunting for sport is the
 

14001
03:57:50,560 --> 03:57:52,469
the fact that hunting for sport is the
thing that often funds the preservation

14002
03:57:52,469 --> 03:57:52,479
thing that often funds the preservation
 

14003
03:57:52,479 --> 03:57:53,830
thing that often funds the preservation
of a species

because when i i felt really strongly
 

14351
04:03:39,279 --> 04:03:41,189
because when i i felt really strongly
about it like i had that feeling that

14352
04:03:41,189 --> 04:03:41,199
about it like i had that feeling that
 

14353
04:03:41,199 --> 04:03:43,910
about it like i had that feeling that
this was

14354
04:03:43,910 --> 04:03:43,920

 

14355
04:03:43,920 --> 04:03:45,910

this was going to be a thing that i i

14356
04:03:45,910 --> 04:03:45,920
this was going to be a thing that i i
 

14357
04:03:45,920 --> 04:03:47,349
this was going to be a thing that i i
wanted to build and grow and could have

14358
04:03:47,349 --> 04:03:47,359
wanted to build and grow and could have
 

14359
04:03:47,359 --> 04:03:50,630
wanted to build and grow and could have
a really positive impact and outlast me

14360
04:03:50,630 --> 04:03:50,640
a really positive impact and outlast me
 

14361
04:03:50,640 --> 04:03:53,269
a really positive impact and outlast me
and um would you bring it back as the

14362
04:03:53,269 --> 04:03:53,279
and um would you bring it back as the
 

14363
04:03:53,279 --> 04:03:54,950
and um would you bring it back as the
same name

14364
04:03:54,950 --> 04:03:54,960
same name
 

14365
04:03:54,960 --> 04:03:57,429

yeah well i i put the logo on my arm

14366
04:03:57,429 --> 04:03:57,439
yeah well i i put the logo on my arm
 

14367
04:03:57,439 --> 04:03:59,269
yeah well i i put the logo on my arm
that's kind of how strongly i felt about

14368
04:03:59,269 --> 04:03:59,279
that's kind of how strongly i felt about
 

14369
04:03:59,279 --> 04:04:00,870
that's kind of how strongly i felt about
it and so

14370
04:04:00,870 --> 04:04:00,880
it and so
 

14371
04:04:00,880 --> 04:04:03,750
it and so
when i did that and around that time and

14372
04:04:03,750 --> 04:04:03,760
when i did that and around that time and
 

14373
04:04:03,760 --> 04:04:05,590
when i did that and around that time and
all of that time i felt

14374
04:04:05,590 --> 04:04:05,600
all of that time i felt
 

14375
04:04:05,600 --> 04:04:10,309
all of that time i felt
really really strongly that um

14376
04:04:10,309 --> 04:04:10,319

 

14377
04:04:10,319 --> 04:04:11,990

quietly

14378
04:04:11,990 --> 04:04:12,000
quietly
 

14379
04:04:12,000 --> 04:04:14,710
quietly
because it feels like

14380
04:04:14,710 --> 04:04:14,720
because it feels like
 

14381
04:04:14,720 --> 04:04:17,110
because it feels like
a little bit bold

14382
04:04:17,110 --> 04:04:17,120
a little bit bold
 

14383
04:04:17,120 --> 04:04:18,830
a little bit bold
but quietly felt

14384
04:04:18,830 --> 04:04:18,840
but quietly felt
 

14385
04:04:18,840 --> 04:04:21,110
but quietly felt
really almost with a certainty that it

14386
04:04:21,110 --> 04:04:21,120
really almost with a certainty that it
 

14387
04:04:21,120 --> 04:04:23,189
really almost with a certainty that it
was going to be something really big and

14388
04:04:23,189 --> 04:04:23,199
was going to be something really big and
 

14389
04:04:23,199 --> 04:04:25,110
was going to be something really big and
it was growing and growing

14390
04:04:25,110 --> 04:04:25,120
it was growing and growing
 

14391
04:04:25,120 --> 04:04:27,030
it was growing and growing
and all signs were pointing towards

14392
04:04:27,030 --> 04:04:27,040
and all signs were pointing towards
 

14393
04:04:27,040 --> 04:04:28,550
and all signs were pointing towards
there i was just sort of stalled and

14394
04:04:28,550 --> 04:04:28,560
there i was just sort of stalled and
 

14395
04:04:28,560 --> 04:04:30,790
there i was just sort of stalled and
couldn't figure out the logistics

14396
04:04:30,790 --> 04:04:30,800
couldn't figure out the logistics
 

14397
04:04:30,800 --> 04:04:33,269
couldn't figure out the logistics
and then enter mr fox

14398
04:04:33,269 --> 04:04:33,279
and then enter mr fox
 

14399
04:04:33,279 --> 04:04:38,229
and then enter mr fox
so the universe can be quite

14400
04:04:38,229 --> 04:04:38,239

 

14401
04:04:38,239 --> 04:04:40,870

absurdly cruel at times

14402
04:04:40,870 --> 04:04:40,880
absurdly cruel at times
 

14403
04:04:40,880 --> 04:04:42,710
absurdly cruel at times
but yeah

14404
04:04:42,710 --> 04:04:42,720
but yeah
 

14405
04:04:42,720 --> 04:04:45,349
but yeah
but that that is something uh

14406
04:04:45,349 --> 04:04:45,359
but that that is something uh
 

14407
04:04:45,359 --> 04:04:47,910
but that that is something uh
that's something worth reaching for is

14408
04:04:47,910 --> 04:04:47,920
that's something worth reaching for is
 

14409
04:04:47,920 --> 04:04:50,389
that's something worth reaching for is
repay the debts of the past

14410
04:04:50,389 --> 04:04:50,399
repay the debts of the past
 

14411
04:04:50,399 --> 04:04:52,389
repay the debts of the past
and then people have said to me that

14412
04:04:52,389 --> 04:04:52,399
and then people have said to me that
 

14413
04:04:52,399 --> 04:04:55,269
and then people have said to me that
leon achieved some kind of immortality

14414
04:04:55,269 --> 04:04:55,279
leon achieved some kind of immortality
 

14415
04:04:55,279 --> 04:04:56,790
leon achieved some kind of immortality
via

14416
04:04:56,790 --> 04:04:56,800
via
 

14417
04:04:56,800 --> 04:04:59,030
via
being in the documentary

14418
04:04:59,030 --> 04:04:59,040
being in the documentary
 

14419
04:04:59,040 --> 04:05:01,110
being in the documentary
and then i might i don't understand this

14420
04:05:01,110 --> 04:05:01,120
and then i might i don't understand this
 

14421
04:05:01,120 --> 04:05:03,750
and then i might i don't understand this
world at all but i might do like an nft

14422
04:05:03,750 --> 04:05:03,760
world at all but i might do like an nft
 

14423
04:05:03,760 --> 04:05:04,950
world at all but i might do like an nft
thing

14424
04:05:04,950 --> 04:05:04,960
thing
 

14425
04:05:04,960 --> 04:05:07,269
thing
related to leon's image which would be

14426
04:05:07,269 --> 04:05:07,279
related to leon's image which would be
 

14427
04:05:07,279 --> 04:05:09,269
related to leon's image which would be
another way of

14428
04:05:09,269 --> 04:05:09,279
another way of
 

14429
04:05:09,279 --> 04:05:12,550
another way of
kind of immortalizing his image at least

14430
04:05:12,550 --> 04:05:12,560
kind of immortalizing his image at least
 

14431
04:05:12,560 --> 04:05:13,429
kind of immortalizing his image at least
yeah

14432
04:05:13,429 --> 04:05:13,439
yeah
 

14433
04:05:13,439 --> 04:05:15,429
yeah
but that's a um

14434
04:05:15,429 --> 04:05:15,439
but that's a um
 

14435
04:05:15,439 --> 04:05:17,030
but that's a um
i mean it's a

14436
04:05:17,030 --> 04:05:17,040
i mean it's a
 

14437
04:05:17,040 --> 04:05:19,590
i mean it's a
potentially in progress

14438
04:05:19,590 --> 04:05:19,600
potentially in progress
 

14439
04:05:19,600 --> 04:05:23,189
potentially in progress
kind of a crazy leap but and potentially

14440
04:05:23,189 --> 04:05:23,199
kind of a crazy leap but and potentially
 

14441
04:05:23,199 --> 04:05:26,630
kind of a crazy leap but and potentially
relaunching the restaurant

14442
04:05:26,630 --> 04:05:26,640
relaunching the restaurant
 

14443
04:05:26,640 --> 04:05:28,150
relaunching the restaurant
possibly yes

14444
04:05:28,150 --> 04:05:28,160
possibly yes
 

14445
04:05:28,160 --> 04:05:29,830
possibly yes
there's a restaurant and there's one

14446
04:05:29,830 --> 04:05:29,840
there's a restaurant and there's one
 

14447
04:05:29,840 --> 04:05:31,670
there's a restaurant and there's one
lucky duck in that brand and they're

14448
04:05:31,670 --> 04:05:31,680
lucky duck in that brand and they're
 

14449
04:05:31,680 --> 04:05:32,630
lucky duck in that brand and they're
sort of

14450
04:05:32,630 --> 04:05:32,640
sort of
 

14451
04:05:32,640 --> 04:05:34,710
sort of
separate but related

14452
04:05:34,710 --> 04:05:34,720
separate but related
 

14453
04:05:34,720 --> 04:05:36,309
separate but related
um and

14454
04:05:36,309 --> 04:05:36,319
um and
 

14455
04:05:36,319 --> 04:05:39,349
um and
they could each exist independently i

14456
04:05:39,349 --> 04:05:39,359
they could each exist independently i
 

14457
04:05:39,359 --> 04:05:41,269
they could each exist independently i
liked it better when they

14458
04:05:41,269 --> 04:05:41,279
liked it better when they
 

14459
04:05:41,279 --> 04:05:42,870
liked it better when they
existed together because i felt like

14460
04:05:42,870 --> 04:05:42,880
existed together because i felt like
 

14461
04:05:42,880 --> 04:05:44,550
existed together because i felt like
they were very complementary in a lot of

14462
04:05:44,550 --> 04:05:44,560
they were very complementary in a lot of
 

14463
04:05:44,560 --> 04:05:47,189
they were very complementary in a lot of
ways and they made sense together but

14464
04:05:47,189 --> 04:05:47,199
ways and they made sense together but
 

14465
04:05:47,199 --> 04:05:49,030
ways and they made sense together but
either one could be done separately

14466
04:05:49,030 --> 04:05:49,040
either one could be done separately
 

14467
04:05:49,040 --> 04:05:50,950
either one could be done separately
without the other

14468
04:05:50,950 --> 04:05:50,960
without the other
 

14469
04:05:50,960 --> 04:05:53,110
without the other

but also in a kind of
 

14489
04:06:10,399 --> 04:06:13,510
but also in a kind of
possibly doomed temporary way

14490
04:06:13,510 --> 04:06:13,520
possibly doomed temporary way
 

14491
04:06:13,520 --> 04:06:15,030
possibly doomed temporary way
which

14492
04:06:15,030 --> 04:06:15,040
which
 

14493
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:17,269
which

it's not that it's not simple it's
 

14497
04:06:18,800 --> 04:06:21,590
it's not that it's not simple it's
actually quite simple it's just that

14498
04:06:21,590 --> 04:06:21,600
actually quite simple it's just that
 

14499
04:06:21,600 --> 04:06:24,790
actually quite simple it's just that
again there's a large age gap

14500
04:06:24,790 --> 04:06:24,800
again there's a large age gap
 

14501

which in itself isn't a problem because
 

14505
04:06:28,720 --> 04:06:31,349
which in itself isn't a problem because
again i wouldn't

14506
04:06:31,349 --> 04:06:31,359
again i wouldn't
 

14507
04:06:31,359 --> 04:06:33,269
again i wouldn't
i wouldn't want to

14508
