know all the edge cases and how it works

494
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
know all the edge cases and how it works

505
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,230
you know 200 someone-year-old experiment
and then we looked at the financial

506
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
and then we looked at the financial
 

507
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,469
and then we looked at the financial
markets and it turns out there were more

508
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
markets and it turns out there were more
 

509
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,150
markets and it turns out there were more
people shorting the stock than stocks

510
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
people shorting the stock than stocks
 

511

how that's possible and then i'm trying

516
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
how that's possible and then i'm trying
 

517
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,029
how that's possible and then i'm trying
to uncover

518
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039

some of the hedge funds that were crying
 

851
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,110
some of the hedge funds that were crying
initially

852
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
initially
 

853
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,470
initially
that maybe some of the wall street bets

854
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
that maybe some of the wall street bets
 

855
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,870
that maybe some of the wall street bets
people who bought last would be crying

people who bought last would be crying
 

857
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,110
people who bought last would be crying
and then eventually there's an probably

858
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
and then eventually there's an probably
 

859
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,030
and then eventually there's an probably
another set of hedge funds or even the

860
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
another set of hedge funds or even the
 

861

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
squeeze these hedge funds because they
 

877
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,910
squeeze these hedge funds because they
have too much short interest

878
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
feels like the dark knight series of
 

961
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,389
feels like the dark knight series of
films where like

962
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
films where like
 

963
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,829

burn yeah i think there is a contingent

966
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
burn yeah i think there is a contingent
 

967
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,870
burn yeah i think there is a contingent
of people who just

968
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
of people who just
 

969
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,189
of people who just
literally want to see chaos yeah like

970
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
literally want to see chaos yeah like
 

971
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,710
literally want to see chaos yeah like
you know that contingent

972
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
you know that contingent
 

973
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,629
you know that contingent
on some of these you know forums who

974
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
on some of these you know forums who
 

975
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,990
on some of these you know forums who
just want to create chaos

976
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
just want to create chaos
 

977
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,470
just want to create chaos
right um so there's certainly that chaos

978
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
right um so there's certainly that chaos
 

979
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,150
right um so there's certainly that chaos
contingent but i think overall what the

980
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
contingent but i think overall what the
 

981
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,269
contingent but i think overall what the

outcome
 

1993
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,510
outcome
but there's a possibility this is a

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,520
but there's a possibility this is a
 

1995
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,110
but there's a possibility this is a
possibility but it's very low and it's

possibility but it's very low and it's
 

1997
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,149
possibility but it's very low and it's
certainly lower than

they had the mrna vaccines ready

2030
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:45,600
they had the mrna vaccines ready
 

2031
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,950
they had the mrna vaccines ready
we could have deployed the vaccines in

2032
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:46,960
we could have deployed the vaccines in
 

2033
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,310
we could have deployed the vaccines in
the summer we would have been done with

2034
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,320
the summer we would have been done with
 

2035
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,870
the summer we would have been done with
this

2036
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:48,880
this
 

2037
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,029
this
it would have been over by now so we get

2038
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039
it would have been over by now so we get
 

2039
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,630
it would have been over by now so we get
to challenge all of that thinking i

2040
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
to challenge all of that thinking i
 

2041
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,310
to challenge all of that thinking i
think that's what the great pause did

2042
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320
think that's what the great pause did
 

2043
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,990
think that's what the great pause did
it's letting everybody challenge that

2044
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
it's letting everybody challenge that
 

2045
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,470
it's letting everybody challenge that
thinking is why do we have that rule

2046
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
thinking is why do we have that rule
 

2047
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,350
thinking is why do we have that rule
okay yeah we don't want to have people

obviously understand but there's a
 

2055
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,909
obviously understand but there's a
reasonable discussion about

2056
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:07,919
reasonable discussion about
 

2057
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,509
reasonable discussion about
well maybe there's a level of risk in a

2058
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:09,519
well maybe there's a level of risk in a
 

2059
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,110
well maybe there's a level of risk in a
global pandemic i mean we fought the

lot of deaths to do that but we had to
 

2067
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,789

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000
which we must
 

2071
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,950
which we must
fight and it's going to result in it's

2072
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960
fight and it's going to result in it's

dying a day but
we could have actually stopped it

2078

we could have actually stopped it
 

2079
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,470
we could have actually stopped it
earlier if we just had a reasonable

we you and i could have a reasonable
discussion about a challenge trial is

discussion about a challenge trial is
 

2113
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,990
discussion about a challenge trial is
something we should consider

2114
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
something we should consider
 

2115
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,190
something we should consider
in a acute situation where millions of

2116
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
in a acute situation where millions of
 

2117
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,470
in a acute situation where millions of
people are going to lose their lives

people are going to lose their lives
 

2119
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,509
people are going to lose their lives
right so you know that's an example of

2120
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
right so you know that's an example of
 

2121
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,029
right so you know that's an example of
capitalism and competition working

2122
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
capitalism and competition working
 

2123
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:07,669
capitalism and competition working
really well

example testing

2130
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
example testing
 

2131
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,549
example testing
at scale should have it seems obvious

2132
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
at scale should have it seems obvious
 

2133
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,549
at scale should have it seems obvious
i i was a little clueless about it but

2134
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
i i was a little clueless about it but
 

2135
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,710
i i was a little clueless about it but
because i thought there's no way you

2136
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
because i thought there's no way you
 

2137
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,590
because i thought there's no way you
can have like antigen tests at hundreds

2138
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
can have like antigen tests at hundreds
 

2139
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,470
can have like antigen tests at hundreds
of millions

2140
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,480
of millions
 

2141
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,230
of millions
like order hundreds of millions of them

2142
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,240
like order hundreds of millions of them
 

2143
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,750
like order hundreds of millions of them
and make them cheap but actually

2144
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:27,760
and make them cheap but actually
 

2145
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,430
and make them cheap but actually
i realized recently that there have been

2146

i realized recently that there have been
 

2147
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,350
i realized recently that there have been
available since about like may

there
 

2157
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,269
there
there's a little bit of a failure of uh

it seems that the blame is to be placed
 

2165
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,710
it seems that the blame is to be placed
at the regulators

and then everybody would be testing and

2218
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,640
and then everybody would be testing and
 

2219
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,149
and then everybody would be testing and
we would have contained it we don't have

00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:34,159
we would have contained it we don't have
 

2221
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,909
we would have contained it we don't have
test and trace here in the united states

test and trace here in the united states
 

2223
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,430
test and trace here in the united states
all the countries that

2224
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,440
all the countries that
 

2225
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,909
all the countries that
are on the other side of kovid did it by

2226
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919
are on the other side of kovid did it by
 

2227
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,190
are on the other side of kovid did it by
having testing

2228
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
having testing
 

2229
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,590
having testing
tracing and closing their borders and

2230
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
tracing and closing their borders and
 

2231
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,389
tracing and closing their borders and
masks

2232
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:44,399
masks
 

2233
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,710
masks
that's the combination that works the

2234
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:46,720
that's the combination that works the
 

2235
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,509
that's the combination that works the
the problem with

2236
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519
the problem with
 

2237
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,149
the problem with
the coronavirus is uh while there's a

2238
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,159
the coronavirus is uh while there's a
 

2239
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,909
the coronavirus is uh while there's a
lot of institutions did not behave their

2240
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:51,919
lot of institutions did not behave their
 

2241
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:52,549
lot of institutions did not behave their
best

2242
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
best
 

2243
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,389
best
it's also the case that there's a lot of

2244
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
it's also the case that there's a lot of
 

2245
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,310
it's also the case that there's a lot of
uncertainty so i tend to give a little

2246
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,320
uncertainty so i tend to give a little
 

2247
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,509
uncertainty so i tend to give a little
bit of a pass

2248
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:57,519
bit of a pass
 

2249
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,590
bit of a pass
to everybody involved for the

2250
00:33:59,590 --> 00:33:59,600
to everybody involved for the
 

2251
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,549
to everybody involved for the
uncertainty

2252
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
uncertainty
 

2253
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,830
uncertainty
we were all i give them that until june

2254
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:03,840
we were all i give them that until june
 

2255
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,509
we were all i give them that until june
i wonder how history will remember this

2256
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:05,519
i wonder how history will remember this
 

2257
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,069
i wonder how history will remember this
whole period i'd love to ask you

01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,510
so you're saying not fundamentally like
the idea but the execution of the actual

4954
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:41,520
the idea but the execution of the actual
 

4955
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,750
the idea but the execution of the actual
of the construction the actual product

4956
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
of the construction the actual product
 

4957
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,189
of the construction the actual product
is amazing

4958
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:45,199
is amazing
 

4959
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:48,709
is amazing
then um there's customers

4960
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:48,719
then um there's customers
 

4961
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,870
then um there's customers
and that every business has ultimately a

4962
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
and that every business has ultimately a
 

4963
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,229
and that every business has ultimately a
customer and that

4964
01:14:52,229 --> 01:14:52,239
customer and that
 

4965
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,550
customer and that
customer if they are in fact delighted

4966
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:54,560

by that product
 

4969
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,830
by that product
that's the magic because

4970
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840
that's the magic because
 

4971
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,630
that's the magic because
you need a team to build the product and

4972
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:02,640
you need a team to build the product and
 

4973
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,390
you need a team to build the product and
then you need customers to use the

4974
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
then you need customers to use the
 

4975
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,270
then you need customers to use the
product

4976
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:05,280
product
 

4977
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,350
product
and really those three vectors are

4978
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:07,360
and really those three vectors are
 

4979
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,750
and really those three vectors are
undeniable now

4980
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
undeniable now
 

4981
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,270
undeniable now
you can have great teams that build a

4982
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:11,280
you can have great teams that build a
 

4983
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,669
you can have great teams that build a
bad product doesn't happen too often

4984
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:13,679
bad product doesn't happen too often
 

4985
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,350
bad product doesn't happen too often
um or you have customers who don't like

4986
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:15,360
um or you have customers who don't like
 

4987
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,990
um or you have customers who don't like
the product but generally speaking

4988
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:18,000
the product but generally speaking
 

4989
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,790
the product but generally speaking
a great team will build a great product

4990
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:20,800
a great team will build a great product
 

4991
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,790
a great team will build a great product
or a good product and iterate

4992
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:22,800
or a good product and iterate
 

4993
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,189
or a good product and iterate
and then eventually delight customers

4994
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:25,199
and then eventually delight customers
 

4995
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:25,990
and then eventually delight customers
and so

4996
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,000
and so
 

4997
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,669
and so
most people say the team is the most

4998
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
most people say the team is the most
 

4999
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,310
most people say the team is the most
important but

5000
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
important but
 

5001
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,990
important but
there's a lot of smart people out there

5002
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,000
there's a lot of smart people out there

people to do it for free

5010
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
people to do it for free
 

5011
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,550
people to do it for free

on
because i thought for many months now

5184
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
because i thought for many months now
 

5185
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,390
because i thought for many months now
that testing needs to be done at scale

5186
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:16,400
that testing needs to be done at scale
 

5187
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,590
that testing needs to be done at scale
and it still hasn't gotten done

5188
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:17,600
and it still hasn't gotten done
 

5189
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,910
and it still hasn't gotten done
it has so we gave up basically and

5190
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:19,920
it has so we gave up basically and
 

5191
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,189
it has so we gave up basically and
testing we gave up

5192
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:21,199
testing we gave up
 

5193
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,709
testing we gave up
because we're and we're all sitting

5194
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:22,719
because we're and we're all sitting
 

5195
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,430
because we're and we're all sitting
there waiting for vaccine to come along

there waiting for vaccine to come along
 

5197
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,310
there waiting for vaccine to come along
and the distribution of the vaccine is

5198
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,320
and the distribution of the vaccine is
 

5199
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:28,870
and the distribution of the vaccine is
not

5200

not
 

5201
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,470
not
you know it's struggling from the same

5202
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:30,480
you know it's struggling from the same
 

5203
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,910
you know it's struggling from the same
kind of things as the testing it's going

5204
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:31,920
kind of things as the testing it's going
 

5205
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,790
kind of things as the testing it's going
to take

5206
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:32,800
to take
 

5207
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,189
to take
quite a bit of time so it does if

5208
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:35,199
quite a bit of time so it does if
 

5209
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:36,790
quite a bit of time so it does if
everything goes great

5210
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
everything goes great
 

5211
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,110
everything goes great
meaning there's not a second strand of

5212
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,120
meaning there's not a second strand of
 

5213
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:39,990
meaning there's not a second strand of
the virus that's

5214
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:40,000
the virus that's
 

5215
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,990
the virus that's
going to create a second major wave

5216
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:44,000
going to create a second major wave
 

5217
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,550
going to create a second major wave
that i i'm cynical enough to think that

5218
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:46,560
that i i'm cynical enough to think that
 

5219
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,990
that i i'm cynical enough to think that
it won't be until

5220
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,000
it won't be until
 

5221
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,430
it won't be until
mid-summer that we start opening back up

5222
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:51,440
mid-summer that we start opening back up
 

5223
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,030
mid-summer that we start opening back up
yeah i think it's going to be may june

5224
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:53,040
yeah i think it's going to be may june

been tracking it's like 1.5 million

5228
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
been tracking it's like 1.5 million
 

5229
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,590
been tracking it's like 1.5 million
shots at arms a day

5230
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:57,600
shots at arms a day
 

5231
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,830
shots at arms a day
i think this vaccine has been undersold

5232
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
i think this vaccine has been undersold
 

5233
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,870
i think this vaccine has been undersold
i mean it's a miracle

5234
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:00,880
i mean it's a miracle
 

5235
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,630
i mean it's a miracle
not one person who was in the trials

5236
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:02,640
not one person who was in the trials
 

5237
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,390
not one person who was in the trials
died who took it

5238
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:04,400
died who took it
 

5239
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,830
died who took it
and only one went to the hospital and

5240
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
and only one went to the hospital and
 

5241
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,910
and only one went to the hospital and
they weren't even put on a ventilator so

5242
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:07,920
they weren't even put on a ventilator so
 

5243
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,990
they weren't even put on a ventilator so
and the hospitalizations are plummeting

5244
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:10,000
and the hospitalizations are plummeting
 

5245
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,310
and the hospitalizations are plummeting
and we're at 10 now in the united states

5246
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:12,320
and we're at 10 now in the united states
 

5247
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,550
and we're at 10 now in the united states
at the pace we're going at 1.5 a day

5248
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
at the pace we're going at 1.5 a day
 

5249
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,910
at the pace we're going at 1.5 a day
i think when the johnson johnson one

5250
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
i think when the johnson johnson one
 

5251
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,189
i think when the johnson johnson one
comes out next month it'll be three

5252
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
comes out next month it'll be three
 

5253
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,590
comes out next month it'll be three
million a day maybe two and a half

5254
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:19,600
million a day maybe two and a half
 

5255
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,950
million a day maybe two and a half
and we already have 100 million people

5256
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
and we already have 100 million people
 

5257
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,390
and we already have 100 million people
who've likely had it so i've been doing

5258
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400
who've likely had it so i've been doing
 

5259
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,070
who've likely had it so i've been doing
the math i think we're like

5260
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080
the math i think we're like
 

5261
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,390
the math i think we're like
60 days away february march yeah

5262
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
60 days away february march yeah
 

5263
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,990
60 days away february march yeah
sometime in april i think

5264
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:28,000
sometime in april i think
 

5265
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,830
sometime in april i think
anybody's gonna be able to get a shot

5266
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:29,840
anybody's gonna be able to get a shot
 

5267
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,430
anybody's gonna be able to get a shot
and the number of deaths is going to go

5268
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
and the number of deaths is going to go
 

5269
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,189
and the number of deaths is going to go

reverse chronological order that's how

5356
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,440
reverse chronological order that's how
 

5357
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,870
reverse chronological order that's how
you consumed a feed

5358

was in reverse chronological order the
 

5363
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:07,910
was in reverse chronological order the
newest thing was up top and you would

5364
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:07,920

ars like
 

5949
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,270
ars like
this is why i think if apple figures out

5950
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
this is why i think if apple figures out

where you put the glasses on you see the

5960
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:04,719
where you put the glasses on you see the
 

5961
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:06,790
where you put the glasses on you see the
real world but you augmented

5962
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:06,800
real world but you augmented
 

5963
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,310
real world but you augmented
well you make uh just like you were

5964
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:08,320
well you make uh just like you were
 

5965
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,470
well you make uh just like you were
saying you make it frictionless

5966
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
saying you make it frictionless
 

5967
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,189
saying you make it frictionless
a very low friction to make a deep human

5968
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:13,199
a very low friction to make a deep human
 

5969
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,790
a very low friction to make a deep human
connection because you you have all the

5970
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,800
connection because you you have all the
 

5971
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,950
connection because you you have all the
basic elements there already

5972
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:16,960
basic elements there already
 

5973
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,910
basic elements there already
now think about the unintended

5974
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:17,920
now think about the unintended
 

5975
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,310
now think about the unintended
consequences of what i just described

5976
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,320
consequences of what i just described
 

5977
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,830
consequences of what i just described
it could get creepy and weird the

01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,510
it could get creepy and weird the
privacy thing yeah

5980
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:23,520
privacy thing yeah
 

5981
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,830

your privacy is an illusion like all
 

5987
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:33,110

people are more than willing to give up
privacy in exchange for

5992
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:36,960
privacy in exchange for
 

5993
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,030
privacy in exchange for
some value you know it's a value trade

5994
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:39,040
some value you know it's a value trade
 

5995
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,790
some value you know it's a value trade
yeah and giving if

5996

yeah and giving if
 

5997
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,390
yeah and giving if
if my tesla when i'm driving in the

5998
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:44,400
if my tesla when i'm driving in the
 

5999
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,910
if my tesla when i'm driving in the
direction of my house just starts the

6000
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:45,920
direction of my house just starts the
 

6001
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,669
direction of my house just starts the
navigation and saves me three clicks and

6002
01:30:47,669 --> 01:30:47,679
navigation and saves me three clicks and
 

6003
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,189
navigation and saves me three clicks and
that friction's gone

6004
01:30:49,189 --> 01:30:49,199
that friction's gone
 

6005
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,590
that friction's gone
i'm willing to give tesla my location

6006
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:51,600
i'm willing to give tesla my location
 

6007
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,709

you get the idea i mean it will be that
 

6017
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,110
you get the idea i mean it will be that
way with like dna and other things at

6018
01:30:59,110 --> 01:30:59,120
way with like dna and other things at
 

6019
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,310
way with like dna and other things at
some point we'll just be like yeah just

6020
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,320
some point we'll just be like yeah just
 

6021
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,750
some point we'll just be like yeah just
take my dna like i don't

6022
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:01,760
take my dna like i don't
 

6023
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,189
take my dna like i don't
yeah sure people can look and see that

6024
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:03,199
yeah sure people can look and see that
 

6025
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:05,750
yeah sure people can look and see that
i'm a mental [\h__\h] and my iq is like

6026
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:05,760
i'm a mental [\h__\h] and my iq is like
 

6027
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,550
i'm a mental [\h__\h] and my iq is like
lower than

6028
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,560
lower than
 

6029
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,910
lower than
i don't want to bring the bell curve up

6030
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:07,920
i don't want to bring the bell curve up
 

6031
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,669
i don't want to bring the bell curve up
or whatever but but

6032
01:31:09,669 --> 01:31:09,679
or whatever but but
 

6033
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,590
or whatever but but
you could you could figure out like if

6034
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:11,600
you could you could figure out like if
 

6035
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,270
you could you could figure out like if
we all put our dna in the sequence

6036
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:13,280
we all put our dna in the sequence
 

6037
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,950
we all put our dna in the sequence
online and like oh yeah you know

6038
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:14,960
online and like oh yeah you know
 

6039
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,750
online and like oh yeah you know
lex has got 10 more iq points than j-cal

6040
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
lex has got 10 more iq points than j-cal
 

6041
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,310
lex has got 10 more iq points than j-cal
and yeah

6042
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:18,320
and yeah
 

6043
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,149
and yeah
you know sam's got 10 more than lex and

6044
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:20,159
you know sam's got 10 more than lex and
 

6045
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:21,669
you know sam's got 10 more than lex and
all of a sudden people are like all bent

6046
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:21,679
all of a sudden people are like all bent
 

6047
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:23,189
all of a sudden people are like all bent
out of shape about it but what if they

6048
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:23,199
out of shape about it but what if they
 

6049
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:24,470
out of shape about it but what if they
we did that and they were like and by

6050
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,480
we did that and they were like and by
 

6051
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,229
we did that and they were like and by
the way you also all three of you are

6052
01:31:26,229 --> 01:31:26,239
the way you also all three of you are
 

6053
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:28,390
the way you also all three of you are
gonna get parkinson's unless you do x y

6054
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,400
gonna get parkinson's unless you do x y
 

6055
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:28,870
gonna get parkinson's unless you do x y
and z

6056
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:28,880
and z
 

6057
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,470
and z
yeah unless you eat more blueberries or

6058

the united states every year like maybe
 

6119
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,870
the united states every year like maybe
10 basis points of them like one in a

6120

thousand
 

6123
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:33,270

the chances of you blowing up the rocket

6164

you can go a little faster but the
 

6171
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,430

you know we're gonna put some money into

6186
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:29,840
you know we're gonna put some money into
 

6187
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,750
you know we're gonna put some money into
uh safe things and then we're gonna have

6188
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:31,760
uh safe things and then we're gonna have
 

6189
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,750
uh safe things and then we're gonna have
these really binary things over here

6190
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:33,760
these really binary things over here
 

6191
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,950
these really binary things over here
and they probably put five percent uh in

6192
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:36,960
and they probably put five percent uh in
 

6193
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,790
and they probably put five percent uh in
venture capital traditionally it's grown

6194
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
venture capital traditionally it's grown
 

6195
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,750
venture capital traditionally it's grown
to twenty percent

6196

to twenty percent
 

6197
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,350
to twenty percent
just as a function of how successful

6198
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
just as a function of how successful
 

6199
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:42,950
just as a function of how successful
it's been so

6200
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:42,960
it's been so
 

6201
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,470
it's been so
you know the harvards of the world and

6202
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:44,480
you know the harvards of the world and
 

6203
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,229
you know the harvards of the world and
mit is probably one five or

6204
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:46,239
mit is probably one five or
 

6205
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:48,709
mit is probably one five or
ten percent in venture but it's grown to

6206
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:48,719
ten percent in venture but it's grown to
 

6207
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:49,350
ten percent in venture but it's grown to
25

6208
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:49,360
25
 

6209
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,030
25
because you know companies like airbnb

6210
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:51,040
because you know companies like airbnb
 

6211
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,430
because you know companies like airbnb
and uber have grown so big in tesla

6212
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:53,440
and uber have grown so big in tesla
 

6213
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,550
and uber have grown so big in tesla
but the goal is in these venture funds

6214
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:56,560
but the goal is in these venture funds
 

6215
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,550
but the goal is in these venture funds
we're going to invest in 30 names

6216
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:58,560
we're going to invest in 30 names
 

6217
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,550
we're going to invest in 30 names
and one or two of them are going to

6218
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:00,560
and one or two of them are going to
 

6219
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,149
and one or two of them are going to
return three times the capital we've

6220
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
return three times the capital we've
 

6221
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:02,790
return three times the capital we've
deployed

6222
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:02,800
deployed
 

6223
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,390
deployed
so it's a 300 million dollar fund and

6224
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:04,400
so it's a 300 million dollar fund and
 

6225
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,229
so it's a 300 million dollar fund and
there's 30 names and each got 10 million

6226
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:06,239
there's 30 names and each got 10 million
 

6227
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,390
there's 30 names and each got 10 million
that means one of the 10 million is

6228
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:08,400
that means one of the 10 million is
 

6229
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,590
that means one of the 10 million is
going to return

6230
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:09,600
going to return
 

6231
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,070
going to return
the fund plus so that means it has to

6232
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,080
the fund plus so that means it has to
 

6233
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,110
the fund plus so that means it has to
grow

6234
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,120
grow
 

6235
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,950
grow
30x and then 60x to double the fund and

6236
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:16,960
30x and then 60x to double the fund and
 

6237
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,070
30x and then 60x to double the fund and
you're really supposed to be

6238
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
you're really supposed to be
 

6239
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,990
you're really supposed to be
doing three times cash on cash so that

6240
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:20,000
doing three times cash on cash so that
 

6241
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,669
doing three times cash on cash so that
300 million dollar funds

6242
01:34:21,669 --> 01:34:21,679
300 million dollar funds
 

6243
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,510
300 million dollar funds
the expectation is in 10 years to return

6244
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
the expectation is in 10 years to return
 

6245
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,950
the expectation is in 10 years to return
900 million

6246
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:24,960
900 million
 

6247
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,390
900 million
triple the person's money as opposed to

6248
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:26,400
triple the person's money as opposed to
 

6249
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,910
triple the person's money as opposed to
the stock market which doubles your

6250
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:27,920
the stock market which doubles your
 

6251
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,189
the stock market which doubles your
money in the same period

6252
01:34:29,189 --> 01:34:29,199
money in the same period
 

6253
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,430
money in the same period
so you're supposed to do 25 percent

6254
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:31,440
so you're supposed to do 25 percent
 

6255
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,910
so you're supposed to do 25 percent
annualized returns in order to

6256
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:33,920
annualized returns in order to
 

6257
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,229
annualized returns in order to
triple the money and maybe i have an

6258
01:34:36,229 --> 01:34:36,239
triple the money and maybe i have an
 

6259
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:37,669
triple the money and maybe i have an
outlying chance of four or five times

6260
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
outlying chance of four or five times
 

6261
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:38,950
outlying chance of four or five times
the money which does happen sometimes

6262
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:38,960
the money which does happen sometimes
 

6263
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,910
the money which does happen sometimes
when you have an outlier in your

6264
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:39,920
when you have an outlier in your
 

6265
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,629
when you have an outlier in your
portfolio like uber or facebook was

6266
01:34:42,629 --> 01:34:42,639
portfolio like uber or facebook was
 

6267
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,430
portfolio like uber or facebook was
and what that means is the venture

6268
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,440
and what that means is the venture
 

6269
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:45,990
and what that means is the venture
capitalist

6270
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:46,000
capitalist
 

6271
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,430
capitalist
behavior on the game they're playing is

6272
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:47,440
behavior on the game they're playing is
 

6273
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,109
behavior on the game they're playing is
different than you as the founder you as

6274
01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:49,119
different than you as the founder you as
 

6275
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:50,629
different than you as the founder you as
the founder you may really care about

6276
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:50,639
the founder you may really care about
 

6277
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:51,350
the founder you may really care about
this

6278
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:51,360
this
 

6279
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,669
this
and it dying really matters to you and

6280
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:53,679
and it dying really matters to you and
 

6281
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:54,870
and it dying really matters to you and
then you got a venture capitalist who's

6282
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,880
then you got a venture capitalist who's
 

6283
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,310
then you got a venture capitalist who's
like we're betting on 30 names we need

6284
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:56,320
like we're betting on 30 names we need
 

6285
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,510
like we're betting on 30 names we need
two of them

6286
01:34:57,510 --> 01:34:57,520
two of them
 

6287
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,510
two of them
to hit it out of the park maybe three

6288
01:34:59,510 --> 01:34:59,520
to hit it out of the park maybe three
 

6289
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:02,310
to hit it out of the park maybe three
and nothing else is meaningful

6290
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
and nothing else is meaningful
 

6291
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,310
and nothing else is meaningful
so now you start thinking about the game

6292
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:04,320
so now you start thinking about the game
 

6293
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,910
so now you start thinking about the game
theory there

6294
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:05,920
theory there
 

6295
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,629
theory there
you're dealing with you know money that

6296
01:35:08,629 --> 01:35:08,639
you're dealing with you know money that
 

6297
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:09,669
you're dealing with you know money that
is coming in

6298
01:35:09,669 --> 01:35:09,679
is coming in
 

6299
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:13,590
is coming in
that only cares about you going 100x

6300
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:13,600
that only cares about you going 100x
 

6301
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,030
that only cares about you going 100x
yes it's a whole different ball game

6302
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,040
yes it's a whole different ball game
 

6303
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,470
yes it's a whole different ball game
whereas if you build off revenue you

6304
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:18,480
whereas if you build off revenue you
 

6305
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,510
whereas if you build off revenue you
don't have to do that and if you look at

6306
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:19,520
don't have to do that and if you look at
 

6307
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,669
don't have to do that and if you look at
a company like com.com we invested at 5

6308
01:35:21,669 --> 01:35:21,679
a company like com.com we invested at 5
 

6309
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,189
a company like com.com we invested at 5
million the next round they did was 250

6310
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:23,199
million the next round they did was 250
 

6311
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,030
million the next round they did was 250
they were so capital efficient

6312
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:25,040
they were so capital efficient
 

6313
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,270
they were so capital efficient
that they grew from 10 000 a month in

6314
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,280
that they grew from 10 000 a month in
 

6315
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,109
that they grew from 10 000 a month in
revenue to millions of dollars a month

6316
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:29,119
revenue to millions of dollars a month
 

6317
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:30,070
revenue to millions of dollars a month
in revenue

6318
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,080
in revenue
 

6319
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,149
in revenue
over those four years since we invested

6320
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
over those four years since we invested
 

6321
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,750
over those four years since we invested
and they didn't raise money in between

6322
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:33,760
and they didn't raise money in between
 

6323
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,390
and they didn't raise money in between
wow it was unbelievable and i've only

6324
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,400
wow it was unbelievable and i've only
 

6325
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,750
wow it was unbelievable and i've only
seen this happen three or four times so

6326
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
seen this happen three or four times so
 

6327
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,189
seen this happen three or four times so
it doesn't happen all this capital

6328
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
it doesn't happen all this capital
 

6329
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:40,390
it doesn't happen all this capital
efficient meaning

6330
01:35:40,390 --> 01:35:40,400
efficient meaning
 

6331
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,830
efficient meaning
uh based on customer revenue alone plus

01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
uh based on customer revenue alone plus
 

6333
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,229

some
 

6335
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,390
some
small amount of fundraising you're able

01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:47,360
to go like
 

6339
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,550
to go like
how hard is it to do that it takes

6340
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:50,560
how hard is it to do that it takes
 

6341
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,790
how hard is it to do that it takes
extreme product market fit you have to

6342
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800
extreme product market fit you have to
 

6343
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,390
extreme product market fit you have to
have a great price for your product that

6344
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:54,400
have a great price for your product that
 

6345
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,790
have a great price for your product that
has a great margin um

6346
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:56,800
has a great margin um
 

6347
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,390
has a great margin um
yeah and if you're doing something in

6348
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:58,400
yeah and if you're doing something in
 

6349
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,149
yeah and if you're doing something in
hardware it's probably impossible

6350
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:00,159
hardware it's probably impossible
 

6351
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:01,669
hardware it's probably impossible
because it's super capital intensive so

6352
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:01,679
because it's super capital intensive so
 

6353
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:02,790
because it's super capital intensive so
it's probably got to be a software

6354
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:02,800
it's probably got to be a software
 

6355
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,189
it's probably got to be a software
business

6356
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:03,199
business
 

6357
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,030
business
software hardware businesses take a lot

6358
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,040
software hardware businesses take a lot
 

6359
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,510
software hardware businesses take a lot
more do venture capitals get in the way

6360
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:07,520
more do venture capitals get in the way

6460
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:36,800
so everybody look there's a couple
 

6461
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,910
so everybody look there's a couple
little blips in there but

6462
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:37,920
little blips in there but
 

6463
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:38,870
little blips in there but
generally speaking there hasn't been

6464
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
generally speaking there hasn't been
 

6465
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,709
generally speaking there hasn't been
like a major crash uh with the exception

6466
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
like a major crash uh with the exception
 

6467
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:41,910
like a major crash uh with the exception
of the pandemic crash but that bounced

6468
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:41,920
of the pandemic crash but that bounced
 

6469
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:42,709
of the pandemic crash but that bounced
right back

6470
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:42,719
right back
 

6471
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:45,270
right back
and so you know it takes a decade to

6472
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:45,280
and so you know it takes a decade to
