00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
decentralization of truth
 

335
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,270
decentralization of truth
where like truth is a clustering thing

336
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
where like truth is a clustering thing
 

337
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,029
where like truth is a clustering thing
where you have these like this point

certain ideas
 

345
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,870
certain ideas
and what's thought of as truth is almost

346
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
and what's thought of as truth is almost
 

347
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,390
and what's thought of as truth is almost
like a clustering algorithm when you

348
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
like a clustering algorithm when you
 

349
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,749
like a clustering algorithm when you
just get a bunch of

350
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
just get a bunch of
 

351
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,270
just get a bunch of
people that believe the same thing

352
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
people that believe the same thing
 

353
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,189
people that believe the same thing
that's truth but there's also another

354
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
that's truth but there's also another
 

355
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,830
that's truth but there's also another

truth
 

357
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,909
truth
and there might be like multiple truths

358
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
and there might be like multiple truths
 

359
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,189
and there might be like multiple truths
and it's almost it

360
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
and it's almost it
 

361
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,150
and it's almost it
be like a battle of truths maybe even

362
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
be like a battle of truths maybe even
 

363
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,430
be like a battle of truths maybe even
the idea of truth

364
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
the idea of truth
 

365
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,550
the idea of truth
will like lessen its power

366
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
will like lessen its power
 

367
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,550
will like lessen its power
in society that there is such a thing as

368
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
in society that there is such a thing as
 

369
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,309
in society that there is such a thing as
a truth because like the downside of

370
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
a truth because like the downside of
 

371
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:02,710
a truth because like the downside of
saying

372
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
saying
 

373
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,950
saying
something is true is uh it's always the

something is true is uh it's always the
 

375
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,110
something is true is uh it's always the
downside of what people like religious

people call scientism

378
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
people call scientism
 

379
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,510
people call scientism
which is like once science has declared

380
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
which is like once science has declared
 

381
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,029
which is like once science has declared
something is true

382
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
something is true
 

383
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,150
something is true
you can't no longer question it but

384
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
you can't no longer question it but
 

385
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,309
you can't no longer question it but
the reality is science is a moving

386
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
the reality is science is a moving
 

387
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,749
the reality is science is a moving
mechanism you're constantly questioning

388
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
mechanism you're constantly questioning
 

389
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,189
mechanism you're constantly questioning
you're constantly questioning and

390
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
you're constantly questioning and
 

391
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,790
you're constantly questioning and
maybe truth should be renamed

392
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
maybe truth should be renamed
 

393
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,309
maybe truth should be renamed
as uh as a process not a

394
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
as uh as a process not a
 

395
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,870
as uh as a process not a
not a final destination the whole point

396
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
not a final destination the whole point
 

397
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,990
not a final destination the whole point
is to keep questioning

398
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
is to keep questioning
 

399
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,309
is to keep questioning
keep questioning keep discovering kind

400
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
keep questioning keep discovering kind
 

401
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,390
keep questioning keep discovering kind
of like we're going backwards in time so

402
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
of like we're going backwards in time so
 

403
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,189
of like we're going backwards in time so
like

404
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
like
 

405
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,270
like
back when back when people were sort of

406
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
back when back when people were sort of
 

407
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,629
back when back when people were sort of
finding their identities and we were

408
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
finding their identities and we were
 

409
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,390
finding their identities and we were
less globalized right

410
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
less globalized right
 

411
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,990
less globalized right
like people would would get together and

412
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
like people would would get together and
 

413
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,510
like people would would get together and
they'd get together around common value

414
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
they'd get together around common value
 

415
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,230
they'd get together around common value
system

416
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
system
 

417
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,390
system
common morals and a common place and

418
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
common morals and a common place and
 

419
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,550
common morals and a common place and
those would be sort of these clusters of

420
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
those would be sort of these clusters of
 

421
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,390
those would be sort of these clusters of
their truth right and so we have all

422
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
their truth right and so we have all
 

423
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,990
their truth right and so we have all
these different like civilizations and

424
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
these different like civilizations and
 

425
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,670
these different like civilizations and
societies across

426
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
societies across
 

427
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,270
societies across
across the world that created their own

truths you know we talk about the jews

430
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
truths you know we talk about the jews
 

431
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,390

and the tom and toro

432
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
and the tom and toro
 

433
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,189
and the tom and toro
look at buddhist texts we can look at

434
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
look at buddhist texts we can look at
 

435
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,710
look at buddhist texts we can look at
all sorts of different truths and

436
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
all sorts of different truths and
 

437
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,550
all sorts of different truths and
how many of them get at the same things

438
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
how many of them get at the same things
 

439
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,710
how many of them get at the same things
but many of them have different ideas or

440
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
but many of them have different ideas or
 

441
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,309
but many of them have different ideas or
different articulations

442
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
different articulations
 

443
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,870
different articulations
yeah harare and sapiens rewinds that

444
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
yeah harare and sapiens rewinds that
 

445
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,629
yeah harare and sapiens rewinds that
even farther back into like caveman

446
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
even farther back into like caveman
 

447
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,070
even farther back into like caveman
times that's the thing that made

these clusters of ideas hold them in

452
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
these clusters of ideas hold them in

through stories pass them on to each

um that uh that has power
 

467
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,309
um that uh that has power
only because we believe in it and is

468
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
only because we believe in it and is

at risk
 

653
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,750
at risk
and i realized the best course of action

654
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
and i realized the best course of action
 

655
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,509
and i realized the best course of action
was basically

656
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
was basically
 

657
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,630
was basically
just not to broach the topic

658
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640

667
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,350
i'm not i'm not gonna be a part of it
and it's a real shame it's a real loss

668
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
and it's a real shame it's a real loss
 

669
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,350
and it's a real shame it's a real loss
to all of the students who i think

670
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
to all of the students who i think
 

671
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,030
to all of the students who i think
came to the school to learn from these

672
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
came to the school to learn from these
 

673
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,790
came to the school to learn from these
brilliant professors

674
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
brilliant professors
 

675
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,710
brilliant professors
in that context of these world experts

676
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
in that context of these world experts
 

677
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,269
in that context of these world experts
the problem seems to be that reporting

678
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
the problem seems to be that reporting
 

679
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,030
the problem seems to be that reporting
mechanism

680
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
mechanism
 

681
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,509
mechanism
where there's a disproportionate power

682
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
where there's a disproportionate power
 

683
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,790
where there's a disproportionate power
to a complaint

684
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
to a complaint
 

685
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,350
to a complaint
of a young student a complaint that an

686
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
of a young student a complaint that an
 

687
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,310
of a young student a complaint that an
idea

688
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
idea
 

689
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,670
idea
is painful or an idea is disrespectful

690
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
is painful or an idea is disrespectful
 

691
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,949
is painful or an idea is disrespectful
to you know or

692
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
to you know or
 

693
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,069

ideas creating an unsafe space

694
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
ideas creating an unsafe space
 

695
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,949
ideas creating an unsafe space
and the the conclusion of that i mean

696
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
and the the conclusion of that i mean
 

697
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:13,990
and the the conclusion of that i mean
i'm not sure what to do

698
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
i'm not sure what to do
 

699
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,470
i'm not sure what to do
with that because it's a single

700
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
with that because it's a single
 

701
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,190
with that because it's a single
reporting

702

reporting
 

703
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,190
reporting
maybe a couple but that has more power

704
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
maybe a couple but that has more power
 

705
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,590
maybe a couple but that has more power
than the idea itself and that's strange

706
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
than the idea itself and that's strange
 

707
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,630
than the idea itself and that's strange
i i don't know how to

708
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
i i don't know how to
 

709
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,509
i i don't know how to
fix that in the administration except to

710
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519

fire everybody
so like this is to push back against

so like this is to push back against
 

715
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,630
so like this is to push back against
this storyline

716

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,069
and i have to be a little careful
because

830
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079

831
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,430
because
um you know i've been in some of these

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,830
so you've explored a bunch of different
ideas you wrote a bunch of different

1154
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
ideas you wrote a bunch of different
 

1155
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,630
ideas you wrote a bunch of different
stuff

1156
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
stuff
 

1157
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,510
stuff
uh how did lee brooks come about it

1158
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
uh how did lee brooks come about it
 

1159
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,310
uh how did lee brooks come about it
basically

1160
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
basically
 

1161
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,630
basically
came to me that it had to be kind of a

1162
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
came to me that it had to be kind of a
 

1163
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,230
came to me that it had to be kind of a
grassroots movement and it had to be

1164
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
grassroots movement and it had to be
 

1165
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,990
grassroots movement and it had to be
something that changed culturally

1166
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
something that changed culturally
 

1167
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,710
something that changed culturally
and it had to be relatively personal

1168
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
and it had to be relatively personal
 

1169
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,310
and it had to be relatively personal
people meeting people

1170
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
people meeting people
 

1171
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,470
people meeting people

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
people finding out that no i'm not the
 

1173
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,909
people finding out that no i'm not the

there are a lot of other people who feel
alone

1180
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
alone
 

1181
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,750
alone
i i believe this thing and it's not as

1182
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
i i believe this thing and it's not as
 

1183
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,190
i i believe this thing and it's not as
unpopular as i thought

1184
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
unpopular as i thought
 

1185
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,510
unpopular as i thought
you know the basically creating

1186
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
you know the basically creating
 

1187
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,029
you know the basically creating
heterodoxy of thought

1188
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
heterodoxy of thought
 

1189
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,510
heterodoxy of thought
and it's creating that moment where you

1190
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
and it's creating that moment where you
 

1191
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,909
and it's creating that moment where you
realize that your politics

1192
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
realize that your politics
 

1193
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,510
realize that your politics
are personal and that your politics are

1194
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
are personal and that your politics are
 

1195
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,990
are personal and that your politics are
shared by a lot of people on campus

1196
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
shared by a lot of people on campus
 

1197
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,029
shared by a lot of people on campus
and so i just started coding it i i

1198
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
and so i just started coding it i i
 

1199
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,630
and so i just started coding it i i
didn't have much coding experience but

1200
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,640
didn't have much coding experience but
 

1201
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,750
didn't have much coding experience but
uh

1202
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
uh
 

1203
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,990
uh
went headfirst in and figured how hard

1204
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
went headfirst in and figured how hard
 

1205
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,950
went headfirst in and figured how hard
could it be

1206
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
could it be
 

1207
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,750
could it be
you know i mean this is really

fascinating
 

1211
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,990
fascinating
so i talked to a lot of software

1212
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
so i talked to a lot of software
 

1213
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,590
so i talked to a lot of software
engineers ai people

1214
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
engineers ai people
 

1215
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,549
engineers ai people
obviously that's where my passion my uh

1216
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
obviously that's where my passion my uh

that you don't have a background
 

1231
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,870
that you don't have a background
in programming you don't have even maybe

1232
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
in programming you don't have even maybe
 

1233
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,029
in programming you don't have even maybe
a technical background

1234
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
a technical background
 

1235
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,070
a technical background
so you saw a problem

1236
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
so you saw a problem
 

1237
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,110
so you saw a problem
you explored different ideas and then

1238
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
you explored different ideas and then
 

1239
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,789
you explored different ideas and then
you just decided you're gonna

1240

you just decided you're gonna
 

1241
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,149
you just decided you're gonna
learn how to build an app like without a

1242
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
learn how to build an app like without a
 

1243

program without a programming background
 

1257
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,310
program without a programming background
and building the app like detail like

1258
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
and building the app like detail like
 

1259
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,270
and building the app like detail like
what do you actually

1260
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
what do you actually
 

1261
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,230
what do you actually
like how do you start sure i mean you

step by step right i'll be as dumb as

1270
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
step by step right i'll be as dumb as
 

1271
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,870

this
well yeah i had a pc at the time and i

well yeah i had a pc at the time and i
 

1281
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,950
well yeah i had a pc at the time and i
was android at the time

1282
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
was android at the time
 

1283
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,630
was android at the time
and i realized you know i realized it

1284
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
and i realized you know i realized it
 

1285
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,549
and i realized you know i realized it
should be like an ios app and so

1286
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
should be like an ios app and so
 

1287
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,789
should be like an ios app and so
um you know that was a decision but you

1288
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
um you know that was a decision but you
 

1289
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,590
um you know that was a decision but you
know i knew

for testing eventually got an iphone um
 

1335
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,470
for testing eventually got an iphone um
so those are the real robot blocks to

1336
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
so those are the real robot blocks to
 

1337
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,430
so those are the real robot blocks to
start with

1338
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
start with
 

1339
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,750
start with
um from there i mean there's there's

1340
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
um from there i mean there's there's
 

1341
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,190
um from there i mean there's there's
almost too much information out there

1342
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
almost too much information out there
 

1343
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,070
almost too much information out there
about programming

1344
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
about programming
 

1345
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,909
about programming
the question is like where do you start

1346
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:45,919
the question is like where do you start
 

1347
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,510
the question is like where do you start
and what's going to be useful to you

1348
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
and what's going to be useful to you
 

1349
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,950
and what's going to be useful to you
and i

1350
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
and i
 

1351
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,549
and i
i my first thought was i should look at

1352
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
i my first thought was i should look at
 

1353
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,310
i my first thought was i should look at
some yell classes but it became very

1354
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
some yell classes but it became very
 

1355
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,830
some yell classes but it became very
clear very quickly that that was not the

1356
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:55,840
clear very quickly that that was not the
 

1357
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,110
clear very quickly that that was not the
right place to start

1358
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
right place to start
 

1359
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,029
right place to start
um that would probably be the right

1360
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
um that would probably be the right
 

1361
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,390
um that would probably be the right
place to start if i wanted to get a job

1362
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
place to start if i wanted to get a job
 

1363
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,870
place to start if i wanted to get a job
at

1364
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
at
 

1365
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,710
at
amazon but michael was slightly

1366
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
amazon but michael was slightly
 

1367
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,470
amazon but michael was slightly
different yeah and

1368
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
different yeah and
 

1369
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,510
different yeah and
i i definitely had it in mind that what

1370
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
i i definitely had it in mind that what
 

1371
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,789
i i definitely had it in mind that what
i was trying to make was i'm trying to

1372
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799
i was trying to make was i'm trying to
 

1373
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,390
i was trying to make was i'm trying to
prove out an idea i'm not trying to make

1374
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
prove out an idea i'm not trying to make
 

1375
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,510
prove out an idea i'm not trying to make
a finished product

1376
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
a finished product
 

1377
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,909
a finished product
i'm just trying to get to the first step

1378
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
i'm just trying to get to the first step
 

1379
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,110
i'm just trying to get to the first step
because i figured

1380
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
because i figured
 

1381
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,230
because i figured
if i keep if i keep getting to the next

1382
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
if i keep if i keep getting to the next
 

1383
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,430
if i keep if i keep getting to the next
step

1384
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
step
 

1385
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,590
step
at least i won't die now you know like

1386
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
at least i won't die now you know like
 

1387

at least i won't die now you know like
at least things will move forward i'll

1388
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
at least things will move forward i'll
 

1389
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,070
at least things will move forward i'll
learn new things

1390
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
learn new things
 

1391
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,990
learn new things
maybe i'll meet new people i'll show a

1392
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
maybe i'll meet new people i'll show a
 

1393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,430
maybe i'll meet new people i'll show a
degree of seriousness about what i'm

1394
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
degree of seriousness about what i'm
 

1395
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,149
degree of seriousness about what i'm

and things will come together and that
 

1399
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,310
and things will come together and that
is as you'll see what ends up happening

is as you'll see what ends up happening
 

1401
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,590
is as you'll see what ends up happening
um so i start with swift right and

1402
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
um so i start with swift right and
 

1403
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,029
um so i start with swift right and

video it's basically like
 

1437
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,070
video it's basically like
introductory course to swift yeah i mean

1438
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
introductory course to swift yeah i mean
 

1439
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,830
introductory course to swift yeah i mean
you say introductory i think most of the

1440
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
you say introductory i think most of the
 

1441
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,350
you say introductory i think most of the
people in that class

1442
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
people in that class
 

1443
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,110
people in that class
um probably had a much better background

1444
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
um probably had a much better background
 

1445
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,350
um probably had a much better background
than i did software developers probably

1446
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
than i did software developers probably
 

1447
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,190
than i did software developers probably
yeah computer scientists and it was slow

1448
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
yeah computer scientists and it was slow
 

1449
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,789
yeah computer scientists and it was slow
for me um

1450
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
for me um
 

1451
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,710
for me um
i i don't think i realized it fully at

1452
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
i i don't think i realized it fully at
 

1453
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,149
i i don't think i realized it fully at
the time just how far behind i was from

1454
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
the time just how far behind i was from
 

1455
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,510
the time just how far behind i was from
the rest of the class because i was like

1456
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
the rest of the class because i was like
 

1457
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,070
the rest of the class because i was like
wow

1458
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
wow
 

1459
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,510
wow
it seems like people are picking this up

1460
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
it seems like people are picking this up
 

1461
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,590
it seems like people are picking this up
really quickly um

1462
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
really quickly um
 

1463
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,029
really quickly um
so it took a little longer and you know

1464
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:31,039
so it took a little longer and you know
 

1465
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,789
so it took a little longer and you know
a lot of time on stack overflow

1466
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
a lot of time on stack overflow
 

1467
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,270
a lot of time on stack overflow
but eventually i made a truly minimal

1468
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
but eventually i made a truly minimal
 

1469
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,870
but eventually i made a truly minimal
viable product

1470
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
viable product
 

1471
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,029
viable product
the most minimal like we're talking you

1472
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
the most minimal like we're talking you
 

1473
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,269
the most minimal like we're talking you

and you plug it into a
certain a cloud server and you verify

1486
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,360
certain a cloud server and you verify
 

1487
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,710
certain a cloud server and you verify
people's accounts

1488

people's accounts
 

1489
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,350
people's accounts
and you you're off you have you have to

1490
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
and you you're off you have you have to
 

1491
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,789
and you you're off you have you have to
figure out how to

1492
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
figure out how to
 

1493
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,710
figure out how to
like the whole idea of like having an

1494
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:02,720
like the whole idea of like having an
 

1495
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,990
like the whole idea of like having an
account so

1496
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
account so
 

1497
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,990
account so
there's a permanence like you can create

1498
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
there's a permanence like you can create
 

1499
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,190
there's a permanence like you can create
an account

1500
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
an account
 

1501
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,230
an account
with an email verify it verify it

1502
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,240
with an email verify it verify it
 

1503
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,390
with an email verify it verify it
okay so that that's not you know and

1504
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
okay so that that's not you know and
 

1505
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,510
okay so that that's not you know and
that's literally how i thought about it

1506
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
that's literally how i thought about it
 

1507
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,269
that's literally how i thought about it
right like so what do i need to do

1508
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
right like so what do i need to do
 

1509

and i'm like well first thing i need is
 

1511
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,310
and i'm like well first thing i need is
a login page

1512
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
a login page
 

1513
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,710
a login page
and i'm like how to make a login page in

1514
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
and i'm like how to make a login page in
 

1515
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,990
and i'm like how to make a login page in
swift

1516
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
swift
 

1517
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,430
swift
i mean it's that easy if someone this

1518
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
i mean it's that easy if someone this
 

1519
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,029
i mean it's that easy if someone this
has been done before of course and the

1520
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
has been done before of course and the
 

1521
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,630
has been done before of course and the
first page that pops up was probably a

1522
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
first page that pops up was probably a
 

1523
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,070
first page that pops up was probably a
pretty damn good page

1524
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,080
pretty damn good page
 

1525
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,390
pretty damn good page
it wasn't that bad it wasn't perfect but

1526
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400
it wasn't that bad it wasn't perfect but
 

1527
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,110
it wasn't that bad it wasn't perfect but
like

1528
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120
like
 

1529
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,950
like
maybe it got me 80 of the way there yeah

1530
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
maybe it got me 80 of the way there yeah
 

1531
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,870
maybe it got me 80 of the way there yeah
and then i came into some bugs

1532
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:34,880
and then i came into some bugs
 

1533
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,710
and then i came into some bugs
and then you know i asked stack overflow

1534
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
and then you know i asked stack overflow
 

1535
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,990
and then you know i asked stack overflow
a few questions

1536
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
a few questions
 

1537
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,909
a few questions
and then i got a little further and then

1538
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
and then i got a little further and then
 

1539
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,750
and then i got a little further and then
i found some more bugs and then i'm like

1540
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
i found some more bugs and then i'm like
 

1541
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,789
i found some more bugs and then i'm like
maybe this isn't the right way to do

1542
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
maybe this isn't the right way to do
 

1543
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,470
maybe this isn't the right way to do
maybe i should do it this way and yeah

1544
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
maybe i should do it this way and yeah
 

1545
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,149
maybe i should do it this way and yeah
i'm sure my code isn't great

1546
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
i'm sure my code isn't great
 

1547
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,430
i'm sure my code isn't great
but the goal isn't to make great code

1548
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,440
but the goal isn't to make great code
 

1549
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,789
but the goal isn't to make great code
the great wasn't the goal wasn't to make

1550
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
the great wasn't the goal wasn't to make
 

1551
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,070
the great wasn't the goal wasn't to make
scalable code it was to

1552
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080
scalable code it was to
 

1553
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,710
scalable code it was to
understand is this something my friends

1554
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
understand is this something my friends
 

1555
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,350
understand is this something my friends
will use

1556
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360
will use
 

1557
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,029
will use
like what is the reaction going to be if

1558
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
like what is the reaction going to be if
 

1559
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,630
like what is the reaction going to be if
i put it in their hands and

1560
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
i put it in their hands and
 

1561
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,950
i put it in their hands and
am i capable of making this thing and

1562
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
am i capable of making this thing and
 

1563
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,669
am i capable of making this thing and
that's awesome

1564
00:24:59,669 --> 00:24:59,679
that's awesome
 

1565
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,590
that's awesome
and so you're focusing on the the

1566
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
and so you're focusing on the the
 

1567
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,950
and so you're focusing on the the
experience like actually

1568
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:02,960
experience like actually
 

1569
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,950
experience like actually
just really driving towards that first

1570
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
just really driving towards that first
 

1571
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,029
just really driving towards that first
step figuring out the first step and

1572
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
step figuring out the first step and
 

1573
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,630
step figuring out the first step and
really driving towards it of course you

1574
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
really driving towards it of course you
 

1575
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,909
really driving towards it of course you
have to also figure out

1576
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
have to also figure out
 

1577
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,789
have to also figure out
like concept of like storage like

1578
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
like concept of like storage like
 

1579
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,669
like concept of like storage like
database

1580
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
database
 

1581
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,430
database
you know something funny what's that i

1582
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
you know something funny what's that i
 

1583
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,590
you know something funny what's that i
just made the database structure with no

1584
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
just made the database structure with no
 

1585
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,830
just made the database structure with no
knowledge of databases whatsoever

1586
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:19,840
knowledge of databases whatsoever
 

1587
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,669
knowledge of databases whatsoever
and i start showing it to my friends who

1588
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:21,679
and i start showing it to my friends who
 

1589
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,870
and i start showing it to my friends who
have an experience in cs and they're

1590
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
have an experience in cs and they're
 

1591
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,350
have an experience in cs and they're
like

1592
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,360
like
 

1593
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,110
like
you used a heap that's so interesting

1594
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
you used a heap that's so interesting
 

1595
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,430
you used a heap that's so interesting
you're like why did you decide to

1596
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
you're like why did you decide to
 

1597
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,029
you're like why did you decide to
store it in this way i'm like bro i

1598
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
store it in this way i'm like bro i
 

1599
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,390
store it in this way i'm like bro i
don't even know what a heap is yeah

1600
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400

 

1601
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,029

i just did it because it works like i'm

1602
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
i just did it because it works like i'm
 

1603
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,230
i just did it because it works like i'm
trying to make calls and stuff and

1604
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
trying to make calls and stuff and
 

1605
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,029
trying to make calls and stuff and
they're like

1606
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
they're like
 

1607
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,789
they're like
uh yeah they're like the hierarchy is

1608
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
uh yeah they're like the hierarchy is
 

1609
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,710
uh yeah they're like the hierarchy is
really like i'm like what

1610
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
really like i'm like what
 

1611
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,470
really like i'm like what
there's a deep profound lesson in there

1612
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
there's a deep profound lesson in there
 

1613
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,390
there's a deep profound lesson in there
that i don't know how much you've

1614
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
that i don't know how much you've
 

1615
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,909
that i don't know how much you've
interacted with computer science people

1616
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
interacted with computer science people
 

1617
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,950
interacted with computer science people
since but

1618
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
since but
 

1619
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,710
since but
they tend to optimize and have these

1620
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
they tend to optimize and have these
 

1621
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,630
they tend to optimize and have these
kind of discussions and what leads

1622
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
kind of discussions and what leads
 

1623
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,269
kind of discussions and what leads
what results is over optimization it's

1624
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
what results is over optimization it's
 

1625
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,870
what results is over optimization it's
like worrying is this really the right

1626
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
like worrying is this really the right
 

1627
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,710
like worrying is this really the right
way to do it and then you go

1628
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
way to do it and then you go
 

1629
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,310
way to do it and then you go
as opposed to doing the first thing on

1630
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
as opposed to doing the first thing on
 

1631
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,630
as opposed to doing the first thing on
stack overflow you go down this like

1632
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
stack overflow you go down this like
 

1633
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,430
stack overflow you go down this like
rabbit hole of what's the actual proper

1634
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
rabbit hole of what's the actual proper
 

1635
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,710
rabbit hole of what's the actual proper
way to do it

1636
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
way to do it
 

1637
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,630
way to do it
and then you're like you wake up five

1638
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
and then you're like you wake up five
 

1639

that
that's a really deep lesson like just

1650
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
that's a really deep lesson like just
 

1651
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,510
that's a really deep lesson like just
get it done

1652
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
get it done
 

1653
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,870
get it done
and and there's like what what's a heat

1654
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
and and there's like what what's a heat

is is the right that should be a t-shirt

1658
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
is is the right that should be a t-shirt
 

1659
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,269
is is the right that should be a t-shirt
uh

1660
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:25,279
uh
 

1661
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,110
uh
that that's really the right approach to

1662
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
that that's really the right approach to
 

1663
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,549
that that's really the right approach to
building something that

1664
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
building something that
 

1665
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,830
building something that
ultimately creates an experience and

1666
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
ultimately creates an experience and
 

1667
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,310
ultimately creates an experience and
then you

1668
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
then you
 

1669
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,710
then you
iterate eventually that's how the great

1670
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
iterate eventually that's how the great
 

1671
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,310
iterate eventually that's how the great
some of the greatest software products

1672
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,320
some of the greatest software products
 

1673
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,750
some of the greatest software products
in this world have been built

1674
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:37,760
in this world have been built
 

1675
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,630
in this world have been built
as you create it quickly and then just

1676
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
as you create it quickly and then just
 

1677
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,750
as you create it quickly and then just
iterate

1678
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
iterate
 

1679
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,830
iterate
what was by the way in your mind the

1680
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:43,840
what was by the way in your mind the
 

1681
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,909
what was by the way in your mind the
thing that you're chasing as a

1682
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
thing that you're chasing as a
 

1683
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,909
thing that you're chasing as a
prototype like what what was the first

1684
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
prototype like what what was the first
 

1685
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,590
prototype like what what was the first
step that it feels like something is

1686
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
step that it feels like something is
 

1687
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,549
step that it feels like something is
working

1688
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
working
 

1689
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,149
working
like do you see you interacting with

1690
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159
like do you see you interacting with
 

1691
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,149
like do you see you interacting with
another friend

1692
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
another friend
 

1693
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,909
another friend
yeah i think the first step was like

1694
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
yeah i think the first step was like
 

1695
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,269
yeah i think the first step was like
it's one thing to tell someone about an

1696
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:01,279
it's one thing to tell someone about an
 

1697
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,630
it's one thing to tell someone about an
idea but it's another thing to put in

1698
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
idea but it's another thing to put in
 

1699
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,950
idea but it's another thing to put in
their hands and kind of see like

1700
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
their hands and kind of see like
 

1701
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,710
their hands and kind of see like
the way their their eyes kind of look um

1702
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
the way their their eyes kind of look um
 

1703
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,950
the way their their eyes kind of look um
and when i'd go i'd walk around across

1704
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
and when i'd go i'd walk around across
 

1705
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,990
and when i'd go i'd walk around across
campus which is

1706
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
campus which is
 

1707
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,909
campus which is
part of yale and i'd literally just go

1708
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
part of yale and i'd literally just go
 

1709
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,269
part of yale and i'd literally just go
up to people and run up to them and be

1710
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
up to people and run up to them and be
 

1711
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,549
up to people and run up to them and be
like try this try this you got to try

1712
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
like try this try this you got to try
 

1713
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:16,870
like try this try this you got to try
this

1714

this
 

1715
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,230
this
this is pre-quarantined by the way of

1716
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
this is pre-quarantined by the way of
 

1717
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,990
this is pre-quarantined by the way of
course this would never

1718
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000

 

1719
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,669

like what is it and i'd be like and i'll

1720
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
like what is it and i'd be like and i'll
 

1721
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,789
like what is it and i'd be like and i'll
explain it's like an anonymous

1722
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
explain it's like an anonymous
 

1723
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,750
explain it's like an anonymous
discussion feed

1724
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
discussion feed
 

1725
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,630
discussion feed
for a yale campus yeah and you see their

1726
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
for a yale campus yeah and you see their
 

1727
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,669
for a yale campus yeah and you see their
gears turning

1728
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
gears turning
 

1729
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,590
gears turning
and they just some people would be like

1730
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600
and they just some people would be like
 

1731
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,350
and they just some people would be like
not interested yeah i'm like fine not

1732
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
not interested yeah i'm like fine not
 

1733
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,990
not interested yeah i'm like fine not
your target

1734
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
your target
 

1735
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,190
your target
demographic i get it you'll come

1736
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,200
demographic i get it you'll come
 

1737
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,430
demographic i get it you'll come
eventually um but some people

1738
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440
eventually um but some people
 

1739
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,430
eventually um but some people
like you could see it they got it

1740
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,440
like you could see it they got it
 

1741
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,070
like you could see it they got it
they're like yes

1742
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,080
they're like yes
 

1743
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,149
they're like yes
and that's when i was like okay okay

1744
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
and that's when i was like okay okay
 

1745
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,549
and that's when i was like okay okay
there is and you don't need

1746
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
there is and you don't need
 

1747
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,269
there is and you don't need
i mean you don't need fifty percent of

1748
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:49,279
i mean you don't need fifty percent of
 

1749
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,230
i mean you don't need fifty percent of
people to like it

1750
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,240
people to like it
 

1751
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,470
people to like it
yeah you need what five percent ten

1752
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
yeah you need what five percent ten
 

1753
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,430
yeah you need what five percent ten
percent to love it

1754
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
percent to love it
 

1755
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,950
percent to love it
and then they'll tell five percent ten

1756
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
and then they'll tell five percent ten
 

1757
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,710
and then they'll tell five percent ten
percent yeah word of mouth yeah

1758
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:56,720
percent yeah word of mouth yeah
 

1759
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,070
percent yeah word of mouth yeah
and you're good um of course the first

1760
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
and you're good um of course the first
 

1761
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,710
and you're good um of course the first
version was

1762
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
version was
 

1763
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,870
version was
very very crappy but seeing people

1764
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
very very crappy but seeing people
 

1765
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,029
very very crappy but seeing people
trying despite all the crappiness wasn't

1766
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039
trying despite all the crappiness wasn't
 

1767
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,630
trying despite all the crappiness wasn't
it was sort of enough to be the first

1768
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
it was sort of enough to be the first
 

1769
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,510
it was sort of enough to be the first
step and

1770
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
step and
 

1771
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,510
step and
you know since since then all of my

1772
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:09,520
you know since since then all of my
 

1773
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,789
you know since since then all of my
code's been stripped out

1774
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
code's been stripped out
 

1775
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,830
code's been stripped out
i now um have friends who

1776
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
i now um have friends who
 

1777
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,350
i now um have friends who
basically have told me don't bother with

1778
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360
basically have told me don't bother with
 

1779
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,029
basically have told me don't bother with
the coding part you do you do the rest

1780
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
the coding part you do you do the rest
 

1781
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,310
the coding part you do you do the rest
you just make sure that we can code

1782
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,320
you just make sure that we can code
 

1783
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,590
you just make sure that we can code
because they want to code

1784
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
because they want to code
 

1785
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,750
because they want to code
great i mean i'm not an engineer yeah i

1786
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
great i mean i'm not an engineer yeah i
 

1787
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,950
great i mean i'm not an engineer yeah i
never intended to be an engineer and

1788
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
never intended to be an engineer and
 

1789
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,909
never intended to be an engineer and
there's a lot to do that's not

1790
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919
there's a lot to do that's not
 

1791
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:24,630
there's a lot to do that's not

interesting i had a

2524
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:14,640
interesting i had a
 

2525
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,630
interesting i had a
discussion about with naval about this

2526
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
discussion about with naval about this
 

2527
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,550
discussion about with naval about this
actually with a few others

2528
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
actually with a few others
 

2529
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,670
actually with a few others
that have a very clear distinction

2530
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:21,680
that have a very clear distinction
 

2531
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,230
that have a very clear distinction
between public and private

2532
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,240
between public and private
 

2533
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,069
between public and private
something i'm struggling with by the way

2534
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:26,079
something i'm struggling with by the way
 

2535
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:32,309
something i'm struggling with by the way
personally i'm thinking about

2536
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:32,319

 

2537
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,270

so one on the very basic surface level

2538
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,280
so one on the very basic surface level
 

2539
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,589
so one on the very basic surface level
is

2540
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
is
 

2541
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,510
is
uh if you carry with yourself lies

2542
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
uh if you carry with yourself lies
 

2543
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,109
uh if you carry with yourself lies
small lies or big lies it's extra mental

2544
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:43,119
small lies or big lies it's extra mental
 

2545
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,150
small lies or big lies it's extra mental
effort

2546
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
effort
 

2547
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,670
effort
to remember what you uh

2548
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:47,680
to remember what you uh
 

2549
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,069
to remember what you uh
like to remember what you're supposed to

2550
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:50,079
like to remember what you're supposed to
 

2551
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,990
like to remember what you're supposed to
say not supposed to say

2552
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,000
say not supposed to say
 

2553
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,550
say not supposed to say
so that's on a very surface level of

2554
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,560
so that's on a very surface level of
 

2555
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,430
so that's on a very surface level of
like it's just

2556
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
like it's just
 

2557
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,910
like it's just
easier to live life when you're have the

2558
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:57,920
easier to live life when you're have the
 

2559
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,750
easier to live life when you're have the
smaller the gap between the private you

2560
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
smaller the gap between the private you
 

2561
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,750
smaller the gap between the private you
and the public you

2562
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
and the public you
 

2563
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,190
and the public you
and the second is

2564
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
and the second is
 

2565
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,510
and the second is
i think for me from an engineering

2566
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
i think for me from an engineering
 

2567
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,190
i think for me from an engineering
perspective

2568
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,200
perspective
 

2569
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,790
perspective
like if i'm dishonest with others

2570
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:12,800
like if i'm dishonest with others
 

2571
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,349
like if i'm dishonest with others
i will too quickly become dishonest with

2572
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
i will too quickly become dishonest with
 

2573
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,870
i will too quickly become dishonest with
myself

2574
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
myself
 

2575
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,910
myself
and in so doing i will not truly be able

2576
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
and in so doing i will not truly be able
 

2577
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,750
and in so doing i will not truly be able
to think deeply about the world and come

2578
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:21,760
to think deeply about the world and come
 

2579
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,069
to think deeply about the world and come
up

2580
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
up
 

2581
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,550
up
and build revolutionary ideas there's

2582
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:24,560
and build revolutionary ideas there's
 

2583
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,109
and build revolutionary ideas there's
something about honesty that feels like

2584
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119
something about honesty that feels like
 

2585
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,790
something about honesty that feels like
it's that first principles thinking

it's that first principles thinking
 

2587
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,630
it's that first principles thinking
that's almost like overused as a term

2588
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:30,640
that's almost like overused as a term
 

2589
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,510
that's almost like overused as a term
but

2590
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520
but
 

2591
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,190
but
it feels like that requires radical

2592
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
it feels like that requires radical
 

2593
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,630
it feels like that requires radical
honesty not radical asshole-ishness

2594
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:36,640
honesty not radical asshole-ishness

it's hard to know what to do but i think
as much as possible as an individual you

as much as possible as an individual you
should try to be honest

2866
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
should try to be honest

more polished
 

2873
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,150
more polished
and that being more polished turns into

2874
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
and that being more polished turns into
 

2875
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,190
and that being more polished turns into
a politician

2876
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200
a politician

and so there's both discussions about
 

3077
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,470
and so there's both discussions about
the deep like

3078
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:42,480
the deep like
 

3079
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,190
the deep like
community issues within colombia or yale

3080
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
community issues within colombia or yale
 

3081
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,549
community issues within colombia or yale
or so on

3082
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
or so on
 

3083
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,630
or so on
dartmouth and there's also the broader

3084
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
dartmouth and there's also the broader
 

3085
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,710
dartmouth and there's also the broader
community of the ivy leagues that people

3086
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
community of the ivy leagues that people
 

3087
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,470
community of the ivy leagues that people
are discussing but i could see that

3088
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
are discussing but i could see that
 

3089
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:54,870
are discussing but i could see that
actually

3090
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:54,880
actually
 

3091
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,190
actually
expanding more and more and more but

3092
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,200
expanding more and more and more but
 

3093
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,589
expanding more and more and more but
which is it's a powerful coupling

3094
00:49:59,589 --> 00:49:59,599
which is it's a powerful coupling
 

3095
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,990
which is it's a powerful coupling
which is the feeling of like this little

3096
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,000
which is the feeling of like this little
 

3097
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,430
which is the feeling of like this little
village this little community we're

3098
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,440
village this little community we're
 

3099
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,630
village this little community we're
building together

3100
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
building together
 

3101
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,349
building together
but also the broader issues yeah so you

3102
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:07,359
but also the broader issues yeah so you
 

3103
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,309
but also the broader issues yeah so you
could do both

3104
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:08,319
could do both
 

3105
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,309
could do both
discussions one thing that was important

3106
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:10,319
discussions one thing that was important
 

3107
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,670
discussions one thing that was important
to me is

3108
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:11,680
to me is
 

3109
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,309
to me is
talking about social media as a concept

3110
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
talking about social media as a concept
 

3111
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,390
talking about social media as a concept
right

3112
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:16,400
right
 

3113
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,870
right
i think the way people socialize is very

3114
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880
i think the way people socialize is very
 

3115
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,870
i think the way people socialize is very
much context dependent

3116
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:20,880
much context dependent
 

3117
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,430
much context dependent
so we're talking about people

3118
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:23,440
so we're talking about people
 

3119
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,390
so we're talking about people
understanding each other

3120
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
understanding each other
 

3121
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,430
understanding each other
through language through english yes and

3122
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:27,440
through language through english yes and
 

3123
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,710
through language through english yes and
these languages are constructed

3124
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:30,720
these languages are constructed
 

3125
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,230
these languages are constructed
very in a very nuanced way in a very

3126
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
very in a very nuanced way in a very
 

3127
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,670
very in a very nuanced way in a very
sort of temperamental way right and

3128
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:37,680
sort of temperamental way right and
 

3129
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,430
sort of temperamental way right and
you kind of need a similar context to be

3130
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
you kind of need a similar context to be
 

3131
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,910
you kind of need a similar context to be
able to have productive conversations

3132
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:41,920
able to have productive conversations
 

3133
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,829
able to have productive conversations
so to me it's really important that

3134
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:43,839
so to me it's really important that
 

3135
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,670
so to me it's really important that
these these groups

3136
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
these these groups
 

3137
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,750
these these groups
they share people something in common a

3138
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:47,760
they share people something in common a
 

3139
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,430
they share people something in common a
really big lived experience the ivy

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,510
to then connect and meet space in
physical space

physical space
 

3193
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,870
physical space
so the i guess the sort of magic of it

for
 

3601
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,430
for
an app like librex with its

3602

you know and like you said i think
 

3611
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,829
you know and like you said i think
beautifully anonymity is not the core

3612
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:51,839
beautifully anonymity is not the core
 

3613
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:52,789
beautifully anonymity is not the core
value

3614
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:52,799
value
 

3615
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,990
value
it's just the tool you use and

3616
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,000
it's just the tool you use and
 

3617
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,390
it's just the tool you use and
who knows maybe anonymity will not

3618
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:58,400
who knows maybe anonymity will not
 

3619
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,150
who knows maybe anonymity will not

like if you give people the choice who
 

3623
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,670
like if you give people the choice who
knows what this evolves

3624
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:03,680
knows what this evolves
 

3625
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,349

from the login page you initially

3626
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:05,359
from the login page you initially
 

3627
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,349
from the login page you initially
created the key thing is the founding

3628
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
created the key thing is the founding
 

3629
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,069
created the key thing is the founding
principles

3630
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:08,079
principles
 

3631
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,390
principles
and again who knows if you give people a

3632
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
and again who knows if you give people a
 

3633
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,150
and again who knows if you give people a
really nice way to monetize their data

3634
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160
really nice way to monetize their data
 

3635

so the way i think about it is we have
 

3765

so the way i think about it is we have
these

these
 

3767
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,470
these
principles um they're pretty simple and

3768
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,480
principles um they're pretty simple and
 

3769
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,870
principles um they're pretty simple and
they're pretty easy to enforce and then

3770
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:36,880
they're pretty easy to enforce and then
 

3771
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,470
they're pretty easy to enforce and then
beyond the principles we have

3772
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
beyond the principles we have
 

3773
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,230
beyond the principles we have
a set of moderators moderate from every

the principles
 

3783
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,750
the principles
but kind of clue us in to what's

3784
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760
but kind of clue us in to what's

feel strongly about
and then also ones that are a little

01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:55,599
and then also ones that are a little
 

3861
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,190
and then also ones that are a little
more murky where we want to see that

3862
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:57,200
more murky where we want to see that
 

3863
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,470
more murky where we want to see that
they're sort of thinking about these

what do you see your your role as
libraries grows

3954
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:30,400
libraries grows
 

3955
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,430
libraries grows
and in general what are the mechanisms

3956
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
and in general what are the mechanisms
 

3957
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,829
and in general what are the mechanisms
of scaling here for moderation

3958
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:35,839
of scaling here for moderation
 

3959
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,230
of scaling here for moderation
so i see it open discourse is

3960
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
so i see it open discourse is
 

3961
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,510
so i see it open discourse is
fundamental to

3962
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:39,520
fundamental to

01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,950
fundamental to

i guess you could say founder ceo what

3966
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:45,359
i guess you could say founder ceo what
 

3967
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,109
i guess you could say founder ceo what
have you

3968
01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:47,119
have you
 

3969
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,309
have you
part of my purpose has to be to enforce

3970
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:50,319
part of my purpose has to be to enforce
 

3971
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,029
part of my purpose has to be to enforce
the

3972
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
the
 

3973
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,710
the
vision right and part of the vision is

3974
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:52,720
vision right and part of the vision is
 

3975
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,710
vision right and part of the vision is
open discourse and that does come down

3976
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,720
open discourse and that does come down
 

3977
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,670
open discourse and that does come down
in part to reasonable moderation and

3978
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:57,680
in part to reasonable moderation and
 

3979
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,630
in part to reasonable moderation and
community-guided

3980
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:58,640
community-guided
 

3981
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,190
community-guided
reasonable moderation so i imagine that

3982
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:01,200
reasonable moderation so i imagine that
 

3983
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,950
reasonable moderation so i imagine that
will always be something that i'm

3984
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:02,960
will always be something that i'm
 

3985
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,670
will always be something that i'm
intimately involved with to some degree

3986
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
intimately involved with to some degree
 

3987
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:05,990
intimately involved with to some degree
now

3988
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,000
now
 

3989
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,950
now
the degree to which the way in which

that
 

3993
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,549
that
manifests i imagine will have to change

3994
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:12,559
manifests i imagine will have to change
 

3995
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:13,589
manifests i imagine will have to change
right

3996
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
right
 

3997
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,630
right
um and hopefully i'll be able to

who understand
the the way that we are sort of

01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
the the way that we are sort of
 

4009
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,150
the the way that we are sort of

4014
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:31,760
moderation and there can be a sort of
 

4015
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,589
moderation and there can be a sort of
hierarchical structure

4016
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:33,599
hierarchical structure
 

4017
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,230
hierarchical structure
but i think when you have a product

different ways i think that

4048
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
different ways i think that
 

4049
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,750
different ways i think that
because he might have abdicated quite a

4050
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:03,760
because he might have abdicated quite a
 

4051
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,230
because he might have abdicated quite a
bit of the details there hard for me to

4052
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,240
bit of the details there hard for me to
 

4053
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:06,710
bit of the details there hard for me to
say

4054
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:06,720
say
 

4055
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,789
say
because the amazon does so many things i

4056
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:08,799
because the amazon does so many things i
 

4057
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,150
because the amazon does so many things i
think the probably the better examples

4058
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,160
think the probably the better examples
 

4059
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,230
think the probably the better examples
like elon with rock is he's still

4060
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:12,240
like elon with rock is he's still
 

4061
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,789
like elon with rock is he's still
at the core of the engineering he's at

4062
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
at the core of the engineering he's at
 

4063
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,309
at the core of the engineering he's at
the core of the engineering there's

4064
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:16,319
the core of the engineering there's
 

4065
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,069
the core of the engineering there's
some fundamental questions he probably

4066
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:18,079
some fundamental questions he probably
 

4067
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,150
some fundamental questions he probably
does way too much of the engineering

4068
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,160
does way too much of the engineering
 

4069
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,870
does way too much of the engineering
like he's like the lowest level detail

4070
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,880
like he's like the lowest level detail
 

4071
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,470
like he's like the lowest level detail
but you're saying like the core

4072
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:24,480
but you're saying like the core
 

4073
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,630
but you're saying like the core
things that are that make the app work

4074
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:26,640
things that are that make the app work
 

4075
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,230
things that are that make the app work

conversations and by the way
i'm 21 years old let's remind us

4082
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,000
i'm 21 years old let's remind us
 

4083

how to run a business that is worth
 

4107

and i imagine that i'll learn so much

4126
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:18,880
and i imagine that i'll learn so much
 

4127
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,870
and i imagine that i'll learn so much
more i just know that

4128
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:20,880
more i just know that
 

4129
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,150
more i just know that

moderation is always going to be
important to me because i don't think

4132
01:07:24,549 --> 01:07:24,559
important to me because i don't think
 

4133
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,789
important to me because i don't think

01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,349
three words that people have been
tossing around and politicizing i would

for this conversation down the rabbit

4178
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,480
for this conversation down the rabbit
 

4179
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:12,870
for this conversation down the rabbit
hole

4180
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:12,880
hole
 

4181
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,110
hole
of like just how unclear it is

4182
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:16,120
of like just how unclear it is
 

4183
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,470
of like just how unclear it is
philosophically what is meant by this

4184
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
philosophically what is meant by this
 

4185
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,390
philosophically what is meant by this
kind of freedom

4186
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,400
kind of freedom
 

4187
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,470
kind of freedom
uh it's not as easy as people think but

4188
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:24,480
uh it's not as easy as people think but
 

4189
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,390
uh it's not as easy as people think but
it's interesting pragmatically speaking

4190
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:26,400
it's interesting pragmatically speaking
 

4191
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,749
it's interesting pragmatically speaking
to hear what how you

4192
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:27,759
to hear what how you
 

4193
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,110
to hear what how you
think about it in the context of librex

4194
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
think about it in the context of librex
 

4195
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,590
think about it in the context of librex
yeah it's a tough one right there's a

4196
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:33,600
yeah it's a tough one right there's a
 

4197
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,550
yeah it's a tough one right there's a
lot there

4198
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:34,560
lot there
 

4199
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,110
lot there
so i come from the background of being a

4200
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:37,120
so i come from the background of being a
 

4201
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,030
so i come from the background of being a
math major

4202
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:39,040
math major
 

4203
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,709
math major
maybe it's important to start with that

4204
01:08:40,709 --> 01:08:40,719
maybe it's important to start with that
 

4205
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,590
maybe it's important to start with that

no bs crap you know stuff
and so to me the easiest way to moderate

4340
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:10,320
and so to me the easiest way to moderate
 

4341
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,030
and so to me the easiest way to moderate
around that

4342
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:11,040
around that
 

4343
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,270
around that
because as you said figuring out what is

4344
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:13,280
because as you said figuring out what is
 

4345
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,550
because as you said figuring out what is
hateful and what is hate speech is

4346
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:14,560
hateful and what is hate speech is
 

4347
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,350
hateful and what is hate speech is
really hard

4348
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,360

and that seems to work on the whole

4354
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,800
and that seems to work on the whole
 

4355
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,630
and that seems to work on the whole
pretty well to be pretty light

coordinating groups right

4372
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:39,440
coordinating groups right
 

4373
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,430
coordinating groups right
oftentimes these are these are sort of

4374
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:41,440
oftentimes these are these are sort of
 

4375
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,790
oftentimes these are these are sort of
hackneyed subjects these are things that

4376
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
hackneyed subjects these are things that
 

4377
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,270
hackneyed subjects these are things that
have been

4378
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:43,280
have been
 

4379
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,149
have been
broached and we've heard them before

4380
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:46,159
broached and we've heard them before
 

4381
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,350
broached and we've heard them before
they don't really lead anywhere

4382
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:47,360
they don't really lead anywhere
 

4383
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,550
they don't really lead anywhere
productive

4385
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,870
productive
so we so it goes under this principle of

4386
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
so we so it goes under this principle of
 

4387
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,310
so we so it goes under this principle of
be specific in the ideas you're

4388
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
be specific in the ideas you're
 

4389
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,750
be specific in the ideas you're
discussing

4390
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:53,760
discussing
 

4391
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,149

very few words but the community gets it

4414
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:22,880
very few words but the community gets it
 

4415
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,270
very few words but the community gets it
you know

4416
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
you know
 

4417
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,110
you know
yeah they get it i mean this the thing

4418
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,120
yeah they get it i mean this the thing
 

4419
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,709
yeah they get it i mean this the thing
they they um

4420

they they um
 

4421
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,830
they they um
the the trouble with rules is uh

4422
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:29,840
the the trouble with rules is uh
 

4423
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,750
the the trouble with rules is uh
as the community grows they'll figure

4424
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:31,760
as the community grows they'll figure
 

4425
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,910
as the community grows they'll figure
out ways to manipulate the rules

4426
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:33,920
out ways to manipulate the rules
 

4427
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,350
out ways to manipulate the rules
absolutely it's human nature it's

4428
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
absolutely it's human nature it's
 

4429
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,110
absolutely it's human nature it's
creativity yeah

4430
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,120
creativity yeah
 

4431
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,669
creativity yeah
something beautiful about it of course

4432
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:39,679
something beautiful about it of course
 

4433
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,110
something beautiful about it of course
unlike and from an evolutionary

4434
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:41,120
unlike and from an evolutionary
 

4435
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,709
unlike and from an evolutionary
perspective yes yeah the fact that

4436
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:42,719
perspective yes yeah the fact that
 

4437
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:43,430
perspective yes yeah the fact that
people are

4438
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
people are
 

4439
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,229
people are
so creative and so looking to and

4440
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
so creative and so looking to and
 

4441
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,149
so creative and so looking to and
because people are genuinely interested

4442
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
because people are genuinely interested
 

4443
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,510
because people are genuinely interested
in figuring out these things about

4444
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:49,520
in figuring out these things about
 

4445
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,669
in figuring out these things about
social media and so they'll

4446
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:51,679
social media and so they'll
 

4447
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,590
social media and so they'll
100 percent like see like where's the

4448
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:53,600
100 percent like see like where's the
 

4449
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,590
100 percent like see like where's the
edge and i mean part of that's

4450
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,600
edge and i mean part of that's
 

4451
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,270
edge and i mean part of that's
maintaining some level of vagueness in

4452
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,280
maintaining some level of vagueness in
 

4453
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,590
maintaining some level of vagueness in
your role set yeah which has its own

4454
01:12:59,590 --> 01:12:59,600
your role set yeah which has its own
 

4455
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,510
your role set yeah which has its own
set of questions and something we could

4456
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520
set of questions and something we could
 

4457
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,430
set of questions and something we could
think about and i'm not implying i have

4458
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
think about and i'm not implying i have
 

4459
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,390
think about and i'm not implying i have
all the answers

4460
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
all the answers
 

4461
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,270
all the answers
but there is something really

4462
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,280
but there is something really
 

4463
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,709
but there is something really
interesting about people being so

4464
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
interesting about people being so
 

4465
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:07,590
interesting about people being so
engaged

engaged
 

4467
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,590
engaged
that they're looking to figure out where

4468
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:09,600
that they're looking to figure out where
 

4469
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,590
that they're looking to figure out where
those edges and what does that mean

4470
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:11,600
those edges and what does that mean
 

4471
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,550
those edges and what does that mean
what does that edge mean you know so one

4472
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
what does that edge mean you know so one
 

4473
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,350

life
 

4579
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,350

where you're in meat space
 

4583
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,189
where you're in meat space
you might be actually becoming

4584
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
you might be actually becoming
 

4585
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,950
you might be actually becoming

successful and so on and growing and so
 

4587
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,550

4589
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,229
on but you just need sometimes to be
angry at somebody

he's very he has a very particular way
of saying things

4694
01:16:58,709 --> 01:16:58,719
of saying things
 

4695
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,229
of saying things
but you get the impression that he's

4696
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239
but you get the impression that he's
 

4697
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:01,669
but you get the impression that he's
someone who actually cares about these

4698
01:17:01,669 --> 01:17:01,679
someone who actually cares about these
 

4699
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,510
someone who actually cares about these
things within the limits of his power

4700
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:03,520
things within the limits of his power
 

4701
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,669
things within the limits of his power
yeah and that's the question the limits

4702
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679
yeah and that's the question the limits
 

4703
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,030
yeah and that's the question the limits
of the power

4704
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,040
of the power
 

4705
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,149
of the power
librex is growing not just in the number

4706
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
librex is growing not just in the number
 

4707
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,590
librex is growing not just in the number
of communities

4708
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:11,600
of communities
 

4709
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,470
of communities
but also in the way you're incentivizing

4710
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,480
but also in the way you're incentivizing
 

4711
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,630
but also in the way you're incentivizing
positive conversations like coupled with

4712
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:18,640
positive conversations like coupled with
 

4713
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,390
positive conversations like coupled with
the moderation and so on so you think

4714
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:20,400
the moderation and so on so you think
 

4715
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,990
the moderation and so on so you think
there's a lot of innovation to be had in

4716
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,000
there's a lot of innovation to be had in
 

4717
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,070
there's a lot of innovation to be had in
that area there's a tremendous amount

4718
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,080
that area there's a tremendous amount
 

4719
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,630
that area there's a tremendous amount
i think when you think about the reasons

4720
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:26,640
i think when you think about the reasons

part of the benefit of
 

4733
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,350
part of the benefit of
sort of our moderation structure is that

4734
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:39,360
sort of our moderation structure is that
 

4735
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,189
sort of our moderation structure is that
we can limit some of those bad actors

4736

we can limit some of those bad actors
 

4737

we can limit some of those bad actors
you know no bot accounts no brigading

4738

you know no bot accounts no brigading
 

4739
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,270
you know no bot accounts no brigading
at the same time the more you

4740
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,280
at the same time the more you
 

4741
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,709
at the same time the more you
incentivize a certain type of behavior

4742
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719
incentivize a certain type of behavior
 

4743
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:50,390
incentivize a certain type of behavior
the better it's going to be

4744
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:50,400
the better it's going to be
 

4745
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,149
the better it's going to be
and it's we don't see it as our role as

4746
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:54,159
and it's we don't see it as our role as
 

4747
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,669
and it's we don't see it as our role as
the platform to force the communion

4748
01:17:57,669 --> 01:17:57,679
the platform to force the communion
 

4749
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,590
the platform to force the communion
in a direction and frankly i don't think

4750
01:17:59,590 --> 01:17:59,600
in a direction and frankly i don't think
 

4751
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,030
in a direction and frankly i don't think
it would be good for anyone the

4752
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:01,040
it would be good for anyone the
 

4753
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:01,750
it would be good for anyone the
community

community
 

4755
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,830
community
or the conversations if we forced a

4756
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:03,840
or the conversations if we forced a
 

4757
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,790
or the conversations if we forced a
specific type of

4758
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:04,800
specific type of
 

4759
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,189
specific type of
conversations uh conversation we just

01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,830
that like if you
you don't nee you will not need to

4770
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
you don't nee you will not need to
 

4771
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,470

censor if you allow people

4772
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:18,480
censor if you allow people
 

4773
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,870
censor if you allow people
at scale to be good the good will

4774
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
at scale to be good the good will
 

4775
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,470
at scale to be good the good will

that's that's my fundamental belief i

4778
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:24,400
that's that's my fundamental belief i
 

4779
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,189
that's that's my fundamental belief i
i'm very optimistic about that

4780
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199
i'm very optimistic about that
 

4781
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,910
i'm very optimistic about that
but currently librex is small in the

but currently librex is small in the
 

4783
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,430
but currently librex is small in the

that by design you're scaling slowly

4790
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
that by design you're scaling slowly
 

4791
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:43,270
that by design you're scaling slowly
carefully so how does librex scale is it

4792
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:43,280
carefully so how does librex scale is it
 

4793
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,229
carefully so how does librex scale is it
possible

4794
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:44,239
possible

you know facebook also started with a

you know facebook also started with a

01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,550
you know facebook also started with a

small set of communities
that were schools and then now grew to

4800
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:51,360
that were schools and then now grew to
 

4801
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,070
that were schools and then now grew to
be

4802
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:52,080
be
 

4803
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,950
be
basically the if not one of the largest

do you see librex as potentially scaling

4808
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239
do you see librex as potentially scaling
 

4809
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,990
do you see librex as potentially scaling
to be

4810
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
to be
 

4811
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,270
to be
beyond even college campuses uh but

4812
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:05,280
beyond even college campuses uh but
 

4813
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,229
beyond even college campuses uh but
encompassing the whole world it's a it's

4814
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:08,239
encompassing the whole world it's a it's
 

4815
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,110
encompassing the whole world it's a it's
a long timeline

4816
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:11,120
a long timeline
 

4817
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,750
a long timeline
i'll say this let's get step back to

4818
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:13,760
i'll say this let's get step back to
 

4819
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,350
i'll say this let's get step back to
like

4820
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:15,360
like
 

4821
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,590
like
where did facebook go wrong because

4822
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:17,600
where did facebook go wrong because
 

4823
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,030
where did facebook go wrong because
clearly they did a lot right

4824
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:19,040
clearly they did a lot right
 

4825
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,950
clearly they did a lot right
and we can only we can only speculate

4826
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:22,960
and we can only we can only speculate
 

4827
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,790
and we can only we can only speculate
about what the objectives were of the

4828
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:24,800
about what the objectives were of the
 

4829
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,229
about what the objectives were of the
founders of facebook

4830
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:26,239
founders of facebook
 

4831
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,229
founders of facebook
um you know i'm sure they've said some

4832
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:28,239
um you know i'm sure they've said some
 

4833
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:29,510
um you know i'm sure they've said some
things but

4834
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:29,520
things but
 

4835
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,669
things but
it's always interesting to know what the

4836
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:31,679
it's always interesting to know what the
 

4837
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:32,950
it's always interesting to know what the
what the uh

4838
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
what the uh
 

4839
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,270
what the uh
mythology is versus what the truth is of

4840
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,280
mythology is versus what the truth is of
 

4841
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,470
mythology is versus what the truth is of
the matter

4842
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:36,480
the matter
 

4843
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,229
the matter
so perhaps they and they've been very

4844
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:38,239
so perhaps they and they've been very
 

4845
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,510
so perhaps they and they've been very
successful i mean

4846
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
successful i mean
 

4847
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,590
successful i mean
they they've taken over the world to

4848
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:41,600
they they've taken over the world to
 

4849
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,830
they they've taken over the world to
some extent

4850
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
some extent
 

4851
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,229
some extent
at the same time the goals of librex are

4852
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:46,239
at the same time the goals of librex are
 

4853
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,350
at the same time the goals of librex are

01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:47,360
to create
 

4855
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,669
to create
these positive communities and these

4856
01:19:49,669 --> 01:19:49,679
these positive communities and these
 

4857
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:50,390
these positive communities and these
open

4858
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
open
 

4859
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,870
open
conversations where people can have real

4860
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:52,880
conversations where people can have real
 

4861
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,149
conversations where people can have real
conversation and connection in their

4862
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:54,159
conversation and connection in their
 

4863
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,270
conversation and connection in their
communities in a vulnerable and

4864
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
communities in a vulnerable and
 

4865
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,630
communities in a vulnerable and
authentic way

4866
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
authentic way
 

4867
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,910
authentic way
and so to that end which

4868
01:19:59,910 --> 01:19:59,920
and so to that end which
 

4869
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,950
and so to that end which
i imagine might be different than the

4870
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
i imagine might be different than the
 

4871
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,990
i imagine might be different than the
goals of a facebook

4872
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:04,000
goals of a facebook
 

4873
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,310
goals of a facebook
for example one thing that we want to do

4874
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:06,320
for example one thing that we want to do
 

4875
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,270
for example one thing that we want to do
is keep things intimate and

4876
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,280
is keep things intimate and
 

4877
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,629
is keep things intimate and
community-based

4878
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:08,639
community-based
 

4879
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,629
community-based
so each school is its own community

4880
01:20:12,629 --> 01:20:12,639
so each school is its own community
 

4881
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,470
so each school is its own community
and perhaps you could have a slightly

4882
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:14,480
and perhaps you could have a slightly
 

4883
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,910
and perhaps you could have a slightly
broader community

4884
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:15,920
broader community
 

4885
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,470
broader community
maybe you could have a i know uh the

4886
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
maybe you could have a i know uh the
 

4887
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,229
maybe you could have a i know uh the
california system is an obvious one

4888
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:20,239
california system is an obvious one
 

4889
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,310
california system is an obvious one
pac-10 might be an obvious one

4890
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:22,320
pac-10 might be an obvious one
 

4891
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,870
pac-10 might be an obvious one
and we can think about that um but

4892
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:24,880
and we can think about that um but
 

4893
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,870
and we can think about that um but
fundamentally the unit

4894
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:26,880
fundamentally the unit
 

4895
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,950
fundamentally the unit
the unit of community is your school or

4896
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:28,960
the unit of community is your school or
 

4897
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,070
the unit of community is your school or
your school

4898
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,080
your school
 

4899
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,270
your school
community so that that that's one

4900
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:33,280
community so that that that's one
 

4901
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,790
community so that that that's one
difference that i think will help us the

4902
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,800
difference that i think will help us the
 

4903
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,910
difference that i think will help us the
other thing is that

4904
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
other thing is that
 

4905
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,709
other thing is that
we're scaling intentionally meaning that

4906
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:38,719
we're scaling intentionally meaning that
 

4907
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,070
we're scaling intentionally meaning that
when we expand to a school

4908
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,080
when we expand to a school
 

4909
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,870
when we expand to a school
we have moderators in place we have

4910
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:42,880
we have moderators in place we have
 

4911
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,790
we have moderators in place we have
moderators who understand that school's

4912
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:44,800
moderators who understand that school's
 

4913
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,629
moderators who understand that school's
environment in a very personal

4914
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:46,639
environment in a very personal
 

4915
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,590

we're growing as we're ready
both technologically but also socially

4920
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:53,679
both technologically but also socially
 

4921
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:54,390
both technologically but also socially
you know

4922
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:54,400
you know
 

4923
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,550
you know
but as we think we have the tools to um

4924
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:58,560
but as we think we have the tools to um
 

4925

content that we want them to create
 

4931
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:06,550
content that we want them to create
and you know there's a lot of ways to

01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
and you know there's a lot of ways to
 

4933
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,830
and you know there's a lot of ways to
define communities so

4934
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:07,840
define communities so
 

4935
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,110
define communities so
first of all there's geographic

4936

first of all there's geographic
 

4937
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,950
first of all there's geographic
community as well uh

community as well uh
 

4939
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,189
community as well uh
but the way you're kind of defining

4940
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
but the way you're kind of defining
 

4941
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:14,310

and learn and because that's what we're
 

5007
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,070

5013
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,030
growing it's about
learning from these from each of these

i don't know i didn't look at the
details but i'm guessing there's a bunch

5092
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:51,760
details but i'm guessing there's a bunch

details but i'm guessing there's a bunch
of racism and hate speech and all that

of racism and hate speech and all that

on you okay so that's an example of like

5098
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,360
on you okay so that's an example of like
 

5099
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,830
on you okay so that's an example of like
okay here's how it goes wrong when you

5100
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:01,840
okay here's how it goes wrong when you
 

5101
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,590
okay here's how it goes wrong when you
have anonymity

5102
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:03,600
have anonymity
 

5103
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,790

oftentimes these things are
 

5133
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,910
oftentimes these things are
somewhat unknowable and the the degree

perspective on it
 

5161
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,390
perspective on it
um knowing that i'm also a human with

um i um so i started building librex

5170
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,080
um i um so i started building librex
 

5171
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,709
um i um so i started building librex
for its own merits i i i i at first i

5172
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:12,719
for its own merits i i i i at first i

5235
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,070
is how much power they can have so if
you're predisposed to think in this way

5236
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,080
you're predisposed to think in this way

like the lives of many yeah and if you
think this way

5254
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:46,960
think this way
 

5255
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,070
think this way
it's a problem but i i i i'm hopeful

5256
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,080
it's a problem but i i i i'm hopeful
 

5257
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,149
it's a problem but i i i i'm hopeful
that you're right that in most cases

5258
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:52,159
that you're right that in most cases
 

5259
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,550
that you're right that in most cases
it's going to be a minority of people

5260
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:54,560
it's going to be a minority of people
 

5261
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,910
it's going to be a minority of people
i think it is and that's what the

5262
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:55,920
i think it is and that's what the
 

5263
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,669
i think it is and that's what the
research has showed

5264
01:26:57,669 --> 01:26:57,679
research has showed
 

5265
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,790
research has showed
and one really powerful thing is that

5266
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
and one really powerful thing is that
 

5267
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,990
and one really powerful thing is that
we can really actively control who comes

5268
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:04,000
we can really actively control who comes
 

5269
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,910
we can really actively control who comes
in and out of our community based on the

5270
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
in and out of our community based on the
 

5271
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,870
in and out of our community based on the
edu verification and we can also control

5272
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:08,880
edu verification and we can also control
 

5273
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,550
edu verification and we can also control
who's not in our community because we

5274
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
who's not in our community because we
 

5275
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,310
who's not in our community because we
have that lever where each account is

5276
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,320
have that lever where each account is
 

5277
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,629
have that lever where each account is
associated with it.edu

5278
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:14,639
associated with it.edu
 

5279
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,950
associated with it.edu
um so that's the first point i would put

5280
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:16,960
um so that's the first point i would put
 

5281
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,149
um so that's the first point i would put
out point out there

5282
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:18,159
out point out there
 

5283
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:20,870
out point out there
second point is controlled expansion

5284
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:20,880
second point is controlled expansion
 

5285
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,830
second point is controlled expansion
meaning that

5286
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,840
meaning that
 

5287
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,550
meaning that

it's like if a privately owned highway

5552
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:56,159
it's like if a privately owned highway
 

5553

and a bunch of people in this world
 

5565
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,070
and a bunch of people in this world
would be like yes because

5566
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:08,080
would be like yes because
 

5567
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,950
would be like yes because
electric is good for the environment and

5568
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:10,960
electric is good for the environment and
 

5569
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,590
electric is good for the environment and
uh

5570
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:13,600
uh
 

5571
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,629
uh
you know yes but then

5572
01:32:16,629 --> 01:32:16,639
you know yes but then
 

5573
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,470
you know yes but then
you have to consider the like the

5574
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
you have to consider the like the
 

5575
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,070
you have to consider the like the
slippery slope nature of it

5576
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,080
slippery slope nature of it
 

5577
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,070
slippery slope nature of it
but also like the the negative impact on

5578
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,080
but also like the the negative impact on
 

5579
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,750
but also like the the negative impact on
the lives of many others

5580
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:23,760
the lives of many others
 

5581
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,669
the lives of many others
and what that means for innovation and

5582
01:32:25,669 --> 01:32:25,679
and what that means for innovation and
 

5583
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:26,870
and what that means for innovation and
for like uh

5584
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
for like uh
 

5585
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,870
for like uh
competition again in a capitalistic

5586
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:28,880
competition again in a capitalistic
 

5587
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,110
competition again in a capitalistic
sense so there's some nature

5588
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:31,120
sense so there's some nature
 

5589
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,070
sense so there's some nature
there's some level to this hierarchy of

5590
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
there's some level to this hierarchy of
 

5591
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,189
there's some level to this hierarchy of
our existence

5592
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:35,199
our existence
 

5593
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:39,030
our existence
that we should not allow to manipulate

5594
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:39,040
that we should not allow to manipulate
 

5595
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,790
that we should not allow to manipulate
what's built on top of it it should be

5596
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
what's built on top of it it should be
 

5597
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,070
what's built on top of it it should be
truly infrastructure

5598
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,080
truly infrastructure
 

5599
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,110
truly infrastructure
and it feels like compute is uh

5600
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:45,120
and it feels like compute is uh
 

5601
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,390
and it feels like compute is uh
storage and compute is the that layer

5602
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:48,400
storage and compute is the that layer
 

5603
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,950
storage and compute is the that layer
like it shouldn't be messed with um i

5604
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:50,960
like it shouldn't be messed with um i
 

5605
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,790
like it shouldn't be messed with um i
haven't seen anybody really complain

5606
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:52,800
haven't seen anybody really complain
 

5607
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,629
haven't seen anybody really complain
about it like in terms of government

5608
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:54,639
about it like in terms of government
 

5609
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,390
about it like in terms of government
and i'm not even sure government is the

5610
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:56,400
and i'm not even sure government is the
 

5611
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,310
and i'm not even sure government is the
right mechanism through policy and

5612
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:58,320
right mechanism through policy and
 

5613
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,590
right mechanism through policy and
regulation to step

5614
01:32:59,590 --> 01:32:59,600
regulation to step
 

5615
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,550
regulation to step
in because again they do a messy job of

5616
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:02,560
in because again they do a messy job of
 

5617
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,910
in because again they do a messy job of
fixing things

5618
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:03,920
fixing things
 

5619
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,950
fixing things
but i do hope there's competitors to aws

5620
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:06,960
but i do hope there's competitors to aws
 

5621
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:07,510
but i do hope there's competitors to aws
to make

5622
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,520
to make
 

5623
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,310
to make
aws and step up because i do think you

5624
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320
aws and step up because i do think you
 

5625
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,910
aws and step up because i do think you
know i'm a fan of aws

5626
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:11,920
know i'm a fan of aws
 

5627
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,870
know i'm a fan of aws
except this service it's a good service

5628
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:14,880
except this service it's a good service
 

5629
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,750

until this

5630
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:15,760
until this
 

5631
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,629
until this
until yeah until they rip out the the

5632
01:33:18,629 --> 01:33:18,639
until yeah until they rip out the the
 

5633
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:20,390

rug
 

5635
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,070
rug
and the point is it's not that

5636
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:22,080
and the point is it's not that
 

5637
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,149
and the point is it's not that
necessarily their decision

5638
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
necessarily their decision
 

5639
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,910
necessarily their decision
was a bad one with parlor in particular

5640
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:27,920
was a bad one with parlor in particular
 

5641
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,350
was a bad one with parlor in particular
it's that like the the slippery slope

5642
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:31,360
it's that like the the slippery slope
 

5643
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,350
it's that like the the slippery slope
nature of it but also

5644
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
nature of it but also
 

5645
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,149
nature of it but also
the it takes the good actors that are

5646
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:36,159
the it takes the good actors that are
 

5647
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:37,990
the it takes the good actors that are
creating amazing products and makes them

5648
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,000
creating amazing products and makes them
 

5649
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,189
creating amazing products and makes them
more fearful

5650
01:33:39,189 --> 01:33:39,199
more fearful
 

5651
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:40,709
more fearful
and when you're more fearful it's the

5652
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:40,719
and when you're more fearful it's the
 

5653
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:42,870
and when you're more fearful it's the
same reason that anonymity is a tool

5654
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:42,880
same reason that anonymity is a tool
 

5655
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,709
same reason that anonymity is a tool
that you don't create the best thing you

5656
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:44,719
that you don't create the best thing you
 

5657
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,149
that you don't create the best thing you
could possibly create when you're

5658
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
could possibly create when you're
 

5659
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:47,189
could possibly create when you're
fearful you don't

5660
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
fearful you don't
 

5661
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:50,470
fearful you don't
create that's right i think we kind of

5662
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:50,480
create that's right i think we kind of
 

5663
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,550
create that's right i think we kind of

5731
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:07,430
basically
supporting harvey weinstein right

supporting harvey weinstein right
what do you think about this whole idea

5734
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,040
what do you think about this whole idea
 

5735
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,709
what do you think about this whole idea
of safe spaces

5736
01:35:10,709 --> 01:35:10,719
of safe spaces
 

5737
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:14,149
of safe spaces
uh on college campuses because it feels

5738
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:14,159
uh on college campuses because it feels
 

5739
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,430
uh on college campuses because it feels
like

5740
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,440
like
 

5741
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,910
like
the the mission of librex is pushing

5742
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:17,920
the the mission of librex is pushing
 

5743
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,669
the the mission of librex is pushing
back against the idea of safe spaces

5744
01:35:21,669 --> 01:35:21,679
back against the idea of safe spaces
 

5745
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,189
back against the idea of safe spaces
i think safe spaces are fine when

5746
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:23,199
i think safe spaces are fine when
 

5747
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,030
i think safe spaces are fine when
they're within people's private lives

5748
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:25,040
they're within people's private lives
 

5749
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,030
they're within people's private lives
within their homes you know within their

5750
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:27,040
within their homes you know within their
 

5751
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,109
within their homes you know within their
religious organizations

5752
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:29,119
religious organizations
 

5753
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:30,390
religious organizations
i think the problem becomes when the

5754
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:30,400
i think the problem becomes when the
 

5755
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,310
i think the problem becomes when the
institution starts encouraging

5756
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:32,320
institution starts encouraging
 

5757
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:37,030
institution starts encouraging
or um backing safe spaces

5758
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
or um backing safe spaces
 

5759
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:41,990
or um backing safe spaces
because what are people being safe from

5760
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,000
because what are people being safe from
 

5761
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,149
because what are people being safe from
and oftentimes it seems like there's

5762
01:35:44,149 --> 01:35:44,159
and oftentimes it seems like there's
 

5763
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:45,669
and oftentimes it seems like there's
this idea that

5764
01:35:45,669 --> 01:35:45,679
this idea that
 

5765
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,870
this idea that
the harm that's being attempted to to be

5766
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:48,880
the harm that's being attempted to to be
 

5767
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,430
the harm that's being attempted to to be
mitigated is the harm of confronting

5768
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:51,440
mitigated is the harm of confronting
 

5769
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,030
mitigated is the harm of confronting
opinions you disagree with opinions you

5770
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,040
opinions you disagree with opinions you
 

5771
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,870
opinions you disagree with opinions you
might find repugnant

5772
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
might find repugnant
 

5773
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,070
might find repugnant
and if this is conflated with a need for

5774
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
and if this is conflated with a need for
 

5775
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,109
and if this is conflated with a need for
safety

5776

safety
 

5777
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,189
safety
then that's where the idea of liberal

5778
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:01,199
then that's where the idea of liberal
 

5779

um of course it's complicated and we

5782
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:06,560
um of course it's complicated and we
 

5783
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,830
um of course it's complicated and we
still want to have safe intellectual

5784
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:08,840
still want to have safe intellectual

environments
 

5787
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,790
environments
but the way that i hear the term safe

5788
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:12,800
but the way that i hear the term safe
 

5789
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,310
but the way that i hear the term safe
space used today

01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,320
space used today
 

5791
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,470
space used today
i think it doesn't really have a place

5792
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:16,480
i think it doesn't really have a place
 

5793
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,070
i think it doesn't really have a place
within

5794
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,080
within
 

5795
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,350
within
like the intellectual context yeah

5796
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:21,360
like the intellectual context yeah
 

5797
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,910
like the intellectual context yeah
it's funny i mean this is why librex is

5798
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:23,920
it's funny i mean this is why librex is
 

5799
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,510
it's funny i mean this is why librex is
really exciting is it's pushing those

5800
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:25,520
really exciting is it's pushing those
 

5801
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,350
really exciting is it's pushing those
difficult conversations and i'd love to

5802
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
difficult conversations and i'd love to
 

5803
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,750
difficult conversations and i'd love to
see

01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:29,760

 

5805
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,350

ultimately there does seem to be an

5806
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:31,360
ultimately there does seem to be an
 

5807
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,510
ultimately there does seem to be an
asymmetry of power

5808
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
asymmetry of power
 

5809
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,709
asymmetry of power
that results in the concept of safe

5810
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:36,719
that results in the concept of safe
 

5811
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:37,990
that results in the concept of safe
spaces and

5812
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:38,000
spaces and
 

5813
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,109

01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:42,870
hate speech being redefined in a
slippery slope kind of way where it

5816
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:42,880
slippery slope kind of way where it
 

5817
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,629
slippery slope kind of way where it
means basically anything you want it to

5818
01:36:44,629 --> 01:36:44,639
means basically anything you want it to

it's hard psychologically to think that
 

7289
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:31,669
it's hard psychologically to think that
they might be wrong

7290
02:01:31,669 --> 02:01:31,679
they might be wrong
 

7291
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:35,030

7293
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,709
yeah but you're saying that's the only
way way you succeed because if they knew

7294
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
way way you succeed because if they knew
 

7295
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:37,669
way way you succeed because if they knew
what they were doing they would have

7296
02:01:37,669 --> 02:01:37,679
what they were doing they would have
 

7297
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:39,510
what they were doing they would have
built it themselves

7298
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:39,520
built it themselves
 

7299
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:43,189
built it themselves
um and what's especially hard is people

7300
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
um and what's especially hard is people
 

7301
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,109
um and what's especially hard is people
go oh of course you know

7302
02:01:45,109 --> 02:01:45,119

their advice but i'll know why it's

7306
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:48,159
their advice but i'll know why it's
 

7307
02:01:48,159 --> 02:01:48,870
their advice but i'll know why it's
wrong

7308
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:48,880
wrong
 

7309
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,629
wrong
yeah and then i'll and i'll do my own

7310
02:01:50,629 --> 02:01:50,639
yeah and then i'll and i'll do my own
 

7311
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:52,390
yeah and then i'll and i'll do my own
thing and that sounds great and abstract

7312
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:52,400
thing and that sounds great and abstract
 

7313
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,109
thing and that sounds great and abstract
but sometimes

7314
02:01:53,109 --> 02:01:53,119
but sometimes
 

7315
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:54,470
but sometimes
you can't always even put your finger on

7316
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:54,480
you can't always even put your finger on
 

7317
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,550
you can't always even put your finger on
why they're wrong yeah and i think

7318
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:56,560
why they're wrong yeah and i think
 

7319
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:59,669
why they're wrong yeah and i think
to have the conviction to say

7320
02:01:59,669 --> 02:01:59,679
to have the conviction to say
 

7321
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:01,830
to have the conviction to say
you're wrong and i can't tell you why

7322
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:01,840
you're wrong and i can't tell you why
 

7323
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,070
you're wrong and i can't tell you why
but i still think i'm right

7324
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:04,080
but i still think i'm right
 

7325
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:06,310
but i still think i'm right
it's a rare thing especially at like

7326
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:06,320
it's a rare thing especially at like
 

7327
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:07,910
it's a rare thing especially at like
it's very counterintuitive and

7328
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:07,920
it's very counterintuitive and
 

7329
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,229
it's very counterintuitive and
you might even say it's hubris or yeah

arrogant
but i think it's necessary because a lot

7334
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:13,199
but i think it's necessary because a lot
 

7335
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:14,709
but i think it's necessary because a lot
of these things are

7336

i have to thank for that i think this
there's something that's like

7968
02:12:39,430 --> 02:12:39,440
there's something that's like
 

7969
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:41,750
there's something that's like
unstoppable about the creative mind it's

7970
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
unstoppable about the creative mind it's
 

7971
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,430
unstoppable about the creative mind it's

like it's right there that fire
 

7973
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:47,270
like it's right there that fire
and i guess part of the part of the

7974
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:47,280
and i guess part of the part of the
 

7975
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:48,629
and i guess part of the part of the
thing that you're supposed to do is let

7976
02:12:48,629 --> 02:12:48,639
thing that you're supposed to do is let
 

7977
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:51,189
thing that you're supposed to do is let
that fire burn in whichever direction

7978
02:12:51,189 --> 02:12:51,199
that fire burn in whichever direction
 

7979
02:12:51,199 --> 02:12:53,990
that fire burn in whichever direction
and it's gonna hurt it's gonna hurt fire

7981
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,030
and it's gonna hurt it's gonna hurt fire
will hurt

should mention that at the time
 

8375

02:19:30,389 --> 02:19:30,399
i was someone who like refused to take
 

8377
02:19:30,399 --> 02:19:31,910
i was someone who like refused to take
in anything into my body that wasn't

8378
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:31,920
in anything into my body that wasn't
 

8379
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:33,110
in anything into my body that wasn't
natural

natural
 

8381
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:35,429
natural
and so a lot of the time i i tried to be

8382
02:19:35,429 --> 02:19:35,439
and so a lot of the time i i tried to be
 

8383
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:36,709
and so a lot of the time i i tried to be
unmedicated

8384
02:19:36,709 --> 02:19:36,719
unmedicated
 

8385
02:19:36,719 --> 02:19:39,349
unmedicated
um eventually i i didn't allow them to

8386
02:19:39,349 --> 02:19:39,359
um eventually i i didn't allow them to
 

8387
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:41,429
um eventually i i didn't allow them to
add a little medication to my body

8388
02:19:41,429 --> 02:19:41,439
add a little medication to my body
 

8389
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:44,549
add a little medication to my body
but there's just so much uncertainty and

02:19:44,549 --> 02:19:44,559
but there's just so much uncertainty and

and things that i believe that might not
be so overtly popular
