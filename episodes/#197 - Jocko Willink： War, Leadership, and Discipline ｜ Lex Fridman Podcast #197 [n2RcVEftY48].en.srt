339
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,390
connection and appreciation that that
brings a lot

340
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
brings a lot
 

341
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,909
brings a lot
and maybe i'm romanticizing war here

342
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
and maybe i'm romanticizing war here
 

343
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,029
and maybe i'm romanticizing war here
but it feels like that's inextricably

344
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
but it feels like that's inextricably
 

345
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,710
but it feels like that's inextricably
connected to world war ii

346
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
connected to world war ii
 

347
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,790
connected to world war ii
for russians is this does that resonate

348
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
for russians is this does that resonate
 

349
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,830
for russians is this does that resonate
at all is it

350
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
at all is it
 

351
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,670
at all is it
so if you look at military training

352
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
so if you look at military training
 

353
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,430
so if you look at military training
what they do is they take people in the

354
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
what they do is they take people in the
 

355
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,510
what they do is they take people in the
military from the civilian world they

356
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
military from the civilian world they
 

357
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,710
military from the civilian world they
bring them into the military and they

358
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
bring them into the military and they
 

359
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,150
bring them into the military and they
put them through

360
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
put them through
 

361
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,430
put them through
boot camp which is the stereotypical

362
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
boot camp which is the stereotypical
 

363
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,950
boot camp which is the stereotypical
thing that you see on tv you're going to

364
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
thing that you see on tv you're going to
 

365
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,990
thing that you see on tv you're going to
get yelled at you're going to get

366
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
get yelled at you're going to get
 

367
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,670
get yelled at you're going to get
screamed out you're going to get

368
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
screamed out you're going to get
 

369
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,029
screamed out you're going to get
you're gonna get put in the mud and

370
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
you're gonna get put in the mud and
 

371
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,270
you're gonna get put in the mud and
you're gonna made to be made to do hard

372
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
you're gonna made to be made to do hard
 

373
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,790
you're gonna made to be made to do hard
things together

374
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
things together
 

375
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,390
things together
and what does that do with those

376
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
and what does that do with those
 

377
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,350
and what does that do with those
civilians well it gives them a common

378
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
civilians well it gives them a common
 

379
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,990
civilians well it gives them a common
background

380
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
background
 

381
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,510
background
it gives them a common suffering that

382
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
it gives them a common suffering that
 

383
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,350
it gives them a common suffering that
they've been through together

384
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
they've been through together
 

385
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,710
they've been through together
and they form some sort of connection

386
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
and they form some sort of connection
 

387
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,870
and they form some sort of connection
some sort of bond

388
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
some sort of bond
 

389
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,710
some sort of bond
now to make that bond a little bit

390
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
now to make that bond a little bit
 

391
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,150
now to make that bond a little bit
stronger

392
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
stronger
 

393
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,589
stronger
after you get done with boot camp they

394
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
after you get done with boot camp they
 

395
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,029
after you get done with boot camp they
send you to advanced infantry school

396
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
send you to advanced infantry school
 

397
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,070
send you to advanced infantry school
and you suffer some more together

398
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
and you suffer some more together
 

399
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,390
and you suffer some more together
and when you suffer more together now

400
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
and when you suffer more together now
 

401
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,670
and when you suffer more together now
you're in a smaller group too because

402
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
you're in a smaller group too because
 

403
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,230
you're in a smaller group too because
now it's

404
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
now it's
 

405
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,309
now it's
infantry it's not supply people anymore

406
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
infantry it's not supply people anymore
 

407
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,830
infantry it's not supply people anymore
or logisticians it's

408
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840
or logisticians it's
 

409
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,589
or logisticians it's
strictly people that are going to

410
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
strictly people that are going to
 

411
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,189
strictly people that are going to
fight their infantrymen so they go

412
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
fight their infantrymen so they go
 

413
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,550
fight their infantrymen so they go
through a school together and now they

414
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
through a school together and now they
 

415
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,629
through a school together and now they
get a little bit tighter

416
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
get a little bit tighter
 

417
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,749
get a little bit tighter
get done with that and maybe you go to

418
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
get done with that and maybe you go to
 

419
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,110
get done with that and maybe you go to
an airborne division so you go to

420
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
an airborne division so you go to
 

421
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,110
an airborne division so you go to
airborne school and now you all

422
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
airborne school and now you all
 

423
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,629
airborne school and now you all
overcome this fear of jumping out of an

424
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
overcome this fear of jumping out of an
 

425
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,550
overcome this fear of jumping out of an
airplane together and you celebrate

426
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
airplane together and you celebrate
 

427
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,670
airplane together and you celebrate
surviving that

428
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680

 

429
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,950

then maybe you get done with that and

430
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
then maybe you get done with that and
 

431
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,469
then maybe you get done with that and
now you go at an airborne division now

432
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
now you go at an airborne division now
 

433
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,909
now you go at an airborne division now
you're an even tighter group because

434
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
you're an even tighter group because
 

435
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,230
you're an even tighter group because
you've

436
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
you've
 

437
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,110
you've
suffered together what comes next is

438
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
suffered together what comes next is
 

439
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,869
suffered together what comes next is
special forces training or ranger

440
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
special forces training or ranger
 

441
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,309
special forces training or ranger
training and what they do is they put

442
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
training and what they do is they put
 

443
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,909
training and what they do is they put
you in these situations where

444
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
you in these situations where
 

445
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,070
you in these situations where
you're going to suffer together and

446
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
you're going to suffer together and
 

447
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,350
you're going to suffer together and
you're going to build these bonds

448
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
you're going to build these bonds
 

449
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,790
you're going to build these bonds
because as i said earlier you have to

450
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
because as i said earlier you have to
 

451
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,110
because as i said earlier you have to
rely on each other to survive

452
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
rely on each other to survive
 

453
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,629
rely on each other to survive
and by the way not everyone does not

454
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
and by the way not everyone does not
 

455
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,670
and by the way not everyone does not
everyone makes it through this training

456
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
everyone makes it through this training
 

457
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,110
everyone makes it through this training
so you sort of have these memories of

458
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
so you sort of have these memories of
 

459
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,710
so you sort of have these memories of
people that didn't make it you

460
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
people that didn't make it you
 

461
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,830
people that didn't make it you
share that connection as well and you

462
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
share that connection as well and you
 

463
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,430
share that connection as well and you
can keep going down this road until you

464
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
can keep going down this road until you
 

465
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,790
can keep going down this road until you
go into combat

466
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
go into combat
 

467
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,189
go into combat
with a military unit and military units

468
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
with a military unit and military units
 

469
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,029
with a military unit and military units
that go through combat

470
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
that go through combat
 

471
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,029
that go through combat
have an even tighter bond and the harder

472
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
have an even tighter bond and the harder
 

473
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,390
have an even tighter bond and the harder
the combat that they go through the

474
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
the combat that they go through the
 

475
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,550
the combat that they go through the
tighter the bond is going to be

476
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
tighter the bond is going to be
 

477
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,189
tighter the bond is going to be
so i think when you talk about what the

478
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
so i think when you talk about what the
 

479
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,350
so i think when you talk about what the
soviet union went through in world war

480
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
soviet union went through in world war
 

481
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,150
soviet union went through in world war
ii

482
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
ii
 

483
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,950
ii
there was a shared suffering

484
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
there was a shared suffering
 

485
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,029
there was a shared suffering
to survive and so the entire nation

486
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
to survive and so the entire nation
 

487
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,190
to survive and so the entire nation
has that common thread and that's

488
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
has that common thread and that's
 

489
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,790
has that common thread and that's
probably the thing that you

490
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
probably the thing that you
 

491
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,389
probably the thing that you
sense or feel when you refer back to

492
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
sense or feel when you refer back to
 

493
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,670
sense or feel when you refer back to
the bond that resonates all the way back

494
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
the bond that resonates all the way back
 

495
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,469
the bond that resonates all the way back
to

496
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
to
 

497
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,670

there's this main there's
this important push in 1941 where they

538

this important push in 1941 where they
 

539
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,870
this important push in 1941 where they
were trying to get before the winter to

uh to moscow
and what stalin was doing is he was

544
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
and what stalin was doing is he was
 

545
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,910
and what stalin was doing is he was
basically throwing bodies

546
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
basically throwing bodies
 

547
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,509
basically throwing bodies
at at uh to slow the attack

at at uh to slow the attack
 

549

at at uh to slow the attack
and what that meant is everybody

550
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
and what that meant is everybody
 

551
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,550
and what that meant is everybody
understood that you

552
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
understood that you
 

553
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,110
understood that you
your job was you have this heavy machine

554
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
your job was you have this heavy machine
 

555
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,070
your job was you have this heavy machine
guns

556

guns
 

557
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,949
guns
it's very it's almost unreasonable to be

558
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
it's very it's almost unreasonable to be
 

559
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,710
it's very it's almost unreasonable to be
able to be mobile any kind of way with

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
able to be mobile any kind of way with

able to be mobile any kind of way with
them

562

them
 

563
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,509
them
so you're you're throwing at the front

564
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
so you're you're throwing at the front
 

565
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,710
so you're you're throwing at the front
and you're just non-stop

566
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
and you're just non-stop
 

567
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,030
and you're just non-stop
shooting and you know 95 plus percent of

568
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
shooting and you know 95 plus percent of
 

569
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,790
shooting and you know 95 plus percent of
people are just dead

570
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
people are just dead
 

571
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,790
people are just dead
other soldiers are just dead and then

572
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
other soldiers are just dead and then
 

573
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,069
other soldiers are just dead and then
you just go back

574
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
you just go back
 

575
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,230
you just go back
back and you're trying to protect as

576
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
back and you're trying to protect as
 

577
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,670
back and you're trying to protect as
many civilians as you can throughout

578
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
many civilians as you can throughout
 

579
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,829
many civilians as you can throughout
this whole process but you don't

580
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
this whole process but you don't
 

581
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,829
this whole process but you don't
and so you have millions of civilians

582
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
and so you have millions of civilians
 

583
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,790
and so you have millions of civilians
that die along the way into this march

584
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
that die along the way into this march
 

585
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,230
that die along the way into this march
is there something you can say about

586
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
is there something you can say about
 

587
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,870
is there something you can say about
this complete perhaps it's naive for me

588
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
this complete perhaps it's naive for me
 

589
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,110
this complete perhaps it's naive for me
to say but

590
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
to say but
 

591
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,310
to say but
a war that lacks tactics

592
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
a war that lacks tactics
 

593
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,829
a war that lacks tactics
that lacks strategy

594
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
that lacks strategy
 

595
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,430
that lacks strategy
and is purely about just

596
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440

 

597
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,110

no consideration of human life and just

598
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
no consideration of human life and just
 

599
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,230
no consideration of human life and just
throwing bodies

600
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
throwing bodies
 

601
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,069
throwing bodies
and bullets into a mix together where

602
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
and bullets into a mix together where
 

603
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,750
and bullets into a mix together where
millions die

604
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
millions die
 

605
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,829
millions die
and that in particular felt much less

606
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
and that in particular felt much less
 

607
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,069
and that in particular felt much less
like

608
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
like
 

609
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,069
like
conflict and much more like

610
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
conflict and much more like
 

611
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,790
conflict and much more like
torture or suffering

612
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800

 

613
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,350

it didn't it didn't come off as torture

614
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
it didn't it didn't come off as torture
 

615
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,310
it didn't it didn't come off as torture
only that

616
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
only that
 

617
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,150
only that
interestingly enough as you probably

618
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
interestingly enough as you probably
 

619
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,550
interestingly enough as you probably
know my grandfather including everybody

620
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
know my grandfather including everybody
 

621
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,230

else
 

623
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,590
else
volunteered they were proud to do this

624
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
volunteered they were proud to do this
 

625
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,470
volunteered they were proud to do this
they were proud to march to their death

626
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
they were proud to march to their death
 

627
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,990
they were proud to march to their death
for country for love of country

628

for country for love of country
 

629
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,630
for country for love of country
but the question on the civilian side

630
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
but the question on the civilian side
 

631
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,030
but the question on the civilian side
when

632
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
when
 

633
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,110
when
when more civilians die the military

634
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
when more civilians die the military
 

635
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,710
when more civilians die the military
personnel what do you make of that

636
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720

 

637
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,829

it's awful and it's awful when

638
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
it's awful and it's awful when
 

639
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,910
it's awful and it's awful when
a soldier dies it's awful when a

640
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
a soldier dies it's awful when a
 

641
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,110
a soldier dies it's awful when a
civilian dies

642
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
civilian dies
 

643
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,069
civilian dies
it's awful when 10 civilians or 10

644
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
it's awful when 10 civilians or 10
 

645
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,430
it's awful when 10 civilians or 10
soldiers and it's

646
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
soldiers and it's
 

647
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,509
soldiers and it's
even more awful when millions and

648
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
even more awful when millions and
 

649
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,670
even more awful when millions and
millions of soldiers and civilians die

650
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680

 

651
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,790

i think it's safe to say that the soviet

652
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
i think it's safe to say that the soviet
 

653
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,430
i think it's safe to say that the soviet
union was facing an existential threat

654
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
union was facing an existential threat
 

655
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,269
union was facing an existential threat
to their existence against the nazis

656
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
to their existence against the nazis
 

657
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,310
to their existence against the nazis
so to not fight

658
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
so to not fight
 

659
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,069
so to not fight
would be to die as well maybe die a

660
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
would be to die as well maybe die a
 

661
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,910
would be to die as well maybe die a
death a few years later

662
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
death a few years later
 

663
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,310
death a few years later
maybe die a different way but

664
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320

 

665
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,750

the choice was die now trying

666
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
the choice was die now trying
 

667
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,269
the choice was die now trying
or die later on your knees

668
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
or die later on your knees
 

669
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,150
or die later on your knees

893
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,870
when you go into a war civilians are
going to die and you have to understand

894

going to die and you have to understand
 

895
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,590
going to die and you have to understand
that

896
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
that
 

897
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,629
that
and the other thing that you have to

898
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
and the other thing that you have to
 

899
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,069
and the other thing that you have to
understand is that

900
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
understand is that
 

901
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,030

and it seems like sometimes we're a

904
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
and it seems like sometimes we're a
 

905
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,310
and it seems like sometimes we're a
little bit naive about the calculation

906
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
little bit naive about the calculation
 

907
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,870
little bit naive about the calculation

of what that's going to look like
 

909
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,509
of what that's going to look like
and maybe we think well not that many

910
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:49,519
and maybe we think well not that many
 

911
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,509
and maybe we think well not that many
civilians and maybe not that many of our

912
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
civilians and maybe not that many of our
 

913
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,590
civilians and maybe not that many of our
our personnel are going to die and

00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
our personnel are going to die and
 

915
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,949
our personnel are going to die and
that's where you get into

916
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
that's where you get into
 

917
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,990
that's where you get into
sticky situations and you know another

918
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
sticky situations and you know another
 

919
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,230
sticky situations and you know another
thing when you were talking about

920
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
thing when you were talking about
 

921
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,269
thing when you were talking about
the soviet union versus the nazis

922
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
the soviet union versus the nazis
 

923
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,909
the soviet union versus the nazis
that's total war that's what that is and

00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
that's total war that's what that is and
 

925
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,590
that's total war that's what that is and
we don't engage in that very often it's

926
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
we don't engage in that very often it's

often
 

937
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,949
often
in fact the last time we fought like

938
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
in fact the last time we fought like
 

939
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,270
in fact the last time we fought like
that was world war ii

940

it takes
 

945
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,829
it takes
to up to and including the atomic bomb

946
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
to up to and including the atomic bomb
 

947
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,350

think about before you go to war
 

953
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,710

and i don't think we think about that
 

955
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,630
and i don't think we think about that
very often

956
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
very often
 

957

00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
you know even the united states the
 

959
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,070
you know even the united states the
atomic bomb

960
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
atomic bomb
 

961
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,909

nuclear weapons is an interesting one

962
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
nuclear weapons is an interesting one
 

963
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,390
nuclear weapons is an interesting one
because there's a lot of

964
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
because there's a lot of
 

965
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,870
because there's a lot of
there's a lot of hesitation on that

966

there's a lot of hesitation on that
there's a lot of critics of that

968

to use nuclear weapons
 

979
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,110
to use nuclear weapons
it's interesting to think about

980
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120

 

981
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,950

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
ethics into it
 

985
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,150

winning the war but
 

989
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,669
winning the war but

993
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,190

usually those decisions are made by

994
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
usually those decisions are made by
 

995
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,710
usually those decisions are made by
leaders

996
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
leaders
 

997
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,310

soldier who feels like they're trying to
protect their friends

1134
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200

 

1135
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,029

they'll move through that if you've got

1136
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
they'll move through that if you've got
 

1137
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,950
they'll move through that if you've got
a soldier that's doing it because they

a soldier that's doing it because they

1143
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,630
personal glory they'll probably not feel
good about it later

1144
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
good about it later
 

1145
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,310
good about it later
so i think it depends on the situation i

1146
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
so i think it depends on the situation i
 

1147
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,830
so i think it depends on the situation i
think it depends on the psychology of

1148
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
think it depends on the psychology of
 

1149
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,870
think it depends on the psychology of
the individual that's going through it

1150
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880
the individual that's going through it
 

1151
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,070
the individual that's going through it
he said move through that

1152
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080

 

1153
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,870

is there some calculation here that a

1154
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
is there some calculation here that a
 

1155
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,110
is there some calculation here that a
soldier

1156
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
soldier
 

1157
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,230
soldier
when they kill another soldier a

1158
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
when they kill another soldier a
 

1159
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,669
when they kill another soldier a
realization that is

1160
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
realization that is
 

1161
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,789
realization that is
just another human being i mean is there

1162
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
just another human being i mean is there
 

1163
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,750
just another human being i mean is there
some

1164
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
some
 

1165
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,669
some

1265
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,430
raped and abused by these insurgents
and so on the one side we become

1266
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
and so on the one side we become
 

1267
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,549
and so on the one side we become
the the iraqi populace is very

1268
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
the the iraqi populace is very
 

1269
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,029
the the iraqi populace is very
humanized to us because we're talking to

1270
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,039
humanized to us because we're talking to
 

1271
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,630
humanized to us because we're talking to
them we've got interpreters

1272
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
them we've got interpreters
 

1273
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,710
them we've got interpreters
we understand we're seeing them day

1274
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
we understand we're seeing them day
 

1275
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,710
we understand we're seeing them day
after day the same individuals

1276
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
after day the same individuals
 

1277
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,909
after day the same individuals
and so we form a bond with the local

1278
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:15,919
and so we form a bond with the local
 

1279
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,430
and so we form a bond with the local
populace

1280
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
populace
 

1281
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,909
populace
and yet we see what the insurgents are

1282
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
and yet we see what the insurgents are
 

1283
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,710
and yet we see what the insurgents are
doing

1284
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
doing
 

1285
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,830
doing
and so it's again not difficult

1286
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
and so it's again not difficult
 

1287
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,310
and so it's again not difficult
to dehumanize people that behave in that

1288
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
to dehumanize people that behave in that
 

1289
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,390
to dehumanize people that behave in that
manner

1290
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
manner
 

1291
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,269
manner
yeah i suppose i'm i worry about the

1292
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
yeah i suppose i'm i worry about the
 

1293
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,390
yeah i suppose i'm i worry about the
dehumanization at a much larger scale

1294
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
dehumanization at a much larger scale
 

1295
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,909
dehumanization at a much larger scale
when it's not the kind of case that

1296
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
when it's not the kind of case that
 

1297
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,269
when it's not the kind of case that
you're talking about even now

1298
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:41,279

 

1299
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,990

hopefully i'm not fear-mongering but

1300
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
hopefully i'm not fear-mongering but
 

1301
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,230
hopefully i'm not fear-mongering but
there's a sense in which there's the

1302
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
there's a sense in which there's the
 

1303
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,830
there's a sense in which there's the
drums of war slowly starting to build

1304
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
drums of war slowly starting to build
 

1305
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,950
drums of war slowly starting to build
with china there

1306
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960

 

1307
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,870

in the best case it would be a cold war

1308
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
in the best case it would be a cold war
 

1309
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,029
in the best case it would be a cold war
of there's a dehumanization aspect

1310
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
of there's a dehumanization aspect
 

1311
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,669
of there's a dehumanization aspect
that's happening with china currently

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
that that may ultimately lead to
 

1329
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,669
that that may ultimately lead to
conflict

1330
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
conflict
 

1331
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,149
conflict
in the worst case hot conflict that

in the worst case hot conflict that
 

1333
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,430
in the worst case hot conflict that
would no longer be

00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
would no longer be
 

1335
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,070
would no longer be
the situation you are in in iraq and

the situation you are in in iraq and

more
similar to the soviet union conflict

1340
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:36,159
similar to the soviet union conflict
 

1341
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,029
similar to the soviet union conflict
with the

and then they're dehumanized to where
 

1347

doesn't have to be through just a hot
war it could be um

1360
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
war it could be um
 

1361
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,590
war it could be um
through starvation through camps

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:01,600
through starvation through camps
 

1363
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,269
through starvation through camps
all those kinds of things and i worry i

1364
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
all those kinds of things and i worry i
 

1365
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,789
all those kinds of things and i worry i
worry about that

1366
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799
worry about that
 

1367
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,630
worry about that
we kind of tend to think that these wars

1368
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
we kind of tend to think that these wars
 

1369
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,470
we kind of tend to think that these wars
are behind us

1370
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,480
are behind us
 

1371
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,230
are behind us
and i'm not always so sure that's the

1372
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240
and i'm not always so sure that's the
 

1373
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,149
and i'm not always so sure that's the
case

1374
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
case
 

1375
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,710
case
and at least in the way that uh it

1376
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
and at least in the way that uh it
 

1377
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,269
and at least in the way that uh it
ultimately starts with hate

1378
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
ultimately starts with hate
 

1379
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,070
ultimately starts with hate
and if again hopefully i'm not being too

1380
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
and if again hopefully i'm not being too
 

1381
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,269
and if again hopefully i'm not being too
dramatic

1382
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
dramatic
 

1383
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,669
dramatic
but i i see that there's a kind of

1384
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
but i i see that there's a kind of
 

1385
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,390
but i i see that there's a kind of
brewing

1386
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
brewing
 

1387
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,669
brewing
of uh it starts with dehumanization and

1388
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:27,679
of uh it starts with dehumanization and
 

1389
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,870
of uh it starts with dehumanization and
turns to hate

1390
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
turns to hate
 

1391
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,269
turns to hate

but that's the kind of conflicts i'm
referring to and um

they play it uh quite often in military
funerals which i just recently learned

1424
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
funerals which i just recently learned
 

1425
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:07,669
funerals which i just recently learned
but

1426
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
but
 

1427
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,909
but

00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
it's this powerful song as a line um
 

1429
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,710
it's this powerful song as a line um
we're fools

1430
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
we're fools
 

1431
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,310
we're fools
to make war on our brothers in arms

1432
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320
to make war on our brothers in arms
 

1433
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,510
to make war on our brothers in arms
do you think there's some sense in which

1434
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
do you think there's some sense in which
 

1435
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,190
do you think there's some sense in which
at the leadership level but just as

1436
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
at the leadership level but just as
 

1437
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,950
at the leadership level but just as
human beings

1438
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
human beings
 

1439
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,750
human beings
were perhaps foolish and engaging

1440
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
were perhaps foolish and engaging
 

1441
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,350
were perhaps foolish and engaging
in military conflict

1442
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:29,360

 

1443
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,470

as much as we have

1444
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480

 

1445
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,430

or is full a very inappropriate word

1446
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
or is full a very inappropriate word
 

1447
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,110
or is full a very inappropriate word
here

1448
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
here
 

1449
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,909
here
well i think the using the term brothers

1450
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
well i think the using the term brothers
 

1451
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,870
well i think the using the term brothers
in arms means

1452
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
in arms means
 

1453
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,190
in arms means
the people that are on my side right so

1454
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
the people that are on my side right so
 

1455
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,870
the people that are on my side right so
it doesn't make sense

1456
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
it doesn't make sense
 

1457
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,909
it doesn't make sense
to start wars with people that are on

1458
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:47,919
to start wars with people that are on
 

1459
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:48,870
to start wars with people that are on
your side

1460
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:48,880
your side
 

1461
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,350
your side
so that's that might just be the way the

1462
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,360
so that's that might just be the way the
 

1463
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,110
so that's that might just be the way the
lyrics are written so that it

1464
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
lyrics are written so that it
 

1465
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,669
lyrics are written so that it
fit the song or whatever um i think

1466
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
fit the song or whatever um i think
 

1467
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,510
fit the song or whatever um i think
broadly what you're asking me is

1468
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
broadly what you're asking me is
 

1469
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,630
broadly what you're asking me is
is war foolish yeah

1470
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
is war foolish yeah
 

1471
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,950
is war foolish yeah
and i would say the answer is yes and if

1472
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
and i would say the answer is yes and if
 

1473
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,389
and i would say the answer is yes and if
you can avoid it you absolutely should

1474
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
you can avoid it you absolutely should
 

1475
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,310
you can avoid it you absolutely should
but if there is a

1476
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
but if there is a
 

1477
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,430
but if there is a
bear or a wolf that is trying to get

1478
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440
bear or a wolf that is trying to get
 

1479
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,230
bear or a wolf that is trying to get
into your house

1480
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,240
into your house
 

1481
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,470
into your house
is it foolish to shoot that bear or

1482
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
is it foolish to shoot that bear or
 

1483
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,750
is it foolish to shoot that bear or
shoot that wolf

1484
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
shoot that wolf
 

1485
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,470
shoot that wolf
i think the answer is pretty obvious so

1486
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
i think the answer is pretty obvious so
 

1487
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,350
i think the answer is pretty obvious so
when

1488
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
when
 

1489
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,190
when

that gets in the way
 

1825
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,109
that gets in the way
or is it a good thing well i think like

1826
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
or is it a good thing well i think like
 

1827
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,710
or is it a good thing well i think like
anything else

1828
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:28,720
anything else

if it's balanced correctly it's great

1830
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
if it's balanced correctly it's great
 

1831
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,630
if it's balanced correctly it's great
and if it goes

1832
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
and if it goes
 

1833
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,790
and if it goes
to some extreme level then it becomes a

1834
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:34,800
to some extreme level then it becomes a
 

1835
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,630
to some extreme level then it becomes a
negative and i think it

1836
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:36,640
negative and i think it
 

1837
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,790
negative and i think it
i think it's probably sourced in some

1838
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:38,800
i think it's probably sourced in some
 

1839
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,190
i think it's probably sourced in some
sort of

1840
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,200
sort of
 

1841
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,510
sort of
animalistic tribalism that we all have

1842
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520
animalistic tribalism that we all have
 

1843
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,950
animalistic tribalism that we all have
to be part of a tribe

1844
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
to be part of a tribe
 

1845
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,150
to be part of a tribe
and this is a real big tribe that you

1846
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
and this is a real big tribe that you
 

1847
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,190
and this is a real big tribe that you
get to be a part of

1848
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
get to be a part of
 

1849
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,630
get to be a part of
and all you have to do is kind of show

1850
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
and all you have to do is kind of show
 

1851
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,430
and all you have to do is kind of show
up and so when someone says hey

1852
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:53,440
up and so when someone says hey
 

1853

has now officially
 

1873
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,550
has now officially
released the report saying that they're

1874

adding more and more autonomy in

1880
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,040
adding more and more autonomy in
 

1881
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,710
adding more and more autonomy in
artificial intelligence into its weapon

systems because china is doing it

1884
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
systems because china is doing it
 

1885
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,190
systems because china is doing it
so there's these are the first steps and

1886
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,200
so there's these are the first steps and
 

1887
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,470
so there's these are the first steps and
then something that

1888
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:32,480
then something that
 

1889
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,550
then something that
ai folks worry about which is uh

1890
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:36,560
ai folks worry about which is uh
 

1891
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,990
ai folks worry about which is uh
a race an ai race

1892

a race an ai race
 

1893
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,550
a race an ai race
in the space of autonomous weapons that

1894
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,560
in the space of autonomous weapons that
 

1895
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,589
in the space of autonomous weapons that
can run away

1896
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:43,599
can run away
 

1897
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,270
can run away
uh too quickly is that something um

1898
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
uh too quickly is that something um
 

1899
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,630
uh too quickly is that something um

where to shoot
 

1911
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,829
where to shoot
and the largest scale of military

of just get being given a mission of

1916
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:03,359
of just get being given a mission of
 

1917
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,109

say terrorist human being
 

1923
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,430
say terrorist human being
and then figure out what is the right

1924
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:11,440
and then figure out what is the right
 

1925
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,750
and then figure out what is the right
bombing campaign on your own

1926
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
bombing campaign on your own
 

1927
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,990
bombing campaign on your own
to accomplish this task that minimizes

1928
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
to accomplish this task that minimizes
 

1929
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,069
to accomplish this task that minimizes
civilian death

1930

civilian death
 

1931
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,910
civilian death
and and then just loading that in and

1932
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:19,920
and and then just loading that in and
 

1933
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,589
and and then just loading that in and
letting the ai system automatically

1934
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
letting the ai system automatically
 

1935
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:21,990
letting the ai system automatically
decide

decide
 

1937
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,349
decide
that what are your general thoughts

1938
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:25,359
that what are your general thoughts
 

1939

that what are your general thoughts
about it

1940

about it
 

1941
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,710
about it
do you do you worry about it because as

1942
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:28,720
do you do you worry about it because as
 

1943
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,550
do you do you worry about it because as
the positive effects

1944
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:30,560
the positive effects
 

1945
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,990
the positive effects
that in the best version of that world

1946
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,000
that in the best version of that world
 

1947
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,030
that in the best version of that world
you kill fewer civilians

1948
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,040
you kill fewer civilians
 

1949
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,510
you kill fewer civilians
you kill hurt fewer of your own

1950
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,520
you kill hurt fewer of your own
 

1951
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,069
you kill hurt fewer of your own
human beings but at the negative side of

1952
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:44,079
human beings but at the negative side of
 

1953
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,910
human beings but at the negative side of
that

1954

that
 

1955
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,750
that
you might lose the the thing we kind of

1956
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:49,760
you might lose the the thing we kind of
 

1957
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,670
you might lose the the thing we kind of
talked about which is the basic humanity

1958
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
talked about which is the basic humanity
 

1959
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,230
talked about which is the basic humanity
even

1960
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,240
even
 

1961
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,510
even
in the individual soldier of what is

1962
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
in the individual soldier of what is
 

1963
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,109
in the individual soldier of what is
right and what is wrong

1964
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
right and what is wrong
 

1965
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,950
right and what is wrong
and not making huge mistakes that hurt

1966
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
and not making huge mistakes that hurt
 

1967
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,230
and not making huge mistakes that hurt
thousands or millions of people

1968
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,240
thousands or millions of people
 

1969
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,670
thousands or millions of people
i guess what you're asking me is if they

1970
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:05,680
i guess what you're asking me is if they
 

1971
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,270
i guess what you're asking me is if they
could make a machine that could

1972
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
could make a machine that could
 

1973
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,550
could make a machine that could
do more surgical attacks on

1974
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
do more surgical attacks on
 

1975
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,310
do more surgical attacks on
enemy individuals would i be for it

1976
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,320
enemy individuals would i be for it
 

1977
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,710
enemy individuals would i be for it
yes i would be for it the problem is

1978
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,720
yes i would be for it the problem is
 

1979
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,030
yes i would be for it the problem is
if you've ever used machines of any kind

1980
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
if you've ever used machines of any kind
 

1981
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,230
if you've ever used machines of any kind
their initial design may not be there

1982
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,240
their initial design may not be there
 

1983
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,950
their initial design may not be there
there's unintended consequences there's

1984
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
there's unintended consequences there's
 

1985
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,310
there's unintended consequences there's
uh

1986
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:30,320
uh
 

1987
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,710
uh
there's ways in the the machine actually

1988
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
there's ways in the the machine actually
 

1989
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,750
there's ways in the the machine actually
behaves

that you realize there's bugs in this

1992
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,040
that you realize there's bugs in this
 

1993

that you realize there's bugs in this
thing

1994

thing
 

1995
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,950
thing
so do we not put protocols in place to

1996
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
so do we not put protocols in place to
 

1997
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,589
so do we not put protocols in place to
prevent

1998
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
prevent
 

1999
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,349
prevent
something from going too far outside the

something from going too far outside the
 

2001
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,750
something from going too far outside the

boundaries of what we wanted to execute
 

2003
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,790
boundaries of what we wanted to execute
you do but the question is uh

2004
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800
you do but the question is uh
 

2005
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,710
you do but the question is uh
this is the first time in human history

2006
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
this is the first time in human history
 

2007
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,710
this is the first time in human history
you can create things

2008
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:52,720
you can create things
 

2009
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,109
you can create things
machines toaster microwave oven

that's smarter than you in this

2012
00:38:59,349 --> 00:38:59,359
that's smarter than you in this
 

2013
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,270
that's smarter than you in this
particular task

2014
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,280
particular task
 

2015
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,829
particular task
i mean it's not yet there what you're

2016
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
i mean it's not yet there what you're
 

2017
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,589
i mean it's not yet there what you're
learning a lot with military strategies

2018
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:05,599
learning a lot with military strategies
 

2019
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,750
learning a lot with military strategies
humans are actually really damn smart

2020
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:07,760
humans are actually really damn smart
 

2021
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,630
humans are actually really damn smart
it's very hard to do to improve on a

it's very hard to do to improve on a
 

2023

human
 

2025
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,589
human
and so most actual drones that are

2026
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:13,599
and so most actual drones that are
 

2027
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,150
and so most actual drones that are
unmanned are still piloted by humans

2028
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
unmanned are still piloted by humans
 

2029
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,349
unmanned are still piloted by humans
it's very difficult to do every aspect

2030
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:19,359
it's very difficult to do every aspect
 

2031
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,950
it's very difficult to do every aspect
of war

2032
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:20,960
of war
 

2033
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,109
of war
but it's not out of the realm of

2034
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119
but it's not out of the realm of
 

2035
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,030
but it's not out of the realm of
possibility that

2036
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,040
possibility that
 

2037
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,550
possibility that
machines will start doing those things

2038
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,560
machines will start doing those things
 

2039
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,069
machines will start doing those things
better in certain certain

2040
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,079
better in certain certain
 

2041
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,430
better in certain certain
things a certain more precise

2045
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,790

the question is so what happens

2046
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
the question is so what happens
 

2047
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,950
the question is so what happens
when you start to rely on the machine to

2048
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:40,960
when you start to rely on the machine to
 

2049
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,950
when you start to rely on the machine to
do some of the task

2050
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
do some of the task
 

2051
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,990
do some of the task
is you get lazy

2052
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
is you get lazy
 

2053
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,470
is you get lazy
you forget what it is like to do that

2054
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
you forget what it is like to do that
 

2055
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,349
you forget what it is like to do that
task

2056
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:49,359
task
 

2057
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,349
task
or more importantly you lose the

2058
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
or more importantly you lose the
 

2059
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,190
or more importantly you lose the
knowledge of the intricacies of that

2060
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,200
knowledge of the intricacies of that
 

2061
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,230
knowledge of the intricacies of that
task

2062
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,240
task
 

2063
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,470
task
and you forget the ways you can go wrong

2064
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:56,480
and you forget the ways you can go wrong
 

2065
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,310
and you forget the ways you can go wrong
so the protocols

2066
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:58,320
so the protocols
 

2067
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,510
so the protocols
may not be sufficient to constrain the

2068
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:01,520
may not be sufficient to constrain the
 

2069
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,390
may not be sufficient to constrain the
power

2070
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
power
 

2071
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,030
power
of the ways that things go wrong

2072
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,040
of the ways that things go wrong
 

2073
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,790
of the ways that things go wrong
especially when things are moving really

2074
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
especially when things are moving really
 

2075
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,990
especially when things are moving really
quickly

2076
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,000
quickly
 

2077
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,670
quickly
especially when the ethics of the two

2078
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:11,680
especially when the ethics of the two
 

2079
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,910
especially when the ethics of the two
sides aren't perfectly aligned

sides aren't perfectly aligned
 

2081
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,630
sides aren't perfectly aligned
when people are some certain sides like

2082
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
when people are some certain sides like
 

2083
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,950
when people are some certain sides like
on the chinese side may be more willing

2084
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
on the chinese side may be more willing
 

2085
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,910
on the chinese side may be more willing
to take risks

2086
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
to take risks
 

2087
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,870
to take risks
for dangerous consequences than others

2088
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
for dangerous consequences than others
 

2089
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,349
for dangerous consequences than others
so what

2090
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:25,359
so what
 

2091
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,910
so what
happened on the bioweapon side is

2092
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:27,920
happened on the bioweapon side is
 

2093
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,950
happened on the bioweapon side is
internationally

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,270
internationally
maybe you can speak to this more but my

2096
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,280
maybe you can speak to this more but my
 

2097
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,109
maybe you can speak to this more but my
sense what i was told

2098
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:33,119
sense what i was told
 

2099
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,470
sense what i was told
there's a sense globally that buy

2100
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
there's a sense globally that buy
 

2101
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,230
there's a sense globally that buy
weapons are not going to be used

weapons are not going to be used
 

2103
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,790
weapons are not going to be used
they're unethical there's a sense like

2104
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
they're unethical there's a sense like
 

2105
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,030
they're unethical there's a sense like
we're not going to engage in this

2106
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,040
we're not going to engage in this
 

2107
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,309
we're not going to engage in this
and with ai currently china

2108
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:46,319
and with ai currently china
 

2109
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,589
and with ai currently china
and u.s said green light

2110
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
and u.s said green light
 

2111
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,150
and u.s said green light
i'll go ahead it's it's totally ethical

2112
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
i'll go ahead it's it's totally ethical
 

2113
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,589
i'll go ahead it's it's totally ethical
if if it can decrease the

2114

if if it can decrease the
 

2115
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,710
if if it can decrease the
loss of human life um

2116
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
loss of human life um
 

2117
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,990
loss of human life um
why not my worry is

2118
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,000
why not my worry is
 

2119
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,190
why not my worry is
that it's much more it's

2120
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
that it's much more it's
 

2121
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,550
that it's much more it's
it's much easier to design weapons

2122
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
it's much easier to design weapons
 

2123
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,750
it's much easier to design weapons
that are effective

2124
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:11,760
that are effective
 

2125
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,470
that are effective
than design weapons who have the the

2126
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,480
than design weapons who have the the
 

2127
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,630
than design weapons who have the the
depth of ethics

2128
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
depth of ethics
 

2129
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,990
depth of ethics
and morals that humans do which i think

2130
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,000
and morals that humans do which i think
 

2131
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,670
and morals that humans do which i think
we don't as human beings don't

2132
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
we don't as human beings don't
 

2133
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,109
we don't as human beings don't
acknowledge enough

2134
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:23,119
acknowledge enough
 

2135
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,510
acknowledge enough
that even like the cold calculated

00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,520
that even like the cold calculated
 

2137
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,630
that even like the cold calculated
killing of others

2138
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:26,640
killing of others
 

2139
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,710
killing of others
like precise effective execution of a

2140
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
like precise effective execution of a
 

2141
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,750
like precise effective execution of a

2142
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
mission
 

2143
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,870
mission
still has ethics in it at every level

2144
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:34,880
still has ethics in it at every level
 

2145
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,550
still has ethics in it at every level
you know what's right and what's wrong

2146
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560
you know what's right and what's wrong
 

2147
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,150
you know what's right and what's wrong
and i don't know if that

2148
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
and i don't know if that
 

2149
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,670
and i don't know if that
i don't know if you take that away

2150
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
i don't know if you take that away
 

2151
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,589
i don't know if you take that away
you're not going to make huge mistakes

2152
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:41,599
you're not going to make huge mistakes
 

2153
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,670
you're not going to make huge mistakes
that you regret

2154
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
that you regret
 

2155
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,190
that you regret
is that something you don't

2156
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
is that something you don't
 

2157
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,630
is that something you don't
i don't really worry about it um but

2158
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:52,640
i don't really worry about it um but
 

2159
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,790
i don't really worry about it um but
as you design something like i said you

2160
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:54,800
as you design something like i said you
 

2161
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,630
as you design something like i said you
you put protocols in place and

2162
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
you put protocols in place and
 

2163
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,270
you put protocols in place and
and from what i am hearing you say or

2164
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,280
and from what i am hearing you say or
 

2165
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,470
and from what i am hearing you say or
trying to hear you say

2166
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,480
trying to hear you say
 

2167
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,230
trying to hear you say
there's be a point where our protocols

2168
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240
there's be a point where our protocols
 

2169
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,990
there's be a point where our protocols
wouldn't be

2170
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
wouldn't be
 

2171
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,190
wouldn't be
wouldn't be sufficient to stop the

2172
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:07,200
wouldn't be sufficient to stop the
 

2173
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,750
wouldn't be sufficient to stop the
machine

2174
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:07,760
machine
 

2175
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:15,270
machine
from doing something that was unethical

2176
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280

 

2177
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,270

i'm kind of worried that this is

2178
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:17,280
i'm kind of worried that this is
 

2179
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,430
i'm kind of worried that this is
something you don't worry about

2180
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:19,440
something you don't worry about
 

2181
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,190
something you don't worry about
because a lot of people i respect don't

2182
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
because a lot of people i respect don't
 

2183
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,190
because a lot of people i respect don't
worry about it and i don't know what to

2184
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
worry about it and i don't know what to
 

2185
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,790
worry about it and i don't know what to
do about that

2186
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:24,800
do about that
 

2187
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,109
do about that
a lot of generals don't worry about it a

2188
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
a lot of generals don't worry about it a
 

2189
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,390
a lot of generals don't worry about it a
lot of people who know

2190
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:28,400
lot of people who know
 

2191
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,910
lot of people who know
much more about war like you than me

2192
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920
much more about war like you than me
 

2193
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,190
much more about war like you than me
don't worry about it and that worries me

2194
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
don't worry about it and that worries me
 

2195
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,349
don't worry about it and that worries me
well that's because you have a vision

2196
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359
well that's because you have a vision
 

2197
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,230
well that's because you have a vision
into

2198
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,240
into
 

2199
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,589
into
the shortfalls of a.i and i don't

2200
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:41,599
the shortfalls of a.i and i don't
 

2201
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,829
the shortfalls of a.i and i don't
i don't have a vision of the shortfalls

2202
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:43,839
i don't have a vision of the shortfalls
 

2203
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,670
i don't have a vision of the shortfalls
of ai i don't know enough about it

2204
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,680
of ai i don't know enough about it
 

2205
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,630
of ai i don't know enough about it
as far as i'm concerned you put a on off

2206
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
as far as i'm concerned you put a on off
 

2207
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,230
as far as i'm concerned you put a on off
switch somewhere you put a

2208
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240
switch somewhere you put a
 

2209
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,069
switch somewhere you put a
a kill switch on a system

2210
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:54,079
a kill switch on a system
 

2211
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,750
a kill switch on a system
and if it starts going awry you hit the

2212
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
and if it starts going awry you hit the
 

2213
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,670
and if it starts going awry you hit the
kill switch and that's it

2214
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:57,680
kill switch and that's it
 

2215
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,829
kill switch and that's it
so if you know when you look at me and

2216
00:42:59,829 --> 00:42:59,839
so if you know when you look at me and
 

2217
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:00,710
so if you know when you look at me and
say well there's

2218
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,720
say well there's
 

2219
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,390
say well there's
no possible way to put a kill switch

2220
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,400
no possible way to put a kill switch
 

2221
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,550
no possible way to put a kill switch
that would be 100 effective and here's

2222
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,560
that would be 100 effective and here's
 

2223
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,109
that would be 100 effective and here's
you draw those concerns to me and we

2224
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
you draw those concerns to me and we
 

2225
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,790
you draw those concerns to me and we
could talk through it and say okay

2226
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
could talk through it and say okay
 

2227
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,630
could talk through it and say okay
well here's where we should draw the

2228
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:10,640
well here's where we should draw the
 

2229
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,470
well here's where we should draw the
line yeah

2230
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:12,480
line yeah
 

2231
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,309
line yeah
i mean it's like again for the soviet

2232
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:14,319
i mean it's like again for the soviet
 

2233
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,190
i mean it's like again for the soviet
union chernobyl meltdown

2234
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,200
union chernobyl meltdown
 

2235
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,510
union chernobyl meltdown
there's always the ability i believe to

2236
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:19,520
there's always the ability i believe to
 

2237
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,470
there's always the ability i believe to
have a kill switch

2238
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
have a kill switch
 

2239
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,829
have a kill switch
the problem is uh the more power you

2240
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
the problem is uh the more power you
 

2241
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,150
the problem is uh the more power you
give to the machine

2242
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,160
give to the machine
 

2243
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,069
give to the machine
the more opportunity you give to the

2244
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:32,079
the more opportunity you give to the
 

2245
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,910
the more opportunity you give to the
to the human supervising that machine to

2246
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:33,920
to the human supervising that machine to
 

2247
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,829
to the human supervising that machine to
make a mistake and not

2248
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:35,839
make a mistake and not
 

2249
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,270
make a mistake and not
shut off the switch at the right time so

2250
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,280
shut off the switch at the right time so
 

2251
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,950
shut off the switch at the right time so
yes the solution i mean you're putting

2252
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:40,960
yes the solution i mean you're putting
 

2253
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,390
yes the solution i mean you're putting
the responsibility still in the human

2254
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:42,400
the responsibility still in the human
 

2255
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,670
the responsibility still in the human
hands and i think that's the correct

2256
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
hands and i think that's the correct
 

2257
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,630
hands and i think that's the correct
place to put it

2258
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:44,640
place to put it
 

2259
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,230
place to put it
there should be good protocols good

2260
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240
there should be good protocols good
 

2261
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,190
there should be good protocols good
leadership good execution competency all

2262
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,200
leadership good execution competency all
 

2263
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,069
leadership good execution competency all
around

2264
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079
around
 

2265
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,710
around
your protocol should consider the basic

2266
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
your protocol should consider the basic
 

2267
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,230
your protocol should consider the basic

failures of human nature the human
 

2269
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,030
failures of human nature the human
factor

2270
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
factor
 

2271
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,470
factor
of how things go wrong so there should

2272
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:56,480
of how things go wrong so there should
 

2273
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,069
of how things go wrong so there should
be multiple people supervising the

2274
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:58,079
be multiple people supervising the
 

2275
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,670
be multiple people supervising the
system all those things

2276
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
system all those things
 

2277
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,870
system all those things
but i am just very skeptical

2278
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:02,880
but i am just very skeptical
 

2279
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,470
but i am just very skeptical
of greater and greater power in the

2280
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,480
of greater and greater power in the
 

2281
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,430
of greater and greater power in the
machine that can create war

2282
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:07,440
machine that can create war
 

2283
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,190
machine that can create war
that can not lead to death yeah and

2284
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:11,200
that can not lead to death yeah and
 

2285
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,030
that can not lead to death yeah and
that's why like i said and like you just

2286
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040
that's why like i said and like you just
 

2287
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,030
that's why like i said and like you just
said you have protocols in place that

2288
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,040
said you have protocols in place that
 

2289
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,870
said you have protocols in place that
that are a kill switch and if if you

2290
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
that are a kill switch and if if you
 

2291
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,230
that are a kill switch and if if you
think about the amount of

2292
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:18,240
think about the amount of
 

2293
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,390
think about the amount of
nuclear weapons that we've had on planet

2294
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
nuclear weapons that we've had on planet
 

2295
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,910
nuclear weapons that we've had on planet
earth for the past however many years

2296
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:23,920
earth for the past however many years
 

2297
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,510
earth for the past however many years
and there's been you know no

2298
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
and there's been you know no
 

2299
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,589
and there's been you know no
rogue element that said you know what

2300
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:29,599
rogue element that said you know what
 

2301
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,109
rogue element that said you know what
i'm gonna shoot this thing there's been

2302
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
i'm gonna shoot this thing there's been
 

2303
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:31,670
i'm gonna shoot this thing there's been
no

2304
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:31,680
no
 

2305
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,349
no
protocol that took place where all of a

2306
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
protocol that took place where all of a
 

2307
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,430
protocol that took place where all of a
sudden we said

2308
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,440
sudden we said
 

2309
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,150
sudden we said
oh no i mean there's been there's been

2310
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
oh no i mean there's been there's been
 

2311
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,430
oh no i mean there's been there's been
escalations

2312
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:39,440
escalations
 

2313
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,750
escalations
but the protocols worked have worked so

2314
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,760
but the protocols worked have worked so
 

2315
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,550
but the protocols worked have worked so
far

2316
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
far
 

2317
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,670
far
now that's a scary thing to think about

2318
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:45,680
now that's a scary thing to think about
 

2319
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,950
now that's a scary thing to think about
that we rely on these protocols to stop

2320
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
that we rely on these protocols to stop
 

2321
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,030
that we rely on these protocols to stop
some rogue element out there from

2322
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
some rogue element out there from
 

2323
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,069
some rogue element out there from
launching a

2324
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
launching a
 

2325
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,589
launching a
missile that could kill millions of

2326
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:53,599
missile that could kill millions of
 

2327
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,349
missile that could kill millions of
people and trigger

2328
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:55,359
people and trigger
 

2329
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,109
people and trigger
a global war so yeah the protocol should

2330
00:44:59,109 --> 00:44:59,119
a global war so yeah the protocol should
 

2331
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,750
a global war so yeah the protocol should
be strict

2332
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:01,760

 

2333
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,790

okay ask uh jacqueline a ridiculous

2334
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
okay ask uh jacqueline a ridiculous
 

2335
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,550

question
 

2337
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,349
question
if human civilization goes extinct what

2338
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
if human civilization goes extinct what
 

2339
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,630
if human civilization goes extinct what
would be the reason

2340
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
would be the reason
 

2341
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,589
would be the reason
you mention nuclear war do you worry

2342

you know what we we've made it through a
 

2415

and maybe he doesn't necessarily know
 

2947
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,270
and maybe he doesn't necessarily know
how to do everything a good leader

2948
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:43,280
how to do everything a good leader
 

2949
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,190
how to do everything a good leader

front line troops and say

that you said is he said when there's a

2962
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
that you said is he said when there's a
 

2963

problem
 

2965

problem
he gets in there so there's things

2966
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
he gets in there so there's things
 

2967

happening at his companies that
 

2969
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,390
happening at his companies that
they're working and so he doesn't have

2970
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400
they're working and so he doesn't have
 

2971
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,470
they're working and so he doesn't have
to die i'm not saying he never does but

00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,480
to die i'm not saying he never does but
 

2973
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,390
to die i'm not saying he never does but
he doesn't have to spend as much time

2974
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
he doesn't have to spend as much time
 

2975
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,589
he doesn't have to spend as much time
working on

2976
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599
working on
 

2977
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,549
working on
or or looking at some sub-system that's

2978
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:10,559
or or looking at some sub-system that's
 

2979
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:11,670
or or looking at some sub-system that's
functioning well

2980
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:11,680
functioning well
 

2981
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,109
functioning well
he's got a good leader in there that's

2982
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
he's got a good leader in there that's
 

2983
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,549
he's got a good leader in there that's
handling it and he checks in with that

2984
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:14,559
handling it and he checks in with that
 

2985
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:15,670
handling it and he checks in with that
leader and the leader says yeah it's

2986
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:15,680
leader and the leader says yeah it's
 

2987
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,990
leader and the leader says yeah it's
working perfectly he says great

2988
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,000
working perfectly he says great
 

2989
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,549
working perfectly he says great
that when there's a problem that's when

2990
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559
that when there's a problem that's when
 

2991
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,069
that when there's a problem that's when
he might have to get down there and dig

2992
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,079
he might have to get down there and dig
 

2993
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,670
he might have to get down there and dig
into some details so that he fully

2994
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:23,680
into some details so that he fully
 

2995
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,870
into some details so that he fully
understands it so that

2996
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:24,880
understands it so that
 

2997
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,349
understands it so that
he when he digs down in the details and

2998
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:27,359
he when he digs down in the details and
 

2999
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,430
he when he digs down in the details and
this is important

3000
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
this is important
 

3001
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,349
this is important
he's coming from an altitude where he

3002
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:31,359
he's coming from an altitude where he
 

3003
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,190
he's coming from an altitude where he
has a

3004
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,200
has a
 

3005
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,549
has a
better bigger perspective not

3006
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:34,559
better bigger perspective not
 

3007
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,670
better bigger perspective not
necessarily better but a bigger

3008
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:35,680
necessarily better but a bigger
 

3009
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,470
necessarily better but a bigger
perspective

3010
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
perspective
 

3011
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,549
perspective
so if you sit there and work on a

3012
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
so if you sit there and work on a
 

3013
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,990
so if you sit there and work on a
problem whatever

3014
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:40,000
problem whatever
 

3015
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,230
problem whatever
for eight hours and you're staring at

3016
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
for eight hours and you're staring at
 

3017
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,829
for eight hours and you're staring at
you know if you were planning a mission

3018
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:43,839
you know if you were planning a mission
 

3019
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:44,630
you know if you were planning a mission
and you were

3020
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:44,640
and you were
 

3021
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,630
and you were
you were planning it for eight hours

3022
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:46,640
you were planning it for eight hours
 

3023
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,670
you were planning it for eight hours
you're staring at the

3024
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
you're staring at the
 

3025
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,030
you're staring at the
the maps and the charts and you're

3026
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,040
the maps and the charts and you're
 

3027
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,069
the maps and the charts and you're
figuring out where all the troops are

3028
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:50,079
figuring out where all the troops are
 

3029
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,589
figuring out where all the troops are
going to be located

3030
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
going to be located
 

3031
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,349
going to be located
and i come in after eight hours and i

3032
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:53,359
and i come in after eight hours and i
 

3033
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,630
and i come in after eight hours and i
look at your plan

3034
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:54,640
look at your plan
 

3035
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,510
look at your plan
from a from a distant perspective

3036
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,520
from a from a distant perspective
 

3037
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,950
from a from a distant perspective
there's a good chance i'll be able to

3038
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:58,960
there's a good chance i'll be able to
 

3039
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,270
there's a good chance i'll be able to
see

3040
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,280
see
 

3041
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,950
see
holes in your plan that you couldn't see

3042
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:00,960
holes in your plan that you couldn't see
 

3043
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,910
holes in your plan that you couldn't see
because your perspective was too close

3044
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:03,920
because your perspective was too close
 

3045
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,150
because your perspective was too close
so so that's good for me to be able to

3046
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:06,160
so so that's good for me to be able to
 

3047
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,750
so so that's good for me to be able to
come in from a higher perspective and

3048
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:07,760
come in from a higher perspective and
 

3049
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,870
come in from a higher perspective and
have a look at it

3050
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,880
have a look at it
 

3051
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,230
have a look at it
but also there's times where

3052
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
but also there's times where
 

3053
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,910
but also there's times where
i need to get down there and actually

3054
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:13,920
i need to get down there and actually
 

3055
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,829
i need to get down there and actually
look you know if you're looking at a

3056
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
look you know if you're looking at a
 

3057
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,190
look you know if you're looking at a
problem you say look i can't figure out

3058
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,200
problem you say look i can't figure out
 

3059
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,549
problem you say look i can't figure out
boss i can't figure out how to get to

3060
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:18,559
boss i can't figure out how to get to
 

3061
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,910
boss i can't figure out how to get to
this target

3062
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:19,920
this target
 

3063
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,109
this target
and i'm looking at it from a distance

3064
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:21,119
and i'm looking at it from a distance
 

3065
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,549
and i'm looking at it from a distance
and i don't see i might need to start

3066
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:22,559
and i don't see i might need to start
 

3067
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:23,270
and i don't see i might need to start
digging in

3068
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
digging in
 

3069
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,910
digging in
and looking and saying oh here's a route

3070
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:25,920
and looking and saying oh here's a route
 

3071
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,430
and looking and saying oh here's a route
that we can take that actually makes

3072
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,440
that we can take that actually makes
 

3073
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,470
that we can take that actually makes
sense

3074
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:28,480
sense
 

3075
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,190
sense
let's try that so i think it's a good

3076
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:31,200
let's try that so i think it's a good
 

3077
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,589
let's try that so i think it's a good
example of someone

3078
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
example of someone
 

3079
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,069
example of someone
going up and down in altitude to look at

3080
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:36,079
going up and down in altitude to look at
 

3081
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,349
going up and down in altitude to look at
problems understanding what's happening

3082
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
problems understanding what's happening
 

3083
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,710
problems understanding what's happening
with the front-line troops and at the

3084
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:38,720
with the front-line troops and at the
 

3085
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,990
with the front-line troops and at the
same time being able to go

3086
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,000
same time being able to go
 

3087
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,030
same time being able to go
back to the strategic level and i can

3088
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,040
back to the strategic level and i can
 

3089
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,230
back to the strategic level and i can
it's probably this way the reason that

3090
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:46,240
it's probably this way the reason that
 

3091
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,750
it's probably this way the reason that
he's successful is because he doesn't

3092
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
he's successful is because he doesn't
 

3093
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,549
he's successful is because he doesn't
get stuck

3094
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:48,559
get stuck
 

3095
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,630
get stuck
down there yeah because if he felt the

3096
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:50,640
down there yeah because if he felt the
 

3097
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,030
down there yeah because if he felt the
need to micromanage each and every part

3098
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
need to micromanage each and every part
 

3099
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,109
need to micromanage each and every part
on a tesla

3100
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:55,119
on a tesla
 

3101
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,589
on a tesla
it wouldn't be it would be very unlikely

3102
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
it wouldn't be it would be very unlikely
 

3103
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,349
it wouldn't be it would be very unlikely
that he would have the capacity to do

3104
00:57:59,349 --> 00:57:59,359
that he would have the capacity to do
 

3105
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:00,630
that he would have the capacity to do
all that

3106
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:00,640
all that
 

3107
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,910
all that
now he can hand over some broad

3108
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:03,920
now he can hand over some broad
 

3109
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,510
now he can hand over some broad
chip design and say hey this is what the

3110
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:05,520
chip design and say hey this is what the
 

3111
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,789
chip design and say hey this is what the
function needs to be and he gives it to

3112
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
function needs to be and he gives it to
 

3113
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,150
function needs to be and he gives it to
lex and lex goes there with your team

3114
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:08,160
lex and lex goes there with your team
 

3115
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,109
lex and lex goes there with your team
and you figured out and you make it

3116
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
and you figured out and you make it
 

3117
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:09,910
and you figured out and you make it
happen

3118
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:09,920
happen
 

3119
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,109
happen
if he had to actually do that all

3120
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:11,119
if he had to actually do that all
 

3121
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,309
if he had to actually do that all
himself most likely not possible

3122
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:14,319
himself most likely not possible
 

3123
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,309
himself most likely not possible
so that's what leaders should be doing

3124
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
so that's what leaders should be doing
 

3125
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,069
so that's what leaders should be doing
they should go elevate and

3126
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:18,079
they should go elevate and
 

3127
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,390
they should go elevate and
and and then get down in the weeds when

3128
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
and and then get down in the weeds when
 

3129
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,950
and and then get down in the weeds when
they have to and then go back up

3130
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
they have to and then go back up
 

3131
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,990
they have to and then go back up
the sad thing this is the part that

3132
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,000
the sad thing this is the part that
 

3133
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,789
the sad thing this is the part that
makes me not want to do a startup

3134
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:28,799
makes me not want to do a startup
 

3135
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:32,150
makes me not want to do a startup
is basically his whole life is dealing

3136
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
is basically his whole life is dealing
 

3137
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,430
is basically his whole life is dealing
with emergencies

3138
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
with emergencies
 

3139
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,870
with emergencies
just like you said he's not dealing

3140
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:36,880
just like you said he's not dealing
 

3141
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,710
just like you said he's not dealing
this is not shooting the [\h__\h] about

3142
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:38,720
this is not shooting the [\h__\h] about
 

3143
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,630
this is not shooting the [\h__\h] about
details of engineering

3144
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:40,640
details of engineering
 

3145
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,190
details of engineering
it's dealing with like in this in the

3146
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:43,200
it's dealing with like in this in the
 

3147
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,309
it's dealing with like in this in the
case of the company

3148
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:44,319
case of the company
 

3149
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:47,349
case of the company
life and death like something that can

3150
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:47,359
life and death like something that can
 

3151
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:47,750
life and death like something that can
just

3152
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:47,760
just
 

3153
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,990
just
completely damage the production line

3154
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:50,000
completely damage the production line
 

3155
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,430
completely damage the production line
right so he's constantly dealing with

3156
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:51,440
right so he's constantly dealing with
 

3157
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,589
right so he's constantly dealing with
emergencies putting out fires

3158
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:53,599
emergencies putting out fires
 

3159
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,510
emergencies putting out fires
and um i don't know if there's something

3160
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:55,520
and um i don't know if there's something
 

3161
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,510
and um i don't know if there's something
to be said about the psychology of that

3162
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:57,520
to be said about the psychology of that
 

3163
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,549
to be said about the psychology of that
of how uh like he he's spoken himself

3164
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:00,559
of how uh like he he's spoken himself
 

3165
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,510
of how uh like he he's spoken himself
that he's worried

3166
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:01,520
that he's worried
 

3167
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,710
that he's worried
whether his mind can hold up much longer

3168
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
whether his mind can hold up much longer
 

3169
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,349
whether his mind can hold up much longer
so hopefully in the near future he will

3170
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
so hopefully in the near future he will
 

3171
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:07,910
so hopefully in the near future he will
start to

3172
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:07,920
start to
 

3173
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,390
start to
form more decentralized command where he

3174
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
form more decentralized command where he
 

3175
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,990
form more decentralized command where he
has some subordinate leadership

3176
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
has some subordinate leadership
 

3177
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,470
has some subordinate leadership
that he fully trusts and most important

3178
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:14,480
that he fully trusts and most important
 

3179
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,470
that he fully trusts and most important
that he has properly trained

3180
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:16,480
that he has properly trained
 

3181
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,230
that he has properly trained
so that they can handle these day-to-day

3182
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:18,240
so that they can handle these day-to-day
 

3183
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,510
so that they can handle these day-to-day
fires at least

3184
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:19,520
fires at least
 

3185
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,309
fires at least
80 percent of them so only 20 of the

3186
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:22,319
80 percent of them so only 20 of the
 

3187
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,190
80 percent of them so only 20 of the
time

3188
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:23,200
time
 

3189
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,190
time
does he actually need to go and solve a

3190
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:25,200
does he actually need to go and solve a
 

3191
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,230
does he actually need to go and solve a
problem

3192
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:26,240
problem
 

3193
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,789
problem
if he's not doing that right now then

3194
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:28,799
if he's not doing that right now then
 

3195
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,950
if he's not doing that right now then
that's going to end up being a problem

3196
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:30,960
that's going to end up being a problem
 

3197
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,630
that's going to end up being a problem
anytime so i work with companies all the

3198
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:32,640
anytime so i work with companies all the
 

3199
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,990
anytime so i work with companies all the
time and that's what's interesting about

3200
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
time and that's what's interesting about
 

3201
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,710
time and that's what's interesting about
this is

3202
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
this is
 

3203
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,270
this is
i go and work with a ceo or with a with

3204
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:37,280
i go and work with a ceo or with a with
 

3205
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,630
i go and work with a ceo or with a with
the c-suite of a company

3206
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
the c-suite of a company
 

3207
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,990
the c-suite of a company
it takes a little while to figure out

3208
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:40,000
it takes a little while to figure out
 

3209
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,150
it takes a little while to figure out
what's going on i'm kind of going off of

3210
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:42,160
what's going on i'm kind of going off of
 

3211
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,430
what's going on i'm kind of going off of
the things that you're telling me

3212
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:43,440
the things that you're telling me
 

3213
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,069
the things that you're telling me
yeah almost anecdotally right yes but

3214
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:46,079
yeah almost anecdotally right yes but
 

3215
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,430
yeah almost anecdotally right yes but
let's say that what you get

3216
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
let's say that what you get
 

3217
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,750
let's say that what you get
and also i don't know how familiar you

3218
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:49,760
and also i don't know how familiar you
 

3219
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,030
and also i don't know how familiar you
actually are with the

3220
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,040
actually are with the
 

3221
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,990
actually are with the
inner workings of his companies but

3222
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000

 

3223
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,270

if we were to assume that what you're

3224
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:57,280
if we were to assume that what you're
 

3225
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,430
if we were to assume that what you're
saying is accurate then my advice would

3226
00:59:59,430 --> 00:59:59,440
saying is accurate then my advice would
 

3227
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,190
saying is accurate then my advice would
be hey listen

3228
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,200
be hey listen
 

3229
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,390
be hey listen
you need to start putting a little bit

3230
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
you need to start putting a little bit
 

3231
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,069
you need to start putting a little bit
more time and effort into training up

3232
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079
more time and effort into training up
 

3233
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,390
more time and effort into training up
some subordinate leadership that has the

3234
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:06,400
some subordinate leadership that has the
 

3235
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,670
some subordinate leadership that has the
trust knowledge and expertise that you

3236
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:09,680
trust knowledge and expertise that you
 

3237
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,349
trust knowledge and expertise that you
will be able to turn over

3238
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:11,359
will be able to turn over
 

3239
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,069
will be able to turn over
some of these some of these details too

3240
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:14,079
some of these some of these details too
 

3241
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,910
some of these some of these details too
for two reasons number one so you can

3242
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:15,920
for two reasons number one so you can
 

3243
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,230
for two reasons number one so you can
let your brain um you know you can you

3244
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:18,240
let your brain um you know you can you
 

3245
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,309
let your brain um you know you can you
can survive a little longer as he put it

3246
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:20,319
can survive a little longer as he put it
 

3247
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:21,510
can survive a little longer as he put it
but also

3248
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:21,520
but also
 

3249
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,190
but also
all the time that you spend as a leader

3250
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:23,200
all the time that you spend as a leader
 

3251
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,349
all the time that you spend as a leader
looking down and into your organization

3252
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:25,359
looking down and into your organization
 

3253
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:26,710
looking down and into your organization
is time that you're not looking up and

3254
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:26,720
is time that you're not looking up and
 

3255
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,270
is time that you're not looking up and
out

3256
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,280
out
 

3257
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,630
out
so when you're not looking up and out

3258
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:28,640
so when you're not looking up and out
 

3259
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,470
so when you're not looking up and out
you're not seeing what the competitor's

3260
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:30,480
you're not seeing what the competitor's
 

3261
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,589
you're not seeing what the competitor's
doing you're not seeing where the

3262

4148
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
first of all everything's a dichotomy
 

4149
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,149
first of all everything's a dichotomy
right and so

4150
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:58,159
right and so
 

4151
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,470
right and so
to think that all the time you're always

4152
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
to think that all the time you're always
 

4153
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,310
to think that all the time you're always
going to be able to

4154
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:02,320
going to be able to
 

4155
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,910
going to be able to
just bark orders at people and they're

4156
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
just bark orders at people and they're
 

4157
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,110
just bark orders at people and they're
always going to listen to you and you're

4158
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:05,120
always going to listen to you and you're
 

4159
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,229
always going to listen to you and you're
always going to get the best result

4160
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:06,239
always going to get the best result
 

4161
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,630
always going to get the best result
that would not be smart to think that

4162
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:08,640
that would not be smart to think that
 

4163
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,750
that would not be smart to think that
every single time

4164
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:09,760
every single time
 

4165
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,390
every single time
you're going to come to a 100 consensus

4166
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
you're going to come to a 100 consensus
 

4167
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,070
you're going to come to a 100 consensus
amongst the troops

4168
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:14,080
amongst the troops
 

4169
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,750
amongst the troops
and that decision is going to reveal

4170
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:15,760
and that decision is going to reveal
 

4171
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,990
and that decision is going to reveal
itself without you nudging it along

4172
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,000
itself without you nudging it along
 

4173
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,350
itself without you nudging it along
that would also be short-sighted and

4174
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,360
that would also be short-sighted and
 

4175
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,149
that would also be short-sighted and
naive so what you what a good leader

4176
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:24,159
naive so what you what a good leader
 

4177
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,350
naive so what you what a good leader
does is they

they can they listen to what the troops
have to say

4184
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:30,320
have to say
 

4185

have to say
they take that feedback maybe they

4186
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
they take that feedback maybe they
 

4187
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,790
they take that feedback maybe they
quietly nudge things and

does some nudging that
 

4193
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,790
does some nudging that

01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,350
put that confidence into check we have
to put that ego in a check

4666
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,360
to put that ego in a check
