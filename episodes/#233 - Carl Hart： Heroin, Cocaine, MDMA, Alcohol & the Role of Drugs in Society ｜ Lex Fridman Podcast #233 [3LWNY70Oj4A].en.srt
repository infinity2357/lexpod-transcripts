00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
and that's just not how it works uh you
 

167
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,390
and that's just not how it works uh you
need the environment you need the cage

168
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
need the environment you need the cage
 

169
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,110
need the environment you need the cage
as they say if you don't have the cage

170
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
as they say if you don't have the cage
 

171
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,509
as they say if you don't have the cage
you don't get the full extent of the

172
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
you don't get the full extent of the
 

173
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,309
you don't get the full extent of the
effects and so like you can take mdma

174
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
effects and so like you can take mdma
 

175
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,309
effects and so like you can take mdma
and have an awful time you can have a

176
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
and have an awful time you can have a
 

177
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,550
and have an awful time you can have a
time in which uh which you get paranoid

178
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
time in which uh which you get paranoid
 

179
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,949
time in which uh which you get paranoid
and so forth and then

180
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
and so forth and then
 

181
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,710
and so forth and then
you can take it that drug under the

182
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
you can take it that drug under the
 

183
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,869
you can take it that drug under the
right conditions and it'd just be like

184
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
right conditions and it'd just be like
 

185
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,789
right conditions and it'd just be like
one of the best moments you've ever had

186
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
one of the best moments you've ever had
 

187
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,710
one of the best moments you've ever had
it certainly enhanced

188
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
it certainly enhanced
 

189
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,910
it certainly enhanced
um a number of my relationships but i've

190
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
um a number of my relationships but i've
 

191
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,229
um a number of my relationships but i've
also had some times with mdma that

192
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
also had some times with mdma that
 

193
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,229
also had some times with mdma that
haven't been so lovely when the people

194
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
haven't been so lovely when the people
 

195
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,710
haven't been so lovely when the people
who you are hanging out with

196
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
who you are hanging out with
 

197
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,470
who you are hanging out with
you don't know them you're distrustful

198
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
you don't know them you're distrustful
 

199
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,710
you don't know them you're distrustful
and all of those kind of things so

200
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
and all of those kind of things so
 

201
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,869
and all of those kind of things so
it's important to put context in it now

202
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
it's important to put context in it now
 

203
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,350
it's important to put context in it now
we can talk about drugs at a biochemical

204
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
we can talk about drugs at a biochemical
 

205
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,589
we can talk about drugs at a biochemical
level at a biological level and we kind

206
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
level at a biological level and we kind
 

207
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,030
level at a biological level and we kind
of do that in this country with this

208
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
of do that in this country with this
 

209
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,949
of do that in this country with this
fascination with neuroscience

210
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
fascination with neuroscience
 

211
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,630
fascination with neuroscience
and um

212
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
and um
 

213
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,309
and um
that's an inappropriate kind of

214
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
that's an inappropriate kind of
 

215
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,030
that's an inappropriate kind of
fascination the way in the way we talk

216
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
fascination the way in the way we talk
 

217
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,550
fascination the way in the way we talk
about it so we can talk about opioids

218
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
about it so we can talk about opioids
 

219
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,229
about it so we can talk about opioids
and then we can talk about

220
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
and then we can talk about
 

221
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,110
and then we can talk about
endogenous opioid system in the brain we

222
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
endogenous opioid system in the brain we
 

223
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,429
endogenous opioid system in the brain we
can talk about dopamine and other sort

224
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
can talk about dopamine and other sort
 

225
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,150
can talk about dopamine and other sort
of

226
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
of
 

227
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,030
of
monoamine transmitters and and what uh

228
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
monoamine transmitters and and what uh
 

229
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,349
monoamine transmitters and and what uh
opioids are doing to them and we can do

230
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
opioids are doing to them and we can do
 

231
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,790
opioids are doing to them and we can do
the same thing with mdma um and

232
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
the same thing with mdma um and
 

233
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,749
the same thing with mdma um and
we won't be any closer to understanding

234
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
we won't be any closer to understanding
 

235
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,350
we won't be any closer to understanding
the sort of uh

236
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
the sort of uh
 

237
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,070
the sort of uh
experience that is induced by these

238
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
experience that is induced by these
 

239
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,230
experience that is induced by these
drugs certainly the experience that we

240
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
drugs certainly the experience that we
 

241
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,550
drugs certainly the experience that we
all seek you know what i'm saying so

242
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
all seek you know what i'm saying so
 

243
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,230
all seek you know what i'm saying so
getting a positive experience or getting

244
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
getting a positive experience or getting
 

245
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,830
getting a positive experience or getting
a negative experience is strongly

246
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
a negative experience is strongly
 

247
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,390
a negative experience is strongly
defined by the environment strongly

248
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
defined by the environment strongly
 

249
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,629
defined by the environment strongly
dependent upon that but the environment

250
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
dependent upon that but the environment
 

251
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,749
dependent upon that but the environment
is a very

252
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
is a very
 

253
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,590
is a very
it's a short word that can describe a

254
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
it's a short word that can describe a
 

255
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,790
it's a short word that can describe a
lot of things

256
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
lot of things
 

257
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,830
lot of things
so

258
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
so
 

259
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,430
so
would you say the environment is

260
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
would you say the environment is
 

261
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,030
would you say the environment is
important are the people

262
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
important are the people
 

263
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,510
important are the people
where you are currently in your life

264
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
where you are currently in your life
 

265
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,430
where you are currently in your life
or is it also dependent on the full

266
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
or is it also dependent on the full
 

267
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,670
or is it also dependent on the full
trajectory of your psychology of your

268
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
trajectory of your psychology of your
 

269
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,430
trajectory of your psychology of your
life experiences of your parents or the

270
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
life experiences of your parents or the
 

271
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,749
life experiences of your parents or the
people you came up with of the trauma

272
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
people you came up with of the trauma
 

273
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,990
people you came up with of the trauma
you've experienced of the hopes and

274
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
you've experienced of the hopes and
 

275
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,710
you've experienced of the hopes and
dreams that were crushed or or or not or

276
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
dreams that were crushed or or or not or
 

277
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,029
dreams that were crushed or or or not or
the opposite or the success levels or

278
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
the opposite or the success levels or
 

279
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,550
the opposite or the success levels or
all those things like what

280
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
all those things like what
 

281
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,629
all those things like what
what are the interesting sort of uh

282
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
what are the interesting sort of uh
 

283
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,110
what are the interesting sort of uh
landscape of experiences that contribute

284
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
landscape of experiences that contribute
 

285
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,950
landscape of experiences that contribute
to how you actually

286
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
to how you actually
 

287
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,350
to how you actually
feel when you take a drug right on

288
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
feel when you take a drug right on
 

289
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,430
feel when you take a drug right on
so all of those things are important but

290
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
so all of those things are important but
 

291
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,430
so all of those things are important but
you know like if someone had trauma in

292
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
you know like if someone had trauma in
 

293
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,510
you know like if someone had trauma in
childhood and they did the work and they

294
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
childhood and they did the work and they
 

295
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,590
childhood and they did the work and they
dealt with it that's not so important in

296
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
dealt with it that's not so important in
 

297
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,510
dealt with it that's not so important in
this case but if they didn't deal with

298
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
this case but if they didn't deal with
 

299
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,909
this case but if they didn't deal with
it and that trauma is being triggered in

300
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
it and that trauma is being triggered in
 

301
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,270
it and that trauma is being triggered in
that event

302
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
that event
 

303
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,790
that event
in that moment

304
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
in that moment
 

305
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,189
in that moment
then it's important but let's just take

306
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
then it's important but let's just take
 

307
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,469
then it's important but let's just take
somebody like me

308
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
somebody like me
 

309
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,189
somebody like me
i'm 54 years old i'll be 55 this month

310
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
i'm 54 years old i'll be 55 this month
 

311
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,189
i'm 54 years old i'll be 55 this month
actually and um

312
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
actually and um
 

313
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,350
actually and um
you know i've done a lot of work in

314
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
you know i've done a lot of work in
 

315
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,310
you know i've done a lot of work in
terms of figuring out who i am and i'm

316
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
terms of figuring out who i am and i'm
 

317
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,550
terms of figuring out who i am and i'm
comfortable with myself

318
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
comfortable with myself
 

319
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,309
comfortable with myself
and i know how to set limits for

320
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
and i know how to set limits for
 

321
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,230
and i know how to set limits for
whatever it is i'm doing

322
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
whatever it is i'm doing
 

323
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,150
whatever it is i'm doing
um and so

324
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
um and so
 

325
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,629
um and so
i know i need to work out i know i need

326
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
i know i need to work out i know i need

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,189
i think like you also mentioned in the
book and elsewhere you know people have

book and elsewhere you know people have
 

445
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,150
book and elsewhere you know people have
come around to maybe psilocybin

446
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
come around to maybe psilocybin
 

447
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,110
come around to maybe psilocybin
uh being one such drug maybe cannabis

448
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
uh being one such drug maybe cannabis
 

449
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,029
uh being one such drug maybe cannabis
being once this drug but you also

450
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
being once this drug but you also
 

451
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,350
being once this drug but you also
mention other drugs like cocaine heroin

452
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
mention other drugs like cocaine heroin
 

453

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,869
um can you just linger on this point
how

458
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
how
 

459
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,550
how
do we get the positive effects of those

460
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
do we get the positive effects of those
 

461
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,709
do we get the positive effects of those
drugs and why in the media and the

462
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
drugs and why in the media and the
 

463
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,230
drugs and why in the media and the
general conception we have of these

464
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
general conception we have of these
 

465
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,670
general conception we have of these
drugs is that they were going to

466
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
drugs is that they were going to
 

467
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,310
drugs is that they were going to
make a bad life worse or ruin a good

well so your first question was how do

472
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
well so your first question was how do
 

473
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,910
well so your first question was how do
we

474
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
we
 

475
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,710
we
harness the positive effects how do we

476
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
harness the positive effects how do we
 

477
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,150
harness the positive effects how do we
increase the likelihood of getting the

478
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
increase the likelihood of getting the
 

479
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,030
increase the likelihood of getting the
positive effects again like i said we

480
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
positive effects again like i said we
 

481
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,230
positive effects again like i said we
want to make sure that people are

482
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
want to make sure that people are
 

483
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,470
want to make sure that people are
responsible and they've handled their

484
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
responsible and they've handled their
 

485
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,790
responsible and they've handled their
responsibilities make sure they eat well

486
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
responsibilities make sure they eat well
 

487
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,949
responsibilities make sure they eat well
sleep will exercise all of those sorts

488
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
sleep will exercise all of those sorts
 

489
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,350
sleep will exercise all of those sorts
of things play an important point role

490
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
of things play an important point role

the substance itself
 

513
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,110
the substance itself
it increases the likelihood that you

514
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
it increases the likelihood that you
 

515
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,190
it increases the likelihood that you
will have a better time so anxiety is

516
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
will have a better time so anxiety is
 

517
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,550
will have a better time so anxiety is
the big one you need to remove the

518
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
the big one you need to remove the
 

519
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,030
the big one you need to remove the
anxiety anxiety is critical

520
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
anxiety anxiety is critical
 

521
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,949
anxiety anxiety is critical
it's huge

522
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
it's huge
 

523
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,710
it's huge
many of the negative effects that we see

524
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
many of the negative effects that we see
 

525
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,670
many of the negative effects that we see
with drugs have to do with anxiety and

526
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
with drugs have to do with anxiety and
 

527
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,910
with drugs have to do with anxiety and
not necessarily anxiety because the drug

528
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
not necessarily anxiety because the drug
 

529
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,310
not necessarily anxiety because the drug
induced it it's the anxiety that the

530
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
induced it it's the anxiety that the
 

531
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,190
induced it it's the anxiety that the
situation induced a lot of times

532
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
situation induced a lot of times
 

533
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,670
situation induced a lot of times
and then you ask like well why does this

534
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
and then you ask like well why does this
 

535
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,389
and then you ask like well why does this
sound counter-intuitive why

536
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
sound counter-intuitive why
 

537
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,470
sound counter-intuitive why
does the media

538
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
does the media
 

539
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,949
does the media
report uh differently

540
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
report uh differently
 

541
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,190
report uh differently
well because it's money in reporting the

542
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
well because it's money in reporting the
 

543
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,150
well because it's money in reporting the
negative effects almost exclusively

544
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
negative effects almost exclusively
 

545
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,509
negative effects almost exclusively
think about

546
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
think about
 

547
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,150
think about
writing a newspaper article

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
writing a newspaper article
 

549
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,710

talking about overdose you don't even
 

561
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,829
talking about overdose you don't even
have to say why people are dying from

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
with research grants that's public
 

977
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,669
with research grants that's public
that's funded by the public taxpayers

978
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
that's funded by the public taxpayers
 

979
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,549
that's funded by the public taxpayers
dollars do you think we would be allowed

980
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
dollars do you think we would be allowed
 

981
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,350
dollars do you think we would be allowed
to do this if these drugs were so

982
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
to do this if these drugs were so
 

983
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,350
to do this if these drugs were so
dangerous

984
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
dangerous
 

985
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,070
dangerous
it's just nonsense i mean and the drugs

986
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
it's just nonsense i mean and the drugs
 

987
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,669
it's just nonsense i mean and the drugs
we're talking about

988
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
we're talking about
 

989
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,110
we're talking about
they are all

990
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
they are all
 

991
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,470
they are all
approved for medical use somewhere in

992
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
approved for medical use somewhere in
 

993
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,630
approved for medical use somewhere in
the world

994
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
the world
 

995
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,230
the world
and the studies you conduct are

996
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
and the studies you conduct are
 

997
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,789
and the studies you conduct are
basically asking what kinds of questions

998
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:44,799
basically asking what kinds of questions
 

999
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,310
basically asking what kinds of questions
so you take

1000
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
so you take
 

1001
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,150
so you take
uh the full range of drugs you're

1002
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
uh the full range of drugs you're
 

1003
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,710
uh the full range of drugs you're
talking about uh from from marijuana to

1004
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
talking about uh from from marijuana to
 

1005
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,990
talking about uh from from marijuana to
cell cybin to mdma to cocaine and heroin

1006
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
cell cybin to mdma to cocaine and heroin
 

1007
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,590
cell cybin to mdma to cocaine and heroin
what is the study looking at like what

1008
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
what is the study looking at like what
 

1009
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,190
what is the study looking at like what
the actual experience with the positive

1010
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
the actual experience with the positive
 

1011
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,630
the actual experience with the positive
and negative effects of the experience

1012
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
and negative effects of the experience
 

1013
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,909
and negative effects of the experience
on the drug are

1014
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
on the drug are
 

1015
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,710
on the drug are
in uh controlled conditions yeah so we

1016
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
in uh controlled conditions yeah so we
 

1017
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,470
in uh controlled conditions yeah so we
did these kind of experiments with

1018
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
did these kind of experiments with
 

1019
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,590
did these kind of experiments with
alcohol

1020
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
alcohol
 

1021
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,750
alcohol
nicotine all these drugs in order to

1022
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
nicotine all these drugs in order to
 

1023
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,110
nicotine all these drugs in order to
have an empirical database

1024
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
have an empirical database
 

1025
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,669
have an empirical database
to tell people um

1026
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
to tell people um
 

1027
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,270
to tell people um
exactly what these drugs do and what

1028
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
exactly what these drugs do and what
 

1029
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,230
exactly what these drugs do and what
they don't do the conditions under which

1030
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
they don't do the conditions under which
 

1031
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,390
they don't do the conditions under which
the drugs will produce positive effects

1032
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
the drugs will produce positive effects
 

1033
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,230
the drugs will produce positive effects
the conditions under which the drugs

1034
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
the conditions under which the drugs
 

1035
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,070
the conditions under which the drugs
were more likely to produce negative

1036
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
were more likely to produce negative
 

1037
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,029
were more likely to produce negative
effects

1038
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
effects
 

1039
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,350
effects
all of this information is important for

1040
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
all of this information is important for
 

1041
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,270
all of this information is important for
a society to know

1042
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
a society to know
 

1043
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,590
a society to know
and we do know and and that's why we're

1044
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
and we do know and and that's why we're
 

1045
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,909
and we do know and and that's why we're
collecting the data we're collecting the

1046
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
collecting the data we're collecting the
 

1047
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,390
collecting the data we're collecting the
data it to help us

1048
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
data it to help us
 

1049
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,310
data it to help us
with treatment if someone is having

1050
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
with treatment if someone is having
 

1051
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,549
with treatment if someone is having
problems with these data

1052
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
problems with these data
 

1053
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,029
problems with these data
hopefully we'll uh understand

1054
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
hopefully we'll uh understand
 

1055
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,110
hopefully we'll uh understand
more about the

1056
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
more about the
 

1057
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,310
more about the
how to

1058
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
how to
 

1059
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,549
how to
help them deal with their problems based

1060
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
help them deal with their problems based
 

1061
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,390
help them deal with their problems based
on some of the research that we're doing

1062
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
on some of the research that we're doing
 

1063
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,990
on some of the research that we're doing
so what kind of negative effects are we

1064
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
so what kind of negative effects are we
 

1065
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,990
so what kind of negative effects are we
looking out for like what what are the

1066
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
looking out for like what what are the
 

1067
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,669
looking out for like what what are the
properties of drugs we should be careful

1068
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
properties of drugs we should be careful
 

1069
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,750
properties of drugs we should be careful
about is it addictive properties how

1070
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
about is it addictive properties how
 

1071

addictive it is how
 

1073
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,470
addictive it is how
how uh destructive or painful whatever

1074
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
how uh destructive or painful whatever

the
 

1079
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,110
the
withdrawal processes

1080
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
withdrawal processes
 

1081
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,310
withdrawal processes
what kind of things are we looking out

1082
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
what kind of things are we looking out
 

1083
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,310
what kind of things are we looking out
for yeah those are certain kind of

1084
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
for yeah those are certain kind of
 

1085
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,669
for yeah those are certain kind of
questions we certainly have asked

1086
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
questions we certainly have asked
 

1087
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,909
questions we certainly have asked
because like uh something like cry

1088
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
because like uh something like cry
 

1089
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,110
because like uh something like cry
cocaine versus alcohol or

1090
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
cocaine versus alcohol or
 

1091
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,149
cocaine versus alcohol or
heroin when it comes to uh withdrawal of

1092
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
heroin when it comes to uh withdrawal of
 

1093
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,789
heroin when it comes to uh withdrawal of
physical dependence like cocaine has a

1094
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
physical dependence like cocaine has a
 

1095
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,350
physical dependence like cocaine has a
very limited sort of uh withdrawal

1096
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
very limited sort of uh withdrawal
 

1097
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,830
very limited sort of uh withdrawal
symptoms i mean it's hard to see uh same

1098
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
symptoms i mean it's hard to see uh same
 

1099
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,149
symptoms i mean it's hard to see uh same
is true with methamphetamine but uh with

1100
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159
is true with methamphetamine but uh with
 

1101
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,830
is true with methamphetamine but uh with
heroin you certainly can see a

1102
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
heroin you certainly can see a
 

1103
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,909
heroin you certainly can see a
withdrawal syndrome that's displeasing

1104
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
withdrawal syndrome that's displeasing
 

1105
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,350
withdrawal syndrome that's displeasing
that's unpleasant

1106
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
that's unpleasant
 

1107
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,750
that's unpleasant
but with alcohol that would draw

1108
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
but with alcohol that would draw
 

1109
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,230
but with alcohol that would draw
can actually kill you so heroin is

1110
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
can actually kill you so heroin is
 

1111
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,710
can actually kill you so heroin is
unpleasant and not lovely but with

1112
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
unpleasant and not lovely but with
 

1113
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,710
unpleasant and not lovely but with
alcohol withdrawal that's the one that's

1114
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
alcohol withdrawal that's the one that's
 

1115
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,470
alcohol withdrawal that's the one that's
the most dangerous i mean all of these

1116
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
the most dangerous i mean all of these
 

1117
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,590
the most dangerous i mean all of these
kind of questions we want to know um

1118
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
kind of questions we want to know um
 

1119
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,870
kind of questions we want to know um
answers to uh and and so when we think

1120
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
answers to uh and and so when we think
 

1121
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,350
answers to uh and and so when we think
about uh heroin or some other drugs and

1122
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
about uh heroin or some other drugs and
 

1123
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,870
about uh heroin or some other drugs and
you say like what kind of negative

1124
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
you say like what kind of negative
 

1125
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,029
you say like what kind of negative
effects negative effects we don't talk

1126
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
effects negative effects we don't talk
 

1127
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,510
effects negative effects we don't talk
about much in the society the main thing

1128
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
about much in the society the main thing
 

1129
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,190
about much in the society the main thing
that really concerns me about like

1130
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
that really concerns me about like
 

1131
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,789
that really concerns me about like
heroin use really is constipation so if

1132
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
heroin use really is constipation so if
 

1133
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,149
heroin use really is constipation so if
people uh are using uh heroin on a

1134
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
people uh are using uh heroin on a
 

1135
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,789
people uh are using uh heroin on a
regular basis and then they have a sort

1136
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799
regular basis and then they have a sort
 

1137
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,549
regular basis and then they have a sort
of slowing of their gut motility they're

of slowing of their gut motility they're
 

1139
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,230
of slowing of their gut motility they're
in they're likely to increase

1140
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
in they're likely to increase
 

1141
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,870
in they're likely to increase
constipation and that's not good i mean

1142
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
constipation and that's not good i mean
 

1143
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,669
constipation and that's not good i mean
for your general health but we never

1144
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
for your general health but we never
 

1145
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,669
for your general health but we never
talk about that in this society and

1146
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
talk about that in this society and
 

1147
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,789
talk about that in this society and
that's probably the most important thing

1148
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
that's probably the most important thing
 

1149
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,110
that's probably the most important thing
aside from the fact that people get

1150
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
aside from the fact that people get
 

1151
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,029
aside from the fact that people get
contaminated street drugs and that sort

1152
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039
contaminated street drugs and that sort
 

1153
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,789
contaminated street drugs and that sort
of stuff and increase the likelihood of

1154
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
of stuff and increase the likelihood of
 

1155
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,390
of stuff and increase the likelihood of
maybe dying from some contaminant or

1156
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
maybe dying from some contaminant or
 

1157
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,390
maybe dying from some contaminant or
people who are inexperienced and they're

1158
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,400
people who are inexperienced and they're

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,470
people who are inexperienced and they're
mixing heroin with other sedatives

1160
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
mixing heroin with other sedatives
 

1161
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,590
mixing heroin with other sedatives
that's not good but the constipation

1162
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
that's not good but the constipation
 

1163
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,110
that's not good but the constipation
is a huge one um and then other sort of

1164
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
is a huge one um and then other sort of
 

1165
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,310
is a huge one um and then other sort of
drugs negative effects um like the

1166
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
drugs negative effects um like the
 

1167
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,230
drugs negative effects um like the
amphetamines all of the amphetamines

1168
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
amphetamines all of the amphetamines
 

1169
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,230
amphetamines all of the amphetamines
they differ they disrupt sleep food

1170
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
they differ they disrupt sleep food
 

1171
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,789
they differ they disrupt sleep food
intake all of these things are so

1172
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
intake all of these things are so
 

1173
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,510
intake all of these things are so
critical for sustaining human life

1174
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
critical for sustaining human life
 

1175
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,190
critical for sustaining human life
but we never talk about that because

1176
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
but we never talk about that because
 

1177
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,909
but we never talk about that because
it's not as sexy as this nonsense that

1178
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:05,919
it's not as sexy as this nonsense that
 

1179
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,990
it's not as sexy as this nonsense that
people write about like addiction

1180
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000
people write about like addiction
 

1181
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,149
people write about like addiction
addiction has almost nothing to do with

1182
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
addiction has almost nothing to do with
 

1183
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,990
addiction has almost nothing to do with
the drugs themselves and i make that

1184
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
the drugs themselves and i make that
 

1185
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,110
the drugs themselves and i make that
comment because um the vast majority

1186
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
comment because um the vast majority
 

1187
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,990
comment because um the vast majority
abuser for users for any drug

1188
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
abuser for users for any drug
 

1189
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,630
abuser for users for any drug
never become addicted and so if the vast

1190
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
never become addicted and so if the vast
 

1191
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,870
never become addicted and so if the vast
majority of users don't become addicted

1192
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880
majority of users don't become addicted
 

1193
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,029
majority of users don't become addicted
then you have to move beyond the drug

1194
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
then you have to move beyond the drug
 

1195
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,029
then you have to move beyond the drug
when you're talking about the phenomena

1196
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
when you're talking about the phenomena
 

1197
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,750
when you're talking about the phenomena
interest in this case addiction and and

1198
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
interest in this case addiction and and
 

1199
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,990
interest in this case addiction and and
so when we think about addiction it has

1200
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
so when we think about addiction it has
 

1201
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,390
so when we think about addiction it has
much more to do with our psychosocial

1202
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
much more to do with our psychosocial
 

1203
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,789
much more to do with our psychosocial
environment than the drug itself

1204
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
environment than the drug itself
 

1205
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,390
environment than the drug itself
but that's not sexy

1206
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
but that's not sexy
 

1207
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,630
but that's not sexy
so addiction is even the property of the

1208
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
so addiction is even the property of the
 

1209
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,190
so addiction is even the property of the
environment not a property um a result

1210
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
environment not a property um a result
 

1211
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,190
environment not a property um a result
of the environment it certainly can be

1212
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
of the environment it certainly can be
 

1213
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,190
of the environment it certainly can be
there are people who are

1214
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
there are people who are
 

1215
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,230
there are people who are
suffering from uh uh co-occurring mental

1216
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
suffering from uh uh co-occurring mental
 

1217
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,710
suffering from uh uh co-occurring mental
illness like uh depression anxiety i

1218
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
illness like uh depression anxiety i
 

1219
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,350
illness like uh depression anxiety i
mean that's within the person of course

1220
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
mean that's within the person of course
 

1221
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,350
mean that's within the person of course
and that increases the likelihood for

1222
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
and that increases the likelihood for
 

1223
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,070
and that increases the likelihood for
addiction so that could that's um

1224
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
addiction so that could that's um
 

1225
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,669
addiction so that could that's um
not so much the environment but there

1226
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
not so much the environment but there
 

1227
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,870
not so much the environment but there
are people who

1228
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
are people who
 

1229
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,110

unrealistic expectations heaped on them
 

1233
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,070
unrealistic expectations heaped on them
and those people are more likely to have

1234
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
and those people are more likely to have
 

1235
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,830
and those people are more likely to have
some problems with drugs

1236
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
some problems with drugs
 

1237
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,230
some problems with drugs
there are people who are just immature

all of these kind of issues are far more

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
all of these kind of issues are far more
 

1265
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,390
all of these kind of issues are far more
important than the drug itself

1266
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
important than the drug itself
 

1267
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,669
important than the drug itself
so they could seek escape in a

so they could seek escape in a
 

1269
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,310
so they could seek escape in a
particular drug i mean there is a

00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
particular drug i mean there is a
 

1271
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,310
particular drug i mean there is a

and some more some pull you in harder

1274
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
and some more some pull you in harder
 

1275
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,549
and some more some pull you in harder
than others when you need the escape

what evidence you have for that belief i

1280
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
what evidence you have for that belief i
 

1281
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,149
what evidence you have for that belief i
don't i yeah because there is none there

1282
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:02,159
don't i yeah because there is none there
 

1283
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,350
don't i yeah because there is none there
is absolutely none i mean people say

1284
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
is absolutely none i mean people say
 

1285
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,390
is absolutely none i mean people say
stuff like that and um

1286
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
stuff like that and um
 

1287
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,549
stuff like that and um
that's the problem that's precisely the

1288
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
that's the problem that's precisely the
 

1289
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,870
that's the problem that's precisely the

well this is a problem though but we

1294
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
well this is a problem though but we
 

1295
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,950
well this is a problem though but we
have a scientific database yeah we don't

1296
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
have a scientific database yeah we don't
 

1297
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,070
have a scientific database yeah we don't
need personal evidence for this we have

1298
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
need personal evidence for this we have
 

1299
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,909
need personal evidence for this we have
in my book i try to go through some of

1300
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
in my book i try to go through some of
 

1301
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,830
in my book i try to go through some of
the science so people could unders

1302
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
the science so people could unders
 

1303
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,430
the science so people could unders
understand it's like

1304
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
understand it's like
 

1305
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,830
understand it's like
uh when you have a math problem you

1306
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
uh when you have a math problem you
 

1307
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,510
uh when you have a math problem you
don't want people saying well you know i

1308
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
don't want people saying well you know i
 

1309
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,990
don't want people saying well you know i
feel like this [\h__\h] what you feel what

1310
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,000
feel like this [\h__\h] what you feel what
 

1311
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,830
feel like this [\h__\h] what you feel what
does the data say

1312
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
does the data say
 

1313
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,710
does the data say
so

1314
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
so
 

1315
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,710
so
one of the problems with the data so one

1316
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
one of the problems with the data so one
 

1317
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,110
one of the problems with the data so one
day it is the the there's the studies

1318
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
day it is the the there's the studies
 

1319
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,390
day it is the the there's the studies
that you're doing this is excellent

1320
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
that you're doing this is excellent
 

1321
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,070
that you're doing this is excellent
research work but there's some of the

1322
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
research work but there's some of the
 

1323
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,430
research work but there's some of the
drugs are illegal yes and some are legal

1324
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,440
drugs are illegal yes and some are legal
 

1325
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,230
drugs are illegal yes and some are legal
um so you have just

1326
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
um so you have just
 

1327
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,310
um so you have just
it's unfortunate that some of the drugs

1328
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320
it's unfortunate that some of the drugs
 

1329
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,789
it's unfortunate that some of the drugs
are illegal or how whatever you believe

1330
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
are illegal or how whatever you believe
 

1331
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,789
are illegal or how whatever you believe
but there's not enough of a data set of

1332
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
but there's not enough of a data set of
 

1333
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,029
but there's not enough of a data set of
uh public in the open use that's like

1334
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,039
uh public in the open use that's like
 

1335
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,990
uh public in the open use that's like
you in the wild data set it'd be nice to

1336
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
you in the wild data set it'd be nice to
 

1337
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,149
you in the wild data set it'd be nice to
do you know thousands of people and see

1338
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
do you know thousands of people and see
 

1339
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,350
do you know thousands of people and see
from all the different kinds of

1340
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
from all the different kinds of
 

1341
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,269
from all the different kinds of
environments and all that kind of stuff

1342
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
environments and all that kind of stuff
 

1343
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,830
environments and all that kind of stuff
to get an understanding i think we have

1344
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
to get an understanding i think we have
 

1345
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,350
to get an understanding i think we have
a substantial a substantial database but

1346
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,360
a substantial a substantial database but
 

1347
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,029
a substantial a substantial database but
people just ignore it got it

1348
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
people just ignore it got it
 

1349
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,390
people just ignore it got it
that said

1350
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
that said
 

1351
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,990
that said
let me ask you the question of

1352
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
let me ask you the question of
 

1353
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,430
let me ask you the question of
legalization

1354
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
legalization
 

1355
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,950
legalization
so

1356
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
so
 

1357
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,789
so
should in your view all drugs be

1358
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:24,799
should in your view all drugs be
 

1359
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,070
should in your view all drugs be
legalized

1360
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
legalized
 

1361
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,310
legalized
the drugs that people seek certainly

1362
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
the drugs that people seek certainly
 

1363
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,669
the drugs that people seek certainly
should be legally

1364
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
should be legally
 

1365
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,390
should be legally
regulated and available to adults so

1366
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
regulated and available to adults so
 

1367
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,230
regulated and available to adults so
when i say the drugs people seek like

1368
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
when i say the drugs people seek like
 

1369
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,750
when i say the drugs people seek like
cannabis mdma cocaine heroin um

1370
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
cannabis mdma cocaine heroin um
 

1371
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,590
cannabis mdma cocaine heroin um
those drugs certainly should be

1372
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,600
those drugs certainly should be
 

1373
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,830
those drugs certainly should be
available and some of the psychedelics

1374
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
available and some of the psychedelics
 

1375
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,470
available and some of the psychedelics
that people seek um now the thing about

1376
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
that people seek um now the thing about
 

1377
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,990
that people seek um now the thing about
it is that

1378
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,000
it is that
 

1379
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,990
it is that
some people uh

1380
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,000
some people uh
 

1381
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,390
some people uh
think that oh we'll be a free fall these

1382
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
think that oh we'll be a free fall these
 

1383
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,390
think that oh we'll be a free fall these
drugs are available to everyone that's

1384
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,400
drugs are available to everyone that's
 

1385
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,710
drugs are available to everyone that's
not true i mean it will be there will be

1386
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
not true i mean it will be there will be
 

1387
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,390
not true i mean it will be there will be
age requirements and maybe other

1388
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
age requirements and maybe other
 

1389
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,230
age requirements and maybe other
requirements but they should be

1390
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
requirements but they should be
 

1391
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,070
requirements but they should be
available and

1392
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
available and
 

1393
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,990
available and
we should also do like what we do with

1394
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
we should also do like what we do with
 

1395
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,870
we should also do like what we do with
alcohol we can put enough alcohol in a

1396
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880
alcohol we can put enough alcohol in a
 

1397
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,830
alcohol we can put enough alcohol in a
bottle to kill you but we don't so we

1398
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
bottle to kill you but we don't so we
 

1399
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,390
bottle to kill you but we don't so we
regulate it such that the amount that's

1400
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
regulate it such that the amount that's
 

1401
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,350
regulate it such that the amount that's
in the bottle uh enhances the safety and

1402
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
in the bottle uh enhances the safety and
 

1403
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,230
in the bottle uh enhances the safety and
minimizes the potential harms

1404
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
minimizes the potential harms
 

1405
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,990
minimizes the potential harms
we can do the same thing with these

1406
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
we can do the same thing with these
 

1407
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,110
we can do the same thing with these
other drugs and we can also say okay we

1408
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
other drugs and we can also say okay we
 

1409
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,110
other drugs and we can also say okay we
won't be selling intravenous

1410
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,120
won't be selling intravenous
 

1411
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,789
won't be selling intravenous
preparations of any of these drugs these

1412

the drugs that the routes of
 

1415
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,510
the drugs that the routes of

uh intranasal
again routes of administration the dose

1422
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
again routes of administration the dose
 

1423
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,789
again routes of administration the dose
that you have in each unit um

1424
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
that you have in each unit um
 

1425
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,470
that you have in each unit um
all can minimize harm based on how you

1426
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
all can minimize harm based on how you
 

1427
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,070
all can minimize harm based on how you
do these things and we can do that we

1428
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
do these things and we can do that we
 

1429
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,590
do these things and we can do that we
have the technology we have the know-how

1430
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
have the technology we have the know-how
 

1431
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,269
have the technology we have the know-how
so you're actually making me think about

1432
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279
so you're actually making me think about
 

1433
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,510
so you're actually making me think about
alcohol a little bit so if i were say

1434
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:57,520
alcohol a little bit so if i were say
 

1435
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,950
alcohol a little bit so if i were say
the drugs become legalized in the way

1436
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
the drugs become legalized in the way
 

1437
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,269
the drugs become legalized in the way
you're describing and me

1438
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:01,279
you're describing and me

positive exploration of those drugs
the reason i say i'm thinking about

1450
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,320
the reason i say i'm thinking about
 

1451
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,230
the reason i say i'm thinking about
alcohol because i don't think

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,430
but
this sort of approach that we have where

1940
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:15,440
this sort of approach that we have where
 

1941
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,310
this sort of approach that we have where
we

1942
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,320
we
 

1943
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,190
we
say we're only exclusively presenting

1944
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,200
say we're only exclusively presenting
 

1945
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,510
say we're only exclusively presenting
the harmful effects and that should make

1946
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:21,520
the harmful effects and that should make
 

1947
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,550
the harmful effects and that should make
people keep people safe i just have a

1948
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:24,560
people keep people safe i just have a
 

1949
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,829
people keep people safe i just have a
problem with that but i i certainly i

1950
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
problem with that but i i certainly i
 

1951
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,030
problem with that but i i certainly i
i take the point that um people say

1952
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
i take the point that um people say
 

1953
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,270
i take the point that um people say
there are negative effects absolutely i

1954
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
there are negative effects absolutely i
 

1955
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,030
there are negative effects absolutely i
absolutely agree

1956
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,040
absolutely agree
 

1957
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,190
absolutely agree
what do you if i can just talk about

1958
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,200
what do you if i can just talk about
 

1959
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,829
what do you if i can just talk about
specific drugs um what's the difference

1960
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
specific drugs um what's the difference
 

1961
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,310
specific drugs um what's the difference
between opioids and

1962
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,320
between opioids and
 

1963
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,990
between opioids and
benzos for example

1964
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000
benzos for example
 

1965
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,950
benzos for example
specifically

1966
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:46,960

 

1967
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,630

i mean these are drugs

1968
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
i mean these are drugs
 

1969
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,829
i mean these are drugs
that you often read about being misused

1970
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
that you often read about being misused
 

1971
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,230
that you often read about being misused
at scale i mean the misuse is the

1972
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,240
at scale i mean the misuse is the
 

1973
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,069
at scale i mean the misuse is the
problem right yeah

1974
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:56,079
problem right yeah
 

1975
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,230
problem right yeah
no matter what the drug is yes

1976
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
no matter what the drug is yes
 

1977
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,589
no matter what the drug is yes
and that's actually what you're pushing

1978
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
and that's actually what you're pushing
 

1979
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,430
and that's actually what you're pushing
for is education and it should be it

1980
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,440
for is education and it should be it
 

1981
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,750
for is education and it should be it
should be legal and should be good so

1982
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:03,760
should be legal and should be good so
 

1983
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,270
should be legal and should be good so
people should know what's the difference

1984
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,280
people should know what's the difference
 

1985
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,870
people should know what's the difference
between um

1986
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
between um
 

1987
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,470
between um
proper use

1988
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,480
proper use
 

1989
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,470
proper use
positive use and misuse

1990
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,480
positive use and misuse
 

1991
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,790
positive use and misuse
i mean one public figure who has been

1992
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
i mean one public figure who has been
 

1993
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,190
i mean one public figure who has been
going through this is uh jordan peterson

1994
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,200
going through this is uh jordan peterson
 

1995
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,109
going through this is uh jordan peterson
he's been public about his struggle of

1996
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
he's been public about his struggle of
 

1997
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,510
he's been public about his struggle of
getting off benzos the withdrawal he's

1998
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,520
getting off benzos the withdrawal he's
 

1999
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,109
getting off benzos the withdrawal he's
going through i mean what are your

2000
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
going through i mean what are your
 

2001
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,630
going through i mean what are your
thoughts about

2002
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:22,640
thoughts about
 

2003
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,470
thoughts about
um

2004
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
um
 

2005
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,870
um
the misuse of benzos or opioids and so

2006
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
the misuse of benzos or opioids and so
 

2007
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,190
the misuse of benzos or opioids and so
on the epic epidemic that people talk

2008
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,200
on the epic epidemic that people talk
 

2009
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,990
on the epic epidemic that people talk
about

2010
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
about
 

2011
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,750
about
yeah i don't know

2012
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
yeah i don't know
 

2013
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,750
yeah i don't know
jordan's specific case but certainly

2014
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:33,760
jordan's specific case but certainly
 

2015
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,230
jordan's specific case but certainly
with benzodiazepines in general we

2016
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,240
with benzodiazepines in general we
 

2017
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,910
with benzodiazepines in general we
talked about withdrawal earlier when i

2018
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
talked about withdrawal earlier when i
 

2019
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,589
talked about withdrawal earlier when i
said that with alcohol withdrawal you

2020
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
said that with alcohol withdrawal you
 

2021
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,069
said that with alcohol withdrawal you
can die so benzos and alcohol they're

2022
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
can die so benzos and alcohol they're
 

2023
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,790
can die so benzos and alcohol they're
closely related so benzoyl withdrawal

2024
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:44,800
closely related so benzoyl withdrawal
 

2025
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,390
closely related so benzoyl withdrawal
too can kill you

2026
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:46,400
too can kill you
 

2027
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,470
too can kill you
just like alcohol so when we think about

2028
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,480
just like alcohol so when we think about
 

2029
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,710
just like alcohol so when we think about
the effects that

2030
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:49,720
the effects that
 

2031
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,670
the effects that
benzodiazepines produce think about the

2032
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
benzodiazepines produce think about the
 

2033
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,069
benzodiazepines produce think about the
effects that alcohol produce they're

2034
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
effects that alcohol produce they're
 

2035
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,430
effects that alcohol produce they're
comparable or similar and so i know

2036
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
comparable or similar and so i know
 

2037
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,230
comparable or similar and so i know
that it's a difficult one to

2038
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,240
that it's a difficult one to
 

2039
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,630
that it's a difficult one to
wean yourself off if you develop the

2040
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,640
wean yourself off if you develop the
 

2041
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,470
wean yourself off if you develop the
dependence but we we have uh protocols

2042
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
dependence but we we have uh protocols
 

2043
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,589
dependence but we we have uh protocols
for that

2044
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:07,599
for that
 

2045
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,270
for that
and i hope he's okay

2046
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
and i hope he's okay
 

2047
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,230
and i hope he's okay
it's interesting to say we have

2048
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,240
it's interesting to say we have
 

2049
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,670
it's interesting to say we have
protocols for that but from my

2050
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:11,680
protocols for that but from my
 

2051
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,430
protocols for that but from my
understanding was that

2052
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:13,440
understanding was that
 

2053
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,910
understanding was that
like the protocols aren't standardized

2054
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:15,920
like the protocols aren't standardized
 

2055
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,109
like the protocols aren't standardized
it feels like

2056
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:17,119
it feels like
 

2057
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,950
it feels like
a lot of doctors aren't as helpful as

2058
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
a lot of doctors aren't as helpful as
 

2059
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,950
a lot of doctors aren't as helpful as
they could be in this process like it's

2060
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
they could be in this process like it's
 

2061
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,230
they could be in this process like it's
a bit of a mess

2062
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
a bit of a mess
 

2063
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,030
a bit of a mess
certainly with withdrawal they're more

2064
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,040
certainly with withdrawal they're more
 

2065
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,670
certainly with withdrawal they're more
uh standardized than anything so

2066
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,680
uh standardized than anything so
 

2067
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,589
uh standardized than anything so
uh like if someone is going through

2068
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
uh like if someone is going through
 

2069
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,510
uh like if someone is going through
alcohol withdrawal there is a standard

2070
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,520
alcohol withdrawal there is a standard
 

2071
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,829
alcohol withdrawal there is a standard
protocol that most physicians in this

2072
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:33,839
protocol that most physicians in this
 

2073
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,470
protocol that most physicians in this
business they follow and the same is

2074
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
business they follow and the same is
 

2075
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,910
business they follow and the same is
true with uh

2076
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
true with uh
 

2077
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,390
true with uh
benzo withdrawal but the thing where it

2078
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:40,400
benzo withdrawal but the thing where it
 

2079
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,710
benzo withdrawal but the thing where it
gets murky is when they're treating

2080
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720
gets murky is when they're treating
 

2081
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,030
gets murky is when they're treating
addiction itself so when you're thinking

2082
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
addiction itself so when you're thinking
 

2083
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,910
addiction itself so when you're thinking
about the substance use disorder in the

2084
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:47,920
about the substance use disorder in the
 

2085
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,390
about the substance use disorder in the
dsm not just withdrawal but the entire

2086
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
dsm not just withdrawal but the entire
 

2087
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,030
dsm not just withdrawal but the entire
addiction that's where you have this

2088
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,040
addiction that's where you have this
 

2089
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,430
addiction that's where you have this
sort of uh

2090
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
sort of uh
 

2091
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,270
sort of uh
divergence or

2092
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,280
divergence or
 

2093
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,670
divergence or
diversity diversity in terms of

2094
00:38:59,670 --> 00:38:59,680
diversity diversity in terms of
 

2095
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,390
diversity diversity in terms of
approaches and many of those approaches

2096
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
approaches and many of those approaches
 

2097
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,510
approaches and many of those approaches
are rubbish

2098
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
are rubbish
 

2099
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,829
are rubbish
what uh can you just elaborate

2100
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:05,839
what uh can you just elaborate
 

2101
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,750
what uh can you just elaborate

dis these uh disruptions so people have
 

2183
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,790
dis these uh disruptions so people have
to meet those two basic criteria before

what is that

2220
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,520
what is that
 

2221
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,550

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,430
long to treat
to

2234
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
to
 

2235
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,510
to
to to deal with that

2236
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
to to deal with that
 

2237
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,190
to to deal with that
uh addiction well you you cited alcohol

2238
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,200
uh addiction well you you cited alcohol
 

2239
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,589
uh addiction well you you cited alcohol
anonymous right and so

2240
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:47,599
anonymous right and so
 

2241
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,750
anonymous right and so
i don't think of alcohol anonymous as

2242
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:49,760
i don't think of alcohol anonymous as
 

2243

2247
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,670
a a treatment that i would send any
relative to you know like for a

environment for yourself for use of
these different substances and that

2432

these different substances and that
 

2433
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,069
these different substances and that
environment has a

2434
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:36,079
environment has a
 

2435
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,750
environment has a
has a very

2436
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
has a very
 

2437
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,790

uh

2438
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:38,800
uh
 

2439
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,630
uh
strong impact on the actual experience

2440
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:40,640
strong impact on the actual experience
 

2441
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,750
strong impact on the actual experience
that you have

2442
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
that you have
 

2443
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,710
that you have
but i mean so um

2444
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:44,720
but i mean so um
 

2445
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,550

cocaine is an upper

2446
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
cocaine is an upper
 

2447
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,430
cocaine is an upper
and then

2448
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
and then
 

2449
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,589
and then
yeah the way we define drugs like uppers

2450
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:49,599
yeah the way we define drugs like uppers
 

2451
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,390
yeah the way we define drugs like uppers
and down downers that's uh

2452
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,400
and down downers that's uh
 

2453
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,630
and down downers that's uh
that's a really uh

2454
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:54,640
that's a really uh
 

2455
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,390
that's a really uh
kind of inappropriate way but it's a

2456
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:56,400
kind of inappropriate way but it's a
 

2457
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,790
kind of inappropriate way but it's a
quick way but so we certainly say

2458
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:58,800
quick way but so we certainly say
 

2459
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,589
quick way but so we certainly say
cocaine is an upper or stimulant yes but

2460
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
cocaine is an upper or stimulant yes but
 

2461

cocaine is an upper or stimulant yes but
um

2462
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:02,560
um
 

2463
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,550
um
you know it depends on the activity of

2464
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
you know it depends on the activity of
 

2465
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,470
you know it depends on the activity of
the person before they take the drug say

2466
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:06,480
the person before they take the drug say
 

2467
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,790
the person before they take the drug say
like if you're like really active before

2468
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,800
like if you're like really active before
 

2469
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,030
like if you're like really active before
taking a drug like cocaine it might

2470
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,040
taking a drug like cocaine it might
 

2471
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,430
taking a drug like cocaine it might
actually calm you you know so it all

2472
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
actually calm you you know so it all
 

2473
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,510
actually calm you you know so it all
depends on the activity of the person

2474

depends on the activity of the person
 

2475
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,670
depends on the activity of the person
before they take the drug i remember uh

it but it was about condom use

2488
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:29,280
it but it was about condom use
 

2489
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,630

and cocaine
and then you know what like the doses

2492
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
and then you know what like the doses
 

2493
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,510
and then you know what like the doses
and whether people are more less likely

2494

and whether people are more less likely
like the unsafe thing there

2496

like the unsafe thing there
 

2497
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,790
like the unsafe thing there
is the

2498
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800

connotation probably because of
 

2509
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,190

hollywood negative connotations are

2510
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,200
hollywood negative connotations are

actually being studied by science and

2512
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:54,720
actually being studied by science and
 

2513
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,550
actually being studied by science and
then they actual impact they have and

2514
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:56,560
then they actual impact they have and
 

2515
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,630
then they actual impact they have and
what are the negative effects again in

2516
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
what are the negative effects again in
 

2517
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,349
what are the negative effects again in
those studies often

2518
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:01,359
those studies often
 

2519
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,829
those studies often
the positive effects are difficult to

2520
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:03,839
the positive effects are difficult to
 

2521
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,230
the positive effects are difficult to
quantify i think maybe i guess you can

2522
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:06,240
quantify i think maybe i guess you can
 

2523
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,069
quantify i think maybe i guess you can
from self-report and so on

2524
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:08,079
from self-report and so on
 

2525
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,589
from self-report and so on
but positive effects are not difficult

2526
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:09,599
but positive effects are not difficult
 

2527
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,190
but positive effects are not difficult
to quantify

2528
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
to quantify
 

2529
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,870
to quantify
you ask people about their euphoria

2530

2533
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,430
uh you can see how well people are
getting along like in our studies that

2534
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
getting along like in our studies that
 

2535
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,030
getting along like in our studies that
we have people

2536
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,040
we have people
 

2537
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,430
we have people
uh sometimes in groups and you see how

2538
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:23,440
uh sometimes in groups and you see how
 

2539
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,710
uh sometimes in groups and you see how
well they get along um on the various

2540
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:26,720
well they get along um on the various
 

2541
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,829
well they get along um on the various
drug conditions or placebo conditions uh

2542
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
drug conditions or placebo conditions uh
 

2543
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,030
drug conditions or placebo conditions uh
it's really

2544

00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:32,880
it's not that difficult then you can see
 

2547
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,190
it's not that difficult then you can see
these uh amazing studies with uh like

2548

um
it really boils down to

2918
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
it really boils down to
 

2919
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,069
it really boils down to
just simple thing we're all similar in

2920
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:42,079
just simple thing we're all similar in
 

2921

yet
 

2929
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,789
yet
somehow

2930
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:50,799
somehow
 

2931
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,829
somehow
um we are being we've been made to

2932
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:53,839
um we are being we've been made to
 

2933
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,470
um we are being we've been made to
believe that we are different in in that

2934
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:56,480
believe that we are different in in that
 

2935
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,549
believe that we are different in in that
way but fundamentally we're all the same

2936
00:54:58,549 --> 00:54:58,559
way but fundamentally we're all the same
 

2937
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,789
way but fundamentally we're all the same
so when people are

2938
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:00,799
so when people are
 

2939
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,549
so when people are
seeking to feel pleasure to feel better

2940
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:04,559
seeking to feel pleasure to feel better
 

2941
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,309
seeking to feel pleasure to feel better

00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
uh why don't we celebrate that instead
 

2943
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,750
uh why don't we celebrate that instead
we denigrate people for that i mean if i

2944
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
we denigrate people for that i mean if i

00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:21,599
against the grain
 

2953
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,750
against the grain
and uh you're a colombia

2954
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760

 

2955
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,750

it takes a lot of guts to sort of speak

2956
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:27,760
it takes a lot of guts to sort of speak
 

2957
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,190
it takes a lot of guts to sort of speak
out about these ideas so boldly

2958
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:31,200
out about these ideas so boldly
 

2959
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,670
out about these ideas so boldly
um i don't know how to ask this question

2960
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:33,680
um i don't know how to ask this question
 

2961
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,910
um i don't know how to ask this question
where do you find the guts

2962
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
where do you find the guts
 

2963
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,069
where do you find the guts
what uh

2964
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:38,079
what uh
 

2965
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,910
what uh
because it's also perhaps inspirational

2966
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
because it's also perhaps inspirational
 

2967
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,390
because it's also perhaps inspirational
to others in different disciplines that

2968
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:42,400
to others in different disciplines that
 

2969
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,910
to others in different disciplines that
are sort of taking on the conventional

2970
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:43,920
are sort of taking on the conventional
 

2971

you know that's how i i see it
 

2997
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,510
you know that's how i i see it
one of the things that people don't

2998
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:17,520
one of the things that people don't
 

2999
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,789
one of the things that people don't
really talk about

3000
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799

 

3001
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,589

with drugs and people who die from some

3002
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:23,599
with drugs and people who die from some
 

3003
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,670
with drugs and people who die from some
drug related death and

3004
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:25,680
drug related death and
 

3005
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,670
drug related death and
i've been thinking about this a whole

3006
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:27,680
i've been thinking about this a whole
 

3007
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,109
i've been thinking about this a whole
lot over the past couple years it's like

3008
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
lot over the past couple years it's like
 

3009
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,750
lot over the past couple years it's like
some of these drugs can take you to a

3010
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:33,760
some of these drugs can take you to a
 

3011
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,309
some of these drugs can take you to a
place where you feel so optimistic and

3012
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:36,319
place where you feel so optimistic and
 

3013
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,990
place where you feel so optimistic and
positive about

3014
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,000
positive about
 

3015
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,230
positive about
humans our fellow humans

3016
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,240
humans our fellow humans
 

3017
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,069
humans our fellow humans
and you want to

3018
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:42,079
and you want to
 

3019
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,390
and you want to
do your best to contribute

3020
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
do your best to contribute
 

3021
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,870
do your best to contribute
and because you know the possibilities

3022
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
and because you know the possibilities
 

3023
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,630
and because you know the possibilities
of what we can be as a society

3024
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,640
of what we can be as a society
 

3025
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,230
of what we can be as a society
and then

3026
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:52,240
and then
 

3027
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,150
and then
you come up with resistance and you like

3028
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:54,160
you come up with resistance and you like
 

3029
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,990
you come up with resistance and you like
you say there are a lot there's a lot of

3030
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,000
you say there are a lot there's a lot of
 

3031
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,990
you say there are a lot there's a lot of
resistance and people just have a hard

3032
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
resistance and people just have a hard
 

3033
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,030
resistance and people just have a hard
time

3034
00:56:59,030 --> 00:56:59,040
time
 

3035
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,069
time
and and so if you know

3036
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
and and so if you know
 

3037
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,230
and and so if you know
humans can be better

3038
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
humans can be better
 

3039
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,950
humans can be better
and they refuse to be better

3040
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:06,960
and they refuse to be better
 

3041
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,390
and they refuse to be better
why be here

3042
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:08,400
why be here
 

3043
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,510
why be here
as someone who knows that they we can do

3044
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
as someone who knows that they we can do
 

3045
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,829
as someone who knows that they we can do
this better i certainly don't want to do

3046
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:13,839
this better i certainly don't want to do
 

3047
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,990
this better i certainly don't want to do
it the way we're doing it

3048
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,000
it the way we're doing it
 

3049
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,990
it the way we're doing it
so you kind of see drugs

3050
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
so you kind of see drugs
 

3051
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,510
so you kind of see drugs
as

3052
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
as
 

3053
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,510
as
mechanisms for potentially elevating the

3054
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:21,520
mechanisms for potentially elevating the
 

3055
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,510
mechanisms for potentially elevating the
human spirit sort of

3056
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,520
human spirit sort of
 

3057
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,990
human spirit sort of
making people feel better so you want to

3058
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,000
making people feel better so you want to
 

3059
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,309
making people feel better so you want to
communicate that message so it's that

3060
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
communicate that message so it's that
 

3061
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,309
communicate that message so it's that
plus

3062
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:30,319
plus
 

3063
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,230
plus
the fact that drugs are used as

there's a lot of proper criticism you
can apply but like relative to other

3222
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:34,960
can apply but like relative to other
 

3223

places
this is well on in on so many ways this

3226
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:38,480
this is well on in on so many ways this
 

3227
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,069
this is well on in on so many ways this
country is incredible

3228
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:40,079
country is incredible
 

3229
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,190
country is incredible
uh is your criticism towards

3230
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
uh is your criticism towards
 

3231
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,589
uh is your criticism towards
cops or towards what cops are asked to

3232
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:45,599
cops or towards what cops are asked to
 

3233

and i
 

3251
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,030
and i
did what i was told to do and so just

3252
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:09,040
did what i was told to do and so just
 

3253
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,710
did what i was told to do and so just
like these guys are doing what they're

3254
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
like these guys are doing what they're
 

3255

imagery that sort of um
 

3269
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,789
imagery that sort of um
glorifying cops that's a problem in a

01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:30,799
glorifying cops that's a problem in a
 

3271
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,069
glorifying cops that's a problem in a
democracy

3272
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:32,079
democracy
 

3273
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,390
democracy
yeah all sides of the glorification of

3274
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:34,400
yeah all sides of the glorification of
 

3275
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,950
yeah all sides of the glorification of
the drug war is a problem yeah

3276
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:38,960
the drug war is a problem yeah
 

3277
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,750
the drug war is a problem yeah
if i can just linger in a little longer

3278
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:41,760
if i can just linger in a little longer
 

3279
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,990
if i can just linger in a little longer
in terms of the effects of drugs

3280
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:44,000
in terms of the effects of drugs
 

3281
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,710
in terms of the effects of drugs
on the the positive like mind expanding

3282
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:46,720
on the the positive like mind expanding
 

3283
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,870
on the the positive like mind expanding
uh components of it

3284
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:48,880
uh components of it
 

3285
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,150
uh components of it
um

3286
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:50,160
um
 

3287
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,510
um
what

3288
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:51,520
what
 

3289
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,670
what
have uh mind altering drugs teach you

3290
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,680
have uh mind altering drugs teach you
 

3291
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,069
have uh mind altering drugs teach you
about the human mind sort of from a

3292
01:01:56,069 --> 01:01:56,079
about the human mind sort of from a
 

3293
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,309
about the human mind sort of from a
neuroscience not even like a

3294
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:58,319
neuroscience not even like a
 

3295
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,670
neuroscience not even like a
biochemical

3296
01:01:59,670 --> 01:01:59,680
biochemical
 

3297
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,309
biochemical
but just like the human mind is amazing

3298
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:02,319
but just like the human mind is amazing
 

3299
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,470
but just like the human mind is amazing
right yeah the places it can go

3300
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:04,480
right yeah the places it can go
 

3301
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,069
right yeah the places it can go
have

3302
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:06,079
have
 

3303
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,910
have
like are there some insights you've

3304
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:07,920
like are there some insights you've
 

3305
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,069
like are there some insights you've
learned yeah from studying drugs about

3306
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079
learned yeah from studying drugs about
 

3307
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,109
learned yeah from studying drugs about
the mind

3308
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:11,119
the mind
 

3309
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:11,990
the mind
yeah

3310
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:12,000
yeah
 

3311
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,990
yeah
can i start from a neurochemical

3312
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,000
can i start from a neurochemical
 

3313
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,670
can i start from a neurochemical
perspective first and then we'll go

3314
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
perspective first and then we'll go
 

3315
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,230
perspective first and then we'll go
larger just from a neurochemical

3316
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
larger just from a neurochemical
 

3317
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,630
larger just from a neurochemical
perspective i mean everything i know

3318
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:20,640
perspective i mean everything i know
 

3319
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,670
perspective i mean everything i know
about the brain i learned through drugs

3320
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:23,680
about the brain i learned through drugs
 

3321
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,589
about the brain i learned through drugs
you know because of my interest in drugs

3322
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:25,599
you know because of my interest in drugs
 

3323
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,589
you know because of my interest in drugs
so i learned a lot about dopamine

3324
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:27,599
so i learned a lot about dopamine
 

3325
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,670
so i learned a lot about dopamine
neurons in certain regions of the brain

3326
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
neurons in certain regions of the brain
 

3327
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,390
neurons in certain regions of the brain
about neuropathy neurons and

3328
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400
about neuropathy neurons and
 

3329
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,029
about neuropathy neurons and
a wide range of other sort of how neural

3330
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:35,039
a wide range of other sort of how neural
 

3331
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,950
a wide range of other sort of how neural
transmission happens because of drugs

3332
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:36,960
transmission happens because of drugs
 

3333
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,710
transmission happens because of drugs
and so that's a really

3334
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
and so that's a really
 

3335
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,910
and so that's a really
valuable tool lessons for me uh but then

3336
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:41,920
valuable tool lessons for me uh but then
 

3337
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,670
valuable tool lessons for me uh but then
when we think that we

3338
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
when we think that we
 

3339
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,589
when we think that we
uh move out a bit and we think more

3340
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:45,599
uh move out a bit and we think more
 

3341
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,829
uh move out a bit and we think more
globally what have i learned in terms of

3342
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:47,839
globally what have i learned in terms of
 

3343
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,270
globally what have i learned in terms of
the mind

3344
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
the mind
 

3345
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,549
the mind
from drugs

3346
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:52,559

 

3347
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,829

i have really learned

3348
01:02:55,829 --> 01:02:55,839
i have really learned
 

3349
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,670
i have really learned
how to be more forgiving of people

3350
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
how to be more forgiving of people
 

3351
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,910
how to be more forgiving of people
and myself

3352
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:01,920
and myself
 

3353
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,710
and myself
and

3354
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:02,720
and
 

3355
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,069
and
um

3356
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
um
 

3357
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,630
um
tolerant and more tolerant of people

3358
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:06,640
tolerant and more tolerant of people
 

3359
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,589
tolerant and more tolerant of people
and

3360
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:07,599
and
 

3361
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,910
and
certainly learned a lot more about

3362
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:09,920
certainly learned a lot more about
 

3363
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,870
certainly learned a lot more about
empathy as a result of

3364
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:12,880
empathy as a result of
 

3365
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,190
empathy as a result of
drug use

3366
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,200
drug use
 

3367
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,710
drug use
uh and like i said earlier

3368
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
uh and like i said earlier
 

3369
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,510
uh and like i said earlier
i'm

3370
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:19,520
i'm
 

3371
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,190
i'm
learning what we can be as a species and

3372
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:23,200
learning what we can be as a species and
 

3373
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,309
learning what we can be as a species and
it's quite incredible uh but because of

3374
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:26,319
it's quite incredible uh but because of
 

3375
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,349
it's quite incredible uh but because of
drugs

3376
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:27,359
drugs
 

3377
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,950
drugs
yeah there's a certain property of drugs

3378
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:28,960
yeah there's a certain property of drugs
 

3379
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,549
yeah there's a certain property of drugs
in different ways they take you out of

3380
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
in different ways they take you out of
 

3381
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,309
in different ways they take you out of
your body like

3382
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:32,319
your body like
 

3383
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,630
your body like
they help you evaluate yourself from

3384
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:34,640
they help you evaluate yourself from
 

3385
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,470
they help you evaluate yourself from
like a third person perspective it's

3386
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,480
like a third person perspective it's
 

3387
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,150
like a third person perspective it's
almost like you have a consciousness in

01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,160
almost like you have a consciousness in
 

3389
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,829
almost like you have a consciousness in
here and you get to step outside of it a

3390
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
here and you get to step outside of it a
 

3391
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:40,789
here and you get to step outside of it a
little bit

3392
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
little bit
 

3393
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,230
little bit
i mean that's kind of what meditation

3394
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
i mean that's kind of what meditation
 

3395
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,470
i mean that's kind of what meditation
does too all of these processes that's

3396
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:44,480
does too all of these processes that's
 

3397
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,430
does too all of these processes that's
what a hell of a good workout does too

3398
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,440
what a hell of a good workout does too

different drugs do that
 

3419
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,870
different drugs do that
in different ways obviously i don't know

3420
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:06,880
in different ways obviously i don't know
 

3421
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,230
in different ways obviously i don't know
from personal experience than some of

3422
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,240
from personal experience than some of
 

3423
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,470

i'm really thankful for people like you
who are pushing the science forward and

3444
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
who are pushing the science forward and
 

3445
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,470
who are pushing the science forward and
are unafraid to talk about this kind of

3446
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:32,480

because i'm really fascinated with
consciousness on the engineering side i

3452
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,160
consciousness on the engineering side i
 

3453
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,870
consciousness on the engineering side i
really want to build robots that are

3454
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:40,880
really want to build robots that are
 

3455
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,710
really want to build robots that are
that have elements of intelligence

01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
that have elements of intelligence
 

3457
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,829
that have elements of intelligence
emotion even consciousness and for that

3458
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:45,839
emotion even consciousness and for that
 

3459
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,750
emotion even consciousness and for that
we need to understand ourselves and

3460
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:47,760
we need to understand ourselves and
 

3461
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,190

safely seems like an incredible tool to
 

3467
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,750
safely seems like an incredible tool to
understand ourselves and if we're

understand ourselves and if we're
 

3469
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,910
understand ourselves and if we're
limiting ourselves from certain drugs

3470

limiting ourselves from certain drugs
 

3471
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,589

multi-billion dollar industry
that could not be supported by people

3490
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:17,760
that could not be supported by people
 

3491
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,029
that could not be supported by people
who are poor
