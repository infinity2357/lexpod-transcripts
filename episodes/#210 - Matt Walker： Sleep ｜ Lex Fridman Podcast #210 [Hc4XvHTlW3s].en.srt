really interested in conscious states i

168
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
really interested in conscious states i
 

169
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,949
really interested in conscious states i
even started to read a lot about

170
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
even started to read a lot about
 

171
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,589
even started to read a lot about
hypnosis

172
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
hypnosis
 

173
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,229
hypnosis
and all of these things hypnosis

174
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
and all of these things hypnosis
 

175
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,390
and all of these things hypnosis
even sleep and dreams at the time they

176
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
even sleep and dreams at the time they
 

177
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,309
even sleep and dreams at the time they
were very esoteric it was sort of

178
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
were very esoteric it was sort of
 

179
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,670
were very esoteric it was sort of
charlatan science at that stage

180
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
charlatan science at that stage
 

181
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,110
charlatan science at that stage
and i think almost all of my colleagues

182
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
and i think almost all of my colleagues
 

183
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,910
and i think almost all of my colleagues
and i are accidental sleep researchers

184
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
and i are accidental sleep researchers
 

185
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,390
and i are accidental sleep researchers
you know no one as i recall in the

186
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
you know no one as i recall in the
 

187
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,990
you know no one as i recall in the
classroom when you're sort of five years

188
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
classroom when you're sort of five years
 

189
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,830
classroom when you're sort of five years
old and the teacher says what would you

190
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
old and the teacher says what would you
 

191
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,070
old and the teacher says what would you
like to be when you grow up you know no

192
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
like to be when you grow up you know no
 

193
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,350
like to be when you grow up you know no
one's putting their hand up and saying i

194
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
one's putting their hand up and saying i
 

195
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,390
one's putting their hand up and saying i
would love to be a sleep researcher

196
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
would love to be a sleep researcher
 

197
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,270
would love to be a sleep researcher
and so when i was doing my phd

198
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
and so when i was doing my phd
 

199
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,789
and so when i was doing my phd
i was trying to

200
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
i was trying to
 

201
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,949
i was trying to
identify different forms of dementia

202
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
identify different forms of dementia
 

203
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,350
identify different forms of dementia
very early on in the course

204
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
very early on in the course
 

205
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,190
very early on in the course
and i was using electrical brainwave

206
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
and i was using electrical brainwave
 

207
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,830
and i was using electrical brainwave
recordings to do that and i was failing

208
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
recordings to do that and i was failing
 

209
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,030
recordings to do that and i was failing
miserably it was a disaster just no

210
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
miserably it was a disaster just no
 

211
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,030
miserably it was a disaster just no
result after no result

212
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
result after no result
 

213
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,630
result after no result
and i used to go home to the doctor's

214
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
and i used to go home to the doctor's
 

215
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,390
and i used to go home to the doctor's
residence with this sort of little igloo

216
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
residence with this sort of little igloo
 

217
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,229
residence with this sort of little igloo
of journals that at the weekend i would

218
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
of journals that at the weekend i would
 

219
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,910
of journals that at the weekend i would
sort of sit in and uh and read and which

220
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
sort of sit in and uh and read and which
 

221
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,590
sort of sit in and uh and read and which
i'm now thinking do i really want to

222
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
i'm now thinking do i really want to
 

223
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,870
i'm now thinking do i really want to
admit this because it sounds like i had

224
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
admit this because it sounds like i had
 

225
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,710
admit this because it sounds like i had
no social life which i didn't i'm a

226
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
no social life which i didn't i'm a
 

227
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,710
no social life which i didn't i'm a
social leper but

228
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
social leper but
 

229
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,189
social leper but
and i started to realize that some parts

230
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
and i started to realize that some parts
 

231
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,030
and i started to realize that some parts
of the brain were

232
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
of the brain were
 

233
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,670
of the brain were
um sleep-related areas and

234
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
um sleep-related areas and
 

235
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,710
um sleep-related areas and
some dementias were eating away those

236
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:31,720
some dementias were eating away those
 

237
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,230
some dementias were eating away those
sleep-related areas other dementias

238
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
sleep-related areas other dementias
 

239
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,990
sleep-related areas other dementias
would leave them untouched and i thought

240
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
would leave them untouched and i thought
 

241
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,870
would leave them untouched and i thought
well

242
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
well
 

243
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,550
well
i'm doing this all wrong i'm measuring

244
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
i'm doing this all wrong i'm measuring
 

245
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,110
i'm doing this all wrong i'm measuring
my patients while they're awake

246
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
my patients while they're awake
 

247
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,790
my patients while they're awake
instead i should be measuring them while

248
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
instead i should be measuring them while
 

249
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,110
instead i should be measuring them while
they're asleep started doing that got

250
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
they're asleep started doing that got
 

251
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,430
they're asleep started doing that got
some amazing results

252
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
some amazing results
 

253
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,830
some amazing results
and then i wanted to ask the question is

254
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
and then i wanted to ask the question is
 

255
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,590
and then i wanted to ask the question is
that sleep

256
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
that sleep
 

257
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,270
that sleep
disruption that my patients are

258
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
disruption that my patients are
 

259
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,510
disruption that my patients are
experiencing as they go into dementia

260
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
experiencing as they go into dementia
 

261
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,749
experiencing as they go into dementia
maybe it's not a symptom of the dementia

262
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
maybe it's not a symptom of the dementia
 

263
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,150
maybe it's not a symptom of the dementia
i wonder if it's a cause of

264
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
i wonder if it's a cause of
 

265
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,830
i wonder if it's a cause of
the dementia

266
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
the dementia
 

267
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,469
the dementia
and at that point which was

268
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
and at that point which was
 

269
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,749
and at that point which was
kafka 20 years ago um

270
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
kafka 20 years ago um
 

271
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,590
kafka 20 years ago um
no one could answer a very simple

272
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
no one could answer a very simple
 

273
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,189
no one could answer a very simple
fundamental question why do we sleep

274
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
fundamental question why do we sleep
 

275
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,870
fundamental question why do we sleep
and

276
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
and
 

277
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,189
and
i at the time didn't realize that some

278
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
i at the time didn't realize that some
 

279
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,710
i at the time didn't realize that some
of the most brilliant minds in

280
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
of the most brilliant minds in
 

281
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,710
of the most brilliant minds in
scientific history had tried to answer

282
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
scientific history had tried to answer
 

283
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,390
scientific history had tried to answer
that question and failed

284
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
that question and failed
 

285
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,390
that question and failed
and at that point i just thought well

286
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
and at that point i just thought well
 

287
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,150
and at that point i just thought well
i'm going to go and do a couple of years

288
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
i'm going to go and do a couple of years
 

289
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,110
i'm going to go and do a couple of years
of sleep research and i'll figure out

290
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
of sleep research and i'll figure out
 

291
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,950
of sleep research and i'll figure out
why we sleep and then i'll come back to

292
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
why we sleep and then i'll come back to
 

293
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,510
why we sleep and then i'll come back to
my patients in this question of dementia

294
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
my patients in this question of dementia
 

295
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,350
my patients in this question of dementia
and as i said that was 20 years ago and

296
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
and as i said that was 20 years ago and
 

297
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,469
and as i said that was 20 years ago and
what i realized is that hard questions

298
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
what i realized is that hard questions
 

299
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,350
what i realized is that hard questions
occur very little about who asks them

300
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
occur very little about who asks them
 

301
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,270
occur very little about who asks them
they will meter out their lessons of

302
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
they will meter out their lessons of
 

303
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,749
they will meter out their lessons of
difficulty all the same and i was

304
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
difficulty all the same and i was
 

305
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,029
difficulty all the same and i was
schooled

306
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
schooled
 

307
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,110
schooled
in the difficulty of the question why do

308
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
in the difficulty of the question why do
 

309
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,550
in the difficulty of the question why do
we sleep

310
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
we sleep
 

311
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,430
we sleep
but in truth 20 years later we've had to

312
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
but in truth 20 years later we've had to
 

313
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,189
but in truth 20 years later we've had to
upend the question

314
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
upend the question
 

315
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,189
upend the question
rather than saying why do we sleep and

316
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
rather than saying why do we sleep and
 

317
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,230
rather than saying why do we sleep and
by the way the answer then was that we

318
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
by the way the answer then was that we
 

319
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,430
by the way the answer then was that we
sleep to cure sleepiness

320
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
sleep to cure sleepiness
 

321
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,189
sleep to cure sleepiness
which is like saying all right you know

322
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
which is like saying all right you know
 

323
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,270
which is like saying all right you know
we eat to cure hunger yeah that tells

324
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
we eat to cure hunger yeah that tells
 

325
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,790
we eat to cure hunger yeah that tells
you nothing about the physiological

326
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
you nothing about the physiological
 

327
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,510
you nothing about the physiological
benefits of food same with sleep

328
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
benefits of food same with sleep
 

329
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,510
benefits of food same with sleep
now we've actually have to ask the

330
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
now we've actually have to ask the
 

331
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,909
now we've actually have to ask the
question is there any physiological

332
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
question is there any physiological
 

333
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,909
question is there any physiological
system in the body or any major

334
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
system in the body or any major
 

335
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,070
system in the body or any major
operation of the mind that isn't

336
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
operation of the mind that isn't
 

337
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,150
operation of the mind that isn't
wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep

338
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep
 

339
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,070
wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep
or demonstrably impaired when we don't

340
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
or demonstrably impaired when we don't
 

341
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,430
or demonstrably impaired when we don't
get enough

342
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
get enough
 

343
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,749
get enough
and so far for the most part the answer

344
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
and so far for the most part the answer
 

345
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,909
and so far for the most part the answer
seems to be now

346
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
seems to be now
 

347
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,870
seems to be now
so far the answer seems to be no

348
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
so far the answer seems to be no
 

349
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,430
so far the answer seems to be no
so why

350
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
so why
 

351
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,150
so why
why does the body and the mind

352
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
why does the body and the mind
 

353
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,189
why does the body and the mind
crave sleep then why do we sleep

354
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
crave sleep then why do we sleep
 

355
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,629
crave sleep then why do we sleep
how you know

356
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
how you know
 

357
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,550
how you know
can we begin to answer that question

358
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
can we begin to answer that question
 

359
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,749
can we begin to answer that question
then

360
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
then
 

361
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,590
then
so i think one of the ways that i think

362
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
so i think one of the ways that i think
 

363
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,950
so i think one of the ways that i think
about this or

364
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
about this or
 

365
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,830
about this or
one of the answers that came to me

366
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
one of the answers that came to me
 

367
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,830
one of the answers that came to me
is the following the reason that we

368
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
is the following the reason that we
 

369
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,710
is the following the reason that we
implode so quickly and so thoroughly

370
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
implode so quickly and so thoroughly
 

371
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,430
implode so quickly and so thoroughly

377
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,110
that will deliberately deprive
themselves of sleep for no apparent good

378
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120

and what that led me then to was the
 

383
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,150

and during that time the mother will
 

411
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,390
and during that time the mother will
undergo sleep deprivation

00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,830
which brings me back to the point
therefore mother nature

426
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
therefore mother nature

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,230
therefore mother nature
in the course of evolution has never had

and
 

443
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,869
and
there's a good example where we have

00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
there's a good example where we have

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,790
nature came up with a very clever recipe
which is

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,070
where is that sort of banking chip for

sleeping unfortunately we don't seem to
 

471
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,310
sleeping unfortunately we don't seem to

that uh physiologically or
 

481
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,990
that uh physiologically or
psychologically the the fact is most

it and then mother nature

486
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
it and then mother nature
 

487
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,470
it and then mother nature
never built an extra mechanism for sleep

488
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
never built an extra mechanism for sleep
 

489
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,269
never built an extra mechanism for sleep
deprivation so it's interesting that

490
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
deprivation so it's interesting that
 

491
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,790

why we sleep by not have a good answer

492
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
why we sleep by not have a good answer
 

493
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,750
why we sleep by not have a good answer
but we need to sleep to be healthy

494
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
but we need to sleep to be healthy
 

495
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,150
but we need to sleep to be healthy
is nevertheless true yeah and we have

496
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
is nevertheless true yeah and we have
 

497
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,389
is nevertheless true yeah and we have
many answers right now in some ways the

498
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
many answers right now in some ways the
 

499
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,550
many answers right now in some ways the
question of why we sleep was the wrong

500
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
question of why we sleep was the wrong
 

501
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,829
question of why we sleep was the wrong
question too

502
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
question too
 

503
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,949
question too
it's you know what are the pluripotent

504
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
it's you know what are the pluripotent
 

505
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,630
it's you know what are the pluripotent
many reasons we sleep we don't just

506
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
many reasons we sleep we don't just
 

507
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,389
many reasons we sleep we don't just
sleep for one reason

508
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
sleep for one reason
 

509
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,430
sleep for one reason
because

510
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
because
 

511
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,710
because
from an evolutionary perspective it is

512
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
from an evolutionary perspective it is
 

513
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,630
from an evolutionary perspective it is
the most idiotic thing that you could

514
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
the most idiotic thing that you could
 

515
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,230
the most idiotic thing that you could
imagine yeah you know when you're

516
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
imagine yeah you know when you're
 

517
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,150
imagine yeah you know when you're
sleeping you're not

518
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
sleeping you're not
 

519
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,750
sleeping you're not
finding a mate you're not reproducing

520
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
finding a mate you're not reproducing
 

521
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,509
finding a mate you're not reproducing
you're not caring for your young you're

522
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
you're not caring for your young you're
 

523
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,230
you're not caring for your young you're
not foraging for food and worse still

524
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
not foraging for food and worse still
 

525
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,470
not foraging for food and worse still
you're vulnerable to predation

526
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
you're vulnerable to predation
 

527
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,630
you're vulnerable to predation
so on any one of those grounds

528
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
so on any one of those grounds
 

529
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,630
so on any one of those grounds
especially as a collective

530
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
especially as a collective
 

531
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,550
especially as a collective
sleep should have been strongly selected

532
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
sleep should have been strongly selected
 

533
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,670
sleep should have been strongly selected
against in the course of evolution

534
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
against in the course of evolution
 

535
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,389
against in the course of evolution
but in every species that we've studied

536
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
but in every species that we've studied
 

537
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,590
but in every species that we've studied
carefully to date sleep is present

538
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
carefully to date sleep is present
 

539
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,990
carefully to date sleep is present
yeah so it is important so like

540
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
yeah so it is important so like
 

541
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,750
yeah so it is important so like
you're right i think i've heard

542
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
you're right i think i've heard
 

543
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,590
you're right i think i've heard
arguments from an evolutionary biology

544
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
arguments from an evolutionary biology
 

545
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,829
arguments from an evolutionary biology
perspective that sleep is actually

546
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
perspective that sleep is actually
 

547
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,269
perspective that sleep is actually
advantageous

548
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
advantageous
 

549
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,710
advantageous
you know maybe like some kind of

550
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
you know maybe like some kind of
 

551
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,230
you know maybe like some kind of
predator predator-prey relationships

552
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
predator predator-prey relationships
 

553
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,470
predator predator-prey relationships
yeah but you're saying it actually makes

554
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
yeah but you're saying it actually makes
 

555
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,389
yeah but you're saying it actually makes
way more sense what you're saying

556
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
way more sense what you're saying
 

557
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,949
way more sense what you're saying
is it should have been selected against

558
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
is it should have been selected against
 

559
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,190
is it should have been selected against
like why close your eyes

560
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
like why close your eyes
 

561
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,590
like why close your eyes
yeah why because and you know there was

562
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
yeah why because and you know there was
 

563
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,990
yeah why because and you know there was
an energy conservation hypothesis for a

while which is that we need to
 

567
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,829
while which is that we need to
essentially go into low battery mode you

568
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
essentially go into low battery mode you
 

569
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,670
essentially go into low battery mode you
know power down because it's

570
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
know power down because it's
 

571
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,389
know power down because it's
unsustainable but in fact that actually

572
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
unsustainable but in fact that actually
 

573
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,310
unsustainable but in fact that actually
has been blasted out the water because

574
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
has been blasted out the water because
 

575
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,590
has been blasted out the water because
sleep is an incredibly active process in

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,350
sleep is an incredibly active process in
fact the difference between you just

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
fact the difference between you just

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,750
fact the difference between you just
lying on the couch but remaining

lying on the couch but remaining
 

581
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,670
lying on the couch but remaining
conscious versus you lying on the couch

582

conscious versus you lying on the couch
 

583
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,829
conscious versus you lying on the couch
and falling asleep it's only a savings

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
millions of years old they have periods

millions of years old they have periods
where they're active in periods where

where they're active in periods where
 

613
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,710
where they're active in periods where
they're passively asleep it's called

and so
 

619
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,630
and so
what that

what that
 

621
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,870
what that
in some way suggested to me was

622
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
in some way suggested to me was
 

623
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,430
in some way suggested to me was
sleep evolved with life itself on it

624
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
sleep evolved with life itself on it
 

625
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,910
sleep evolved with life itself on it
this planet and then it has fought its

which then leads to the
sort of famous um sleep statement from a

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,710
sort of famous um sleep statement from a

awake awakenness
 

659
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,110
awake awakenness
and how many conscious states are there

660
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
and how many conscious states are there
 

661
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,990
and how many conscious states are there
so when you're intuit your understanding

662
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
so when you're intuit your understanding
 

663
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,310
so when you're intuit your understanding
of what the mind can do do you think

664
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
of what the mind can do do you think
 

665
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,949
of what the mind can do do you think
awake state sleep state or is there some

666
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
awake state sleep state or is there some
 

667
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,629
awake state sleep state or is there some
kind of continuum

668
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
kind of continuum
 

669
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,870
kind of continuum
there's a complicated state transition

670
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
there's a complicated state transition
 

671
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,110
there's a complicated state transition
diagram like how do you think about this

672
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
diagram like how do you think about this
 

673
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,389
diagram like how do you think about this
whole space

674
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
whole space
 

675
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,870
whole space
i think about it as a state space

676
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
i think about it as a state space
 

677
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,030
i think about it as a state space
diagram and i think it's probably more

678
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
diagram and i think it's probably more
 

679
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,670
diagram and i think it's probably more
of a continuum than we have

680
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
of a continuum than we have
 

681
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,509
of a continuum than we have
believed it to be or suggested it to be

682
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
believed it to be or suggested it to be
 

683
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,030
believed it to be or suggested it to be
so we used to think

684
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
so we used to think
 

685
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,670
so we used to think
absent of anesthesia that there were

686
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
absent of anesthesia that there were
 

687
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,509
absent of anesthesia that there were
really three main main states of

688
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
really three main main states of
 

689
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,910
really three main main states of
consciousness there was being awake

690
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
consciousness there was being awake
 

691
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,870
consciousness there was being awake
being in non-rapid eye movement sleep or

692
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
being in non-rapid eye movement sleep or
 

693
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,350
being in non-rapid eye movement sleep or
non-dream sleep and then being in rapid

694
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
non-dream sleep and then being in rapid
 

695
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,350
non-dream sleep and then being in rapid
eye movement sleep or dream sleep and

696
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
eye movement sleep or dream sleep and
 

697
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,670
eye movement sleep or dream sleep and
those were the three states within which

698
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
those were the three states within which
 

699
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,190
those were the three states within which
your brain could

700
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
your brain could
 

701
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,310
your brain could
percolate and be conscious i you know

702
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
percolate and be conscious i you know
 

703
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,910
percolate and be conscious i you know
conscious during non-rem sleep is maybe

704
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
conscious during non-rem sleep is maybe
 

705
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,990
conscious during non-rem sleep is maybe
a stretch to say but i still believe

706
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
a stretch to say but i still believe
 

707
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,310
a stretch to say but i still believe
there is plenty of consciousness there

708
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
there is plenty of consciousness there
 

709
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,350
there is plenty of consciousness there
i don't believe that though anymore

710
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
i don't believe that though anymore
 

711
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,910
i don't believe that though anymore
and the reason is because we can have

712
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
and the reason is because we can have
 

713
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,829
and the reason is because we can have
daydreams

714
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
daydreams
 

715
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,110
daydreams
and we are in a very different wakeful

716
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
and we are in a very different wakeful
 

717
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,509
and we are in a very different wakeful
state in those day dreams than we are

718
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
state in those day dreams than we are
 

719
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,829
state in those day dreams than we are
when we are as we are now together

720
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
when we are as we are now together
 

721
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,230
when we are as we are now together
present and

722
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,240
present and
 

723
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,829
present and
extraceptively focused rather than

724
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
extraceptively focused rather than
 

725
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,790
extraceptively focused rather than
intraceptively focused

726
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
intraceptively focused
 

727
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,870
intraceptively focused
and then we also know that as you are

728
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
and then we also know that as you are
 

729
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,389
and then we also know that as you are
sort of progressing into those different

730
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
sort of progressing into those different
 

731
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,870
sort of progressing into those different
stages of sleep during non-rem sleep you

732
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
stages of sleep during non-rem sleep you
 

733
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,790
stages of sleep during non-rem sleep you
can also still dream depends on your

734
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
can also still dream depends on your
 

735
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,269
can also still dream depends on your
definition of dreaming but we seem to

736
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
definition of dreaming but we seem to
 

737
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,350
definition of dreaming but we seem to
have some degree of dreaming in almost

738
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
have some degree of dreaming in almost
 

739
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,470
have some degree of dreaming in almost
all stages of sleep

740
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
all stages of sleep
 

741
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,310
all stages of sleep
we've also then found that when you are

742
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
we've also then found that when you are
 

743
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,829
we've also then found that when you are
sleep deprived

744
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
sleep deprived
 

745
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,550
sleep deprived
there even individual brain cells will

746
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
there even individual brain cells will
 

747
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,150
there even individual brain cells will
fall asleep

748
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
fall asleep
 

749
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,550
fall asleep
despite the animal being

750
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
despite the animal being
 

751
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,870
despite the animal being
you know behaviorally from best we can

752
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
you know behaviorally from best we can
 

753
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,389
you know behaviorally from best we can
tell awake

754
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
tell awake
 

755
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,150
tell awake
individual brain cells and clusters of

756
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
individual brain cells and clusters of
 

757
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,030
individual brain cells and clusters of
brain cells will go into a sleep-like

758
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
brain cells will go into a sleep-like
 

759
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,750
brain cells will go into a sleep-like
state and humans do this too when we are

760
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
state and humans do this too when we are
 

761
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,990
state and humans do this too when we are
sleep deprived we have what are called

762
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
sleep deprived we have what are called
 

763
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,949
sleep deprived we have what are called
micro sleeps where the eyelid will

764
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
micro sleeps where the eyelid will
 

765
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,110
micro sleeps where the eyelid will
partially close

766
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
partially close
 

767
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,470
partially close
and the brain essentially falls lapses

768
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
and the brain essentially falls lapses
 

769
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,910
and the brain essentially falls lapses
into a state of sleep but behaviorally

770
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
into a state of sleep but behaviorally
 

771
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,790
into a state of sleep but behaviorally
you seem to be awake and the danger here

772
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
you seem to be awake and the danger here
 

773
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,710
you seem to be awake and the danger here
is road traffic accidents

774
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
is road traffic accidents
 

775
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,590
is road traffic accidents
so

776
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
so
 

777
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,910
so
these are the what we call these sort of

778
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
these are the what we call these sort of
 

779
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,949
these are the what we call these sort of
micro sleep events at the wheel now if

780
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
micro sleep events at the wheel now if
 

781
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,550
micro sleep events at the wheel now if
you're traveling at

782
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
you're traveling at
 

783
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,230
you're traveling at
65 miles an hour in a two ton vehicle

784
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
65 miles an hour in a two ton vehicle
 

785
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,230
65 miles an hour in a two ton vehicle
you know it takes probably around one

786
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
you know it takes probably around one
 

787
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,829
you know it takes probably around one
second to drift from one lane to the

788
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
second to drift from one lane to the
 

789
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,230
second to drift from one lane to the
next and it takes two seconds to go

790
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
next and it takes two seconds to go
 

791
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,990
next and it takes two seconds to go
completely off the road

792
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
completely off the road
 

793
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,750
completely off the road
so if you have one of these micro sleeps

794
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
so if you have one of these micro sleeps
 

795
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,750
so if you have one of these micro sleeps
at the wheel you know it could be the

796
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
at the wheel you know it could be the
 

797
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,470
at the wheel you know it could be the
last microsleep that you ever have

798
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
last microsleep that you ever have
 

799
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,430
last microsleep that you ever have
but i don't now see it as a set of you

800
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
but i don't now see it as a set of you
 

801
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,870
but i don't now see it as a set of you
know very binary distinct you know step

802
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
know very binary distinct you know step
 

803
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,310
know very binary distinct you know step
function state it's not a one or a zero

804
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
function state it's not a one or a zero
 

805
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,350
function state it's not a one or a zero
i see it more of a as a continuum yeah

806
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
i see it more of a as a continuum yeah
 

807
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,670
i see it more of a as a continuum yeah
so i've for

808
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
so i've for
 

809
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,110
so i've for
for uh

810
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
for uh
 

811
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,509
for uh
five six years at mit

812
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
five six years at mit
 

813
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,350
five six years at mit
really focused on this

814
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
really focused on this
 

815
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,990
really focused on this
human side of driving question and one

816
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
human side of driving question and one
 

817
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,470
human side of driving question and one
of the big concerns is

818
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
of the big concerns is
 

819
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,150
of the big concerns is
the

820
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
the
 

821
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,550
the
micro sleeps drowsiness these kinds of

822
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
micro sleeps drowsiness these kinds of
 

823
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,949
micro sleeps drowsiness these kinds of
ideas and one of the open questions was

824
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
ideas and one of the open questions was
 

825
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,189
ideas and one of the open questions was
is it possible through computer vision

826
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
is it possible through computer vision
 

827
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,230
is it possible through computer vision
to detect or any kind of sensors

828
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
to detect or any kind of sensors
 

829
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,910
to detect or any kind of sensors
the nice thing about computer vision is

830
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
the nice thing about computer vision is
 

831
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,590
the nice thing about computer vision is
you don't have to have direct contact to

832
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
you don't have to have direct contact to
 

833
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,710
you don't have to have direct contact to
the person

834
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
the person
 

835
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,430
the person
is it possible to detect

836
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
is it possible to detect
 

837
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,829
is it possible to detect
increases in uh drowsiness is it

838
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
increases in uh drowsiness is it
 

839
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,590
increases in uh drowsiness is it
possible to detect these kind of micro

840
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
possible to detect these kind of micro
 

841
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,310
possible to detect these kind of micro
sleeps or actually just sleep in general

842
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320

um

844
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
um
 

845
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,350

these are all words that have so many

848
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
these are all words that have so many
 

849
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,430
these are all words that have so many
meanings and so many debates like

850
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
meanings and so many debates like
 

851
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,749
meanings and so many debates like
like attention is a whole nother one

852
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
like attention is a whole nother one
 

853
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,110
like attention is a whole nother one
just because you're looking something

854
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
just because you're looking something
 

855
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,150
just because you're looking something
doesn't mean

856
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
doesn't mean
 

857
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,230
doesn't mean
you're loading in the information just

858
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
you're loading in the information just
 

859
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,629
you're loading in the information just
because you're looking away doesn't mean

860
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
because you're looking away doesn't mean
 

861
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,310
because you're looking away doesn't mean
your peripheral vision can't pick up the

862
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
your peripheral vision can't pick up the
 

863
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,150
your peripheral vision can't pick up the
important information there's so many

864
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
important information there's so many
 

865
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,389
important information there's so many
complicated vision science things there

866
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
complicated vision science things there
 

867
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,710
complicated vision science things there
um so i i wonder if you could say

868
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
um so i i wonder if you could say
 

869
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,470
um so i i wonder if you could say
something to

870
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
something to
 

871
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,990
something to
uh you know they say the eyes or the

872
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
uh you know they say the eyes or the
 

873
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,430
uh you know they say the eyes or the
windows to the soul do you think um

874
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
windows to the soul do you think um
 

875
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,110
windows to the soul do you think um
the eyes can reveal

876
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
the eyes can reveal
 

877
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,870
the eyes can reveal
something about uh

878
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
something about uh
 

879
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,749
something about uh
sleepiness uh through uh through

880
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
sleepiness uh through uh through
 

881
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,590
sleepiness uh through uh through
computer vision through

882
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
computer vision through
 

883
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,430
computer vision through
just looking at the video of the face

884
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
just looking at the video of the face
 

885
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,069
just looking at the video of the face
and andrew huberman and i your friend

886
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
and andrew huberman and i your friend
 

887
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,749
and andrew huberman and i your friend
have talked about this so we'd love to

888
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
have talked about this so we'd love to
 

889
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,749
have talked about this so we'd love to
work on this uh together so you should

890
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
work on this uh together so you should
 

891
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,590
work on this uh together so you should
do it it's a fascinating problem but

892
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
do it it's a fascinating problem but
 

893
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,509
do it it's a fascinating problem but
drowsiness is a tricky one so there's

894
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
drowsiness is a tricky one so there's
 

895
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,269
drowsiness is a tricky one so there's
what kind of information

896
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
what kind of information
 

897
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,350
what kind of information
there's uh blinking and there's eye

898
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
there's uh blinking and there's eye
 

899
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,550
there's uh blinking and there's eye
movement

900
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
movement
 

901
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,550
movement
and those are the ones that can be

902
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
and those are the ones that can be
 

903
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,949
and those are the ones that can be
picked uh up with computer vision do you

904
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
picked uh up with computer vision do you
 

905
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,550
picked uh up with computer vision do you
think those are signals that could be

906
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
think those are signals that could be
 

907
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,470
think those are signals that could be
used to say something about

908
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
used to say something about
 

909
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,350
used to say something about
where we are in this continuum yeah i do

910
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
where we are in this continuum yeah i do
 

911
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,629
where we are in this continuum yeah i do
and i think there are a number of other

912
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
and i think there are a number of other
 

913
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,030
and i think there are a number of other
features too i think um you know

914
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
features too i think um you know
 

915
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,389
features too i think um you know
aperture of i so in other words partial

916
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
aperture of i so in other words partial
 

917
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,030
aperture of i so in other words partial
closures foreclosures

918
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
closures foreclosures
 

919
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,270
closures foreclosures
duration of those closures duration of

920
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
duration of those closures duration of
 

921
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,390
duration of those closures duration of
those partial closures of the eyelid

922
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
those partial closures of the eyelid
 

923
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,270
those partial closures of the eyelid
um i think there may be some information

924
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
um i think there may be some information
 

925
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,270
um i think there may be some information
in the pupil as well

926
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
in the pupil as well
 

927
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,110
in the pupil as well
because as we're transitioning between

928
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
because as we're transitioning between
 

929
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,270
because as we're transitioning between
those states change there are changes in

930
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
those states change there are changes in
 

931
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,870
those states change there are changes in
what's called the automatic nervous

932
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
what's called the automatic nervous
 

933
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,710
what's called the automatic nervous
system or technically it's called the

934
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
system or technically it's called the
 

935
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,350
system or technically it's called the
autonomic nervous system part of which

936
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
autonomic nervous system part of which
 

937
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,870
autonomic nervous system part of which
will control your

938
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
will control your
 

939
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,029
will control your
pupillary size

940
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
pupillary size
 

941
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,950
pupillary size
so i actually think that there is

942
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
so i actually think that there is
 

943
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,310
so i actually think that there is
probably a wealth of information when

944
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,320
probably a wealth of information when
 

945
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,950
probably a wealth of information when
you combine that probably with

946
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
you combine that probably with
 

947
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,070
you combine that probably with
aspects of steering angle steering

948
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
aspects of steering angle steering
 

949
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,669
aspects of steering angle steering
maneuver

950
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
maneuver
 

951
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,990
maneuver
and if you can sense the pressure

952
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
and if you can sense the pressure
 

953
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,390
and if you can sense the pressure
on the pedals as well

954
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
on the pedals as well
 

955
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,750
on the pedals as well
my guess is that there is some

956
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
my guess is that there is some
 

957
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,909
my guess is that there is some
combinatorial feature

958
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
combinatorial feature
 

959
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,710
combinatorial feature
that creates a phenotype

960
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
that creates a phenotype
 

961
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,990
that creates a phenotype
of

962
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
of
 

963
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,029
of
you are starting to fall asleep and

964
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039
you are starting to fall asleep and
 

965
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,150
you are starting to fall asleep and
as the autonomous controls develop

966
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
as the autonomous controls develop
 

967
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,029
as the autonomous controls develop
the

968
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
the

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
it's time for them to kick in some
 

971
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,029
it's time for them to kick in some
manufacturers auto manufacturers sort of

972
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:03,039
manufacturers auto manufacturers sort of
 

973
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,390
manufacturers auto manufacturers sort of
have something

974
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
have something
 

975
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,350
have something
beta version maybe an alpha version of

976
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
beta version maybe an alpha version of
 

977
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,270
beta version maybe an alpha version of
of this already starting to come online

978
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
of this already starting to come online
 

979
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,190
of this already starting to come online
where they have a little camera in the

980
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
where they have a little camera in the
 

981
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,750
where they have a little camera in the
wheel that i think tries to look at some

982
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
wheel that i think tries to look at some
 

983
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,310
wheel that i think tries to look at some
features almost everybody doing this and

984
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
features almost everybody doing this and
 

985
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,830
features almost everybody doing this and
it's very alpha

986
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840

 

987
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,950

so

988
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
so
 

989
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,789
so
uh you know the thing that you currently

990
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
uh you know the thing that you currently
 

991
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,310
uh you know the thing that you currently
have some people have that in their car

992
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
have some people have that in their car
 

993
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,830
have some people have that in their car
there's a coffee cup or something that

994
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
there's a coffee cup or something that
 

995
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,150
there's a coffee cup or something that
comes up that you might be sleepy the

996
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,160
comes up that you might be sleepy the
 

997
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,070
comes up that you might be sleepy the
the primary signal that they're

998
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
the primary signal that they're
 

999
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,470
the primary signal that they're
comfortable using is the steering wheel

1000
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
comfortable using is the steering wheel
 

1001
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,750
comfortable using is the steering wheel
reversals so so basically using your

1002
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
reversals so so basically using your
 

1003
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,590
reversals so so basically using your
interaction with the steering wheel and

1004
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
interaction with the steering wheel and
 

1005
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,830
interaction with the steering wheel and
how much you're interacting with it as a

1006
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
how much you're interacting with it as a
 

1007
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,350
how much you're interacting with it as a
sign of sleepiness so if you have to

1008
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
sign of sleepiness so if you have to
 

1009
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,909
sign of sleepiness so if you have to
constantly correct the car yeah that's a

1010
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
constantly correct the car yeah that's a
 

1011
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,310
constantly correct the car yeah that's a
sign of like you starting to drift into

1012
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
sign of like you starting to drift into
 

1013
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,630
sign of like you starting to drift into
micro sleep i think that's a very very

1014
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
micro sleep i think that's a very very
 

1015
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,390
micro sleep i think that's a very very
crude signal it's probably a powerful

1016
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
crude signal it's probably a powerful
 

1017
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,470
crude signal it's probably a powerful
one there's a whole other component to

1018
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
one there's a whole other component to
 

1019
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,669
one there's a whole other component to
this which is

1020
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
this which is
 

1021
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,430
this which is
it seems like it's so driver and

1022
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
it seems like it's so driver and
 

1023
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,310
it seems like it's so driver and
subject-dependent

1024
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
subject-dependent
 

1025
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,190

1026
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
the
 

1027
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,630
the
how our behavior changes as we

1028
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
how our behavior changes as we
 

1029
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,669
how our behavior changes as we
get sleepy and drowsy seems to be

1030
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
get sleepy and drowsy seems to be
 

1031
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,750
get sleepy and drowsy seems to be
different in complicated fascinating

1032
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
different in complicated fascinating
 

1033
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,669
different in complicated fascinating
ways where you can't just use one signal

1034
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
ways where you can't just use one signal
 

1035
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,950
ways where you can't just use one signal
it's kind of like what you're saying

1036
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
it's kind of like what you're saying
 

1037
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,029
it's kind of like what you're saying
there has to be a lot of different

1038
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
there has to be a lot of different
 

1039
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,390
there has to be a lot of different
signals that you should then be able to

1040
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
signals that you should then be able to
 

1041
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,110
signals that you should then be able to
combine the hope is there's uh the

1042
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
combine the hope is there's uh the
 

1043
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,830
combine the hope is there's uh the
searches for like universal signals that

1044
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
searches for like universal signals that
 

1045
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,750
searches for like universal signals that
are pretty damn good for like ninety

1046
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
are pretty damn good for like ninety
 

1047
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,430
are pretty damn good for like ninety
percent of people

1048
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
percent of people
 

1049
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,430
percent of people
but i don't think we need to take

1050
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
but i don't think we need to take
 

1051
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,070
but i don't think we need to take
necessarily quite that approach i think

1052
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
necessarily quite that approach i think
 

1053
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,029
necessarily quite that approach i think
what we could do in some clever fashion

1054
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
what we could do in some clever fashion
 

1055
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,070
what we could do in some clever fashion
is

1056
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
is
 

1057
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,310
is
using the individual so what you and i

1058
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
using the individual so what you and i
 

1059
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,070
using the individual so what you and i
are perhaps suggesting here is that

1060
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
are perhaps suggesting here is that
 

1061
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,029
are perhaps suggesting here is that
there is

1062
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
there is
 

1063
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,350
there is
an array of features that we know

1064
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
an array of features that we know
 

1065
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,070
an array of features that we know
provide information that is sensitive to

1066
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
provide information that is sensitive to
 

1067
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,669
provide information that is sensitive to
whether or not you're falling asleep at

1068
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
whether or not you're falling asleep at
 

1069
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,630
whether or not you're falling asleep at
the wheel

1070
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
the wheel
 

1071
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,549
the wheel
some of those let's say that there are

1072
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
some of those let's say that there are
 

1073
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,270
some of those let's say that there are
ten of them you know for me seven of

1074
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
ten of them you know for me seven of
 

1075
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,470
ten of them you know for me seven of
them are the cardinal features for you

1076
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
them are the cardinal features for you
 

1077
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,029
them are the cardinal features for you
however you know six of them and they're

1078
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
however you know six of them and they're
 

1079
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,150
however you know six of them and they're
not all the same sort of overlapping are

1080
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
not all the same sort of overlapping are
 

1081
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,750
not all the same sort of overlapping are
those for you

1082
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
those for you
 

1083
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,990
those for you
i think what we need is algorithms that

1084
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
i think what we need is algorithms that
 

1085
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,909
i think what we need is algorithms that
can firstly understand when you are well

1086
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
can firstly understand when you are well
 

1087
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,669
can firstly understand when you are well
slept so let's say that people have

1088
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
slept so let's say that people have
 

1089
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,350
slept so let's say that people have
sleep trackers at night and then your

1090
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
sleep trackers at night and then your
 

1091
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,350
sleep trackers at night and then your
car integrates that information that'd

1092
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
car integrates that information that'd
 

1093
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,430
car integrates that information that'd
be amazing understands when you are well

1094
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
be amazing understands when you are well
 

1095
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,070
be amazing understands when you are well
slept yeah and then you've got the data

1096
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
slept yeah and then you've got the data
 

1097
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,270
slept yeah and then you've got the data
of the individual behavior unique to

1098
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
of the individual behavior unique to
 

1099
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,710
of the individual behavior unique to
that individual snowflake like when they

1100
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
that individual snowflake like when they
 

1101
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,390
that individual snowflake like when they
are well slept this is the signature of

1102
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
are well slept this is the signature of
 

1103
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,470
are well slept this is the signature of
well-rested driving

1104
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
well-rested driving
 

1105
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,789
well-rested driving
then you can look at deviations from

1106
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
then you can look at deviations from
 

1107
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,590
then you can look at deviations from
that and patent match it with the sleep

1108
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
that and patent match it with the sleep
 

1109
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,630
that and patent match it with the sleep
history of that individual and then i

1110
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
history of that individual and then i
 

1111
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,230
history of that individual and then i
don't need to find

1112
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
don't need to find
 

1113
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,029
don't need to find
the sort of you know the

1114
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:38,039
the sort of you know the
 

1115
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,549
the sort of you know the
one-size-fits-all approach for 99 of the

1116
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
one-size-fits-all approach for 99 of the
 

1117
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,510
one-size-fits-all approach for 99 of the
people i can create a very bespoke

1118
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
people i can create a very bespoke
 

1119
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,909
people i can create a very bespoke
tailor-like set of features the savile

1120
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
tailor-like set of features the savile
 

1121
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,669
tailor-like set of features the savile
row suit of sleepiness features you know

1122
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
row suit of sleepiness features you know
 

1123
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,669
row suit of sleepiness features you know
that would be my if you want to ask me

1124
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,679
that would be my if you want to ask me
 

1125
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,590
that would be my if you want to ask me
about moonshots and crazy ideas that's

1126
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
about moonshots and crazy ideas that's
 

1127
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,470
about moonshots and crazy ideas that's
where i go but to start with i think

1128
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
where i go but to start with i think
 

1129
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,390
where i go but to start with i think
your approaches is a great one let's

1130
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
your approaches is a great one let's
 

1131
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,190
your approaches is a great one let's
find something that covers 99 of the

1132
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
find something that covers 99 of the
 

1133
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,270
find something that covers 99 of the
people because the worrying thing about

1134
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
people because the worrying thing about
 

1135
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,909
people because the worrying thing about
microsleeps of course unlike you know

1136
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
microsleeps of course unlike you know
 

1137
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,310
microsleeps of course unlike you know
drugs or alcohol which you know

1138
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
drugs or alcohol which you know
 

1139
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,470
drugs or alcohol which you know
certainly is a terrible thing to be

1140
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
certainly is a terrible thing to be
 

1141
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,830
certainly is a terrible thing to be
behind the wheel

1142
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
behind the wheel
 

1143
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,110
behind the wheel
with those often you

1144
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
with those often you
 

1145
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,430
with those often you
you react too late

1146
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,440
you react too late
 

1147
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,029
you react too late
and that's the reason you get into an

1148
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
and that's the reason you get into an
 

1149
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,070
and that's the reason you get into an
accident

1150
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
accident
 

1151
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,710
accident
when you fall asleep behind the wheel

1152
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
when you fall asleep behind the wheel
 

1153
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,950
when you fall asleep behind the wheel
you don't react at all

1154
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
you don't react at all
 

1155
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,390
you don't react at all
the you know at that point there is a

1156
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
the you know at that point there is a
 

1157
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,470
the you know at that point there is a
two-ton missile driving down the street

1158
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
two-ton missile driving down the street
 

1159
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,110
two-ton missile driving down the street
and no one's in control that's why those

1160
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
and no one's in control that's why those
 

1161
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,230
and no one's in control that's why those
accidents can often be more dangerous

1162
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
accidents can often be more dangerous
 

1163
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,510
accidents can often be more dangerous
yeah and

1164
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
yeah and
 

1165
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,750
yeah and
the fascinating thing is in the case of

1166
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760
the fascinating thing is in the case of
 

1167
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,830
the fascinating thing is in the case of
semi-autonomous vehicles like tesla

1168
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
semi-autonomous vehicles like tesla
 

1169
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,990
semi-autonomous vehicles like tesla
autopilot this is where

1170
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
autopilot this is where
 

1171
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,350
autopilot this is where
i've had disagreements with mr elon musk

1172
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
i've had disagreements with mr elon musk
 

1173
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,110
i've had disagreements with mr elon musk
is uh

1174
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
is uh
 

1175
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,830
is uh
and uh the human factors community

1176
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840
and uh the human factors community
 

1177
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,750
and uh the human factors community
which is this community that one of the

1178
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
which is this community that one of the
 

1179
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,590
which is this community that one of the
big things they study

1180
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
big things they study
 

1181
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,549
big things they study
is uh human supervision over automation

1182
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
is uh human supervision over automation
 

1183
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,630
is uh human supervision over automation
so you have like pilots

1184
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
so you have like pilots
 

1185
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,710
so you have like pilots
you know supervising an airplane that's

1186
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
you know supervising an airplane that's
 

1187
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,190
you know supervising an airplane that's
mostly flying autonomously the question

1188
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
mostly flying autonomously the question
 

1189
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,390
mostly flying autonomously the question
is

1190
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
is
 

1191
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,669
is
when we're actually doing the driving

1192
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
when we're actually doing the driving
 

1193
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,470
when we're actually doing the driving
how do micro sleeps or general how does

1194
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
how do micro sleeps or general how does
 

1195
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,470
how do micro sleeps or general how does
drowsiness progress and how does it

1196
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
drowsiness progress and how does it
 

1197
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,950
drowsiness progress and how does it
affect our driving that question becomes

1198
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
affect our driving that question becomes
 

1199
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,350
affect our driving that question becomes
more fascinating more complicated

1200
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
more fascinating more complicated
 

1201
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,750
more fascinating more complicated
when your task is not driving but

1202
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
when your task is not driving but
 

1203
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,230
when your task is not driving but
supervising the driving so your task is

1204
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
supervising the driving so your task is
 

1205
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,789
supervising the driving so your task is
to take over when stuff goes wrong and

1206
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799
to take over when stuff goes wrong and
 

1207
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,669
to take over when stuff goes wrong and
that

1208
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
that
 

1209
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,750
that
is complicated but

1210
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
is complicated but
 

1211
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,149
is complicated but
the basic conclusions from many decades

1212
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
the basic conclusions from many decades
 

1213
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,789
the basic conclusions from many decades
is that humans are really crappy at

1214
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
is that humans are really crappy at
 

1215
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,149
is that humans are really crappy at
supervising

1216
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
supervising
 

1217
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,510
supervising
because they get

1218
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
because they get
 

1219
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,070
because they get
they get drowsy and lose vigilance much

1220
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
they get drowsy and lose vigilance much
 

1221
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,350
they get drowsy and lose vigilance much
much faster

1222
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
much faster
 

1223
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,350
much faster
the really surprising thing with tesla

1224
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
the really surprising thing with tesla
 

1225
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,390
the really surprising thing with tesla
autopilot it was surprising to me it's

1226
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
autopilot it was surprising to me it's
 

1227
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,470
autopilot it was surprising to me it's
surprising to uh the human factors

1228
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
surprising to uh the human factors
 

1229
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,149
surprising to uh the human factors
community and in fact they still argue

1230
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
community and in fact they still argue
 

1231
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,789
community and in fact they still argue
with me about it is uh it seems that

1232
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:50,799
with me about it is uh it seems that
 

1233
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,149
with me about it is uh it seems that
humans

1234
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
humans
 

1235
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,110
humans
in tesla's with autopilot

1236
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
in tesla's with autopilot
 

1237
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,870
in tesla's with autopilot
and other similar systems are not

1238
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
and other similar systems are not
 

1239
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,630
and other similar systems are not
becoming less vigilant

1240
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:58,640
becoming less vigilant
 

1241
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,590
becoming less vigilant
at least

1242
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
at least
 

1243
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,070
at least
the with with the studies we've done so

1244
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
the with with the studies we've done so
 

1245
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,310
the with with the studies we've done so
there's something about the urgency of

1246
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
there's something about the urgency of
 

1247
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,350
there's something about the urgency of
driving

1248
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
driving
 

1249
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,430
driving
i can't i'm not sure the why but there's

1250
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
i can't i'm not sure the why but there's
 

1251
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,430
i can't i'm not sure the why but there's
something about the risk i think the

1252
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
something about the risk i think the
 

1253
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,750
something about the risk i think the
fact that you might die

1254
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
fact that you might die
 

1255
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,590
fact that you might die
is still keeping people

1256
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600
is still keeping people
 

1257
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,390
is still keeping people
awake the question is as tesla autopilot

1258
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
awake the question is as tesla autopilot
 

1259
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,149
awake the question is as tesla autopilot
or similar systems get better and better

1260
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
or similar systems get better and better
 

1261
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,270
or similar systems get better and better
and better

1262
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
and better
 

1263
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,789
and better
how does that affect increasing

1264
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
how does that affect increasing
 

1265
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,789
how does that affect increasing
drowsiness and that's when you need to

1266
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
drowsiness and that's when you need to
 

1267
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,549
drowsiness and that's when you need to
have that's what the big disagreement

1268
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
have that's what the big disagreement
 

1269
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,190
have that's what the big disagreement
was you need to have driver sensing

1270
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
was you need to have driver sensing
 

1271
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,149
was you need to have driver sensing
meaning driver facing camera

1272
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
meaning driver facing camera
 

1273
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,270
meaning driver facing camera
that

1274
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,280
that
 

1275
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,110
that
tracks some kind of information about

1276
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
tracks some kind of information about
 

1277
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,789
tracks some kind of information about
the face that can tell you

1278
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
the face that can tell you
 

1279
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,590
the face that can tell you
uh drowsiness so you can tell the car if

1280
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
uh drowsiness so you can tell the car if
 

1281
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,830
uh drowsiness so you can tell the car if
you're drowsy so that the car can be

1282
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
you're drowsy so that the car can be
 

1283
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,350
you're drowsy so that the car can be
like you should be

1284
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
like you should be
 

1285
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,830
like you should be
probably driving or pull to the side

1286
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840
probably driving or pull to the side
 

1287
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,549
probably driving or pull to the side
right or i need to do some of the heavy

1288
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
right or i need to do some of the heavy
 

1289
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,549
right or i need to do some of the heavy
lifting here yeah um so there needs to

1290
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:48,559
lifting here yeah um so there needs to
 

1291
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,269
lifting here yeah um so there needs to
be that dance of inter interaction

1292
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,279
be that dance of inter interaction
 

1293
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,590
be that dance of inter interaction
of a human and machine

1294
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
of a human and machine
 

1295
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,990
of a human and machine
but currently it's mostly uh steering

1296
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
but currently it's mostly uh steering
 

1297
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,990
but currently it's mostly uh steering
wheel based so

1298
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
wheel based so
 

1299
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,830
wheel based so
you know this this idea that your hands

1300
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
you know this this idea that your hands
 

1301
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,310
you know this this idea that your hands
should be on the on the steering wheel

1302
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
should be on the on the steering wheel
 

1303
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,110
should be on the on the steering wheel
that's

1304
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
that's
 

1305
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,750
that's
uh a sign that you're paying attention

1306
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
uh a sign that you're paying attention
 

1307
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,710
uh a sign that you're paying attention
is um isn't outdated and a very crude

1308
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
is um isn't outdated and a very crude
 

1309
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,549
is um isn't outdated and a very crude
metric i agree

1310
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
metric i agree
 

1311
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,230
metric i agree
yeah i think there are far more

1312
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
yeah i think there are far more
 

1313
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,990
yeah i think there are far more
sophisticated ways that we can solve

1314
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
sophisticated ways that we can solve
 

1315
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,029
sophisticated ways that we can solve
that problem

1316
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
that problem
 

1317
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,789
that problem
uh if we invest

1318
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799

 

1319
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,710

big philosophical question

1320
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
big philosophical question
 

1321
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,549
big philosophical question
before we get into fun details um

1322
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
before we get into fun details um
 

1323
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,230
before we get into fun details um
on the topic of conscious states

1324
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,240

 

1325
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,070

how fundamental do you think is

1326
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
how fundamental do you think is
 

1327
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,269
how fundamental do you think is
consciousness to the human mind

1328
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
consciousness to the human mind
 

1329
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,430
consciousness to the human mind
i ask this from almost like a robotics

1330
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
i ask this from almost like a robotics
 

1331
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,870
i ask this from almost like a robotics
perspective so in your study of sleep

1332
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
perspective so in your study of sleep
 

1333
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,149
perspective so in your study of sleep
do you think

1334
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
do you think
 

1335
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,990
do you think
the the hard question of consciousness

1336
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
the the hard question of consciousness
 

1337
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,070
the the hard question of consciousness
that it feels like something

1338
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
that it feels like something
 

1339
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,190
that it feels like something
to be us

1340
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,200
to be us
 

1341
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,950
to be us
is that like a nice little feature like

1342
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
is that like a nice little feature like
 

1343
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,310
is that like a nice little feature like
a like a like a quark of our mind or is

1344
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
a like a like a quark of our mind or is
 

1345
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,950
a like a like a quark of our mind or is
it somehow fundamental because sleep

1346
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
it somehow fundamental because sleep
 

1347
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,750
it somehow fundamental because sleep
feels like we take we take a step out of

1348
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
feels like we take we take a step out of
 

1349
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,750
feels like we take we take a step out of
that consciousness a little bit

1350
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
that consciousness a little bit
 

1351
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,390
that consciousness a little bit
so from all your study of sleep

1352
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
so from all your study of sleep
 

1353
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,310
so from all your study of sleep
do you think consciousness is like

1354
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,320
do you think consciousness is like
 

1355
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,710
do you think consciousness is like
deeply part of who we are or is it just

1356
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
deeply part of who we are or is it just
 

1357
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,789
deeply part of who we are or is it just
a nice trick

1358
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
a nice trick
 

1359
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,590
a nice trick
i think it's a deeply embedded feature

1360
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
i think it's a deeply embedded feature
 

1361
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,909
i think it's a deeply embedded feature
that i can imagine has

1362
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
that i can imagine has
 

1363
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,909
that i can imagine has
a whole panoply of biological benefits

1364
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
a whole panoply of biological benefits
 

1365
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,149
a whole panoply of biological benefits
but to your point about sleep what is

1366
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
but to your point about sleep what is
 

1367
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,310
but to your point about sleep what is
interesting if you do a lot of dream

1368
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
interesting if you do a lot of dream
 

1369
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,269
interesting if you do a lot of dream
research and we've done some

1370
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
research and we've done some
 

1371
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,470
research and we've done some
it's very very rare

1372
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
it's very very rare
 

1373
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,510
it's very very rare
at all in fact for you to end up

1374
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
at all in fact for you to end up

in your dreams now you can have

1378
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
in your dreams now you can have
 

1379
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,990
in your dreams now you can have
third-person perspective dreams where

1380
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
third-person perspective dreams where
 

1381
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,950
third-person perspective dreams where
you can see yourself in the dream as if

1382
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
you can see yourself in the dream as if
 

1383
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,070
you can see yourself in the dream as if
you're sort of

your physical being
 

1389
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,110
your physical being
but for the most part it's very rare

1390
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
but for the most part it's very rare
 

1391
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,269
but for the most part it's very rare
that we lose our sense of conscious self

1392
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
that we lose our sense of conscious self
 

1393
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,269
that we lose our sense of conscious self
and maybe i'm sort of doing a sleight of

who we are in dreams we never do now
 

1401

when you went into dreaming you know you

when you went into dreaming you know you
 

1415
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,070

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,830
reasons firstly you started to see
things which were not there so you were

1422

things which were not there so you were
 

1423
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,190
things which were not there so you were
hallucinating

hallucinating
 

1425
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,029

second you believe things that couldn't

1426
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
second you believe things that couldn't
 

1427
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,230
second you believe things that couldn't
possibly be true so you were delusional

possibly be true so you were delusional
 

1429
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,430

third you became confused about time and

1430
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
third you became confused about time and
 

1431
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,830

place and person so you're suffering

place and person so you're suffering
 

1433
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,549

fourth you have wildly fluctuating

emotions something that um psychiatrists
 

1439
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,390
emotions something that um psychiatrists
will call being affectively labile

1440
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,400
will call being affectively labile
 

1441
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,149
will call being affectively labile
and then how wonderful you woke up this

1442
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:48,159
and then how wonderful you woke up this
 

1443
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,909
and then how wonderful you woke up this
morning and you forgot most if not all

1444
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
morning and you forgot most if not all
 

1445
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,190
morning and you forgot most if not all
of that dream experience so you're

1446
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
of that dream experience so you're
 

1447
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,269
of that dream experience so you're
suffering from amnesia if you had to

1448
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:53,279
suffering from amnesia if you had to
 

1449
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,750
suffering from amnesia if you had to
experience any one of those five things

1450
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
experience any one of those five things
 

1451
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,590
experience any one of those five things
while you're awake you would probably be

1452
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
while you're awake you would probably be
 

1453
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,549
while you're awake you would probably be
seeking psychological help

1454
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
seeking psychological help
 

1455
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,830
seeking psychological help
but what so i placed that as a backdrop

1456
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
but what so i placed that as a backdrop
 

1457
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,470
but what so i placed that as a backdrop
against your astute question because

1458

despite all of that

1462
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
psychosis
 

1463
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,870
psychosis
there is still a present

self
 

1467
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,149
self
nested at the heart of it

1468
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
nested at the heart of it
 

1469
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,470
nested at the heart of it
meaning that i think it's very difficult

1470
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
meaning that i think it's very difficult
 

1471
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,669
meaning that i think it's very difficult
for us

1472
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:19,679
for us
 

1473
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,389
for us
to

1474
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:20,399
to
 

1475
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,149
to
abandon our conscious sense of self and

1476
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
abandon our conscious sense of self and
 

1477
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,470
abandon our conscious sense of self and
if it's that hard you know the old adage

1478
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
if it's that hard you know the old adage
 

1479
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,310
if it's that hard you know the old adage
in some ways that you can't outrun your

1480
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,320
in some ways that you can't outrun your
 

1481
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,230
in some ways that you can't outrun your
shadow but here it's more of a

1482
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
shadow but here it's more of a
 

1483
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,070
shadow but here it's more of a
philosophical question which is about

1484
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,080
philosophical question which is about
 

1485
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,549
philosophical question which is about
the conscious mind and what the state of

1486
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
the conscious mind and what the state of
 

1487
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,630
the conscious mind and what the state of
consciousness actually means in a human

1488
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
consciousness actually means in a human
 

1489
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,990
consciousness actually means in a human
being

1490
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
being
 

1491
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,190
being
so i think that that to me you can

1492
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
so i think that that to me you can
 

1493
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,389
so i think that that to me you can
you become

1494
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:42,399
you become
 

1495
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,870
you become
so dislocated from so many other

1496
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
so dislocated from so many other
 

1497
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,669
so dislocated from so many other
rational ways of waking consciousness

1498
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
rational ways of waking consciousness
 

1499
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,750
rational ways of waking consciousness
but one thing that won't go away that

1500
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
but one thing that won't go away that
 

1501
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,789
but one thing that won't go away that
won't get

1502
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
won't get
 

1503
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,909
won't get
perturbed

1504
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:51,919
perturbed
 

1505
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,510
perturbed
or sort of

1506
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
or sort of
 

1507
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,630
or sort of
you know

1508
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
you know
 

1509
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,510
you know
manicled is this your sense of conscious

1510
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
manicled is this your sense of conscious
 

1511
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,350
manicled is this your sense of conscious
self yeah that's a strong sign that

1512
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
self yeah that's a strong sign that
 

1513
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,350
self yeah that's a strong sign that
consciousness is fundamental to the

1514
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
consciousness is fundamental to the
 

1515
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,789
consciousness is fundamental to the
human mind

1516
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799
human mind
 

1517
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,710
human mind
um or we're just creatures of habit

1518
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
um or we're just creatures of habit
 

1519
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,669
um or we're just creatures of habit
we've gotten used to having

1520
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679
we've gotten used to having
 

1521
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,909
we've gotten used to having
consciousness maybe it just takes a lot

1522
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
consciousness maybe it just takes a lot
 

1523
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,350
consciousness maybe it just takes a lot
of uh

1524
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360
of uh
 

1525
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,070
of uh
either chemical substances or a lot of

1526
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
either chemical substances or a lot of
 

1527
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,350
either chemical substances or a lot of
like

1528
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
like
 

1529
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,389
like
mental work to escape that i mean it's

1530
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
mental work to escape that i mean it's
 

1531
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,070
mental work to escape that i mean it's
like trying to launch

1532
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
like trying to launch
 

1533
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,190
like trying to launch
a rocket

1534
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
a rocket
 

1535
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,669
a rocket
you know the energy that has to be put

1536
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
you know the energy that has to be put
 

1537
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,470
you know the energy that has to be put
in to create escape velocity

1538
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
in to create escape velocity
 

1539
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,310
in to create escape velocity
from the gravitational pull of this

1540
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
from the gravitational pull of this
 

1541
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,470
from the gravitational pull of this
thing called planet earth is immense

1542
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,480
thing called planet earth is immense
 

1543
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,029
thing called planet earth is immense
yeah well the same thing is true

1544
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:31,039
yeah well the same thing is true
 

1545
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,470
yeah well the same thing is true
for

1546
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
for
 

1547
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,070
for
for us to abandon our sense of conscious

1548
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
for us to abandon our sense of conscious
 

1549
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,389
for us to abandon our sense of conscious
self the amount of biological the amount

1550
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:38,399
self the amount of biological the amount
 

1551
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,710
self the amount of biological the amount
of substances the amount of wacky stuff

1552
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
of substances the amount of wacky stuff
 

1553
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,269
of substances the amount of wacky stuff
that you have to do to truly get escaped

1554
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279
that you have to do to truly get escaped
 

1555
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,230
that you have to do to truly get escaped
velocity from your conscious self

1556
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
velocity from your conscious self
 

1557
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,389
velocity from your conscious self
what does that tell us about then the

1558
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
what does that tell us about then the
 

1559
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,669
what does that tell us about then the
fundamental

1560
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:49,679
fundamental
 

1561
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,070
fundamental
state of our conscious self

1562
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,080
state of our conscious self
 

1563
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,549
state of our conscious self
yeah it also probably says that that

1564
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559
yeah it also probably says that that
 

1565
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,549
yeah it also probably says that that
it's quite useful to have consciousness

1566
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
it's quite useful to have consciousness
 

1567
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,590
it's quite useful to have consciousness
for uh for survival and for just

1568
00:28:59,590 --> 00:28:59,600
for uh for survival and for just
 

1569
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,990
for uh for survival and for just
operation in this world and perhaps for

1570
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
operation in this world and perhaps for
 

1571
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,070
operation in this world and perhaps for
intelligence i'm one of the on the ai

1572
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
intelligence i'm one of the on the ai
 

1573
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,549
intelligence i'm one of the on the ai
side people that think

1574
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:06,559
side people that think
 

1575
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,990
side people that think
that uh

1576
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
that uh
 

1577
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,310
that uh
intelligence requires consciousness so

1578
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
intelligence requires consciousness so
 

1579
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,789
intelligence requires consciousness so
like high levels of general intelligence

1580
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
like high levels of general intelligence
 

1581
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,389
like high levels of general intelligence
requires consciousness

1582
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
requires consciousness
 

1583
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,870
requires consciousness
most people in the ai field think like

1584
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
most people in the ai field think like
 

1585
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,470
most people in the ai field think like
consciousness and intelligence are

1586
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
consciousness and intelligence are
 

1587
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,070
consciousness and intelligence are
fundamentally different you can build a

1588
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
fundamentally different you can build a
 

1589
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,070
fundamentally different you can build a
computer that's super intelligent it

1590
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
computer that's super intelligent it
 

1591
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,750
computer that's super intelligent it
doesn't have to be conscious

1592
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
doesn't have to be conscious
 

1593
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,029
doesn't have to be conscious
i think that

1594
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
i think that
 

1595
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,789
i think that
if you define super intelligence by

1596
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
if you define super intelligence by
 

1597
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,870
if you define super intelligence by
being good at chess yes but if you

1598
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
being good at chess yes but if you
 

1599
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,350
being good at chess yes but if you
define super intelligence as being able

1600
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
define super intelligence as being able
 

1601
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,830
define super intelligence as being able
to operate in this living world of

1602
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,840
to operate in this living world of
 

1603
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,870
to operate in this living world of
humans

1604
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,880
humans
 

1605
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,630
humans
and be able to perform all kinds of

1606
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,640
and be able to perform all kinds of
 

1607
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,029
and be able to perform all kinds of
different tasks consciousness

1608
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
different tasks consciousness
 

1609
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,750
different tasks consciousness
it seems to be somehow fundamental

1610
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
it seems to be somehow fundamental
 

1611
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,549
it seems to be somehow fundamental
to uh like to to to richly integrate

1612
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
to uh like to to to richly integrate
 

1613
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,110
to uh like to to to richly integrate
yourself into the human experience into

1614
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
yourself into the human experience into
 

1615
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,190
yourself into the human experience into
society it feels like you have to be a

1616
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,200
society it feels like you have to be a
 

1617
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,870
society it feels like you have to be a
conscious being

1618
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
conscious being
 

1619
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,310
conscious being
but then we don't even know what

1620
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320
but then we don't even know what
 

1621
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,230
but then we don't even know what
consciousness is and we certainly don't

1622
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,240
consciousness is and we certainly don't
 

1623
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,630
consciousness is and we certainly don't
know how to engineer it in our machines

1624
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
know how to engineer it in our machines
 

1625
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,430
know how to engineer it in our machines
i love the fact that there are still

1626
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
i love the fact that there are still
 

1627
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,070
i love the fact that there are still
questions that are so embryonic

1628
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
questions that are so embryonic
 

1629
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,389
questions that are so embryonic
because you know i suspect it's the same

1630
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
because you know i suspect it's the same
 

1631
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,590
because you know i suspect it's the same
with you

1632
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:05,600
with you
 

1633
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,549
with you

less so

1642
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880
less so
 

1643
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,990
less so
and i love the fact that we are still

1644
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
and i love the fact that we are still
 

1645
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,870
and i love the fact that we are still
embryonic in our sense of arguing about

embryonic in our sense of arguing about
 

1647
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,230
embryonic in our sense of arguing about
even what the definition of

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,240
even what the definition of
 

1649
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,029
even what the definition of
consciousness is but i also find it

1650
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,039
consciousness is but i also find it
 

1651
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,110
consciousness is but i also find it
fascinating i i think it's thoroughly

1652
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
fascinating i i think it's thoroughly
 

1653
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,710
fascinating i i think it's thoroughly
delightful to absorb yourself in the

1654
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
delightful to absorb yourself in the
 

1655
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,070
delightful to absorb yourself in the
thought

1656
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
thought
 

1657
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,190
thought
think about the brain and we can move

1658
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
think about the brain and we can move
 

1659
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,909
think about the brain and we can move
back across the complexity of phylogeny

1660
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:35,919
back across the complexity of phylogeny
 

1661
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,870
back across the complexity of phylogeny
from you know humans to mammals to sort

1662
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
from you know humans to mammals to sort
 

1663
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,990
from you know humans to mammals to sort
of birds to reptiles amphibians fish and

1664
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
of birds to reptiles amphibians fish and
 

1665
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,430
of birds to reptiles amphibians fish and
you can

1666
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
you can
 

1667
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,190
you can
bacteria whatever you want and you can

1668
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,200
bacteria whatever you want and you can
 

1669
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,029
bacteria whatever you want and you can
go through this and say okay where is

1670
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
go through this and say okay where is
 

1671
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,029
go through this and say okay where is
the hard line of you know what we would

1672
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
the hard line of you know what we would
 

1673
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,110
the hard line of you know what we would
define as consciousness and

1674
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,120
define as consciousness and
 

1675
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,789
define as consciousness and
and i'm sure it's got something to do

1676
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
and i'm sure it's got something to do
 

1677
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,190
and i'm sure it's got something to do
with the complexity of the neural system

1678
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
with the complexity of the neural system
 

1679
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,430
with the complexity of the neural system
of that i'm fairly certain

1680
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
of that i'm fairly certain
 

1681
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,630
of that i'm fairly certain
but

1682
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:58,640
but
 

1683
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,350
but
to me it's always been fascinating

1684
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,360
to me it's always been fascinating
 

1685
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,269
to me it's always been fascinating
so what is it then you know is it that i

1686
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279
so what is it then you know is it that i
 

1687
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,990
so what is it then you know is it that i
just keep adding neurons to a petri dish

1688
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
just keep adding neurons to a petri dish
 

1689
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,430
just keep adding neurons to a petri dish
and i just keep adding them and adding

1690
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
and i just keep adding them and adding
 

1691
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,950
and i just keep adding them and adding
them and adding them at some point when

1692
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:08,960
them and adding them at some point when
 

1693
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,870
them and adding them at some point when
i hit a critical mass of interconnected

1694
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
i hit a critical mass of interconnected
 

1695
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,830
i hit a critical mass of interconnected
neurons that is the mass of the you know

1696
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
neurons that is the mass of the you know
 

1697
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,509
neurons that is the mass of the you know
the interconnected human brain then

1698
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:15,519
the interconnected human brain then
 

1699
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,509
the interconnected human brain then
bingo

1700
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
bingo
 

1701
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,909
bingo
all of a sudden it kicks into gear and

1702
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
all of a sudden it kicks into gear and
 

1703
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,149
all of a sudden it kicks into gear and
we have consciousness like a phase shift

1704
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,159
we have consciousness like a phase shift
 

1705
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,070
we have consciousness like a phase shift
phase transition of some kind correct

1706
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,080
phase transition of some kind correct
 

1707
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,669
phase transition of some kind correct
yeah but there is something about the

1708
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
yeah but there is something about the
 

1709
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,590
yeah but there is something about the
complexity of the nervous system that i

1710
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
complexity of the nervous system that i
 

1711
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,190
complexity of the nervous system that i
think is fundamental to consciousness

1712
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
think is fundamental to consciousness
 

1713
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,470
think is fundamental to consciousness
and the reason i bring that up is

1714
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480
and the reason i bring that up is
 

1715
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,350
and the reason i bring that up is
because

1716
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
because
 

1717
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,710
because
when we're trying to then think about

1718
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720
when we're trying to then think about
 

1719
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,350
when we're trying to then think about
creating it in an artificial way does

1720
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360
creating it in an artificial way does
 

1721
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,750
creating it in an artificial way does
that inform us as to the complexity that

1722
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:37,760
that inform us as to the complexity that
 

1723
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,669
that inform us as to the complexity that
we should be looking at in terms of

1724
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
we should be looking at in terms of
 

1725
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,430
we should be looking at in terms of
development

1726
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
development
 

1727
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,590
development
i also think that it's a missed

1728
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
i also think that it's a missed
 

1729
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,389
i also think that it's a missed
opportunity in the

1730
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
opportunity in the
 

1731
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,110
opportunity in the
sort of digital space for us to try to

1732
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,120
sort of digital space for us to try to
 

1733
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,149
sort of digital space for us to try to
recreate human consciousness

1734
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:52,159
recreate human consciousness
 

1735
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,789
recreate human consciousness
we've already got human consciousness

1736
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:54,799
we've already got human consciousness
 

1737
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,470
we've already got human consciousness
what if we were to think about

1738
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
what if we were to think about
 

1739
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,190
what if we were to think about
creating some other form of why do we

1740
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
creating some other form of why do we
 

1741
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,549
creating some other form of why do we
have to think that

1742
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
have to think that
 

1743
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,509
have to think that
the ultimate in the creation of you know

1744
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
the ultimate in the creation of you know
 

1745
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,990
the ultimate in the creation of you know
an artificial intelligence is the

1746
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
an artificial intelligence is the
 

1747
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,430
an artificial intelligence is the
replication

1748
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
replication
 

1749
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,470

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:08,480
you know
 

1751
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,230
you know
of a human

1752
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:10,240
of a human
 

1753
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,710
of a human
state of consciousness can we not think

1754
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
state of consciousness can we not think
 

1755
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,350
state of consciousness can we not think
outside of our own

1756
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
outside of our own
 

1757
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,430
outside of our own
consciousness and believe that there is

1758
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,440
consciousness and believe that there is
 

1759
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,990
consciousness and believe that there is
something even more incredible or

1760
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,000
something even more incredible or
 

1761
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,200
something even more incredible or
more complementary more orthogonal

1762
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,210
more complementary more orthogonal

1765
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,070
[Music]
so i'm sometimes

1766
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,080
so i'm sometimes
 

1767
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,950
so i'm sometimes
perplexed that people are trying to

1768
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
perplexed that people are trying to
 

1769
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,950
perplexed that people are trying to
mimic human consciousness rather than

1770
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
mimic human consciousness rather than
 

1771
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,110
mimic human consciousness rather than
think about creating

1772
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,120
think about creating
 

1773
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,190
think about creating
something that's different yeah i think

1774
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,200
something that's different yeah i think
 

1775
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,190
something that's different yeah i think
of human consciousness or consciousness

1776
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,200
of human consciousness or consciousness
 

1777
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,430
of human consciousness or consciousness
in general is this magic

1778
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440
in general is this magic
 

1779
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,029
in general is this magic
um

1780
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:41,039
um
 

1781
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,590
um
superpower that allows us to deeply

1782
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600
superpower that allows us to deeply
 

1783
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,350
superpower that allows us to deeply
experience the world and just as you're

1784
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,360
experience the world and just as you're
 

1785
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,269
experience the world and just as you're
saying i don't think that superpower has

1786
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
saying i don't think that superpower has
 

1787
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,669
saying i don't think that superpower has
to take the exact flavor as humans have

1788
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
to take the exact flavor as humans have
 

1789
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,750
to take the exact flavor as humans have
that's my love for robots

1790
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
that's my love for robots
 

1791
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,149
that's my love for robots
i would love to

1792
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
i would love to
 

1793
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,110
i would love to
add the ability to robots that can

1794
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,120
add the ability to robots that can
 

1795
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,230
add the ability to robots that can
experience the world and other humans

1796

i don't know about you
where i wish i had an al pacino in my

1983
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,510

integrity is really important in this

1984
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
integrity is really important in this
 

1985
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,510
integrity is really important in this
life it is and sometimes you find

1986
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,520
life it is and sometimes you find
 

1987
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,550
life it is and sometimes you find
yourself in places where

1988
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
yourself in places where
 

1989
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,390
yourself in places where
there's pressure to sacrifice that

there's pressure to sacrifice that
 

1991
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,150
there's pressure to sacrifice that
integrity and you want uh what is it

1992
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
integrity and you want uh what is it
 

1993

british and sort of having that slightly
 

2009
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,829
british and sort of having that slightly
um

2010
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
um
 

2011
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,510
um
awkward sort of huge grand gene it's

2012
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:45,520
awkward sort of huge grand gene it's
 

2013
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,270
awkward sort of huge grand gene it's
it's very very

2014
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
it's very very
 

2015
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,870
it's very very
at the opposite end of the spectrum of

2016
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:48,880
at the opposite end of the spectrum of
 

2017
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,829
at the opposite end of the spectrum of
the remarkable feat of uh al pacino at

2018
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
the remarkable feat of uh al pacino at
 

2019
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,710
the remarkable feat of uh al pacino at
the end of that scene but um and yeah

2020
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
the end of that scene but um and yeah
 

2021
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,030
the end of that scene but um and yeah
integrity is um it's a

2022
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,040
integrity is um it's a
 

2023
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,710
integrity is um it's a
challenging

2024
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:58,720
challenging
 

2025
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,430
challenging
thing and i value it much and i think

2026
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,440
thing and i value it much and i think
 

2027
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,390
thing and i value it much and i think
um

2028
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,400
um
 

2029
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,150
um
it can take 20 years to build a

2030
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
it can take 20 years to build a
 

2031
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,950
it can take 20 years to build a
reputation in two minutes to lose it and

2032
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:06,960
reputation in two minutes to lose it and
 

2033
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,510
reputation in two minutes to lose it and
there is nothing more that i value than

2034
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,520
there is nothing more that i value than
 

2035
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,109
there is nothing more that i value than
but integrity and

2036
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
but integrity and
 

2037
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,950
but integrity and
you know if i'm ever wrong about

2038
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
you know if i'm ever wrong about
 

2039
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,430
you know if i'm ever wrong about
anything i truly don't want to be

2040
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:15,440
anything i truly don't want to be
 

2041
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,390
anything i truly don't want to be
wrong for any longer than i have to be

2042
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:18,400
wrong for any longer than i have to be
 

2043
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,270
wrong for any longer than i have to be
um

2044
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,280
um
 

2045
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,670
um
you know that's what being in some ways

2046
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680
you know that's what being in some ways
 

2047
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,829
you know that's what being in some ways
a scientist is you're

2048
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:23,839
a scientist is you're
 

2049
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,589
a scientist is you're
you're just driven by truth and the

2050
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:25,599
you're just driven by truth and the
 

2051
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,750
you're just driven by truth and the
irony relative to something like

2052
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760
irony relative to something like
 

2053
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,870
irony relative to something like
mathematics is that in science you never

2054
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:30,880
mathematics is that in science you never
 

2055
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,990
mathematics is that in science you never
find truth what all you do in science is

2056
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,000
find truth what all you do in science is
 

2057
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,230
find truth what all you do in science is
you discount the things that are likely

2058
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,240
you discount the things that are likely
 

2059
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,069
you discount the things that are likely
to be untrue

2060
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:38,079
to be untrue
 

2061
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,710
to be untrue
leaving only the possibility of what

2062
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
leaving only the possibility of what
 

2063
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,510
leaving only the possibility of what
could be true yeah but in math

2064
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
could be true yeah but in math
 

2065
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,349
could be true yeah but in math
you know when you create

2066
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
you know when you create
 

2067
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,109
you know when you create
you know a proof it's a proof for

2068
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
you know a proof it's a proof for
 

2069
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,550
you know a proof it's a proof for
you know

2070
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
you know
 

2071
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,950
you know
from that point forward there is truth

2072
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960
from that point forward there is truth
 

2073
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,950
from that point forward there is truth
in mathematics and there's i think

2074
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:54,960
in mathematics and there's i think
 

2075
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,790
in mathematics and there's i think
there's a beauty in that

2076
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:56,800
there's a beauty in that
 

2077
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,349
there's a beauty in that
but i kind of like the messiness of of

2078
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359
but i kind of like the messiness of of
 

2079
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,349
but i kind of like the messiness of of
science because again

2080
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
science because again
 

2081
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,750
science because again
to me it's less about the truth of the

2082
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:03,760
to me it's less about the truth of the
 

2083
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,069
to me it's less about the truth of the
answer and it is more about the pursuit

2084
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:06,079
answer and it is more about the pursuit
 

2085
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,870
answer and it is more about the pursuit
of questions but their integrity becomes

2086
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:08,880
of questions but their integrity becomes
 

2087
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,550
of questions but their integrity becomes
more and more important and it becomes

2088
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
more and more important and it becomes
 

2089
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,390
more and more important and it becomes
more difficult there's a lot of

2090
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
more difficult there's a lot of
 

2091
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,670
more difficult there's a lot of
pressures just like in the rest of the

2092
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:13,680
pressures just like in the rest of the
 

2093
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,950
pressures just like in the rest of the
world but

2094
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
world but
 

2095
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,150
world but
there's a lot of pressures on a

2096
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,160
there's a lot of pressures on a
 

2097
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,109
there's a lot of pressures on a
scientist one is like funding sources

2098
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:19,119
scientist one is like funding sources
 

2099
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,270
scientist one is like funding sources
yeah i've noticed this that um you know

2100
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:21,280
yeah i've noticed this that um you know
 

2101
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,390
yeah i've noticed this that um you know
money affects everyone's mind i think

2102
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:24,400
money affects everyone's mind i think
 

2103
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,030
money affects everyone's mind i think
i've been always somebody that

2104
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,040
i've been always somebody that
 

2105
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,589
i've been always somebody that
i believe money can't you can't buy

2106
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
i believe money can't you can't buy
 

2107
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,150
i believe money can't you can't buy
my opinion uh i don't care how much

2108
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,160
my opinion uh i don't care how much
 

2109
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,310
my opinion uh i don't care how much
money billions or trillions

2110
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
money billions or trillions
 

2111
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,670
money billions or trillions
the

2112
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,680
the
 

2113
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,109
the
but that pressure is there and you have

2114
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
but that pressure is there and you have
 

2115
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,270
but that pressure is there and you have
to be very cognizant of it and make sure

2116
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:39,280
to be very cognizant of it and make sure
 

2117
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,069
to be very cognizant of it and make sure

2311
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,910
yeah
that to me frightens me more

2312
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
that to me frightens me more
 

2313
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,510

but with the podcast i think

2314
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
but with the podcast i think
 

2315
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,470
but with the podcast i think
really i have two very simple goals

00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
really i have two very simple goals
 

2317
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,270
really i have two very simple goals
i want to try and democratize the

2318
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
i want to try and democratize the
 

2319
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,790
i want to try and democratize the
science of sleep

2320
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:22,800
science of sleep
 

2321
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,870
science of sleep
and in doing so my goal would be to try

2322
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:24,880
and in doing so my goal would be to try
 

2323
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,030
and in doing so my goal would be to try
and reunite humanity with the sleep that

2324
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,040
and reunite humanity with the sleep that
 

2325
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,390
and reunite humanity with the sleep that

it because i thought there's no way you
 

2389
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,670

because it's a lot of work uh but he is

2392
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:46,160
because it's a lot of work uh but he is
 

2393
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,950
because it's a lot of work uh but he is
like

2394
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:46,960
like
 

2395
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,630
like
doing an incredible job of it i just

2396
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:48,640
doing an incredible job of it i just
 

2397
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,430
doing an incredible job of it i just
think

2398
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:49,440
think
 

2399
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,030
think
it's the same with like dan carlin in

2400
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,040
it's the same with like dan carlin in
 

2401
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,510
it's the same with like dan carlin in
hardcore history i thought

2402
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
hardcore history i thought
 

2403
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,550
hardcore history i thought
i thought that the way andrew's doing it

2404
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:56,560
i thought that the way andrew's doing it
 

2405
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,950
i thought that the way andrew's doing it
would crush him the way

2406
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960
would crush him the way
 

2407
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,390
would crush him the way
he crushes dan carlin so dan has so much

2408
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
he crushes dan carlin so dan has so much
 

2409
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,950
he crushes dan carlin so dan has so much
pressure on him to do a good job that he

2410
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:04,960
pressure on him to do a good job that he
 

2411
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,790
pressure on him to do a good job that he
ends up publishing like two episodes a

2412
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:06,800
ends up publishing like two episodes a
 

2413
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,990
ends up publishing like two episodes a
year

2414
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
year
 

2415
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,069
year
so that pressure can be paralyzing the

2416
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,079
so that pressure can be paralyzing the
 

2417
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,829
so that pressure can be paralyzing the
pressure of like

2418
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
pressure of like
 

2419
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,589
pressure of like
putting out like

2420
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
putting out like
 

2421
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,470
putting out like
strong scientific statements that that

2422
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:16,480
strong scientific statements that that
 

2423
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,109
strong scientific statements that that
can be overwhelming now andrew seems to

2424
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
can be overwhelming now andrew seems to
 

2425
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,510
can be overwhelming now andrew seems to
be just plowing through anyway if

2426
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,520
be just plowing through anyway if
 

2427
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,750
be just plowing through anyway if
there's mistakes he'll he'll say there's

2428
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:23,760
there's mistakes he'll he'll say there's
 

2429
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,670
there's mistakes he'll he'll say there's
corrections and so on yeah i just i

2430
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
corrections and so on yeah i just i
 

2431
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,030
corrections and so on yeah i just i
wonder i actually haven't talked to him

2432
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,040
wonder i actually haven't talked to him
 

2433
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,870
wonder i actually haven't talked to him
too much about it like psychologically

2434
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:28,880
too much about it like psychologically
 

2435
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,630
too much about it like psychologically
how difficult is it

2436
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
how difficult is it
 

2437
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,790
how difficult is it

00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
amounts of caffeine all that to say
 

2599
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,150
amounts of caffeine all that to say
uh

2600
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160
uh
 

2601
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,430
uh
what do you think is the relationship

2602
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:29,440
what do you think is the relationship
 

2603
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,230
what do you think is the relationship
between coffee and sleep caffeine and

2604
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
between coffee and sleep caffeine and
 

2605
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,430
between coffee and sleep caffeine and
sleep if there's an interesting

2606
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:33,440
sleep if there's an interesting
 

2607
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,589
sleep if there's an interesting
distinction there there is a distinction

2608
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:35,599
distinction there there is a distinction
 

2609
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,670
distinction there there is a distinction
so i think the first thing to say which

2610
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:37,680
so i think the first thing to say which
 

2611
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,069
so i think the first thing to say which
is going to sound strange coming from me

2612
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
is going to sound strange coming from me
 

2613
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,950
is going to sound strange coming from me
is drink coffee

2614
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:42,960
is drink coffee
 

2615
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,510
is drink coffee
um the health benefits associated with

2616
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:45,520
um the health benefits associated with
 

2617
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,190
um the health benefits associated with
drinking coffee are

2618
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:47,200
drinking coffee are
 

2619
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,309
drinking coffee are
really quite well established now

2620
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:50,319
really quite well established now
 

2621
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,109
really quite well established now
um

2622
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
um
 

2623
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,670
um
but i think that the counterpoint to

2624
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,680
but i think that the counterpoint to
 

2625
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,910
but i think that the counterpoint to
that well firstly the dose and the

2626
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:55,920
that well firstly the dose and the
 

2627
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,710
that well firstly the dose and the
timing make the poison and i'll perhaps

2628
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
timing make the poison and i'll perhaps
 

2629
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,109
timing make the poison and i'll perhaps
come back to that in just a second

2630
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:01,119
come back to that in just a second
 

2631
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,630
come back to that in just a second
but for

2632
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
but for
 

2633
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,910
but for
coffee

2634
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
coffee
 

2635
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,109
coffee
it's actually not the caffeine

2636
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:07,119
it's actually not the caffeine
 

2637
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,150
it's actually not the caffeine
so

2638
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,160
so
 

2639
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,470
so
you know a lot of people have asked me

2640
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,480
you know a lot of people have asked me
 

2641
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,710
you know a lot of people have asked me
about this rightful paradox between the

2642
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
about this rightful paradox between the
 

2643
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,470
about this rightful paradox between the
fact that sleep provides all of these

2644
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,480
fact that sleep provides all of these
 

2645
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,470
fact that sleep provides all of these
incredible health benefits

2646
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,480
incredible health benefits
 

2647
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,470
incredible health benefits
and then coffee which can have a

2648
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:18,480
and then coffee which can have a
 

2649
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,750
and then coffee which can have a
deleterious

2650
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:19,760
deleterious
 

2651
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,069
deleterious
impact on your sleep has

2652
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
impact on your sleep has
 

2653
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,990
impact on your sleep has
a whole collection of health benefits

00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,000
a whole collection of health benefits

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,230
a whole collection of health benefits
many of them venn diagram overlapping

2656
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
many of them venn diagram overlapping
 

2657
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,710
many of them venn diagram overlapping
with those that sleep provides how on

2658
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:28,720
with those that sleep provides how on
 

2659
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,109
with those that sleep provides how on
earth can you reconcile those two

2660
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:31,119
earth can you reconcile those two
 

2661
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,190
earth can you reconcile those two
and the answer is that

2662
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,200
and the answer is that
 

2663
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,870
and the answer is that
well the answer is very simple it's

2664
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:34,880
well the answer is very simple it's
 

2665
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,829
well the answer is very simple it's
called

2666
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:35,839
called
 

2667
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,589
called
antioxidants

2668
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:37,599
antioxidants
 

2669
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,069
antioxidants
but it turns out that for most people in

2670
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
but it turns out that for most people in
 

2671
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,950
but it turns out that for most people in
western civilization because of diet not

2672
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:42,960
western civilization because of diet not
 

2673
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,750
western civilization because of diet not
being quite what it should be

2674
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:45,760
being quite what it should be
 

2675
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,230
being quite what it should be
the major source through which they

2676
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:48,240
the major source through which they
 

2677
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,190
the major source through which they
obtain antioxidants is the coffee bean

2678
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
obtain antioxidants is the coffee bean
 

2679
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,910
obtain antioxidants is the coffee bean
so the the humble coffee bean has now

2680
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:53,920
so the the humble coffee bean has now
 

2681
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,230
so the the humble coffee bean has now
been asked to carry the astronomical

2682
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:56,240
been asked to carry the astronomical
 

2683
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,109
been asked to carry the astronomical
weight

2684
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:57,119

00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
of serving up the large majority of
 

2687
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,710
of serving up the large majority of
people's antioxidant needs

2688
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:02,720
people's antioxidant needs
 

2689
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,510
people's antioxidant needs
and

2690
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:03,520
and
 

2691
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,750
and
you can see this if for example you look

2692
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760
you can see this if for example you look
 

2693
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,390
you can see this if for example you look
at the health benefits of decaffeinated

2694
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:08,400
at the health benefits of decaffeinated
 

2695
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,950
at the health benefits of decaffeinated
coffee it has a whole constellation of

2696
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:10,960
coffee it has a whole constellation of
 

2697
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,950
coffee it has a whole constellation of
really great health benefits too so it's

2698
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:12,960
really great health benefits too so it's
 

2699
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,950
really great health benefits too so it's
not like caffeine and that's why i liked

2700
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:14,960
not like caffeine and that's why i liked
 

2701
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,430
not like caffeine and that's why i liked
what you said this sort of separation of

2702
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,440
what you said this sort of separation of
 

2703
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,750
what you said this sort of separation of
church and state between coffee and

2704
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:19,760
church and state between coffee and
 

2705
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,150
church and state between coffee and
caffeine it's not the caffeine it's the

2706
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,160
caffeine it's not the caffeine it's the
 

2707
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,790
caffeine it's not the caffeine it's the
coffee bean itself that provides those

2708
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:24,800
coffee bean itself that provides those
 

2709
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,790
coffee bean itself that provides those
health benefits but

2710
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:26,800
health benefits but
 

2711
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,390
health benefits but
coming back to how it impacts sleep it

2712
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,400
coming back to how it impacts sleep it
 

2713
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,710
coming back to how it impacts sleep it
impacts sleep in probably at least three

2714
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
impacts sleep in probably at least three
 

2715
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,990
impacts sleep in probably at least three
different ways

2716
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
different ways
 

2717
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,510
different ways
the first is that for most people

2718
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520
the first is that for most people
 

2719
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,510
the first is that for most people
caffeine can make it obviously a little

2720
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
caffeine can make it obviously a little
 

2721
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,589
caffeine can make it obviously a little
harder to fall asleep

2722
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:41,599
harder to fall asleep
 

2723
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,589
harder to fall asleep
caffeine can make it harder to stay

2724
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
caffeine can make it harder to stay
 

2725
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,390
caffeine can make it harder to stay
asleep

2726
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
asleep
 

2727
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,910
asleep
but let's say that you are one of those

2728
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:45,920
but let's say that you are one of those
 

2729
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,750
but let's say that you are one of those
individuals and i think you are

2730
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:47,760
individuals and i think you are
 

2731
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,349
individuals and i think you are
and you can say look i can have three or

2732
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:49,359
and you can say look i can have three or
 

2733
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,670
and you can say look i can have three or
four espressos with dinner and i fall

2734
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:51,680
four espressos with dinner and i fall
 

2735
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,750
four espressos with dinner and i fall
asleep just fine and i stay asleep

2736
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,760
asleep just fine and i stay asleep
 

2737
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,510
asleep just fine and i stay asleep
soundly across the light so there's no

2738
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:55,520
soundly across the light so there's no
 

2739
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,870
soundly across the light so there's no
problem

2740
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:56,880
problem
 

2741
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,270
problem
the downside there is that even if that

2742
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,280
the downside there is that even if that
 

2743
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,750
the downside there is that even if that
is true the amount of deep sleep that

2744
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:01,760
is true the amount of deep sleep that
 

2745
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,150
is true the amount of deep sleep that
you get will not be as deep and so you

2746
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:04,160
you get will not be as deep and so you
 

2747
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,309
you get will not be as deep and so you
will actually lose somewhere between 10

2748
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
will actually lose somewhere between 10
 

2749
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,630
will actually lose somewhere between 10
to 30 percent of your deep sleep if you

2750
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
to 30 percent of your deep sleep if you
 

2751
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,190
to 30 percent of your deep sleep if you
drink caffeine in the evening

2752
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
drink caffeine in the evening
 

2753
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,910
drink caffeine in the evening
so to give you some context to to drop

2754
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
so to give you some context to to drop
 

2755
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,470
so to give you some context to to drop
your deep sleep by let's say 20 i'd

2756
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:16,480
your deep sleep by let's say 20 i'd
 

2757
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,190
your deep sleep by let's say 20 i'd
probably have to age you by 15 years or

2758
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
probably have to age you by 15 years or
 

2759
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,950
probably have to age you by 15 years or
you could do it every night with a cup

i think the fourth component that is

2764
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
i think the fourth component that is
 

2765
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,470
i think the fourth component that is
perhaps less well understood about

coffee is its timing and that's why i

2768
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
coffee is its timing and that's why i
 

2769
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,630
coffee is its timing and that's why i
was saying the timing and the dose make

2770
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:30,640
was saying the timing and the dose make

00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
the poison the dose by the way once you
 

2773
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,030
the poison the dose by the way once you
get past about three cups of coffee a

though caffeine has a half-life of about
 

2791
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,190
though caffeine has a half-life of about
five to six hours

five to six hours
 

2793
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,670
five to six hours
meaning that after five to six hours

2794
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:57,680
meaning that after five to six hours

which means that it has a quarter life

2800
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:04,400
which means that it has a quarter life
 

2801
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,549
which means that it has a quarter life
of 10 to 12 hours so in other words if

2803
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,710
of 10 to 12 hours so in other words if
you have a coffee at noon a quarter of

the clearance of caffeine from your
 

2863
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,510
the clearance of caffeine from your
system some people will have a version

so their half-life could be as short as
 

2871
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,790
so their half-life could be as short as
two hours rather than five to six hours

the caffeine and therefore the half-life
 

2881
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,710
the caffeine and therefore the half-life
sort of sensitivity could be somewhere

2882
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
sort of sensitivity could be somewhere
 

2883
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,069
sort of sensitivity could be somewhere
between you know eight to nine hours

between you know eight to nine hours
 

2885
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,510
between you know eight to nine hours
so we understand that there are

practice

2918
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:19,839
practice
 

2919
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,829
practice
like i drink a lot of coffee so like

2920
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:21,839
like i drink a lot of coffee so like
 

2921
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,829
like i drink a lot of coffee so like
habit

2922
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:23,839
habit
 

2923
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,829
habit
alters how your body is able to get rid

2924
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
alters how your body is able to get rid
 

2925
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,470
alters how your body is able to get rid
of the caffeine not how the body is able

2926
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,480
of the caffeine not how the body is able
 

2927
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,030
of the caffeine not how the body is able
to get rid of the caffeine but it does

2928
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:31,040
to get rid of the caffeine but it does
 

2929
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,030
to get rid of the caffeine but it does
alter how sensitive

2930
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,040
alter how sensitive
 

2931
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,950
alter how sensitive
the body is to the caffeine and it's not

2932
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:34,960
the body is to the caffeine and it's not
 

2933
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,829
the body is to the caffeine and it's not
at the level of the enzyme degrading the

2934
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:37,839
at the level of the enzyme degrading the
 

2935
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,990
at the level of the enzyme degrading the
caffeine it's at the level of the

2936
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,000
caffeine it's at the level of the
 

2937
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,990
caffeine it's at the level of the
receptors that caffeine will act upon

2938
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
receptors that caffeine will act upon
 

2939
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,829
receptors that caffeine will act upon
now it turns out that those are called

2940
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:45,839
now it turns out that those are called
 

2941
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,430
now it turns out that those are called
adenosine receptors and maybe we can

2942
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:47,440
adenosine receptors and maybe we can
 

2943
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,670
adenosine receptors and maybe we can
speak about what adenosine is and sleep

2944
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,680
speak about what adenosine is and sleep
 

2945
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,150
speak about what adenosine is and sleep
pressure and all of that good stuff but

2946
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:52,160
pressure and all of that good stuff but
 

2947
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,549
pressure and all of that good stuff but
as you start to drink more and more

2948
00:53:54,549 --> 00:53:54,559
as you start to drink more and more
 

2949
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,309
as you start to drink more and more
coffee

2950
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
coffee
 

2951
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,190
coffee
the body tries to fight back and it

2952
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,200
the body tries to fight back and it
 

2953
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,790
the body tries to fight back and it
happens with many different drugs by the

2954
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:00,800
happens with many different drugs by the
 

2955
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,030
happens with many different drugs by the
way and it's called tolerance

2956
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
way and it's called tolerance
 

2957
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,430
way and it's called tolerance
and so one of the ways that your body

2958
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
and so one of the ways that your body
 

2959
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,990
and so one of the ways that your body
becomes tolerant to a drug is that the

2960
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,000
becomes tolerant to a drug is that the
 

2961
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,990
becomes tolerant to a drug is that the
receptors that the drug is binding to

2962
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,000
receptors that the drug is binding to
 

2963
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,670
receptors that the drug is binding to
these sort of welcome sites these sort

2964
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
these sort of welcome sites these sort
 

2965
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,230
these sort of welcome sites these sort
of you know picture myths as it were

2966
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
of you know picture myths as it were
 

2967
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,230
of you know picture myths as it were
that receive the drug

2968
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,240
that receive the drug
 

2969
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,309
that receive the drug
those start to get

2970
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
those start to get
 

2971
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,510
those start to get
taken away from the surface of the cell

2972
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:21,520
taken away from the surface of the cell
 

2973
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,109
taken away from the surface of the cell
and it's what we call receptor

2974
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
and it's what we call receptor
 

2975
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,030
and it's what we call receptor
internalization

2976
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:25,040
internalization
 

2977
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,430
internalization
so the cell starts to think gee where's

2978
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,440
so the cell starts to think gee where's
 

2979
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,870
so the cell starts to think gee where's
you know this there's a lot of

2980
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:28,880
you know this there's a lot of
 

2981
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,510
you know this there's a lot of
stimulation going on this is too much so

2982
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
stimulation going on this is too much so
 

2983
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,870
stimulation going on this is too much so
i'm just going to

2984
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:32,880
i'm just going to
 

2985
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,109
i'm just going to
when normally i would you know coat my

2986
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
when normally i would you know coat my
 

2987
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,750
when normally i would you know coat my
cell with let's just say five of these

2988
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:37,760
cell with let's just say five of these
 

2989
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,549
cell with let's just say five of these
receptors for argument's sake

2990
00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:40,559
receptors for argument's sake
 

2991
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,150
receptors for argument's sake
things are going a little bit too

2992
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,160
things are going a little bit too
 

2993
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,990
things are going a little bit too
ballistic right now i'm going to take

2994
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,000
ballistic right now i'm going to take
 

2995
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,150
ballistic right now i'm going to take
away at least two of those receptors and

2996
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,160
away at least two of those receptors and
 

2997
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,069
away at least two of those receptors and
downscale it to just having three of

2998
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:48,079
downscale it to just having three of
 

2999
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,030
downscale it to just having three of
those

3000
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:49,040
those
 

3001
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,510
those
and now you need two cups of coffee to

3002
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:51,520
and now you need two cups of coffee to
 

3003
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,589
and now you need two cups of coffee to
get the same effect that one cup of

3004
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:53,599
get the same effect that one cup of
 

3005
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,430
get the same effect that one cup of
coffee got you before

3006
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
coffee got you before
 

3007
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,390
coffee got you before
and that's why then when you go

3008
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:58,400
and that's why then when you go
 

3009
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,230
and that's why then when you go
cold turkey on coffee all of a sudden

3010
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:02,240
cold turkey on coffee all of a sudden
 

3011
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,510
cold turkey on coffee all of a sudden
the system has equilibriated itself to

3012
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:05,520
the system has equilibriated itself to
 

3013
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,549
the system has equilibriated itself to
expecting x amount of stimulation and

3014
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:08,559
expecting x amount of stimulation and
 

3015
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,230
expecting x amount of stimulation and
now all of that stimulation is gone so

3016
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
now all of that stimulation is gone so
 

3017
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,109
now all of that stimulation is gone so
it's now got too few receptors and you

3018
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,119
it's now got too few receptors and you
 

3019
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,589
it's now got too few receptors and you
have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome

3020
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:15,599
have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome
 

3021
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,589
have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome
and that's why for example with you know

3022
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
and that's why for example with you know
 

3023
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,990
and that's why for example with you know
drugs of abuse things like heroin when

3024
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,000
drugs of abuse things like heroin when
 

3025
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,349
drugs of abuse things like heroin when
people go into abstinence

3026
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
people go into abstinence
 

3027
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,190
people go into abstinence
you know as they're sort of moving into

3028
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
you know as they're sort of moving into
 

3029
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,789
you know as they're sort of moving into
their addiction

3030
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:26,799
their addiction
 

3031
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,109
their addiction
they will build up a progressive

3032
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:29,119
they will build up a progressive
 

3033
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,270
they will build up a progressive
tolerance to that drug so they need to

3034
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:31,280
tolerance to that drug so they need to
 

3035
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,150
tolerance to that drug so they need to
take more of it to get the same high but

3036
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,160
take more of it to get the same high but
 

3037
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,390
take more of it to get the same high but
then if they go cold turkey

3038
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:36,400
then if they go cold turkey
 

3039
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,870
then if they go cold turkey
for some period of time the system goes

3040
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
for some period of time the system goes
 

3041
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,710
for some period of time the system goes
back to being more sensitive again it

3042
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:40,720
back to being more sensitive again it
 

3043
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,789
back to being more sensitive again it
starts to repopulate the surface of the

3044
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:42,799
starts to repopulate the surface of the
 

3045
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,510
starts to repopulate the surface of the
cell with these receptors but now when

3046
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:45,520
cell with these receptors but now when
 

3047
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,589
cell with these receptors but now when
they reuse and they fall off the wagon

3048
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
they reuse and they fall off the wagon
 

3049
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,430
they reuse and they fall off the wagon
if they go back to the same dose that

3050
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:49,440
if they go back to the same dose that
 

3051
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,430
if they go back to the same dose that
they were using before

3052
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:51,440
they were using before
 

3053
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,750
they were using before
you know 10 weeks ago or three months

3054
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
you know 10 weeks ago or three months
 

3055
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,630
you know 10 weeks ago or three months
ago

3056
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
ago
 

3057
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,670
ago
that dose

3058
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:55,680
that dose
 

3059
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,069
that dose
can kill them they can have an overdose

3060
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,079
can kill them they can have an overdose
 

3061
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,589
can kill them they can have an overdose
even though they were using the same

3062
00:55:59,589 --> 00:55:59,599
even though they were using the same
 

3063
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,470
even though they were using the same
amount at those two different times the

3064
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:02,480
amount at those two different times the
 

3065
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,030
amount at those two different times the
difference is that it's not the dose of

3066
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
difference is that it's not the dose of
 

3067
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,349
difference is that it's not the dose of
the drug it's the sensitivity of the

3068
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
the drug it's the sensitivity of the
 

3069
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,750
the drug it's the sensitivity of the
system and that's the same thing that we

3070
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:09,760
system and that's the same thing that we
 

3071
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,910
system and that's the same thing that we
see with caffeine in terms of training

3072
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:11,920
see with caffeine in terms of training
 

3073
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,390
see with caffeine in terms of training
the muscle as it were is the system

3074
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
the muscle as it were is the system
 

3075
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,589
the muscle as it were is the system
becomes less sensitive can calibrate

3076
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
becomes less sensitive can calibrate
 

3077
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,230
becomes less sensitive can calibrate
is there a time

3078
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
is there a time
 

3079
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,789
is there a time
the number of hours before bed

3080
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:22,799
the number of hours before bed
 

3081
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,870
the number of hours before bed
that's a safe bet

3082
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:24,880
that's a safe bet
 

3083
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,430
that's a safe bet
to most people to recommend

3084
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
to most people to recommend
 

3085
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,150
to most people to recommend
you shouldn't drink caffeine this many

3086
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:30,160
you shouldn't drink caffeine this many
 

3087
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,030
you shouldn't drink caffeine this many
hours

3088
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,040
hours
 

3089
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,510
hours
like is there an average half-life that

3090
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:33,520
like is there an average half-life that
 

3091
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,950
like is there an average half-life that
you should be aiming at

3092
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,960
you should be aiming at
 

3093
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,190
you should be aiming at
yeah or is this advice kind of

3094
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,200
yeah or is this advice kind of
 

3095
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,710
yeah or is this advice kind of
impossible because there's so much

3096
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
impossible because there's so much
 

3097
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,190
impossible because there's so much
variability there is a huge variability

3098
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,200
variability there is a huge variability
 

3099
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,510
variability there is a huge variability
and i think everyone themselves you know

3100
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,520
and i think everyone themselves you know
 

3101
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,789
and i think everyone themselves you know
to a degree knows it although i'll put a

3102
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
to a degree knows it although i'll put a
 

3103
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,630
to a degree knows it although i'll put a
caveat on that too because it's slightly

3104
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:48,640
caveat on that too because it's slightly
 

3105
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,390
caveat on that too because it's slightly
dangerous point

3106
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
dangerous point
 

3107
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,630
dangerous point
so the recommendation for the average

3108
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:52,640
so the recommendation for the average
 

3109
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,030
so the recommendation for the average
adult and who where is the average adult

3110
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
adult and who where is the average adult
 

3111
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,789
adult and who where is the average adult
in society there is no such thing but

3112
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:56,799
in society there is no such thing but
 

3113
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,390
in society there is no such thing but
for the average adult

3114
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:58,400
for the average adult
 

3115
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,990
for the average adult
it would be probably cutting yourself

3116
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000
it would be probably cutting yourself
 

3117
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,270
it would be probably cutting yourself
off maybe 10 hours you know before so

3118
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,280
off maybe 10 hours you know before so
 

3119
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,150
off maybe 10 hours you know before so
assuming a normative bedtime in society

3120
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:06,160
assuming a normative bedtime in society
 

3121
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,069
assuming a normative bedtime in society
i would say try to stop drinking

3122
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:08,079
i would say try to stop drinking
 

3123
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,589
i would say try to stop drinking
caffeine you know

3124
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
caffeine you know
 

3125
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,670
caffeine you know
before 2 pm and

3126
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:11,680
before 2 pm and
 

3127
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,190
before 2 pm and
just keep an eye out you know and if

3128
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:13,200
just keep an eye out you know and if
 

3129
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,870
just keep an eye out you know and if
you're struggling with sleep dial down

3130
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
you're struggling with sleep dial down
 

3131
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,069
you're struggling with sleep dial down
the caffeine and see if it makes a

3132
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:16,079
the caffeine and see if it makes a
 

3133
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,910
the caffeine and see if it makes a
difference

3134
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
difference
 

3135
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,829
difference
can i ask you about sleep

3136
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:19,839
can i ask you about sleep
 

3137
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,030
can i ask you about sleep
and

3138
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,040
and
 

3139
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,470
and
learning

3140
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,480
learning
 

3141
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,270
learning
so

3142
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
so
 

3143
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,430
so
how does sleep affect learning

3144
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,440
how does sleep affect learning
 

3145
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,349
how does sleep affect learning
sleep

3146
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:27,359
sleep
 

3147
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,230
sleep
before learning sleep after learning

3148
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
before learning sleep after learning
 

3149
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,670
before learning sleep after learning
which are both fascinating kind of

3150
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:31,680
which are both fascinating kind of
 

3151
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,030
which are both fascinating kind of
dynamics

3152
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,040
dynamics
 

3153
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,030
dynamics
of the mind's interaction with this

3154
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,040
of the mind's interaction with this
 

3155
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,829
of the mind's interaction with this
extra conscious state

3156
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:37,839
extra conscious state
 

3157
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,430
extra conscious state
yeah sleep is

3158
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:39,440
yeah sleep is
 

3159
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,710
yeah sleep is
profoundly

3160
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
profoundly
 

3161
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,630
profoundly
and very intimately related to your

3162
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:42,640
and very intimately related to your
 

3163
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,950
and very intimately related to your
memory systems and your informational

3164
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
memory systems and your informational
 

3165
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,470
memory systems and your informational
systems

3166
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:46,480
systems
 

3167
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,710
systems
the first as you just mentioned is that

3168
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
the first as you just mentioned is that
 

3169
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,430
the first as you just mentioned is that
sleep before learning will essentially

3170
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:51,440
sleep before learning will essentially
 

3171
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,349
sleep before learning will essentially
prepare your brain

3172
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:53,359
prepare your brain
 

3173
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,990
prepare your brain
almost like a dry sponge ready to sort

3174
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,000
almost like a dry sponge ready to sort
 

3175
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,870
almost like a dry sponge ready to sort
of

3176
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:56,880
of
 

3177
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,190
of
initially soak up new information in

3178
00:57:59,190 --> 00:57:59,200
initially soak up new information in
 

3179
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,710
initially soak up new information in
other words you need sleep before

3180
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
other words you need sleep before
 

3181
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,430
other words you need sleep before
learning to effectively imprint

3182
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:03,440
learning to effectively imprint
 

3183
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,670
learning to effectively imprint
information into the brain to lay down

3184
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:05,680
information into the brain to lay down
 

3185
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,430
information into the brain to lay down
fresh memory traces and without sleep

3186
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:09,440
fresh memory traces and without sleep
 

3187
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,270
fresh memory traces and without sleep
the memory circuits of the brain and we

3188
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:11,280
the memory circuits of the brain and we
 

3189
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,829
the memory circuits of the brain and we
know we've studied these memory circuits

3190
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:13,839
know we've studied these memory circuits
 

3191
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:14,950
know we've studied these memory circuits
it will

3192
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
it will
 

3193
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,950
it will
you know essentially become waterlogged

3194
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:16,960
you know essentially become waterlogged
 

3195
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,549
you know essentially become waterlogged
as it were for the sponge analogy and

3196
00:58:18,549 --> 00:58:18,559
as it were for the sponge analogy and
 

3197
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,309
as it were for the sponge analogy and
you can't absorb

3198
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
you can't absorb
 

3199
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,910
you can't absorb
the information as effectively

3200
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:23,920
the information as effectively
 

3201
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,390
the information as effectively
so you need sleep before learning but

3202
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,400
so you need sleep before learning but
 

3203
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,549
so you need sleep before learning but
you also need sleep unfortunately after

3204
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
you also need sleep unfortunately after
 

3205
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,069
you also need sleep unfortunately after
learning too

3206
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
learning too
 

3207
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,470
learning too
to then take those freshly minted

3208
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:32,480
to then take those freshly minted
 

3209
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,190
to then take those freshly minted
memories and effectively hit the save

3210
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
memories and effectively hit the save
 

3211
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,030
memories and effectively hit the save
button on them but it's nowhere near as

3212
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:37,040
button on them but it's nowhere near as
 

3213
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,750
button on them but it's nowhere near as
quick as a digital system it takes hours

3214
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:39,760
quick as a digital system it takes hours
 

3215
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,670
quick as a digital system it takes hours
because it's a physical biological

3216
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
because it's a physical biological
 

3217
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,750
because it's a physical biological
change that happens at the level of

3218
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:43,760
change that happens at the level of
 

3219
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,789
change that happens at the level of
brain cells but sleep after learning

3220
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
brain cells but sleep after learning
 

3221
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:51,030
brain cells but sleep after learning
will cement and solidify that new memory

3222
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,040
will cement and solidify that new memory
 

3223
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,710
will cement and solidify that new memory
into the neural architecture of the

3224
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:52,720
into the neural architecture of the
 

3225
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,270
into the neural architecture of the
brain therefore making it less likely to

3226
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:55,280
brain therefore making it less likely to
 

3227
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,950
brain therefore making it less likely to
be forgotten

3228
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:56,960
be forgotten
 

3229
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,990
be forgotten
so

3230
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
so
 

3231
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,829
so
you know i often think of sleep in that

3232
00:58:59,829 --> 00:58:59,839
you know i often think of sleep in that
 

3233
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:01,190
you know i often think of sleep in that
way as

3234
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:01,200
way as
 

3235
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,589
way as
it's almost sort of future proofing

3236
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:03,599
it's almost sort of future proofing
 

3237
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,510
it's almost sort of future proofing
information

3238
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:05,520
information
 

3239
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,789
information
in in what way well it means that it

3240
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
in in what way well it means that it
 

3241
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:13,030
in in what way well it means that it
gives it a higher degree of assurance

3242
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:13,040
gives it a higher degree of assurance
 

3243
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,430
gives it a higher degree of assurance
to be remembered in the future rather

3244
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:15,440
to be remembered in the future rather
 

3245
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,950
to be remembered in the future rather
than go through

3246
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:16,960
than go through
 

3247
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,069
than go through
the sort of degradation that we think of

3248
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:20,079
the sort of degradation that we think of
 

3249
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,150
the sort of degradation that we think of
as forgetting

3250
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:22,160
as forgetting
 

3251
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,950
as forgetting
so

3252
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
so
 

3253
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,549
so
the brain has

3254
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
the brain has
 

3255
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,109
the brain has
in some ways by default you know

3256
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
in some ways by default you know
 

3257
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,710
in some ways by default you know
there is forget and actually i would

3258
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:28,720
there is forget and actually i would
 

3259
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,670
there is forget and actually i would
love to

3260
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:29,680
love to
 

3261
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,430
love to
i was going to say sleep is relevant for

3262
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
i was going to say sleep is relevant for
 

3263
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,349
i was going to say sleep is relevant for
memory in three different ways but i'm

3264
00:59:33,349 --> 00:59:33,359
memory in three different ways but i'm
 

3265
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,430
memory in three different ways but i'm
going to amend that and say this four

3266
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,440
going to amend that and say this four
 

3267
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,789
going to amend that and say this four
different ways

3268
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799
different ways
 

3269
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,150
different ways
which is learning

3270
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,160

 

3271
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,870

association and then forgetting which

3276
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400
association and then forgetting which
 

3277
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,710
association and then forgetting which
the last one sounds oxymoronic based on

3278
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
the last one sounds oxymoronic based on
 

3279
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,390
the last one sounds oxymoronic based on
the form of three but i'll see if i can

3280
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:52,400
the form of three but i'll see if i can
 

3281
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,430
the form of three but i'll see if i can
explain

3282
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:53,440
explain
 

3283
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,670
explain
so sleep after learning then sort of you

3284
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:55,680
so sleep after learning then sort of you
 

3285
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,510
so sleep after learning then sort of you
know

the third benefit however is that sleep

3292
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:07,440
the third benefit however is that sleep

01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,589
the third benefit however is that sleep
we've learned more recently is much more

3294
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:09,599
we've learned more recently is much more

sleep doesn't simply just take

sleep doesn't simply just take
individual memories

3302
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:15,920
individual memories
 

3303
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,589
individual memories
and strengthen them

3304
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:17,599
and strengthen them
 

3305
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,190
and strengthen them
sleep will then

3306
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
sleep will then
 

3307
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,829
sleep will then
intelligently integrate and cross link

3308
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:21,839
intelligently integrate and cross link
 

3309
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:25,750
intelligently integrate and cross link
and associate that information together

3310
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,760
and associate that information together
 

3311
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,589
and associate that information together
and it's almost like informational

3312
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
and it's almost like informational

this creative associative benefit of
sleep transcends cultural boundaries it

3342
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:56,799
sleep transcends cultural boundaries it
 

3343
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:02,150
sleep transcends cultural boundaries it
is a common experience across humanity

3344
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,160

 

3345
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,750

now i should note that i think the

3346
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:03,760
now i should note that i think the
 

3347
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,990
now i should note that i think the
french translation of that is much

3348
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,000
french translation of that is much
 

3349
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,069
french translation of that is much
closer to you um i think you sleep with

3350
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:08,079
closer to you um i think you sleep with
 

3351
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,549
closer to you um i think you sleep with
a problem whereas the british you sleep

3352
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
a problem whereas the british you sleep
 

3353
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,549
a problem whereas the british you sleep
on a problem the french you sleep with a

3354
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:12,559
on a problem the french you sleep with a
 

3355
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:13,829
on a problem the french you sleep with a
problem i think it says so much about

3356
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:13,839
problem i think it says so much about
 

3357
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,829
problem i think it says so much about
the romantic difference between the

3358
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:15,839
the romantic difference between the
 

3359
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,829
the romantic difference between the
british and the french but let's let's

3360
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:17,839
british and the french but let's let's
 

3361
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,950
british and the french but let's let's
not go there um that's brilliant so such

3362
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:20,960
not go there um that's brilliant so such
 

3363
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,870
not go there um that's brilliant so such
a subtle but such a fundamental

3364
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:22,880
a subtle but such a fundamental
 

3365
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,710
a subtle but such a fundamental
difference yeah

3366
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:24,720
difference yeah
 

3367
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,190
difference yeah
yeah goodness me sleep with the problem

3368
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:27,200
yeah goodness me sleep with the problem
 

3369
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,670
yeah goodness me sleep with the problem
yes exactly right

3370
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:29,680
yes exactly right
 

3371
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,349
yes exactly right
um

3372
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:31,359
um
 

3373
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,230
um
so

3374
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,240
so
 

3375
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,990
so
and we can sort of double click on any

3376
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
and we can sort of double click on any
 

3377
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,349
and we can sort of double click on any
one of these and go in into detail but

3378
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:37,359
one of these and go in into detail but
 

3379
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:42,150
one of these and go in into detail but
the fourth i became really enchanted by

3380
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:42,160
the fourth i became really enchanted by
 

3381
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,190
the fourth i became really enchanted by
about

3382
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
about
 

3383
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,950
about
eight years ago in our research which

3384
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:44,960
eight years ago in our research which
 

3385
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,230
eight years ago in our research which
was this idea of forgetting

3386
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
was this idea of forgetting
 

3387
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,549
was this idea of forgetting
and i started to

3388
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:50,559
and i started to
 

3389
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,789
and i started to
think that forgetting may be the price

3390
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:52,799
think that forgetting may be the price
 

3391
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:56,309
think that forgetting may be the price
that we pay for remembering

3392
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
that we pay for remembering
 

3393
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,789
that we pay for remembering
and in that sense

3394
01:01:58,789 --> 01:01:58,799
and in that sense
 

3395
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,990
and in that sense
there is an enormous

3396
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:02,000
there is an enormous
 

3397
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,190
there is an enormous
benefit

3398
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:03,200
benefit
 

3399
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,829
benefit
to letting

3400
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:04,839
to letting
 

3401
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,430
to letting
go you may be thinking that sounds

3402
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:07,440
go you may be thinking that sounds
 

3403
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,829
go you may be thinking that sounds
ridiculous i don't want to forget in

3404
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:09,839
ridiculous i don't want to forget in
 

3405
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,349
ridiculous i don't want to forget in
fact my biggest problem is i keep

3406
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:11,359

if that's the case we can't simply go

that's true i think forgetting is an

01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,950
that's true i think forgetting is an

01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
example
 

3445
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,870
example
you know

3446
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:52,880
you know
 

3447
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,950
you know
it's not beneficial from an evolutionary

3448
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:54,960
it's not beneficial from an evolutionary
 

3449
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,349
it's not beneficial from an evolutionary
perspective for me to remember where i

3450
01:02:57,349 --> 01:02:57,359
perspective for me to remember where i
 

3451
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:00,710
perspective for me to remember where i
parked my car three years ago

3452
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
parked my car three years ago
 

3453
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,870
parked my car three years ago
so it's important that i can remember

3454
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880
so it's important that i can remember
 

3455
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,589
so it's important that i can remember
today's parking spot but i don't want to

3456
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:05,599
today's parking spot but i don't want to
 

3457
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:06,950
today's parking spot but i don't want to
have the junk

3458
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:06,960
have the junk
 

3459
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,069
have the junk
kind of dna from a memory perspective of

you know where my i parked my car you

3462
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:12,640
you know where my i parked my car you
 

3463
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,870
you know where my i parked my car you
know two years ago um

3464
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:14,880
know two years ago um
 

3465
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,710
know two years ago um
now i actually have a in some ways a

3466
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:16,720
now i actually have a in some ways a
 

3467
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,950
now i actually have a in some ways a
problem with forgetting i'm and again

3468
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
problem with forgetting i'm and again
 

3469
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,470

i'm not trying to sort of be laudatory

3470
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
i'm not trying to sort of be laudatory
 

3471
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,270
i'm not trying to sort of be laudatory
but

3472
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:21,280
but
 

3473
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,069
but
you know i i tend not to forget too many

3474
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:24,079
you know i i tend not to forget too many
 

3475
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,990
you know i i tend not to forget too many
things and i don't think that that's a

3476
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:26,000
things and i don't think that that's a
 

3477
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,029
things and i don't think that that's a
good thing

3478
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:27,039
good thing
 

3479
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,990
good thing
and um the there's a wonderful

3480
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
and um the there's a wonderful
 

3481
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,470
and um the there's a wonderful
neurologist laurea who wrote a book

3482
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:32,480
neurologist laurea who wrote a book
 

3483
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,349
neurologist laurea who wrote a book
called the mind of the mnemonicist and

3484
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:35,359
called the mind of the mnemonicist and
 

3485
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,910
called the mind of the mnemonicist and
it was a brilliant book

3486
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
it was a brilliant book
 

3487
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,549
it was a brilliant book
both because it was written exquisitely

3488
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
both because it was written exquisitely
 

3489
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,309
both because it was written exquisitely
but he was studying

3490
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
but he was studying
 

3491
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,789
but he was studying
these sort of memory savants

3492
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:44,799
these sort of memory savants
 

3493
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,750
these sort of memory savants
who basically could remember everything

who basically could remember everything

who basically could remember everything
that he gave them

01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:49,359
that he gave them
 

3497
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,510
that he gave them
and he tried to find

3498
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,520
and he tried to find
 

3499
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,510
and he tried to find
a [\h__\h] in their armor

a [\h__\h] in their armor
 

3501
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,710
a [\h__\h] in their armor
and the first half of the book is

01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:54,720
and the first half of the book is
 

3503
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,029
and the first half of the book is
essentially about him

3504
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
essentially about him
 

3505
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,990
essentially about him
seeing how far he can push them before

3506
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,000
seeing how far he can push them before
 

3507

they fail

3508

they fail
 

3509
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,750
they fail
and he never found that place

3510
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:03,760
and he never found that place
 

3511
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,470
and he never found that place
he could never find a place where they

he could never find a place where they
 

3513
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,910
he could never find a place where they
stopped

stopped
 

3515
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,789
stopped
remembering and then in his brilliance

01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:10,799
remembering and then in his brilliance
 

3517
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,190
remembering and then in his brilliance
he turned the question on its head he

3518
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200
he turned the question on its head he
 

3519
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,589
he turned the question on its head he
said not what is the benefit of

3520
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:15,599
said not what is the benefit of
 

3521
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,589
said not what is the benefit of

constantly remembering
 

3523
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,150
constantly remembering
but instead what is the detriment

01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
but instead what is the detriment
 

3525
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,069

3569
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,549
at which kind of stuff you remember
and that's where the step of a

3570
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:06,559
and that's where the step of a
 

3571
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,230
and that's where the step of a
simulation integration that you're

3572
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:08,240
simulation integration that you're
 

3573
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,069
simulation integration that you're
referring to is really important i mean

3574
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:10,079
referring to is really important i mean
 

3575
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,190
referring to is really important i mean
we forget most of the things and and the

not being able to naturally remember
 

3633
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,069
not being able to naturally remember
those things and so that that's

those things and so that that's
 

3635
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,990
those things and so that that's
something i need to sort of work on but

01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:18,000
something i need to sort of work on but
 

3637
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,069
something i need to sort of work on but
that's an exact with faces

3638

01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:24,720
names so i am exactly like
 

3643
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,230

you and there is you know an

3644
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,240
you and there is you know an
 

3645
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,789
you and there is you know an
understanding of that in the brain too

3646
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:28,799
understanding of that in the brain too
 

3647
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,950
understanding of that in the brain too
we understand that there is partitioning

3648
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
we understand that there is partitioning
 

3649
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,789
we understand that there is partitioning
of those in terms of the territory of

3650
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:32,799
of those in terms of the territory of
 

3651
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,950
of those in terms of the territory of
the brain that takes care of faces and

3652
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:34,960
the brain that takes care of faces and
 

3653
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,109
the brain that takes care of faces and
facts and places and they can be

3654
01:06:37,109 --> 01:06:37,119
facts and places and they can be
 

3655
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,829
facts and places and they can be
separate so i will never forget

3656
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:39,839
separate so i will never forget
 

3657
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,150
separate so i will never forget
a face but you know and as i said i

3658
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:42,160
a face but you know and as i said i
 

3659

it's not as though there's anything
 

3683
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,069
it's not as though there's anything
wrong with my memory it's just

01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:08,079
wrong with my memory it's just
 

3685
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,589
wrong with my memory it's just
the emotional state i'm in when i'm

detailed labels of of those experiences
and i need to certainly work on that i i

01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,789
what i was wearing that day yeah it's
fascinating yeah i'm the exact the same

3808
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:20,799
fascinating yeah i'm the exact the same
 

3809
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,390
fascinating yeah i'm the exact the same
way but you can't

3810
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
way but you can't
 

3811
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,749
way but you can't
until we have neurolink or something

3812
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
until we have neurolink or something
 

3813
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,430
until we have neurolink or something
like that we can't communicate that you

3814
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
like that we can't communicate that you
 

3815
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,870
like that we can't communicate that you
remember all those things i know that's

3816
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:26,880
remember all those things i know that's
 

3817
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,870
remember all those things i know that's
what i wanted so you have to be able to

3818
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:28,880
what i wanted so you have to be able to
 

3819
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,789
what i wanted so you have to be able to
use uh tricks of human communication for

3820
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:30,799
use uh tricks of human communication for
 

3821
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,070
use uh tricks of human communication for
that but so that i mean that's the it

3822
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:34,080
that but so that i mean that's the it
 

3823
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,990
that but so that i mean that's the it
ultimately is a trick of like which to

3824
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000
ultimately is a trick of like which to
 

3825
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,149
ultimately is a trick of like which to
remember which to forget right and the

3826
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:38,159
remember which to forget right and the
 

3827
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:40,550
remember which to forget right and the
forgetting is so it's so fascinating to

3828
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
forgetting is so it's so fascinating to
 

3829
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,030
forgetting is so it's so fascinating to
say this i mean it seems to be

3830
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,040
say this i mean it seems to be
 

3831
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,590
say this i mean it seems to be
deeply connected to that assimilation

3832
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:45,600
deeply connected to that assimilation
 

3833
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,430
deeply connected to that assimilation
process so forgetting you try to fit

3834
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:49,440
process so forgetting you try to fit
 

3835
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,749
process so forgetting you try to fit
all the new stuff into

3836
01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:51,759
all the new stuff into
 

3837
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:54,870
all the new stuff into
this big web of the old stuff

3838
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:54,880
this big web of the old stuff
 

3839
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,189
this big web of the old stuff
and the things that don't fit you throw

3840
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:57,199
and the things that don't fit you throw
 

3841
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,070
and the things that don't fit you throw
out

3842
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
out
 

3843
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,229
out
i think the assimilation the way i've

3844
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:00,239
i think the assimilation the way i've
 

3845
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,070
i think the assimilation the way i've
been thinking about it with sleep and

3846
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:02,080
been thinking about it with sleep and
 

3847
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,590
been thinking about it with sleep and
it's particularly sort of dream sleep

3848
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
it's particularly sort of dream sleep
 

3849
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,189
it's particularly sort of dream sleep
that we think can help with this

3850
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
that we think can help with this
 

3851
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,270
that we think can help with this
assimilation

3852
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:07,280
assimilation
 

3853
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,229
assimilation
is that

3854
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:08,239
is that
 

3855
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:11,830
is that
during wake we have one version of

3856
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:11,840
during wake we have one version of
 

3857
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,070
during wake we have one version of
associative processing what i mean by

3858
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:14,080
associative processing what i mean by
 

3859
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,669
associative processing what i mean by
that is we see the most obvious

3860
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:15,679
that is we see the most obvious
 

3861
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,030
that is we see the most obvious
connections

3862
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:17,040
connections
 

3863
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,910
connections
so i think of wakefulness

3864
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:19,920
so i think of wakefulness
 

3865
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,630
so i think of wakefulness
as a google search gone right

3866
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
as a google search gone right
 

3867
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,110
as a google search gone right
whereas i see dream sleep as doing

3868
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
whereas i see dream sleep as doing
 

3869
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,990
whereas i see dream sleep as doing
something very different i think dream

3870
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
something very different i think dream
 

3871
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,229
something very different i think dream
sleep is a little bit like group therapy

3872
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:32,239
sleep is a little bit like group therapy
 

3873
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,510
sleep is a little bit like group therapy
for memories

3874
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:33,520
for memories
 

3875
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,070
for memories
that everyone gets a name badge and

3876
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,080
that everyone gets a name badge and
 

3877
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,630
that everyone gets a name badge and
sleep gathers in all of the individual

3878
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,640
sleep gathers in all of the individual
 

3879
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,510
sleep gathers in all of the individual
pieces of the day and it sort of starts

3880
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:41,520
pieces of the day and it sort of starts
 

3881
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,830

i've got no obvious connection with them

3894
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:53,600
i've got no obvious connection with them
 

3895
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,750
i've got no obvious connection with them
at all but once you get chatting with

you learn that you do have a very

01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:58,159
you learn that you do have a very
 

3901
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,149
you learn that you do have a very
distant non-obvious connection but it's

3902
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:00,159
distant non-obvious connection but it's
 

3903
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:02,550
distant non-obvious connection but it's
still a connection not the same

3904
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:02,560
still a connection not the same
 

3905
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,310
still a connection not the same
and it's almost as though you're doing a

and it's almost as though you're doing a

hockey game in utah yeah exactly it

3918
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:17,520
hockey game in utah yeah exactly it
 

3919
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,430
hockey game in utah yeah exactly it
turns out that there actually is a link

3920
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
turns out that there actually is a link
 

3921
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,870
turns out that there actually is a link
if i look at it it's a distant

3922
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:20,880
if i look at it it's a distant
 

3923
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,229
if i look at it it's a distant
non-obvious one

3924
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
non-obvious one
 

3925
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,310
non-obvious one
and to me i find that exciting because

3926
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:24,320
and to me i find that exciting because
 

3927
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,990
and to me i find that exciting because
when you fuse things together that

3928
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000
when you fuse things together that
 

3929
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,910
when you fuse things together that
shouldn't normally go together but when

3930
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
shouldn't normally go together but when
 

3931
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,070
shouldn't normally go together but when
they do they cause marked advances in

they do they cause marked advances in

they do they cause marked advances in
evolutionary fitness it sounds like the

3934
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
evolutionary fitness it sounds like the

3936
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
biological basis of creativity
 

3937
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,030
biological basis of creativity
and that's exactly what i think dream

3938
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
and that's exactly what i think dream
 

3939
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,870
and that's exactly what i think dream
sleep and the algorithm of dream sleep

3940
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:38,880
sleep and the algorithm of dream sleep
 

3941
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,030
sleep and the algorithm of dream sleep
is designed to do you know it's not a

boolean like system where you have

3944
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:44,320
boolean like system where you have
 

3945
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,590
boolean like system where you have
you know the sort of assumptions of true

3946
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:47,600
you know the sort of assumptions of true
 

3947
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,229
you know the sort of assumptions of true
and false you know maybe it's more fuzzy

3948
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:50,239
and false you know maybe it's more fuzzy
 

3949
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,910
and false you know maybe it's more fuzzy
logic system and i think rem sleep is a

3950
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:53,920
logic system and i think rem sleep is a
 

3951
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,470
logic system and i think rem sleep is a
perfect environment within which we do

3952
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
perfect environment within which we do
 

3953
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,709
perfect environment within which we do
you know it's almost like memory pinball

3954
01:11:58,709 --> 01:11:58,719
you know it's almost like memory pinball
 

3955
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,229
you know it's almost like memory pinball
you know you get the information that

3956
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:00,239
you know you get the information that
 

3957
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,149
you know you get the information that
you've learned during the day and then

3958
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:02,159
you've learned during the day and then
 

3959
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,229
you've learned during the day and then
you pull the lever back and you shoot it

3960
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:04,239
you pull the lever back and you shoot it
 

3961
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:06,870
you pull the lever back and you shoot it
up into the attic of your brain

3962
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:06,880
up into the attic of your brain
 

3963
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,950
up into the attic of your brain
you know this cortex filled with all of

3964
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:08,960
you know this cortex filled with all of
 

3965
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,430
you know this cortex filled with all of
your past historical knowledge and you

3966
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:11,440
your past historical knowledge and you
 

3967
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,189
your past historical knowledge and you
start to bounce it around and see where

3968
01:12:13,189 --> 01:12:13,199
start to bounce it around and see where
 

3969
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,630
start to bounce it around and see where
one of those things lights up and you

3970
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:14,640
one of those things lights up and you
 

3971
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,830
one of those things lights up and you
build a new connection there and you

3972
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:15,840
build a new connection there and you
 

3973
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,590
build a new connection there and you
build another one there too you're

3974
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:17,600
build another one there too you're
 

3975
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,590
build another one there too you're
developing schemas

3976
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:19,600
developing schemas
 

3977
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,510
developing schemas
and so in that way i think you could

3978
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:21,520
and so in that way i think you could
 

3979
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,030
and so in that way i think you could
argue

3980
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,040
argue
 

3981
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,950
argue
you know we dream therefore we are

3982
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:26,960
you know we dream therefore we are
 

3983
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,189
you know we dream therefore we are
yeah so in terms of

3984
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
yeah so in terms of
 

3985
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,830
yeah so in terms of
this line between learning and thinking

3986
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:31,840
this line between learning and thinking
 

3987
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,910
this line between learning and thinking
through a new thing

3988
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:33,920
through a new thing
 

3989
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,470
through a new thing
that seems to be deeply connected

3990
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,480
that seems to be deeply connected
 

3991
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,790
that seems to be deeply connected
there's this

3992
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
there's this
 

3993
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,030
there's this
legendary engineer named jim keller who

3994
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
legendary engineer named jim keller who
 

3995
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,270
legendary engineer named jim keller who
keeps yelling at me about this he says

3996
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
keeps yelling at me about this he says
 

3997
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,790
keeps yelling at me about this he says
it's very effective

3998
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:44,800
it's very effective
 

3999
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,310
it's very effective
he likes to

01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
he likes to
 

4001
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,149
he likes to
for difficult problems

4002
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
for difficult problems
 

4003
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,390
for difficult problems
before bed think about that difficult

4004
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
before bed think about that difficult
 

4005
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,750
before bed think about that difficult
problem we're not talking about like

4006
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
problem we're not talking about like
 

4007
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,830
problem we're not talking about like
drama at work or all that kind of stuff

01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:53,840
drama at work or all that kind of stuff
 

4009
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,630
drama at work or all that kind of stuff
no like a scientific for him engineering

and to prime his mind yes before sleep

4018
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,159
and to prime his mind yes before sleep
 

4019
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,030
and to prime his mind yes before sleep
and then go to sleep and then uh he

4020
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,040
and then go to sleep and then uh he
 

4021
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,470
and then go to sleep and then uh he
finds that uh

4022
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,480
finds that uh
 

4023
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,030
finds that uh
the next day he's he's able to think

4024
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:11,040
the next day he's he's able to think
 

4025
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,950
the next day he's he's able to think
much clearer and there's new ideas that

4026
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:12,960
much clearer and there's new ideas that
 

4027
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,510
much clearer and there's new ideas that
come but also just i guess it's more

4028
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,520
come but also just i guess it's more
 

4029
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,830
come but also just i guess it's more
well integrated

4030
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:17,840
well integrated
 

4031
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,030
well integrated
and sometimes during the process of

4032
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,040
and sometimes during the process of
 

4033
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,669
and sometimes during the process of
like he's able to like wake up

4034
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:23,679
like he's able to like wake up
 

4035
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:24,870
like he's able to like wake up
and

like
 

4039
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,830
like
see new insights that's right if he's

01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
see new insights that's right if he's
 

4041
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,350
see new insights that's right if he's
deeply sort of aggressively thinking

4042
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,360
deeply sort of aggressively thinking
 

4043
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,950

it was non-trivial at the time and he
 

4069
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,110
it was non-trivial at the time and he
would try and try he was so obsessed

4070

with it he created playing cards with

4072
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:04,000
with it he created playing cards with
 

4073
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,550
with it he created playing cards with
all of the different elements on and

4074

all of the different elements on and
 

4075
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,709
all of the different elements on and
then he would go on these long train

4076
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:08,719
then he would go on these long train
 

4077
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,350
then he would go on these long train
journeys around europe and he would just

4078
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:11,360
journeys around europe and he would just
 

4079
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,030
journeys around europe and he would just
sort of deal these cards in front of

4080
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
sort of deal these cards in front of
 

4081
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,110
sort of deal these cards in front of
them and he would shuffle them

4082
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:15,120
them and he would shuffle them
 

4083
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,470
them and he would shuffle them
shuffling and shuffling and he would

4084

shuffling and shuffling and he would
 

4085
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,950
shuffling and shuffling and he would
just try to see if he could find what

4086
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,960
just try to see if he could find what
 

4087
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,430
just try to see if he could find what
the answer was and then so the story

4088
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
the answer was and then so the story
 

4089
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,149
the answer was and then so the story
goes you know he fell asleep and he had

play around and they snapped into a
 

4097
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,310
play around and they snapped into a

01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,430
and a tape recorder
um and then probably who would have a

4204
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
um and then probably who would have a
 

4205
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,229
um and then probably who would have a
whole

4206

set of other things in the bed with him

4208
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:43,760
set of other things in the bed with him
 

4209
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,990
set of other things in the bed with him
and who knows how many other people but

4210
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:46,000
and who knows how many other people but
 

4211
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,630
and who knows how many other people but
anyway uh and then he said in his

4212
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:48,640
anyway uh and then he said in his
 

4213
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,030
anyway uh and then he said in his
autobiography and i'm paraphrasing here

4214
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
autobiography and i'm paraphrasing here
 

4215
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:51,750
autobiography and i'm paraphrasing here
but

4216
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:51,760
but
 

4217
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,030
but
one morning i woke up and i realized

4218
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:55,040
one morning i woke up and i realized
 

4219
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,590
one morning i woke up and i realized
that the tape had recorded all the way

4220
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,600
that the tape had recorded all the way
 

4221
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,110
that the tape had recorded all the way
to the end so i rewound the tape

4222
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:01,120
to the end so i rewound the tape
 

4223
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,470
to the end so i rewound the tape
and i hit play and there in some kind of

4224
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
and i hit play and there in some kind of
 

4225
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,669
and i hit play and there in some kind of
ghostly form were the opening chords to

like using sleep
 

4329
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,070
like using sleep
you know that's just basically the

you know that's just basically the
 

4331
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,630
you know that's just basically the

01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,189
deliberate way rather than an
unthoughtful way i still think that you

4348
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:15,199
unthoughtful way i still think that you
 

4349
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,709
unthoughtful way i still think that you
know mother nature

4350
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:16,719
know mother nature
 

4351
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,350
know mother nature
through it you know 3.6 million years of

we can't try to tweak it and nudge it

4366
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:35,440
we can't try to tweak it and nudge it
 

4367
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,950
we can't try to tweak it and nudge it
you know it's a very light hand on the

you know it's a very light hand on the
 

4369

think there's anything wrong with that

4372
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:41,440
think there's anything wrong with that
 

4373
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,430
think there's anything wrong with that
you know just like for example for me

4374
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,440
you know just like for example for me
 

4375
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,709
you know just like for example for me
fasting has improved my ability to focus

4376

and in that same way
 

4381
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,550
and in that same way
you know it's possible that playing with

4382
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:54,560
you know it's possible that playing with
 

4383
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,790
you know it's possible that playing with
these ideas of thinking before bed or

these ideas of thinking before bed or
 

4385
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,950
these ideas of thinking before bed or
some hours before better some

playing with different protocols will

4388
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:00,320
playing with different protocols will

01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,709
playing with different protocols will
have a significant leap over what mother

nature naturally does so if you let your

01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
nature naturally does so if you let your
 

4393
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,870
nature naturally does so if you let your
body do what it naturally does you may

4394
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:06,880
body do what it naturally does you may
 

4395
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,310
body do what it naturally does you may
not achieve the same level of

4396
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:08,320
not achieve the same level of
 

4397
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,830
not achieve the same level of
performance because mother nature

4398
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:11,840
performance because mother nature
 

4399
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,750
performance because mother nature
has not designed us to think deeply

4400
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:13,760
has not designed us to think deeply
 

4401
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,390
has not designed us to think deeply
about uh chip design

about uh chip design
 

4403
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,950
about uh chip design
for uh programming artificial

intelligence systems so well she's
 

4407
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,350
intelligence systems so well she's
gifted us the architecture and the

4408
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360
gifted us the architecture and the
 

4409
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,510
gifted us the architecture and the
capacity to do that

capacity to do that
 

4411
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,430
capacity to do that
what we do with that is

4412
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
what we do with that is
 

4413
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,310
what we do with that is
you know is what life's experience

4414
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
you know is what life's experience

01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,430
you know is what life's experience
dictates

01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,000
she gives us the blueprint to do many
 

4419
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,470
she gives us the blueprint to do many
you know well if i were to sort of

4420
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:36,480
you know well if i were to sort of
 

4421

introspect and self analyze what mother

4422
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:38,719
introspect and self analyze what mother
 

4423
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,189
introspect and self analyze what mother
nature wants me to do i think given my

4424
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
nature wants me to do i think given my
 

4425
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,669
nature wants me to do i think given my
current lifestyle that i have food in

4426
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679
current lifestyle that i have food in
 

4427
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,189
current lifestyle that i have food in
the fridge

4428
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:45,199
the fridge
 

4429
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,510
the fridge
and a bed to sleep on i think what

4430
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:47,520
and a bed to sleep on i think what
 

4431
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,430
and a bed to sleep on i think what
mother nature wants me to do is to be

4432
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:49,440
mother nature wants me to do is to be
 

4433
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,189
mother nature wants me to do is to be
lazy

4434
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
lazy
 

4435
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,590
lazy
and so i think i'm actually resisting

4436
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,600
and so i think i'm actually resisting
 

4437
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,750
and so i think i'm actually resisting
mother nature uh

4438
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:55,760
mother nature uh
 

4439
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,950
mother nature uh
in

4440
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,960
in
 

4441
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,390
in
because so many of my knees are

4442
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:58,400
because so many of my knees are
 

4443
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,830
because so many of my knees are
satisfied and so i i'm

4444
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:01,840
satisfied and so i i'm
 

4445
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,750
satisfied and so i i'm
i have to resist some of the natural

4446
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:03,760
i have to resist some of the natural
 

4447
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,070
i have to resist some of the natural
forces of the body and the mind when i

4448
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,080
forces of the body and the mind when i
 

4449
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,310
forces of the body and the mind when i
do some of the things i do so there's

4450
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:08,320
do some of the things i do so there's
 

4451
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,669
do some of the things i do so there's
that dance

4452
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:09,679
that dance
 

4453
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,430
that dance
um you know like i've been thinking

4454
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:11,440
um you know like i've been thinking
 

4455
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,510
um you know like i've been thinking
about doing a startup and that's

4456
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
about doing a startup and that's
 

4457
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,270
about doing a startup and that's
obviously going against everything that

4458
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
obviously going against everything that
 

4459
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,870
obviously going against everything that
my body and mind

4460
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:16,880
my body and mind
 

4461
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,030
my body and mind
are telling me to do because it's going

4462
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:19,040
are telling me to do because it's going
 

4463
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,110
are telling me to do because it's going
to be basically suffering

4464
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,120
to be basically suffering
 

4465
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,110
to be basically suffering
but the only reason i want as you know

4466
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:23,120
but the only reason i want as you know
 

4467
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,229
but the only reason i want as you know
it will be over

4468
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:26,239
it will be over
 

4469
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,750
it will be over
yes

4470
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:27,760
yes
 

4471
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,229
yes
i but nevertheless there's some kind of

4472
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:30,239
i but nevertheless there's some kind of
 

4473
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:31,910
i but nevertheless there's some kind of
inner drive that wants me to do it and

4474
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:31,920
inner drive that wants me to do it and
 

4475
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,750
inner drive that wants me to do it and
then you start to ask a question well

4476
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:33,760
then you start to ask a question well
 

4477
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,830
then you start to ask a question well
how do you optimize the things you can't

4478
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
how do you optimize the things you can't
 

4479
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,310
how do you optimize the things you can't
optimize like sleep like diet like the

4480
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320
optimize like sleep like diet like the
 

4481
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,149
optimize like sleep like diet like the
people that you surround yourself with

4482
01:21:40,149 --> 01:21:40,159
people that you surround yourself with
 

4483
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:41,590
people that you surround yourself with
in order to

4484
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:41,600
in order to
 

4485
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,510
in order to
maximize happiness and performance and

4486
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:43,520
maximize happiness and performance and
 

4487
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,510
maximize happiness and performance and
all those kinds of things without also

4488
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:45,520
all those kinds of things without also
 

4489
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,310
all those kinds of things without also
over optimizing and that's such an

4490
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:48,320
over optimizing and that's such an
 

4491
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,790
over optimizing and that's such an
interesting idea from

4492
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:50,800
interesting idea from
 

4493
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,910
interesting idea from
from a

4494
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:51,920
from a
 

4495
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,310
from a
engineer so

4496
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:54,320
engineer so
 

4497
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,950
engineer so
as you may know you don't often

4498
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:56,960
as you may know you don't often
 

4499
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,629
as you may know you don't often
get that those kinds of ideas from

4500
01:21:58,629 --> 01:21:58,639
get that those kinds of ideas from
 

4501
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,350
get that those kinds of ideas from
engineers engineers usually just

4502
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:01,360
engineers engineers usually just
 

4503
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,910
engineers engineers usually just
don't read books about sleeping

4504
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:03,920
don't read books about sleeping
 

4505
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,990
don't read books about sleeping
they're usually like the the

4506
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
they're usually like the the
 

4507
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,870
they're usually like the the
they're not they they're not the

4508
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:08,880
they're not they they're not the
 

4509
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,470
they're not they they're not the
healthiest of people

4510
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:10,480
healthiest of people
 

4511
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,270
healthiest of people
um

4512
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280
um
 

4513
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,870
um
i think that's changing over time

4514
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:12,880
i think that's changing over time
 

4515
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,390
i think that's changing over time
especially silicon valley especially the

4516
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:14,400
especially silicon valley especially the
 

4517
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,070
especially silicon valley especially the
tech sector people are starting to

4518
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
tech sector people are starting to
 

4519
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,070
tech sector people are starting to
understand what's a healthy lifestyle

4520
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,080
understand what's a healthy lifestyle
 

4521
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,149
understand what's a healthy lifestyle
but usually they're kind of on the

4522
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:20,159
but usually they're kind of on the
 

4523
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,629
but usually they're kind of on the
insane side especially programmers but

4524
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:22,639
insane side especially programmers but
 

4525
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,310
insane side especially programmers but
it's nice to hear uh somebody like that

4526
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:26,320
it's nice to hear uh somebody like that
 

4527
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,390
it's nice to hear uh somebody like that
use sleep and use some of the things you

4528
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:28,400
use sleep and use some of the things you
 

4529
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,510
use sleep and use some of the things you
talk about strategically yeah

4530
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:31,520
talk about strategically yeah
 

4531
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,790
talk about strategically yeah
on purpose

4532
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:32,800
on purpose
 

4533
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,950
on purpose
you know to that idea of

4534
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:34,960
you know to that idea of
 

4535
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,070
you know to that idea of
not just

4536
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:36,080
not just
 

4537
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,030
not just
trying to use what mother nature gave

4538
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:39,040
trying to use what mother nature gave
 

4539
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,310
trying to use what mother nature gave
but

4540
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:40,320
but
 

4541
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,110
but
seeing if you can do something more or

4542
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:43,120
seeing if you can do something more or
 

4543
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,750
seeing if you can do something more or
different

4544
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:45,760

 

4545
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,030

in a conservative mindset

4546
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,040
in a conservative mindset
 

4547
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,110
in a conservative mindset
i would then pose the question at what

4548
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:51,120
i would then pose the question at what
 

4549
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,470
i would then pose the question at what
cost

4550
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:52,480
cost
 

4551
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,229
cost
because when you

4552
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
because when you
 

4553
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:57,030
because when you
do something perhaps that deviates from

4554
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
do something perhaps that deviates from
 

4555
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,669
do something perhaps that deviates from
the typical pre-programmed

4556
01:22:59,669 --> 01:22:59,679
the typical pre-programmed
 

4557
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,110
the typical pre-programmed
you know

4558
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,120
you know
 

4559
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,910
you know
mother nature's program

4560
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:03,920
mother nature's program
 

4561
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,550
mother nature's program
i suspect it usually comes at the cost

4562
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:06,560
i suspect it usually comes at the cost
 

4563
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,510
i suspect it usually comes at the cost
of something else so maybe he is you

4564
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:09,520
of something else so maybe he is you
 

4565
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,390
of something else so maybe he is you
know able to direct and focus

4566
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:12,400
know able to direct and focus
 

4567
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,709
know able to direct and focus
his sleeping cognition

4568
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:14,719
his sleeping cognition
 

4569
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,030
his sleeping cognition
on those particular topics that will

4570
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:17,040
on those particular topics that will
 

4571
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,149
on those particular topics that will
gain him better problematic resolution

4572
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:20,159
gain him better problematic resolution
 

4573
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,229
gain him better problematic resolution
the next day when he wakes up the

4574
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:22,239
the next day when he wakes up the
 

4575
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:24,229
the next day when he wakes up the
question is though at what cost of the

4576
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:24,239
question is though at what cost of the
 

4577
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:27,110
question is though at what cost of the
other things that didn't make it onto

4578
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,120
other things that didn't make it onto
 

4579
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,390
other things that didn't make it onto
the menu

4580
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:28,400
the menu
 

4581
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,270
the menu
of

4582
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280
of
 

4583
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,830
of
the finger buffet of sleep that night

4584
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
the finger buffet of sleep that night
 

4585
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,629
the finger buffet of sleep that night
and is it that you don't process the

4586
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:34,639
and is it that you don't process the
 

4587
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:35,669
and is it that you don't process the
emotional

4588
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:35,679
emotional
 

4589
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,229
emotional
difficulties or events and therefore you

4590
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:38,239
difficulties or events and therefore you
 

4591
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,470
difficulties or events and therefore you
are less emotionally resolved the next

4592
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:40,480
are less emotionally resolved the next
 

4593
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,910
are less emotionally resolved the next
day but you are more problem resolved

4594
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:43,920
day but you are more problem resolved
 

4595
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,550
day but you are more problem resolved
the following day and so i always try to

4596
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:46,560
the following day and so i always try to
 

4597
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,629
the following day and so i always try to
think and

4598
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
think and
 

4599
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,590
think and
i truly don't want to sound puritanical

4600
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,600
i truly don't want to sound puritanical
 

4601
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,430
i truly don't want to sound puritanical
either about sleep and i think i've come

4602
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:53,440
either about sleep and i think i've come
 

4603
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,110
either about sleep and i think i've come
off that way

4604
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,120
off that way
 

4605
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,189
off that way
many a time especially when i started

4606
01:23:57,189 --> 01:23:57,199
many a time especially when i started
 

4607
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:00,149
many a time especially when i started
out in the public

4608
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
out in the public
 

4609
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,070
out in the public
the tone of the book in some ways you

4610
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:02,080
the tone of the book in some ways you
 

4611
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,229
the tone of the book in some ways you
know i look back and think could i have

4612
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
know i look back and think could i have
 

4613
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,149
know i look back and think could i have
been a little softer

4614
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
been a little softer
 

4615
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:09,750
been a little softer
and the reason was i i was that way

4616
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:09,760
and the reason was i i was that way
 

4617
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,590
and the reason was i i was that way
back in when i started writing the book

4618
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:11,600
back in when i started writing the book
 

4619
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,470
back in when i started writing the book
which was probably something like

4620
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:13,480
which was probably something like
 

4621
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,470
which was probably something like
2014 or 15.

4622
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:16,480
2014 or 15.
 

4623
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,629
2014 or 15.
sleep was the neglected stepsister in

4624
01:24:18,629 --> 01:24:18,639
sleep was the neglected stepsister in
 

4625
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,350
sleep was the neglected stepsister in
the health conversation of the day

4626
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
the health conversation of the day
 

4627
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,390
the health conversation of the day
and i was just so sad to see the amount

4628
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:24,400
and i was just so sad to see the amount
 

4629
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,470
and i was just so sad to see the amount
of suffering and disease and sickness

4630
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:26,480
of suffering and disease and sickness
 

4631
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,510
of suffering and disease and sickness
that was caused by insufficient sleep

4632
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:29,520
that was caused by insufficient sleep
 

4633
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,750
that was caused by insufficient sleep
and for years before i've been you know

4634
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:31,760
and for years before i've been you know
 

4635
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,750
and for years before i've been you know
doing public speaking and i'd tell

4636
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,760
doing public speaking and i'd tell
 

4637
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,950
doing public speaking and i'd tell
people about the great things that

4638
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:34,960
people about the great things that
 

4639
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,550
people about the great things that
happen when you get sleep people would

4640
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
happen when you get sleep people would
 

4641
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,149
happen when you get sleep people would
say that's fascinating and then they

4642
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
say that's fascinating and then they
 

4643
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,669
say that's fascinating and then they
would go back and keep doing the same

4644
01:24:39,669 --> 01:24:39,679
would go back and keep doing the same
 

4645
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,910
would go back and keep doing the same
thing about not sleeping enough and then

4646
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:41,920
thing about not sleeping enough and then
 

4647
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,750
thing about not sleeping enough and then
i realized you can't really speak about

4648
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:43,760
i realized you can't really speak about
 

4649
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,110
i realized you can't really speak about
the good things that happen it's like

4650
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:45,120
the good things that happen it's like
 

4651
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,430
the good things that happen it's like
the news what bleeds leads and if you

4652
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:47,440
the news what bleeds leads and if you
 

4653
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,189
the news what bleeds leads and if you
speak about the alarmingly bad things

4654
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
speak about the alarmingly bad things
 

4655
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,110
speak about the alarmingly bad things
that happen people tend to have a

4656
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:51,120
that happen people tend to have a
 

4657
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,870
that happen people tend to have a
behavioral change

4658
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:52,880
behavioral change
 

4659
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,750
behavioral change
and so the book as a consequence i think

4660
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:55,760
and so the book as a consequence i think
 

4661
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,790
and so the book as a consequence i think
probably came out a little bit on the

4662
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
probably came out a little bit on the
 

4663
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,629
probably came out a little bit on the
strong side of

4664
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
strong side of
 

4665
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,030
strong side of
you know trying to convince you know

4666
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:03,040
you know trying to convince you know
 

4667
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,709
you know trying to convince you know
people you're trying to help a lot of

4668
01:25:04,709 --> 01:25:04,719
people you're trying to help a lot of
 

4669
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,229
people you're trying to help a lot of
people and that's a powerful way to help

4670
01:25:06,229 --> 01:25:06,239
people and that's a powerful way to help
 

4671
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,629
people and that's a powerful way to help
a lot of people i would i was genuinely

4672
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:08,639
a lot of people i would i was genuinely
 

4673
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,149
a lot of people i would i was genuinely
trying to help people but you know

4674
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:10,159
trying to help people but you know
 

4675
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,669
trying to help people but you know
certainly for some people who for whom

4676
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:11,679
certainly for some people who for whom
 

4677
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,910
certainly for some people who for whom
sleep is not does not come easy then it

4678
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:13,920
sleep is not does not come easy then it
 

4679
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,750
sleep is not does not come easy then it
was probably you know

4680
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:15,760
was probably you know
 

4681
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,470
was probably you know
a tricky book to read too and i think i

4682
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,480
a tricky book to read too and i think i
 

4683
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,310
a tricky book to read too and i think i
i feel more sensitive to those people

4684
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:20,320
i feel more sensitive to those people
 

4685
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,470
i feel more sensitive to those people
now and empathetically connected to them

4686
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
now and empathetically connected to them

5011
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:43,590
disease i've often wondered whether it
was coincidental then that both of them

5012
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:43,600
was coincidental then that both of them
 

5013
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,669
was coincidental then that both of them
died of the terrible disease of

died of the terrible disease of
 

5015
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,590
died of the terrible disease of
alzheimer's meaning you know maybe it

5016
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:47,600
alzheimer's meaning you know maybe it
 

5017
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,830
alzheimer's meaning you know maybe it
doesn't get you by way of you know being

popped out of the gene pool in a car
 

5021
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,950
popped out of the gene pool in a car
accident because you had a microsleep at

accident because you had a microsleep at
 

5023
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,590
accident because you had a microsleep at
the wheel at age 32 or it doesn't get

you in your 70s yeah i think the elastic
band of sleep deprivation can stretch

5034
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
band of sleep deprivation can stretch
 

5035
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,629
band of sleep deprivation can stretch
only so far before it snaps

5036
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:10,639
only so far before it snaps
 

5037
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,590
only so far before it snaps
and it ultimately seems to snap you know

5038
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:13,600
and it ultimately seems to snap you know

i think he um
goes to see he i think died of a

5044
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:19,760
goes to see he i think died of a
 

5045
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,629
goes to see he i think died of a
coronary thrombosis i believe

5046
01:32:22,629 --> 01:32:22,639
coronary thrombosis i believe
 

5047
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,709
coronary thrombosis i believe
and there was a wonderful study done out

5048
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:24,719
and there was a wonderful study done out
 

5049
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,149
and there was a wonderful study done out
of harvard where they took a group of

5050
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:26,159
of harvard where they took a group of
 

5051
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,070
of harvard where they took a group of
people who had no signs of

5052
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:28,080
people who had no signs of
 

5053
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,070
people who had no signs of
cardiovascular disease

5054
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,080
cardiovascular disease
 

5055
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,669
cardiovascular disease
and what they found is that when they

5056
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:31,679
and what they found is that when they
 

5057
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:32,870
and what they found is that when they
tracked them

5058
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:32,880
tracked them
 

5059
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,350
tracked them
for years afterwards

5060
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:35,360
for years afterwards
 

5061
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,629
for years afterwards
they were completely healthy to begin

5062
01:32:36,629 --> 01:32:36,639
they were completely healthy to begin
 

5063
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,550
they were completely healthy to begin
with those people who are getting less

5064
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:38,560
with those people who are getting less
 

5065
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,790
with those people who are getting less
than six hours of sleep ended up having

calcification of the coronary artery
 

5073
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,310
calcification of the coronary artery
which is the major

which is the major
 

5075
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,270
which is the major
sort of

massive coronary it's because of a
blockade of the coronary artery

5084
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,000
blockade of the coronary artery
 

5085
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,990

01:33:04,229 --> 01:33:04,239
a coronary thrombosis we also know that
 

5091
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,149
a coronary thrombosis we also know that
insufficient sleep is linked to numerous

could nap
 

5131
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,629
could nap
but what we also know a study again

5132
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
but what we also know a study again
 

5133
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,310
but what we also know a study again
coming out of harvard just

5134
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:46,320
coming out of harvard just
 

5135
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,629
coming out of harvard just
a couple of months ago demonstrated very

5136
01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:48,639
a couple of months ago demonstrated very
 

5137
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,629
a couple of months ago demonstrated very
clearly that polyphasic sleep is

5138
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:50,639
clearly that polyphasic sleep is
 

5139
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,950
clearly that polyphasic sleep is
associated with worse physical outcomes

5140
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:52,960
associated with worse physical outcomes
 

5141
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,350
associated with worse physical outcomes
worth cognitive outcomes and especially

5142
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:55,360
worth cognitive outcomes and especially
 

5143
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,390
worth cognitive outcomes and especially
worse mood outcomes so from that sense

5144
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:58,400
worse mood outcomes so from that sense
 

5145
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,390
worse mood outcomes so from that sense
you know sleeping like a baby is not

5146

perfect for adults
there's a

5150
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
there's a
 

5151
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,669
there's a
fascinating dance here

5152
01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:05,679
fascinating dance here
 

5153
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:06,790
fascinating dance here
of uh

5154
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:06,800
of uh
 

5155
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,070
of uh
the mean and the extreme like the

5156
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:10,080
the mean and the extreme like the
 

5157
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,110
the mean and the extreme like the
the average and the high performers

5158
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,120
the average and the high performers
 

5159
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,750
the average and the high performers
so i um

5160
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760

 

5161
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,070

this this gets to like the meaning of

5162
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:20,080
this this gets to like the meaning of
 

5163
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,870
this this gets to like the meaning of
life kind of discussion but

5164
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:22,880
life kind of discussion but
 

5165
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,070
life kind of discussion but
let's go then

5166
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:24,080
let's go then
 

5167
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,189
let's go then
so well and also happiness so

5168
01:34:27,189 --> 01:34:27,199
so well and also happiness so
 

5169
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:28,950
so well and also happiness so

you have to really get a lot more data

5174
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:35,840
you have to really get a lot more data
 

5175
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,990
you have to really get a lot more data
about individuals to make

5176

my
 

5191
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,590
my
my sense

5192
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:55,600
my sense
 

5193
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,109
my sense
is that

5194
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:57,119
is that
 

5195
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:00,790
is that
whatever life decisions you make if they

5196
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:00,800
whatever life decisions you make if they
 

5197
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,310

that's also going to be a big boost that
 

5201
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,390
that's also going to be a big boost that
needs to be integrated into the plots in

5202
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,400
needs to be integrated into the plots in
 

5203
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,390
needs to be integrated into the plots in
the science right so

5204
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,400
the science right so
 

5205
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,229
the science right so
the i'll give you an example of somebody

5206
01:35:12,229 --> 01:35:12,239
the i'll give you an example of somebody

a framework of this but

5240
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:50,880
a framework of this but
 

5241
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,109
a framework of this but
i'm bothered by

5242

i'm bothered by

i'm bothered by
the fact that a lot of people tell me

5244
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960
the fact that a lot of people tell me
 

5245
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:02,070
the fact that a lot of people tell me
or david that they're doing things wrong

01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,149
now they're correct
but

5256
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:12,159
but

sleep was a secondary citizen in in the

5290
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
sleep was a secondary citizen in in the
 

5291
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,870
sleep was a secondary citizen in in the
full spectrum of what's a healthy life

01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:03,840
silicon valley and all these kinds of
 

5297
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,229
silicon valley and all these kinds of
uh work environments that i get to work

you said

5340
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:52,880
you said
 

5341
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,189
you said
two things is it

5342
01:37:55,189 --> 01:37:55,199
two things is it
 

5343
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:58,390
two things is it
is it wrong to do those things

5344
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400
is it wrong to do those things
 

5345
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,750
is it wrong to do those things
to yourself

5346
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
to yourself
 

5347
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,070
to yourself
and is it unhealthy to do those things

5348
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,080
and is it unhealthy to do those things
 

5349
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,590
and is it unhealthy to do those things
to yourself

5350

i disagree with the former and i agree

5352
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:06,159
i disagree with the former and i agree
 

5353
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:07,590
i disagree with the former and i agree
with the latter

with the latter
 

5355
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,910
with the latter
so from a health biological medicine

5356
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:09,920
so from a health biological medicine
 

5357
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,910
so from a health biological medicine
perspective

about inter-individual differences

5370
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:24,320
about inter-individual differences
 

5371
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,229
about inter-individual differences
usually when i see a bar graph and a

01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:26,239
usually when i see a bar graph and a
 

5373
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:29,669
usually when i see a bar graph and a
mean i usually say show me your variance

5374
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:29,679
mean i usually say show me your variance
 

5375
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,070

01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:32,080
yeah i want to see your variants in
 

5377
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,550
yeah i want to see your variants in
other words show me the distribution of

5378
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:34,560
other words show me the distribution of
 

5379
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,390
other words show me the distribution of
that effect how many people were below

5380
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:36,400
that effect how many people were below
 

5381
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,390
that effect how many people were below
the mean how many is it all tightly

5382
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:38,400
the mean how many is it all tightly
 

5383
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,070
the mean how many is it all tightly
clustered around this one thing so it's

5384
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
clustered around this one thing so it's
 

5385
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,629
clustered around this one thing so it's
a very robust effect or was this huge

5386
01:38:42,629 --> 01:38:42,639
a very robust effect or was this huge
 

5387
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,390
a very robust effect or was this huge
fan of effect where for some people

5388
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:44,400
fan of effect where for some people
 

5389
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,830
fan of effect where for some people
there was no effect at all on other

5390
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:45,840
there was no effect at all on other
 

5391
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,510
there was no effect at all on other
people there was a whopping effect and

5392
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:47,520
people there was a whopping effect and
 

5393
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,870
people there was a whopping effect and
everything in between

5394
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:48,880
everything in between
 

5395
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,590
everything in between
so i don't discount into individual

5396
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:51,600
so i don't discount into individual
 

5397
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,310
so i don't discount into individual
variability

5398
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:54,320
variability
 

5399
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,109
variability
but

5400
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:55,119
but
 

5401
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:56,709
but
and i will come back to those two points

5402
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:56,719
and i will come back to those two points
 

5403
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,470
and i will come back to those two points
about is it wrong and is it unhealthy in

5404
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:58,480
about is it wrong and is it unhealthy in
 

5405
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:01,030
about is it wrong and is it unhealthy in
just a second when it comes to sleep we

5406
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:01,040
just a second when it comes to sleep we
 

5407
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,470
just a second when it comes to sleep we
have found huge amounts of

5408
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:02,480
have found huge amounts of
 

5409
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,870
have found huge amounts of
inter-individual differences in your

but one of the fascinating things so

5414
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:09,679
but one of the fascinating things so
 

5415
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:11,030
but one of the fascinating things so
let's say that i take you and we're

cognition on your attentional ability to
 

5437
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:35,510
cognition on your attentional ability to
focus you are very resilient you just

5438
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
focus you are very resilient you just

01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,270
focus you are very resilient you just
don't show any impairment at all even

5440
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:37,280
don't show any impairment at all even
 

5441
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,709
don't show any impairment at all even
after being awake for 36 hours straight

5442
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:40,719
after being awake for 36 hours straight
 

5443
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,709
after being awake for 36 hours straight
does that mean that you are resilient in

5444
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
does that mean that you are resilient in
 

5445
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,629
does that mean that you are resilient in
all of those other domains as well the

5446
01:39:44,629 --> 01:39:44,639
all of those other domains as well the
 

5447
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:46,310
all of those other domains as well the
answer is no you're not

5448
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:46,320
answer is no you're not
 

5449
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,790
answer is no you're not
so you can be resilient in one

5450
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:48,800
so you can be resilient in one
 

5451
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,990
so you can be resilient in one
but

5452
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:50,000
but
 

5453
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,790
but
very vulnerable in another and we've

5454
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:52,800
very vulnerable in another and we've
 

5455
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,270
very vulnerable in another and we've
we've not found anyone who isn't at

5456
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:55,280
we've not found anyone who isn't at
 

5457
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,310
we've not found anyone who isn't at
least vulnerable in one of those domains

5458
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,320
least vulnerable in one of those domains
 

5459
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,830
least vulnerable in one of those domains
meaning that

5460
01:39:59,830 --> 01:39:59,840
meaning that
 

5461
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,070
meaning that
it's somewhat safe to say that

5462
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:02,080
it's somewhat safe to say that
 

5463
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,910
it's somewhat safe to say that
not getting sufficient sleep will lead

5464
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:03,920
not getting sufficient sleep will lead
 

5465
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,030
not getting sufficient sleep will lead
to some kind of impairment in any one

5466
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:07,040
to some kind of impairment in any one
 

5467
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,270
to some kind of impairment in any one
given individual it may not be the same

5468
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:09,280
given individual it may not be the same
 

5469
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,390
given individual it may not be the same
impermanent

5470
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,400
impermanent
 

5471
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,709
impermanent
but it's likely to be an impairment but

5472
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
but it's likely to be an impairment but
 

5473
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,790
but it's likely to be an impairment but
to come back to the question i think

5474
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:14,800
to come back to the question i think
 

5475
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,590
to come back to the question i think
it's wrong to tell anyone that it's

5476
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,600
it's wrong to tell anyone that it's
 

5477
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,669
it's wrong to tell anyone that it's
wrong to do what they're doing even if

5478
01:40:19,669 --> 01:40:19,679
wrong to do what they're doing even if
 

5479
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:21,830
wrong to do what they're doing even if
they are compromising their sleep even

5480
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:21,840
they are compromising their sleep even
 

5481
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,590
they are compromising their sleep even
if they're compromising their mental

5482
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:23,600
if they're compromising their mental
 

5483
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,990
if they're compromising their mental
health you know as long as they're not

5484
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:26,000
health you know as long as they're not
 

5485
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,310
health you know as long as they're not
hurting anyone else

5486
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:28,320
hurting anyone else
 

5487
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,910
hurting anyone else
then i think

5488
01:40:29,910 --> 01:40:29,920
then i think
 

5489
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,910
then i think
the answer is that's that person's

5490
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:31,920
the answer is that's that person's
 

5491
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,870
the answer is that's that person's
choice

5492
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:32,880

in some ways shaving a little of their

01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:22,719
in some ways shaving a little of their
 

5701
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:24,629
in some ways shaving a little of their
own off

5702
01:44:24,629 --> 01:44:24,639
own off
 

5703
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,910
own off
so i don't take i have no umbrage uh

5704
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:27,920
so i don't take i have no umbrage uh
 

5705
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,470
so i don't take i have no umbrage uh
with that mentality at all i think you

5706
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:30,480
with that mentality at all i think you
 

5707
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,390
with that mentality at all i think you
just have to be very clear about what

5708
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:32,400
just have to be very clear about what
 

5709
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,870
just have to be very clear about what
you're optimizing for

5710
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:34,880
you're optimizing for
 

5711
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,830
you're optimizing for
and my worry is that most people fall

5712
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:37,840
and my worry is that most people fall
 

5713
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,590
and my worry is that most people fall
into the rat race

5714
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:39,600
into the rat race
 

5715
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,149
into the rat race
and they never actually ask the question

5716
01:44:42,149 --> 01:44:42,159
and they never actually ask the question
 

5717
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:44,310
and they never actually ask the question
why am i doing this if you're just

5718
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:44,320
why am i doing this if you're just
 

5719
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,709
why am i doing this if you're just
working nine to five

5720
01:44:46,709 --> 01:44:46,719
working nine to five
 

5721
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:49,590
working nine to five
or uh and you allow that nine to five to

5722
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:49,600
or uh and you allow that nine to five to
 

5723
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,910
or uh and you allow that nine to five to
stretch into much longer but it's

5724
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:51,920
stretch into much longer but it's
 

5725
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,070
stretch into much longer but it's
nevertheless a job that's kind of like

5726
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,080
nevertheless a job that's kind of like
 

5727
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,790
nevertheless a job that's kind of like
wears you down that's one thing another

wears you down that's one thing another
thing is when

5730
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:58,000
thing is when
 

5731
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,709
thing is when
it is a like you're

5732
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:00,719
it is a like you're

i think as long as you know
what it is that you could be doing to

01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:10,320
what it is that you could be doing to

what it is that you could be doing to
yourself and you are comfortable and

previously these were the you know
known unknowns and these were the

and now i am slightly more cognizant i
 

5769

will
 

6177
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:27,830
will
externally triggered yeah it's sort of

6178
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:27,840
externally triggered yeah it's sort of
 

6179
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:31,030
externally triggered yeah it's sort of
what we would call reactive stress

6180
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:31,040
what we would call reactive stress
 

6181
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,030
what we would call reactive stress
um

6182
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:33,040
um
 

6183
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,070
um
and

6184
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:34,080
and
 

6185
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:36,310
and
so that that's sort of point number one

6186
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,320
so that that's sort of point number one
 

6187
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:39,030
so that that's sort of point number one
about the idiosyncrasies the point

6188
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
about the idiosyncrasies the point
 

6189
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,350
about the idiosyncrasies the point
number two is that when you are having a

6190
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:41,360
number two is that when you are having a
 

6191
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,669
number two is that when you are having a
difficult night of sleep

6192
01:53:43,669 --> 01:53:43,679
difficult night of sleep
 

6193
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:45,990
difficult night of sleep
as a sleep researcher you basically have

6194
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:46,000
as a sleep researcher you basically have
 

6195
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,910
as a sleep researcher you basically have
become the woody allen neurotic of the

6196
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:47,920
become the woody allen neurotic of the
 

6197
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,750
become the woody allen neurotic of the
sleep world

6198
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:49,760
sleep world
 

6199
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,510
sleep world
because at that moment you know i'm

6200
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:51,520
because at that moment you know i'm
 

6201
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:54,149
because at that moment you know i'm
trying to fall asleep and i'm not and

6202
01:53:54,149 --> 01:53:54,159
trying to fall asleep and i'm not and
 

6203
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:55,350
trying to fall asleep and i'm not and
i'm starting to think okay my

6204
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:55,360
i'm starting to think okay my
 

6205
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,189
i'm starting to think okay my
dorsilateral prefrontal cortex is not

6206
01:53:57,189 --> 01:53:57,199
dorsilateral prefrontal cortex is not
 

6207
01:53:57,199 --> 01:53:58,870
dorsilateral prefrontal cortex is not
shutting down my noradrenaline is not

6208
01:53:58,870 --> 01:53:58,880
shutting down my noradrenaline is not
 

6209
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,790
shutting down my noradrenaline is not
ramping down my sympathetic nervous

6210
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:00,800
ramping down my sympathetic nervous
 

6211
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,790
ramping down my sympathetic nervous
system is not giving way to my parasite

6212
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:02,800
system is not giving way to my parasite
 

6213
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:05,189
system is not giving way to my parasite
at that point you are dead in the water

6214
01:54:05,189 --> 01:54:05,199
at that point you are dead in the water
 

6215
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:07,270
at that point you are dead in the water
for the next two hours and nothing is

6216
01:54:07,270 --> 01:54:07,280
for the next two hours and nothing is
 

6217
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:09,750
for the next two hours and nothing is
bringing you back so uh there is some

6218
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:09,760
bringing you back so uh there is some
 

6219
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:12,790
bringing you back so uh there is some
irony in that too i would say for myself

6220
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:12,800
irony in that too i would say for myself
 

6221
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,390
irony in that too i would say for myself
though i

6222
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,400
though i
 

6223
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,350
though i
if there's something i'm not proud of it

6224
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:17,360
if there's something i'm not proud of it
 

6225
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,669
if there's something i'm not proud of it
has been

6226
01:54:19,669 --> 01:54:19,679
has been
 

6227
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:23,109
has been
at times railing against my chronotype

6228
01:54:23,109 --> 01:54:23,119
at times railing against my chronotype
 

6229
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:25,510
at times railing against my chronotype
so your chronotype is essentially are

6230
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:25,520
so your chronotype is essentially are
 

6231
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,350
so your chronotype is essentially are
you a morning type evening type or

6232
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:27,360
you a morning type evening type or
 

6233
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,270
you a morning type evening type or
somewhere in between yeah

6234
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:29,280
somewhere in between yeah
 

6235
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:30,550
somewhere in between yeah
and

6236
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,560
and
 

6237
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,870
and
there were times because society is

6238
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:32,880
there were times because society is
 

6239
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,669
there were times because society is
desperately biased towards the morning

6240
01:54:35,669 --> 01:54:35,679
desperately biased towards the morning
 

6241
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:36,709
desperately biased towards the morning
types

6242
01:54:36,709 --> 01:54:36,719
types
 

6243
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:38,709

like i'll just go all the way around
comfortably and happily i love it and

6938
02:07:00,790 --> 02:07:00,800
comfortably and happily i love it and
 

6939
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:03,830
comfortably and happily i love it and
now there'll be a nap i mean if you like

6940
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:03,840
now there'll be a nap i mean if you like
 

6941
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:05,270
now there'll be a nap i mean if you like
add up the hours

6942
02:07:05,270 --> 02:07:05,280
add up the hours
 

6943
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:07,830
add up the hours
when i'm just like sleeping as much

6944
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:07,840
when i'm just like sleeping as much
 

6945
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:10,229
when i'm just like sleeping as much
as i want it'll probably be like six

6946
02:07:10,229 --> 02:07:10,239
as i want it'll probably be like six
 

6947
02:07:10,239 --> 02:07:12,629
as i want it'll probably be like six
hour average per 24 hours

6948
02:07:12,629 --> 02:07:12,639
hour average per 24 hours
 

6949
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:15,589
hour average per 24 hours
like that kind of yeah so it works out

6950
02:07:15,589 --> 02:07:15,599
like that kind of yeah so it works out
 

6951
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:18,149
like that kind of yeah so it works out
nicely maybe even seven hours i don't

6952
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:18,159
nicely maybe even seven hours i don't
 

6953
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:19,189
nicely maybe even seven hours i don't
know but

6954
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:19,199
know but
 

6955
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:21,430
know but
that it's obviously irregular and

6956
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,440
that it's obviously irregular and
 

6957
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:23,510
that it's obviously irregular and
there's chaos in the whole thing right

6958
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:23,520
there's chaos in the whole thing right
 

6959
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:24,229
there's chaos in the whole thing right
like

6960
02:07:24,229 --> 02:07:24,239
like
 

6961
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:25,669
like
sometimes it's shorter sleeve sometimes

6962
02:07:25,669 --> 02:07:25,679
sometimes it's shorter sleeve sometimes
 

6963
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:27,830
sometimes it's shorter sleeve sometimes
it's longer is that

6964
02:07:27,830 --> 02:07:27,840
it's longer is that
 

6965
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:30,069
it's longer is that
is that totally not a good thing do you

6966
02:07:30,069 --> 02:07:30,079
is that totally not a good thing do you
 

6967
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:31,109
is that totally not a good thing do you
think

6968
02:07:31,109 --> 02:07:31,119
think

the best evidence that we have to speak
 

6971
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:34,950
the best evidence that we have to speak
to this question is people who are doing

to this question is people who are doing
 

6973
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:37,510
to this question is people who are doing

rotating shifts
 

6975
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,830
rotating shifts
and

6976
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:38,840
and

unfortunately the news is not good um

the other

to that then
 

7039
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:55,750
to that then
you start to see some of the pressure

7040
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:55,760
you start to see some of the pressure

to your point
 

7047
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,069
to your point
if that's something that you don't mind

7048

if that's something that you don't mind

02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:13,589
then i think you should keep doing what
you're doing it's complicated you of

quick point on that too you know we
 

7107
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:10,470
quick point on that too you know we
often think about

7108
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:10,480

investment
and the reason is because your

7116
02:10:19,669 --> 02:10:19,679
and the reason is because your
 

7117

and to me it's the idea of if i'm going
 

7125
02:10:29,199 --> 02:10:32,390
and to me it's the idea of if i'm going
to boil a pot of water

to boil a pot of water
why would i boil it

7128
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:34,560
why would i boil it
 

7129
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:36,629
why would i boil it
on medium when i could boil it in half

7130
02:10:36,629 --> 02:10:36,639
on medium when i could boil it in half

and
the reason i bring that point up is

7154
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:04,000
the reason i bring that point up is
 

7155
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,470
the reason i bring that point up is
because i don't know any

7156
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:06,480
because i don't know any

right can sometimes be at odds with the
 

7201
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,069
right can sometimes be at odds with the
fact that

trade-off
i actually admire people that take the

i actually admire people that take the

i actually admire people that take the
big risk and work hard whether that

means staying up late at night all those

7214
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:20,480
means staying up late at night all those
 

7215

means staying up late at night all those
kinds of things

7216

kinds of things
 

7217
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,229
kinds of things
but it cannot be in the in the framework

7218
02:12:24,229 --> 02:12:24,239
but it cannot be in the in the framework
 

7219
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:26,069
but it cannot be in the in the framework
in the context like what edison said

7220
02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:26,079
in the context like what edison said
 

7221
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:28,149
in the context like what edison said
which is sleep feels like a waste of

7222
02:12:28,149 --> 02:12:28,159
which is sleep feels like a waste of
 

7223
02:12:28,159 --> 02:12:29,830
which is sleep feels like a waste of
time

7224
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:29,840
time
 

7225
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,550
time
so like if you're not sleeping

7226
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:32,560
so like if you're not sleeping
 

7227
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:34,709
so like if you're not sleeping
because you think sleep is stupid that's

7228
02:12:34,709 --> 02:12:34,719
because you think sleep is stupid that's
 

7229
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:36,390
because you think sleep is stupid that's
totally wrong

7230
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:36,400
totally wrong
 

7231
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,069
totally wrong
but if you're not sleeping because

7232
02:12:38,069 --> 02:12:38,079
but if you're not sleeping because
 

7233
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:39,750
but if you're not sleeping because
you're deeply passionate about something

7234
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:39,760
you're deeply passionate about something
 

7235
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:42,390
you're deeply passionate about something
that to me it's a it's a gray area

7236
02:12:42,390 --> 02:12:42,400
that to me it's a it's a gray area
 

7237
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:44,550
that to me it's a it's a gray area
of course but that to me is much more

7238
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:44,560
of course but that to me is much more
 

7239
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:46,229
of course but that to me is much more
admirable and it's everything you're

7240
02:12:46,229 --> 02:12:46,239
admirable and it's everything you're
 

7241
02:12:46,239 --> 02:12:48,550
admirable and it's everything you're
espousing is saying like whatever the

7242
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:48,560
espousing is saying like whatever the
 

7243
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,390
espousing is saying like whatever the
hell you're doing you better be aware

7244
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:50,400
hell you're doing you better be aware
 

7245
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:51,669
hell you're doing you better be aware
that sleep

7246
02:12:51,669 --> 02:12:51,679
that sleep
 

7247
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:53,589
that sleep
long term and short term is really good

7248
02:12:53,589 --> 02:12:53,599

02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:52,560
and that intensity or that aggression
 

7411
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,310
and that intensity or that aggression
um that

7412
02:15:54,310 --> 02:15:54,320
um that
 

7413
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:56,470
um that
can lack compassion sometimes in empathy

7414
02:15:56,470 --> 02:15:56,480
can lack compassion sometimes in empathy
 

7415
02:15:56,480 --> 02:15:58,229
can lack compassion sometimes in empathy
and when you have children you get

7416
02:15:58,229 --> 02:15:58,239
and when you have children you get
 

7417
02:15:58,239 --> 02:16:00,310
and when you have children you get
a sense like oh everybody was a child at

7418
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:00,320
a sense like oh everybody was a child at
 

7419
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:02,390
a sense like oh everybody was a child at
some point everybody was as a kid and

7420
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
some point everybody was as a kid and
 

7421
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,629
some point everybody was as a kid and
you see that whole development process

7422
02:16:04,629 --> 02:16:04,639
you see that whole development process
 

7423
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:06,550
you see that whole development process
it can definitely enrich

7424
02:16:06,550 --> 02:16:06,560
it can definitely enrich
 

7425
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:08,790
it can definitely enrich
um expand

7426
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:08,800
um expand
 

7427
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,229
um expand
your your

7428
02:16:10,229 --> 02:16:10,239
your your
 

7429
02:16:10,239 --> 02:16:13,189
your your
ability to be empathetic

7430
02:16:13,189 --> 02:16:13,199
ability to be empathetic
 

7431
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:16,149
ability to be empathetic
let me ask you about diet

7432
02:16:16,149 --> 02:16:16,159
let me ask you about diet
 

7433
02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:18,310
let me ask you about diet
so what's the connection between diet

7434
02:16:18,310 --> 02:16:18,320
so what's the connection between diet
 

7435
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:19,430
so what's the connection between diet
and sleep

7436
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:19,440
and sleep
 

7437
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:21,750
and sleep
so i do intermittent fasting sometimes

7438
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:21,760
so i do intermittent fasting sometimes
 

7439
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,669
so i do intermittent fasting sometimes
only one meal a day sometimes no meals a

7440
02:16:23,669 --> 02:16:23,679
only one meal a day sometimes no meals a
 

7441
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:24,629
only one meal a day sometimes no meals a
day

7442
02:16:24,629 --> 02:16:24,639
day
 

7443
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:26,069
day
is there a good science on the

7444
02:16:26,069 --> 02:16:26,079
is there a good science on the
 

7445
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:27,669
is there a good science on the
interaction between

7446
02:16:27,669 --> 02:16:27,679
interaction between
 

7447
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:29,750
interaction between
fasting and sleep

7448
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:29,760
fasting and sleep
 

7449
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:32,950
fasting and sleep
we have some data i would prefer more

7450
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:32,960
we have some data i would prefer more
 

7451
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:35,190
we have some data i would prefer more
but we have data both on

7452
02:16:35,190 --> 02:16:35,200
but we have data both on
 

7453
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:38,469
but we have data both on
time restricted eating

7454
02:16:38,469 --> 02:16:38,479
time restricted eating
 

7455
02:16:38,479 --> 02:16:40,150
time restricted eating
and then

7456
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:40,160
and then
 

7457
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:43,110
and then
we have some data on

7458
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:43,120
we have some data on
 

7459
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:45,830
we have some data on
fasting to a

7460
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:45,840
fasting to a
 

7461
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:49,110
fasting to a
on time restricted eating

7462
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:49,120
on time restricted eating
 

7463
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:51,190
on time restricted eating
i think that it has some benefits

7464
02:16:51,190 --> 02:16:51,200
i think that it has some benefits
 

7465
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,950
i think that it has some benefits
although the human replication studies

7466
02:16:52,950 --> 02:16:52,960
although the human replication studies
 

7467
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:55,190
although the human replication studies
have actually not borne out quite the

7468
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:55,200
have actually not borne out quite the
 

7469
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:57,910
have actually not borne out quite the
same health benefit extent that the

7470
02:16:57,910 --> 02:16:57,920
same health benefit extent that the
 

7471
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,429
same health benefit extent that the
animal studies have been some

7472
02:16:59,429 --> 02:16:59,439
animal studies have been some
 

7473
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:01,270
animal studies have been some
disappointing

7474
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,280
disappointing
 

7475
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,669
disappointing
studies one here close to where we are

7476
02:17:03,669 --> 02:17:03,679
studies one here close to where we are
 

7477
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:06,790
studies one here close to where we are
right now at ucsf recently

7478
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:06,800
right now at ucsf recently
 

7479
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:09,110
right now at ucsf recently
so i think time restricted eating can be

7480
02:17:09,110 --> 02:17:09,120
so i think time restricted eating can be
 

7481
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,429
so i think time restricted eating can be
a good thing and there are many benefits

7482
02:17:11,429 --> 02:17:11,439
a good thing and there are many benefits
 

7483
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:13,669
a good thing and there are many benefits
of time restricted eating is sleep one

7484
02:17:13,669 --> 02:17:13,679
of time restricted eating is sleep one
 

7485
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:15,990
of time restricted eating is sleep one
of them no it doesn't seem to be

7486
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,000
of them no it doesn't seem to be
 

7487
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,589
of them no it doesn't seem to be
because there are probably at the time

7488
02:17:17,589 --> 02:17:17,599
because there are probably at the time
 

7489
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:19,669
because there are probably at the time
that we're recording this three pretty

7490
02:17:19,669 --> 02:17:19,679
that we're recording this three pretty
 

7491
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:21,910
that we're recording this three pretty
decent studies that i'm aware of

7492
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:21,920
decent studies that i'm aware of
 

7493
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,950
decent studies that i'm aware of
um two out of the three were in obese

7494
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:24,960
um two out of the three were in obese
 

7495
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:27,270
um two out of the three were in obese
individuals one out of the three were in

7496
02:17:27,270 --> 02:17:27,280
individuals one out of the three were in
 

7497
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,750
individuals one out of the three were in
healthy weight individuals and what they

7498
02:17:29,750 --> 02:17:29,760
healthy weight individuals and what they
 

7499
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:31,750
healthy weight individuals and what they
found was that time restricted eating in

7500
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:31,760
found was that time restricted eating in
 

7501
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,070
found was that time restricted eating in
all three of those studies didn't have

7502
02:17:34,070 --> 02:17:34,080
all three of those studies didn't have
 

7503
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:36,309
all three of those studies didn't have
any advantageous benefit to sleep it

7504
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:36,319
any advantageous benefit to sleep it
 

7505
02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:39,110
any advantageous benefit to sleep it
didn't necessarily harm sleep but it

7506
02:17:39,110 --> 02:17:39,120
didn't necessarily harm sleep but it
 

7507
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:41,669
didn't necessarily harm sleep but it
didn't seem to improve it

7508
02:17:41,669 --> 02:17:41,679
didn't seem to improve it
 

7509
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:43,429
didn't seem to improve it
when it comes to fasting though which is

7510
02:17:43,429 --> 02:17:43,439
when it comes to fasting though which is
 

7511
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:45,830
when it comes to fasting though which is
a different state

7512
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:45,840
a different state
 

7513
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:47,349
a different state
we don't have too many studies

7514
02:17:47,349 --> 02:17:47,359
we don't have too many studies
 

7515
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:48,870
we don't have too many studies
experimental studies with long-term

7516
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:48,880
experimental studies with long-term
 

7517
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,790
experimental studies with long-term
fasting the best data that we have is

7518
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:50,800
fasting the best data that we have is
 

7519
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:53,750
fasting the best data that we have is
probably from religious practices and

7520
02:17:53,750 --> 02:17:53,760
probably from religious practices and
 

7521
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:56,230
probably from religious practices and
probably the most data we have is during

7522
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:56,240
probably the most data we have is during
 

7523
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:59,910
probably the most data we have is during
ramadan where people will fast for 29 to

7524
02:17:59,910 --> 02:17:59,920
ramadan where people will fast for 29 to
 

7525
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:04,549
ramadan where people will fast for 29 to
30 days from sunrise to sunset

7526
02:18:04,549 --> 02:18:04,559
30 days from sunrise to sunset
 

7527
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:07,110
30 days from sunrise to sunset
and under those conditions

7528
02:18:07,110 --> 02:18:07,120
and under those conditions
 

7529
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:09,990
and under those conditions
there are probably

7530
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:10,000
there are probably
 

7531
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,230
there are probably
are probably five distinct changes that

7532
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:12,240
are probably five distinct changes that
 

7533
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:13,830
are probably five distinct changes that
we've seen

7534
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:13,840
we've seen
 

7535
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,349
we've seen
none of them seem to be particularly

7536
02:18:15,349 --> 02:18:15,359
none of them seem to be particularly
 

7537
02:18:15,359 --> 02:18:17,190
none of them seem to be particularly
good for sleep the first is that the

7538
02:18:17,190 --> 02:18:17,200
good for sleep the first is that the
 

7539
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:18,870
good for sleep the first is that the
amount of melatonin that you release a

7540
02:18:18,870 --> 02:18:18,880
amount of melatonin that you release a
 

7541
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:21,190
amount of melatonin that you release a
melatonin is a hormone it's often called

02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:21,200
melatonin is a hormone it's often called
 

7543
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:23,270
melatonin is a hormone it's often called
the hormone of darkness

7544
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:23,280
the hormone of darkness
 

7545
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:25,830
the hormone of darkness
or the vampire hormone not because it

02:18:25,830 --> 02:18:25,840
or the vampire hormone not because it
 

7547
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:27,589
or the vampire hormone not because it
makes you look longingly at people's

7548
02:18:27,589 --> 02:18:27,599
makes you look longingly at people's
 

7549
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,589
makes you look longingly at people's
necklines but it's just because it comes

7550
02:18:29,589 --> 02:18:29,599
necklines but it's just because it comes
 

7551
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:32,150
necklines but it's just because it comes
out at night yeah melatonin signals to

7552
02:18:32,150 --> 02:18:32,160
out at night yeah melatonin signals to
 

7553
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:34,549
out at night yeah melatonin signals to
your brain that and your body that it's

02:18:34,549 --> 02:18:34,559
your brain that and your body that it's

your brain that and your body that it's
dark it's nighttime and it's time to

02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:51,190
and
when it was released came later that was

7574
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:51,200
when it was released came later that was
 

7575
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:53,429
when it was released came later that was
the first thing the second thing was

7576
02:18:53,429 --> 02:18:53,439
the first thing the second thing was
 

7577
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:54,230
the first thing the second thing was
that

7578
02:18:54,230 --> 02:18:54,240
that
 

7579
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:56,870
that
they ended up finding it harder to fall

7580
02:18:56,870 --> 02:18:56,880
they ended up finding it harder to fall
 

7581
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:59,190
they ended up finding it harder to fall
asleep as quickly as they normally would

7582
02:18:59,190 --> 02:18:59,200
asleep as quickly as they normally would
 

7583
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:00,469
asleep as quickly as they normally would
otherwise

7584
02:19:00,469 --> 02:19:00,479
otherwise
 

7585
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:01,910
otherwise
the third thing was that the total

7586
02:19:01,910 --> 02:19:01,920
the third thing was that the total
 

7587
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:03,750
the third thing was that the total
amount of sleep that they were getting

7588
02:19:03,750 --> 02:19:03,760
amount of sleep that they were getting
 

7589
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,110
amount of sleep that they were getting
decreased

7590
02:19:05,110 --> 02:19:05,120
decreased
 

7591
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:07,589
decreased
the fourth fascinating thing was that a

7592
02:19:07,589 --> 02:19:07,599
the fourth fascinating thing was that a
 

7593
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:11,110
the fourth fascinating thing was that a
wake promoting chemical called erectin

7594
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:11,120
wake promoting chemical called erectin
 

7595
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:13,030
wake promoting chemical called erectin
increased and this is why a lot of

7596
02:19:13,030 --> 02:19:13,040
increased and this is why a lot of
 

7597
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:15,669
increased and this is why a lot of
people will say when i'm fasting it

7598
02:19:15,669 --> 02:19:15,679
people will say when i'm fasting it
 

7599
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:18,309
people will say when i'm fasting it
feels like i can stay awake for longer

7600
02:19:18,309 --> 02:19:18,319
feels like i can stay awake for longer
 

7601
02:19:18,319 --> 02:19:21,509
feels like i can stay awake for longer
and i can i'm more alert i'm more active

7602
02:19:21,509 --> 02:19:21,519
and i can i'm more alert i'm more active
 

7603
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:22,950
and i can i'm more alert i'm more active
and i'll come back to from an

7604
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:22,960
and i'll come back to from an
 

7605
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:24,389
and i'll come back to from an
evolutionary perspective why we

7606
02:19:24,389 --> 02:19:24,399
evolutionary perspective why we
 

7607
02:19:24,399 --> 02:19:26,549
evolutionary perspective why we
understand that to be the case

7608
02:19:26,549 --> 02:19:26,559
understand that to be the case
 

7609
02:19:26,559 --> 02:19:28,469
understand that to be the case
and then the fourth factor is that

7610
02:19:28,469 --> 02:19:28,479
and then the fourth factor is that
 

7611
02:19:28,479 --> 02:19:30,790
and then the fourth factor is that
fasting didn't decrease the amount of

7612
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:30,800
fasting didn't decrease the amount of
 

7613
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:33,190
fasting didn't decrease the amount of
deep sleep that seemed to be unaffected

7614
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:33,200
deep sleep that seemed to be unaffected
 

7615
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,429
deep sleep that seemed to be unaffected
it did however decrease the amount of

7616
02:19:35,429 --> 02:19:35,439
it did however decrease the amount of
 

7617
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:37,669
it did however decrease the amount of
rem sleep or dream sleep and we know

7618
02:19:37,669 --> 02:19:37,679
rem sleep or dream sleep and we know
 

7619
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:40,070
rem sleep or dream sleep and we know
that rem sleep dreaming is essential for

7620
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:40,080
that rem sleep dreaming is essential for
 

7621
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:42,469
that rem sleep dreaming is essential for
emotional first aid mental health it's

7622
02:19:42,469 --> 02:19:42,479
emotional first aid mental health it's
 

7623
02:19:42,479 --> 02:19:45,589
emotional first aid mental health it's
critical for memory creativity it's also

7624
02:19:45,589 --> 02:19:45,599
critical for memory creativity it's also
 

7625
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:47,349
critical for memory creativity it's also
critical for several hormone functions

7626
02:19:47,349 --> 02:19:47,359
critical for several hormone functions
 

7627
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:50,230
critical for several hormone functions
it's when you know if you there's direct

7628
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:50,240
it's when you know if you there's direct
 

7629
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:52,070
it's when you know if you there's direct
correlations between testosterone you

7630
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:52,080
correlations between testosterone you
 

7631
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:54,469
correlations between testosterone you
know testosterone release peaks just

7632
02:19:54,469 --> 02:19:54,479
know testosterone release peaks just
 

7633
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:56,150
know testosterone release peaks just
before you go into rem sleep and during

7634
02:19:56,150 --> 02:19:56,160
before you go into rem sleep and during
 

7635
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:57,910
before you go into rem sleep and during
rem sleep too

7636
02:19:57,910 --> 02:19:57,920
rem sleep too
 

7637
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:00,230
rem sleep too
so rem sleep is critical

7638
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:00,240
so rem sleep is critical
 

7639
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:02,230
so rem sleep is critical
but so those are the five changes that

7640
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:02,240
but so those are the five changes that
 

7641
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:04,150
but so those are the five changes that
we've seen none of them seem to be that

7642
02:20:04,150 --> 02:20:04,160
we've seen none of them seem to be that
 

7643
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:06,870
we've seen none of them seem to be that
advantageous for sleep but the fourth

7644
02:20:06,870 --> 02:20:06,880
advantageous for sleep but the fourth
 

7645
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:09,349
advantageous for sleep but the fourth
point that i mentioned which was orexin

7646
02:20:09,349 --> 02:20:09,359
point that i mentioned which was orexin
 

7647
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:12,150
point that i mentioned which was orexin
which is this wake promoting chemical

7648
02:20:12,150 --> 02:20:12,160
which is this wake promoting chemical
 

7649
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:14,309
which is this wake promoting chemical
and a good demonstration or a very sad

7650
02:20:14,309 --> 02:20:14,319
and a good demonstration or a very sad
 

7651
02:20:14,319 --> 02:20:16,630
and a good demonstration or a very sad
demonstration of its power is when it

7652
02:20:16,630 --> 02:20:16,640
demonstration of its power is when it
 

7653
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:18,950
demonstration of its power is when it
becomes very deficient in the brain and

7654
02:20:18,950 --> 02:20:18,960
becomes very deficient in the brain and
 

7655
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:20,150
becomes very deficient in the brain and
it leads to a condition called

7656
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:20,160
it leads to a condition called
 

7657
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:21,750
it leads to a condition called
narcolepsy

7658
02:20:21,750 --> 02:20:21,760
narcolepsy
 

7659
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:23,990
narcolepsy
where you know you

7660
02:20:23,990 --> 02:20:24,000
where you know you
 

7661
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,230
where you know you
you're just unpredictable with your

7662
02:20:26,230 --> 02:20:26,240
you're just unpredictable with your
 

7663
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,870
you're just unpredictable with your
sleep and you um so

7664
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:28,880
sleep and you um so
 

7665
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:30,469
sleep and you um so
um

7666
02:20:30,469 --> 02:20:30,479
um
 

7667
02:20:30,479 --> 02:20:31,990
um
so erection when it's in high

7668
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:32,000
so erection when it's in high
 

7669
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,309
so erection when it's in high
concentrations keeps you awake when you

7670
02:20:34,309 --> 02:20:34,319
concentrations keeps you awake when you
 

7671
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:37,270
concentrations keeps you awake when you
lose it it can you know it can put you

7672
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:37,280
lose it it can you know it can put you
 

7673
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:38,790
lose it it can you know it can put you
very much into a state of narcolepsy

7674
02:20:38,790 --> 02:20:38,800
very much into a state of narcolepsy
 

7675
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,870
very much into a state of narcolepsy
where you're sleeping a lot of the time

7676
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:40,880
where you're sleeping a lot of the time
 

7677
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:43,510
where you're sleeping a lot of the time
in unpredictable sleep

7678
02:20:43,510 --> 02:20:43,520
in unpredictable sleep
 

7679
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:46,469
in unpredictable sleep
why on earth when you are fasting

7680
02:20:46,469 --> 02:20:46,479
why on earth when you are fasting
 

7681
02:20:46,479 --> 02:20:50,070
why on earth when you are fasting
with the brain release awake promoting

7682
02:20:50,070 --> 02:20:50,080
with the brain release awake promoting
 

7683
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:51,510
with the brain release awake promoting
chemical

7684
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:51,520
chemical
 

7685
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:53,830
chemical
and our answer is right now is the

7686
02:20:53,830 --> 02:20:53,840
and our answer is right now is the
 

7687
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:55,910
and our answer is right now is the
following the one of the few times that

7688
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:55,920
following the one of the few times that
 

7689
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:58,309
following the one of the few times that
i mentioned before that we see animals

7690
02:20:58,309 --> 02:20:58,319
i mentioned before that we see animals
 

7691
02:20:58,319 --> 02:20:59,510
i mentioned before that we see animals
undergoing

7692
02:20:59,510 --> 02:20:59,520
undergoing
 

7693
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:01,750
undergoing
insufficient sleep or

7694
02:21:01,750 --> 02:21:01,760
insufficient sleep or
 

7695
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:03,910
insufficient sleep or
prolonged sleep deprivation is under

7696
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:03,920
prolonged sleep deprivation is under
 

7697
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:06,389
prolonged sleep deprivation is under
conditions of starvation

7698
02:21:06,389 --> 02:21:06,399
conditions of starvation
 

7699
02:21:06,399 --> 02:21:07,349
conditions of starvation
and

7700
02:21:07,349 --> 02:21:07,359
and
 

7701
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:09,510
and
that is an extreme

7702
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:09,520
that is an extreme
 

7703
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:12,230
that is an extreme
evolutionary pressure and at that point

7704
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,240
evolutionary pressure and at that point
 

7705
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:14,230
evolutionary pressure and at that point
the brain will forego some it won't

7706
02:21:14,230 --> 02:21:14,240
the brain will forego some it won't
 

7707
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:17,030
the brain will forego some it won't
forego all but it will forego some of

7708
02:21:17,030 --> 02:21:17,040
forego all but it will forego some of
 

7709
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,309
forego all but it will forego some of
its sleep

7710
02:21:18,309 --> 02:21:18,319
its sleep
 

7711
02:21:18,319 --> 02:21:20,070
its sleep
and the reason is so that it can stay

7712
02:21:20,070 --> 02:21:20,080
and the reason is so that it can stay
 

7713
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:21,990
and the reason is so that it can stay
awake for longer because the sign of

7714
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:22,000
awake for longer because the sign of
 

7715
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,550
awake for longer because the sign of
starvation is saying to the brain you

7716
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:24,560
starvation is saying to the brain you
 

7717
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:26,950
starvation is saying to the brain you
can't find food in your normal foraging

7718
02:21:26,950 --> 02:21:26,960
can't find food in your normal foraging
 

7719
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:29,030
can't find food in your normal foraging
perimeter you need to stay awake for

7720
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:29,040
perimeter you need to stay awake for
 

7721
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:30,950
perimeter you need to stay awake for
longer so you can travel outside of your

7722
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:30,960
longer so you can travel outside of your
 

7723
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:34,070
longer so you can travel outside of your
perimeter for a fur further distance and

7724
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:34,080
perimeter for a fur further distance and
 

7725
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:36,070
perimeter for a fur further distance and
maybe you will find food and save the

7726
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:36,080
maybe you will find food and save the
 

7727
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:37,110
maybe you will find food and save the
organism

7728
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:37,120
organism
 

7729
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,510
organism
so in other words when we fast

7730
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:39,520
so in other words when we fast
 

7731
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:42,950
so in other words when we fast
it's giving our brain this evolutionary

7732
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:42,960
it's giving our brain this evolutionary
 

7733
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:45,030
it's giving our brain this evolutionary
signal that you are under conditions of

7734

it's got to be really bad for you right
 

7867
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:12,950
it's got to be really bad for you right
because why is it so tasty right and i

think yeah
 

7871
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:15,750
think yeah
as we said

7872
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:15,760
as we said
 

7873
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:18,150
as we said
for with biology

7874
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:18,160
for with biology
 

7875
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:21,110
for with biology
you know if there's freeze again there's

7876
02:24:21,110 --> 02:24:21,120
you know if there's freeze again there's
 

7877
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:25,110
you know if there's freeze again there's
yeah there's often a cost too so

7878
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:25,120
yeah there's often a cost too so
 

7879
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:25,910
yeah there's often a cost too so
but

7880
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:25,920
but
 

7881
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,830
but
we at least understand the biological

7882
02:24:27,830 --> 02:24:27,840
we at least understand the biological
 

7883
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:29,349
we at least understand the biological
basis of what you're describing it's not

7884
02:24:29,349 --> 02:24:29,359
basis of what you're describing it's not
 

7885
02:24:29,359 --> 02:24:30,150
basis of what you're describing it's not
that

7886
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:30,160
that
 

7887
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:32,950
that
you you actually don't need less sleep

7888
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:32,960
you you actually don't need less sleep
 

7889
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:36,630
you you actually don't need less sleep
it's that this chemical is present that

7890
02:24:36,630 --> 02:24:36,640
it's that this chemical is present that
 

7891
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:39,670
it's that this chemical is present that
forces you more awake and so

7892
02:24:39,670 --> 02:24:39,680
forces you more awake and so
 

7893
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:42,230
forces you more awake and so
subjectively you feel as though i don't

7894
02:24:42,230 --> 02:24:42,240
subjectively you feel as though i don't
 

7895
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,910
subjectively you feel as though i don't
need as much sleep because i'm wide

7896
02:24:43,910 --> 02:24:43,920
need as much sleep because i'm wide
 

7897
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:45,030
need as much sleep because i'm wide
awake

7898
02:24:45,030 --> 02:24:45,040
awake
 

7899
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:47,670
awake
and those two things are quite different

7900
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:47,680
and those two things are quite different
 

7901
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:49,910
and those two things are quite different
it's not as though you your sleep need

7902
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:49,920
it's not as though you your sleep need
 

7903
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:52,630
it's not as though you your sleep need
has decreased it's that your brain has

7904
02:24:52,630 --> 02:24:52,640
has decreased it's that your brain has
 

7905
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:54,870
has decreased it's that your brain has
hit the overdrive switch the overboost

7906
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:54,880
hit the overdrive switch the overboost
 

7907
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:57,429
hit the overdrive switch the overboost
switch to say we need to keep you awake

7908
02:24:57,429 --> 02:24:57,439
switch to say we need to keep you awake
 

7909
02:24:57,439 --> 02:25:00,630
switch to say we need to keep you awake
because food is in short supply

7910
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:00,640
because food is in short supply
 

7911
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:02,550
because food is in short supply
so you mentioned uh during sleep there's

7912
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:02,560
so you mentioned uh during sleep there's
 

7913
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,070
so you mentioned uh during sleep there's
assimilation all those kinds of things

7914
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:04,080
assimilation all those kinds of things
 

7915
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:05,990
assimilation all those kinds of things
for learning purposes but there's also

7916
02:25:05,990 --> 02:25:06,000
for learning purposes but there's also
 

7917
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,070
for learning purposes but there's also
these uh you mentioned the five ways in

7918
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:08,080
these uh you mentioned the five ways in
 

7919
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:11,270
these uh you mentioned the five ways in
which we become psychotic in dreams

7920
02:25:11,270 --> 02:25:11,280
which we become psychotic in dreams
 

7921
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:12,710
which we become psychotic in dreams
what do you think

7922
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:12,720
what do you think
 

7923
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:14,630
what do you think
what do you think dreams are about

7924
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:14,640
what do you think dreams are about
 

7925
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,230
what do you think dreams are about
what

7926
02:25:16,230 --> 02:25:16,240
what
 

7927
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:18,550
what
why do you think we dream what

7928
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:18,560
why do you think we dream what
 

7929
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:20,950
why do you think we dream what
place do we go to when we dream

7930
02:25:20,950 --> 02:25:20,960
place do we go to when we dream
 

7931
02:25:20,960 --> 02:25:24,309
place do we go to when we dream
and why are they useful not just um not

7932
02:25:24,309 --> 02:25:24,319
and why are they useful not just um not
 

7933
02:25:24,319 --> 02:25:25,990
and why are they useful not just um not
just the assimilation aspect but just

7934
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:26,000
just the assimilation aspect but just
 

7935
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,230
just the assimilation aspect but just
like all the crazy visuals that we get

7936
02:25:28,230 --> 02:25:28,240
like all the crazy visuals that we get
 

7937
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:31,110
like all the crazy visuals that we get
with dreams is there something uh

7938
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:31,120
with dreams is there something uh
 

7939
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:33,190
with dreams is there something uh
you can speak to that's actually useful

7940
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:33,200
you can speak to that's actually useful
 

7941
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:35,910
you can speak to that's actually useful
like why we have such fun

7942
02:25:35,910 --> 02:25:35,920
like why we have such fun
 

7943
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:38,950
like why we have such fun
experiences in that dream world

7944
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:38,960
experiences in that dream world
 

7945
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:39,910
experiences in that dream world
so

7946
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:39,920
so
 

7947
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,429
so
one of the

7948
02:25:41,429 --> 02:25:41,439
one of the
 

7949
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:44,469
one of the
camps in the sleep field is that dreams

7950
02:25:44,469 --> 02:25:44,479
camps in the sleep field is that dreams
 

7951
02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:46,309
camps in the sleep field is that dreams
are meaningless

7952
02:25:46,309 --> 02:25:46,319
are meaningless
 

7953
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:48,630
are meaningless
that they are an epi phenomenal

7954
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:48,640
that they are an epi phenomenal
 

7955
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:51,349
that they are an epi phenomenal
byproduct of this thing called rem sleep

7956
02:25:51,349 --> 02:25:51,359
byproduct of this thing called rem sleep
 

7957
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:53,590
byproduct of this thing called rem sleep
from which dreams come from as a

7958
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:53,600
from which dreams come from as a
 

7959
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,349
from which dreams come from as a
physiological state

7960
02:25:55,349 --> 02:25:55,359
physiological state
 

7961
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:56,150
physiological state
so

7962
02:25:56,150 --> 02:25:56,160
so
 

7963
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:58,309
so
the analogy would be

7964
02:25:58,309 --> 02:25:58,319
the analogy would be
 

7965
02:25:58,319 --> 02:26:00,150
the analogy would be
let's think of a light bulb

7966
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:00,160
let's think of a light bulb
 

7967
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:02,150
let's think of a light bulb
that the reason that you create the

7968
02:26:02,150 --> 02:26:02,160
that the reason that you create the
 

7969
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,630
that the reason that you create the
apparatus of a light bulb is to produce

7970
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:04,640
apparatus of a light bulb is to produce
 

7971
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:06,870
apparatus of a light bulb is to produce
this thing called light in the same way

7972
02:26:06,870 --> 02:26:06,880
this thing called light in the same way
 

7973
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:09,429
this thing called light in the same way
that we we've evolved to this thing

7974
02:26:09,429 --> 02:26:09,439
that we we've evolved to this thing
 

7975
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:11,030
that we we've evolved to this thing
called rem sleep to serve whatever

7976
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:11,040
called rem sleep to serve whatever
 

7977
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:13,590
called rem sleep to serve whatever
functions rem sleep

7978
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:13,600
functions rem sleep
 

7979
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:15,510
functions rem sleep
but it turns out that when you create

7980
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:15,520
but it turns out that when you create
 

7981
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,910
but it turns out that when you create
light in that way you also produce

7982
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:17,920
light in that way you also produce
 

7983
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:19,670
light in that way you also produce
something called heat

7984
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:19,680
something called heat
 

7985
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:21,270
something called heat
it was never the reason that you

7986
02:26:21,270 --> 02:26:21,280
it was never the reason that you
 

7987
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,429
it was never the reason that you
designed the light bulb it's just what

7988
02:26:23,429 --> 02:26:23,439
designed the light bulb it's just what
 

7989
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:25,110
designed the light bulb it's just what
happens when you create light in that

7990
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:25,120
happens when you create light in that
 

7991
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:25,990
happens when you create light in that
way

7992
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:26,000
way
 

7993
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,030
way
and the belief so too was that dreaming

7994
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:29,040
and the belief so too was that dreaming
 

7995
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:30,950
and the belief so too was that dreaming
was essentially the heat of the light

7996
02:26:30,950 --> 02:26:30,960
was essentially the heat of the light
 

7997
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:32,150
was essentially the heat of the light
bulb

7998
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:32,160
bulb
 

7999
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:33,349
bulb
that

8000
02:26:33,349 --> 02:26:33,359
that
 

8001
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:35,750
that
rem sleep is critical but when you have

8002
02:26:35,750 --> 02:26:35,760
rem sleep is critical but when you have
 

8003
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:38,309
rem sleep is critical but when you have
rem sleep with a complex brain like ours

8004
02:26:38,309 --> 02:26:38,319
rem sleep with a complex brain like ours
 

8005
02:26:38,319 --> 02:26:41,110
rem sleep with a complex brain like ours
you also produce this conscious epi

8006
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:41,120
you also produce this conscious epi
 

8007
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:44,389
you also produce this conscious epi
phenomenon called dreaming

8008
02:26:44,389 --> 02:26:44,399
phenomenon called dreaming
 

8009
02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:46,950
phenomenon called dreaming
i don't believe that for a second

8010
02:26:46,950 --> 02:26:46,960
i don't believe that for a second
 

8011
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:49,510
i don't believe that for a second
uh i and from a simple perspective is

8012
02:26:49,510 --> 02:26:49,520
uh i and from a simple perspective is
 

8013
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:52,150
uh i and from a simple perspective is
that i suspect that dreaming is more

8014
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:52,160
that i suspect that dreaming is more
 

8015
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:55,030
that i suspect that dreaming is more
metabolically costly as a conscious

8016
02:26:55,030 --> 02:26:55,040
metabolically costly as a conscious
 

8017
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:57,030
metabolically costly as a conscious
experience than not dreaming so you

8018
02:26:57,030 --> 02:26:57,040
experience than not dreaming so you
 

8019
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:59,510
experience than not dreaming so you
could still have rem sleep but

8020
02:26:59,510 --> 02:26:59,520
could still have rem sleep but
 

8021
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:01,110
could still have rem sleep but
absent the conscious experience of

8022
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:01,120
absent the conscious experience of
 

8023
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:04,550
absent the conscious experience of
dreaming was probably less metabolically

8024
02:27:04,550 --> 02:27:04,560
dreaming was probably less metabolically
 

8025
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:07,429
dreaming was probably less metabolically
costly and whenever mother nature burns

8026
02:27:07,429 --> 02:27:07,439
costly and whenever mother nature burns
 

8027
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:10,870
costly and whenever mother nature burns
the energy unit called atp which is the

8028
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:10,880
the energy unit called atp which is the
 

8029
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:13,590
the energy unit called atp which is the
most valuable thing

8030
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:13,600
most valuable thing
 

8031
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,510
most valuable thing
there's usually a reason for it so if

8032
02:27:15,510 --> 02:27:15,520
there's usually a reason for it so if
 

8033
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:19,030
there's usually a reason for it so if
what if it's more energetically

8034
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:19,040
what if it's more energetically
 

8035
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:20,309
what if it's more energetically

then i suspect that there is a function

8038
02:27:22,150 --> 02:27:22,160
then i suspect that there is a function
 

8039
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,469
then i suspect that there is a function
to it and we've now since discovered

8040
02:27:24,469 --> 02:27:24,479
to it and we've now since discovered
 

8041
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:27,349
to it and we've now since discovered
that dreams have a function the first as

8042
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:27,359
that dreams have a function the first as
 

8043
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:30,389
that dreams have a function the first as
we mentioned creativity the second is

8044
02:27:30,389 --> 02:27:30,399
we mentioned creativity the second is
 

8045
02:27:30,399 --> 02:27:33,670
we mentioned creativity the second is
that dreams provide a form of overnight

8046
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:33,680
that dreams provide a form of overnight

dreaming is a form of emotional first

8050
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:37,600
dreaming is a form of emotional first

aid
 

8053
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:40,469
aid
and it's during dream sleep at night

8054
02:27:40,469 --> 02:27:40,479
and it's during dream sleep at night
 

8055
02:27:40,479 --> 02:27:42,630
and it's during dream sleep at night
that we take these difficult painful

8056
02:27:42,630 --> 02:27:42,640
that we take these difficult painful
 

8057
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:44,630
that we take these difficult painful
experiences that we've had during the

8058
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:44,640
experiences that we've had during the
 

8059
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:46,870
experiences that we've had during the
day sometimes traumatic

8060
02:27:46,870 --> 02:27:46,880
day sometimes traumatic
 

8061
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:49,110
day sometimes traumatic
and dream sleep acts almost like a

8062
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:49,120
and dream sleep acts almost like a
 

8063
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,190
and dream sleep acts almost like a
nocturnal soothing balm

8064
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,200
nocturnal soothing balm
 

8065
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,870
nocturnal soothing balm
and it sort of just takes the sharp

8066
02:27:52,870 --> 02:27:52,880
and it sort of just takes the sharp
 

8067
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:54,950
and it sort of just takes the sharp
edges off those difficult painful

8068
02:27:54,950 --> 02:27:54,960
edges off those difficult painful
 

8069
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:56,150
edges off those difficult painful
experiences

8070
02:27:56,150 --> 02:27:56,160
experiences
 

8071
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:58,469
experiences
so that you come back the next day

8072
02:27:58,469 --> 02:27:58,479
so that you come back the next day
 

8073
02:27:58,479 --> 02:28:00,150
so that you come back the next day
and you feel better

8074
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:00,160
and you feel better
 

8075
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:01,349
and you feel better
about them

8076
02:28:01,349 --> 02:28:01,359
about them
 

8077
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:03,910
about them
and so i think in that sense dreaming

8078
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:03,920
and so i think in that sense dreaming
 

8079
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:07,429
and so i think in that sense dreaming
it's not time that heals all wounds it's

8080
02:28:07,429 --> 02:28:07,439
it's not time that heals all wounds it's
 

8081
02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:10,070
it's not time that heals all wounds it's
time during dream sleep that provides

8082
02:28:10,070 --> 02:28:10,080
time during dream sleep that provides
 

8083
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:12,630
time during dream sleep that provides
emotional convalescence

8084
02:28:12,630 --> 02:28:12,640
emotional convalescence
 

8085
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:15,670
emotional convalescence
so dreaming is almost a form of you know

8086
02:28:15,670 --> 02:28:15,680
so dreaming is almost a form of you know
 

8087
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:19,750
so dreaming is almost a form of you know
emotional windscreen wipers

8088
02:28:19,750 --> 02:28:19,760

 

8089
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:20,950

and i think

8090
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:20,960
and i think
 

8091
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:23,510
and i think
and by the way it's not just

8092
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,520
and by the way it's not just
 

8093
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:25,590
and by the way it's not just
that you dream

8094
02:28:25,590 --> 02:28:25,600
that you dream
 

8095
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:28,790
that you dream
it's what you dream about that also

8096
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:28,800
it's what you dream about that also
 

8097
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:29,910
it's what you dream about that also
matters

8098
02:28:29,910 --> 02:28:29,920
matters
 

8099
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:31,590
matters
so for example scientists have done

8100
02:28:31,590 --> 02:28:31,600
so for example scientists have done
 

8101
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:33,190
so for example scientists have done
studies with learning and memory where

8102
02:28:33,190 --> 02:28:33,200
studies with learning and memory where
 

8103
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:33,910
studies with learning and memory where
they

8104
02:28:33,910 --> 02:28:33,920
they
 

8105
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:37,190
they
have people learn a virtual maze

8106
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:37,200
have people learn a virtual maze
 

8107
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:39,429
have people learn a virtual maze
and what they discovered was that

8108
02:28:39,429 --> 02:28:39,439
and what they discovered was that
 

8109
02:28:39,439 --> 02:28:41,750
and what they discovered was that
those people who then

8110
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:41,760
those people who then
 

8111
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,510
those people who then
dreamed but dreamed of the maze were the

8112
02:28:45,510 --> 02:28:45,520
dreamed but dreamed of the maze were the
 

8113
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:48,150
dreamed but dreamed of the maze were the
only ones who when they woke up ended up

8114
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:48,160
only ones who when they woke up ended up
 

8115
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:50,630
only ones who when they woke up ended up
being better at navigating the maze

8116
02:28:50,630 --> 02:28:50,640
being better at navigating the maze
 

8117
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:53,510
being better at navigating the maze
whereas those people who dreamed but

8118
02:28:53,510 --> 02:28:53,520
whereas those people who dreamed but
 

8119
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:55,990
whereas those people who dreamed but
didn't dream about the maze itself they

8120
02:28:55,990 --> 02:28:56,000
didn't dream about the maze itself they
 

8121
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,990
didn't dream about the maze itself they
were no better at navigating the maze so

8122
02:28:57,990 --> 02:28:58,000
were no better at navigating the maze so
 

8123
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,990
were no better at navigating the maze so
it's not just that you it's not it's

8124
02:28:59,990 --> 02:29:00,000
it's not just that you it's not it's
 

8125
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,309
it's not just that you it's not it's
sort of necessary but not sufficient

8126
02:29:02,309 --> 02:29:02,319
sort of necessary but not sufficient
 

8127
02:29:02,319 --> 02:29:04,710
sort of necessary but not sufficient
it's necessary that you dream but it's

8128
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:04,720
it's necessary that you dream but it's
 

8129
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:06,710
it's necessary that you dream but it's
not sufficient to produce the benefit

8130
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:06,720
not sufficient to produce the benefit
 

8131
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:08,550
not sufficient to produce the benefit
you have to be dreaming about certain

8132
02:29:08,550 --> 02:29:08,560
you have to be dreaming about certain
 

8133
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:11,590
you have to be dreaming about certain
things itself and the same is true for

8134
02:29:11,590 --> 02:29:11,600
things itself and the same is true for
 

8135
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:13,190
things itself and the same is true for
mental health

8136
02:29:13,190 --> 02:29:13,200
mental health
 

8137
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:14,790
mental health
what we've discovered is that people who

8138
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:14,800
what we've discovered is that people who
 

8139
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:16,150
what we've discovered is that people who
are going through a very difficult

8140
02:29:16,150 --> 02:29:16,160
are going through a very difficult
 

8141
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:18,630
are going through a very difficult
experience a trauma for example a very

8142
02:29:18,630 --> 02:29:18,640
experience a trauma for example a very
 

8143
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:21,110
experience a trauma for example a very
painful divorce

8144
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:21,120
painful divorce
 

8145
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:23,110
painful divorce
those people who are dreaming but

8146
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:23,120
those people who are dreaming but
 

8147
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:26,309
those people who are dreaming but
dreaming of that difficult event itself

8148
02:29:26,309 --> 02:29:26,319
dreaming of that difficult event itself
 

8149
02:29:26,319 --> 02:29:28,790
dreaming of that difficult event itself
they go on to gain resolution to their

8150
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:28,800
they go on to gain resolution to their
 

8151
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:31,030
they go on to gain resolution to their
clinical depression one year later

8152
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:31,040
clinical depression one year later
 

8153
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,510
clinical depression one year later
whereas people who were dreaming

8154
02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:33,520
whereas people who were dreaming
 

8155
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:36,150
whereas people who were dreaming
just as much but not dreaming about the

8156
02:29:36,150 --> 02:29:36,160
just as much but not dreaming about the
 

8157
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:39,429
just as much but not dreaming about the
trauma itself did not go on to gain as

8158
02:29:39,429 --> 02:29:39,439
trauma itself did not go on to gain as
 

8159
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:40,870
trauma itself did not go on to gain as
much clinical resolution to their

8160
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:40,880
much clinical resolution to their
 

8161
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:42,230
much clinical resolution to their
depression

8162
02:29:42,230 --> 02:29:42,240
depression
 

8163
02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:43,190
depression
so

8164
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:43,200
so
 

8165
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,150
so
it

8166
02:29:44,150 --> 02:29:44,160
it
 

8167
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:46,389
it
i think to me those are the lines of

8168
02:29:46,389 --> 02:29:46,399
i think to me those are the lines of
 

8169
02:29:46,399 --> 02:29:48,550
i think to me those are the lines of
evidence that tell me dreaming is not

8170
02:29:48,550 --> 02:29:48,560
evidence that tell me dreaming is not
 

8171
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:51,750
evidence that tell me dreaming is not
epi phenomenal and it's not just about

8172
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:51,760
epi phenomenal and it's not just about
 

8173
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:54,710
epi phenomenal and it's not just about
the act of dreaming it's about the

8174
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:54,720
the act of dreaming it's about the
 

8175
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:55,830
the act of dreaming it's about the
content

8176
02:29:55,830 --> 02:29:55,840
content
 

8177
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:58,230
content
of the dreams not just

8178
02:29:58,230 --> 02:29:58,240
of the dreams not just
 

8179
02:29:58,240 --> 02:30:00,950
of the dreams not just
the fact of a dream itself it's first of

8180
02:30:00,950 --> 02:30:00,960
the fact of a dream itself it's first of
 

8181
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,389
the fact of a dream itself it's first of
all it's fascinating it makes a lot of

8182
02:30:02,389 --> 02:30:02,399
all it's fascinating it makes a lot of
 

8183
02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:04,630
all it's fascinating it makes a lot of
sense but then immediately takes my mind

you know maybe you can correct me but i

see dreaming is a kind of simulation of

8208
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:29,760
see dreaming is a kind of simulation of

02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:31,349
see dreaming is a kind of simulation of
worlds

8210

worlds
 

8211

that are not constrained by physics
so like you you get a chance to take

8214
02:30:36,870 --> 02:30:36,880
so like you you get a chance to take
 

8215
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:38,150
so like you you get a chance to take
some of your memories some of your

like to to play with those worlds in a

02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:49,040
like to to play with those worlds in a
 

8227
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:51,030
like to to play with those worlds in a
safe environment of your mind

safe environment of your mind
 

8229
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:52,710
safe environment of your mind
safe in quotes because you can probably

safe in quotes because you can probably
get into a lot of trouble with

02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:54,640
get into a lot of trouble with
 

8233
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:57,990
get into a lot of trouble with
what the places your mind will go but

8234
02:30:57,990 --> 02:30:58,000
what the places your mind will go but
 

8235
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:58,830

02:37:22,550 --> 02:37:22,560
nor adrenaline is present
 

8577
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:23,670
nor adrenaline is present
but

8578
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:23,680
but
 

8579
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:25,190
but
when you go into rem sleep it is the

8580
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:25,200
when you go into rem sleep it is the
 

8581
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:27,030
when you go into rem sleep it is the
only time during the 24-hour period

8582
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:27,040
only time during the 24-hour period
 

8583
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:29,190
only time during the 24-hour period
where your brain is devoid of any

8584
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:29,200
where your brain is devoid of any
 

8585
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,590
where your brain is devoid of any
noradrenaline it is completely shut off

8586
02:37:31,590 --> 02:37:31,600
noradrenaline it is completely shut off
 

8587
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:33,990
noradrenaline it is completely shut off
and so the signal-to-noise ratio is very

8588
02:37:33,990 --> 02:37:34,000
and so the signal-to-noise ratio is very
 

8589
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,750
and so the signal-to-noise ratio is very
different it's almost as though we're

8590
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:35,760
different it's almost as though we're
 

8591
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:38,870
different it's almost as though we're
injecting a greater amount of noise into

8592
02:37:38,870 --> 02:37:38,880
injecting a greater amount of noise into
 

8593
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:40,870
injecting a greater amount of noise into
the neural architecture of the brain

8594
02:37:40,870 --> 02:37:40,880
the neural architecture of the brain
 

8595
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:44,230
the neural architecture of the brain
during dream sleep as if it's chemically

8596
02:37:44,230 --> 02:37:44,240
during dream sleep as if it's chemically
 

8597
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:47,349
during dream sleep as if it's chemically
brute forced into this relaxed

02:37:47,349 --> 02:37:47,359
brute forced into this relaxed
 

8599
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:50,710
brute forced into this relaxed
associative memory processing state and

8600
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:50,720
associative memory processing state and
 

8601
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:53,190
associative memory processing state and
then from an anatomical perspective just

8602
02:37:53,190 --> 02:37:53,200
then from an anatomical perspective just
 

8603
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:54,870
then from an anatomical perspective just
as i described the prefrontal cortex

8604
02:37:54,870 --> 02:37:54,880
as i described the prefrontal cortex
 

8605
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:56,070
as i described the prefrontal cortex
goes down

8606
02:37:56,070 --> 02:37:56,080
goes down
 

8607
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:58,469
goes down
and other regions light up

8608
02:37:58,469 --> 02:37:58,479
and other regions light up
 

8609
02:37:58,479 --> 02:38:01,590
and other regions light up
so it is a state that seems to be very i

8610
02:38:01,590 --> 02:38:01,600
so it is a state that seems to be very i
 

8611
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:05,110
so it is a state that seems to be very i
mean if you were to show me a brain scan

8612
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:05,120
mean if you were to show me a brain scan
 

8613
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:07,990
mean if you were to show me a brain scan
of rem sleep and and tell me that it's

8614
02:38:07,990 --> 02:38:08,000
of rem sleep and and tell me that it's
 

8615
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,309
of rem sleep and and tell me that it's
not rem sleep just say look based on the

8616
02:38:10,309 --> 02:38:10,319
not rem sleep just say look based on the
 

8617
02:38:10,319 --> 02:38:11,670
not rem sleep just say look based on the
pattern of this brain activity what

8618
02:38:11,670 --> 02:38:11,680
pattern of this brain activity what
 

8619
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:13,670
pattern of this brain activity what
would you say is going on in this

8620
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:13,680
would you say is going on in this
 

8621
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:15,429
would you say is going on in this
person's mind i would say well they're

8622
02:38:15,429 --> 02:38:15,439
person's mind i would say well they're
 

8623
02:38:15,439 --> 02:38:16,710
person's mind i would say well they're
probably not rational they're probably

8624
02:38:16,710 --> 02:38:16,720
probably not rational they're probably
 

8625
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:18,389
probably not rational they're probably
not having logical thought because their

8626
02:38:18,389 --> 02:38:18,399
not having logical thought because their
 

8627
02:38:18,399 --> 02:38:19,910
not having logical thought because their
prefrontal cortex is down they're

8628
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:19,920
prefrontal cortex is down they're
 

8629
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:21,590
prefrontal cortex is down they're
probably feeling very emotional because

8630
02:38:21,590 --> 02:38:21,600
probably feeling very emotional because
 

8631
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:23,830
probably feeling very emotional because
their amygdala is is active which is an

8632
02:38:23,830 --> 02:38:23,840
their amygdala is is active which is an
 

8633
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:25,510
their amygdala is is active which is an
emotional center of the brain they're

8634
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,520
emotional center of the brain they're
 

8635
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:27,190
emotional center of the brain they're
definitely going to be thinking visually

8636
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:27,200
definitely going to be thinking visually
 

8637
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:29,030
definitely going to be thinking visually
because the back of the brain is lit up

8638
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:29,040
because the back of the brain is lit up
 

8639
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:31,110
because the back of the brain is lit up
the visual cortex it's probably going to

8640
02:38:31,110 --> 02:38:31,120
the visual cortex it's probably going to
 

8641
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:33,830
the visual cortex it's probably going to
be filled with past experience

8642
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:33,840
be filled with past experience
 

8643
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:36,150
be filled with past experience
and autobiographical memories because

8644
02:38:36,150 --> 02:38:36,160
and autobiographical memories because
 

8645
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:37,349
and autobiographical memories because
their

8646
02:38:37,349 --> 02:38:37,359
their
 

8647
02:38:37,359 --> 02:38:39,510
their
their memory centers are lighting up and

8648
02:38:39,510 --> 02:38:39,520
their memory centers are lighting up and
 

8649
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:40,710
their memory centers are lighting up and
there's probably going to be movement

8650
02:38:40,710 --> 02:38:40,720
there's probably going to be movement
 

8651
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:42,309
there's probably going to be movement
because their motor cortex is very

8652
02:38:42,309 --> 02:38:42,319
because their motor cortex is very
 

8653
02:38:42,319 --> 02:38:43,830
because their motor cortex is very
active

8654
02:38:43,830 --> 02:38:43,840
active
 

8655
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:45,750
active
that to me sounds very much like a dream

8656
02:38:45,750 --> 02:38:45,760
that to me sounds very much like a dream
 

8657
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:47,349
that to me sounds very much like a dream
and it that's exactly what we see in

8658
02:38:47,349 --> 02:38:47,359
and it that's exactly what we see in
 

8659
02:38:47,359 --> 02:38:48,950
and it that's exactly what we see in
brain scanners when we put people inside

8660
02:38:48,950 --> 02:38:48,960
brain scanners when we put people inside
 

8661
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:50,309
brain scanners when we put people inside
of them

8662
02:38:50,309 --> 02:38:50,319
of them
 

8663
02:38:50,319 --> 02:38:52,070
of them
one of the things i

8664
02:38:52,070 --> 02:38:52,080
one of the things i
 

8665
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:53,030
one of the things i
notice

8666
02:38:53,030 --> 02:38:53,040
notice
 

8667
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:57,750
notice
sleep effects is uh my ability to see

8668
02:38:57,750 --> 02:38:57,760
sleep effects is uh my ability to see
 

8669
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:59,510
sleep effects is uh my ability to see
the beauty in the world

8670
02:38:59,510 --> 02:38:59,520
the beauty in the world
 

8671
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:00,950
the beauty in the world
yeah so

8672
02:39:00,950 --> 02:39:00,960
yeah so
 

8673
02:39:00,960 --> 02:39:02,150
yeah so
um

8674
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:02,160
um
 

8675
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:03,510
um
what do you think is the connection

8676
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:03,520
what do you think is the connection
 

8677
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:05,910
what do you think is the connection
between sleep in your emotional life

8678
02:39:05,910 --> 02:39:05,920
between sleep in your emotional life
 

8679
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:08,790
between sleep in your emotional life
your ability to love other human beings

8680
02:39:08,790 --> 02:39:08,800
your ability to love other human beings
 

8681
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:11,270
your ability to love other human beings
and love

8682
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:11,280
and love
 

8683
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,830
and love
life

8684
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:13,840

 

8685
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:15,349

yeah

8686
02:39:15,349 --> 02:39:15,359
yeah
 

8687
02:39:15,359 --> 02:39:17,349
yeah
i think it's

8688
02:39:17,349 --> 02:39:17,359
i think it's
 

8689
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:18,389
i think it's
it's very

8690
02:39:18,389 --> 02:39:18,399
it's very
 

8691
02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:20,710
it's very
powerful and strong so

8692
02:39:20,710 --> 02:39:20,720
powerful and strong so
 

8693
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:22,469
powerful and strong so
we've done a lot of work in the field of

8694
02:39:22,469 --> 02:39:22,479
we've done a lot of work in the field of
 

8695
02:39:22,479 --> 02:39:25,030
we've done a lot of work in the field of
sleep and emotion and sleeping moods and

8696
02:39:25,030 --> 02:39:25,040
sleep and emotion and sleeping moods and
 

8697
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:27,750
sleep and emotion and sleeping moods and
you can separate your emotions into two

8698
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:27,760
you can separate your emotions into two
 

8699
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:29,190
you can separate your emotions into two
main buckets

8700
02:39:29,190 --> 02:39:29,200
main buckets
 

8701
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:31,750
main buckets
um you know positive and negative

8702
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:31,760
um you know positive and negative
 

8703
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:34,070
um you know positive and negative
and what's interesting is that when you

8704
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:34,080
