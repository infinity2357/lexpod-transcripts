complexity that leads to the the
 

327
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,529
complexity that leads to the the
psychology that you are to have as an

328
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:51,539
psychology that you are to have as an
 

329
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,990
psychology that you are to have as an
adult but it's also the biology you come

330
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
adult but it's also the biology you come
 

331
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,290
adult but it's also the biology you come
with the the nature that you might not

332
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,300
with the the nature that you might not
 

333
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,090
with the the nature that you might not
just have the

334
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,100
just have the
 

335
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,029
just have the
the machine that can empathize deeply

336
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,039
the machine that can empathize deeply
 

337
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,610
the machine that can empathize deeply
with the experience of others or maybe a

338
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:04,620
with the experience of others or maybe a
 

339
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,550
with the experience of others or maybe a
machine that gets off gets a dopamine

340
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:07,560
machine that gets off gets a dopamine
 

341
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,590
machine that gets off gets a dopamine
Rush from the manipulation of other

342
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
Rush from the manipulation of other
 

343

00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:13,259
humans yeah I mean put an example of my
 

347
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,189
humans yeah I mean put an example of my
my own background uh my mom didn't have

348
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:16,199
my own background uh my mom didn't have

independent she showed me how to be
 

365
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,210
independent she showed me how to be
independent she showed me how to kind of

366
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,220
independent she showed me how to kind of
 

367
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,129
independent she showed me how to kind of
watch out for others and kind of build

watch out for others and kind of build
 

369
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,129
watch out for others and kind of build
me up in that way and uh I had a great

370
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:40,139
me up in that way and uh I had a great
 

371
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,350
me up in that way and uh I had a great
childhood as far as you know as far as

372
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:42,360
childhood as far as you know as far as
 

373
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,469
childhood as far as you know as far as
her and kind of like how she molded me

374
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:45,479
her and kind of like how she molded me
 

375
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,270
her and kind of like how she molded me
later on I figured out

376
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
later on I figured out
 

377
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,689
later on I figured out
that uh when I had my own kid

378
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:50,699
that uh when I had my own kid
 

379
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,390
that uh when I had my own kid
you know I I figured out that she was

380
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,400
you know I I figured out that she was
 

381
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,710
you know I I figured out that she was
basically trying to make me into what

382
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
basically trying to make me into what
 

383
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,870
basically trying to make me into what
she didn't have in a way

384
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
she didn't have in a way
 

385
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,969
she didn't have in a way
and if I can get to see somebody's

386
00:06:58,969 --> 00:06:58,979
and if I can get to see somebody's
 

387
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,249
and if I can get to see somebody's
parents you know that's usually a that's

388
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:01,259
parents you know that's usually a that's
 

389
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,469
parents you know that's usually a that's
usually a sign of uh of something at

390
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:03,479
usually a sign of uh of something at
 

391
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,210
usually a sign of uh of something at
least for me as far as figuring out

392
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,220
least for me as far as figuring out
 

393
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,950
least for me as far as figuring out
where people are I think there's

394
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
where people are I think there's
 

395
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,510
where people are I think there's
something to be said about nature and

396
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:08,520
something to be said about nature and
 

397
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,969
something to be said about nature and
nurture and how some people come up some

398
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:10,979
nurture and how some people come up some
 

399
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,710
nurture and how some people come up some
people are just born with that uh

400
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
people are just born with that uh
 

401
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,990
people are just born with that uh
predatory Instinct you know uh and

402
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,000
predatory Instinct you know uh and
 

403
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,550
predatory Instinct you know uh and
you'll never know I mean they spend

404
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
you'll never know I mean they spend
 

405
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,990
you'll never know I mean they spend
their whole life practicing how to hide

406
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
their whole life practicing how to hide
 

407
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,770
their whole life practicing how to hide
it

408
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:18,780
it
 

409
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,409
it
uh but if you can figure out somebody's

410
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:21,419
uh but if you can figure out somebody's
 

411
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,850
uh but if you can figure out somebody's
you know background childhood where

412
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:22,860
you know background childhood where
 

413
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,290
you know background childhood where
they're from you can kind of tell

414
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,300
they're from you can kind of tell
 

415
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,730
they're from you can kind of tell
something about them you know I'm from

416

something about them you know I'm from
 

417

something about them you know I'm from
Tijuana you know I'm a Survivor that's

418
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:27,960
Tijuana you know I'm a Survivor that's
 

419
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,450
Tijuana you know I'm a Survivor that's
that's my background as far as where I'm

420
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:29,460
that's my background as far as where I'm
 

421
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,290
that's my background as far as where I'm
from

422
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:30,300
from
 

423
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,490
from
uh culturally genetically

424
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:33,500
uh culturally genetically
 

425
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,150
uh culturally genetically
psychologically

426
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,160
psychologically
 

427
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,670
psychologically
the full shebang yeah I guess some

428
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
the full shebang yeah I guess some
 

429
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,550
the full shebang yeah I guess some
people are born with a certain

430
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:39,560
people are born with a certain
 

431
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,749
people are born with a certain
predispositions and if they're in the

432
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
predispositions and if they're in the
 

433
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,249
predispositions and if they're in the
right environment some of the negative

434
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:43,259
right environment some of the negative
 

435
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,930
right environment some of the negative
aspects might flourish more than others

436
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940
aspects might flourish more than others
 

437
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,730
aspects might flourish more than others
you know for me I mean I grew up

438
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:46,740
you know for me I mean I grew up
 

439
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,950

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
and I remember breaking into my first
 

443
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,809
and I remember breaking into my first
backyard pool it was a house that a

444
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:53,819
backyard pool it was a house that a
 

445
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,370
backyard pool it was a house that a
cartel guy owned and we used to escape

uh there was a recklessness to it you

766
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
uh there was a recklessness to it you
 

767
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,990
uh there was a recklessness to it you
know I I can see that now like now that

768
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,000
know I I can see that now like now that
 

769
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,329
know I I can see that now like now that
I have enough distance from it I could

770
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:35,339
I have enough distance from it I could
 

771
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,250
I have enough distance from it I could
see that there's a recklessness to being

772
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,260
see that there's a recklessness to being
 

773
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,129
see that there's a recklessness to being
that way uh and also you put in Jeopardy

774
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:40,139
that way uh and also you put in Jeopardy
 

775
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,889
that way uh and also you put in Jeopardy
people around you if you take that route

people around you if you take that route
 

777
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,990
people around you if you take that route
so I think there's a sacrifice to it a

778
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,000
so I think there's a sacrifice to it a
 

779
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,150
so I think there's a sacrifice to it a
very powerful and hard one to make for a

780
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,160
very powerful and hard one to make for a

1277
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,549
was going through there uh six months
then you get the reality check when you

1278
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:01,559
then you get the reality check when you
 

1279
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,070
then you get the reality check when you
sign the dotted line and how that none

1280
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
sign the dotted line and how that none
 

1281
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,890
sign the dotted line and how that none
of it really meant anything as far as

1282
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:06,900
of it really meant anything as far as
 

1283
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,930
of it really meant anything as far as
what we were about to go out and do you

1284
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:08,940
what we were about to go out and do you
 

1285
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,710
what we were about to go out and do you
know

1286
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:09,720
know
 

1287
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,330
know
uh

1288
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:11,340
uh
 

1289
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,250
uh
an example of this we were trained with

1290
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:13,260
an example of this we were trained with
 

1291
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,789
an example of this we were trained with
a 92 FS Beretta which is a nine

1292
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
a 92 FS Beretta which is a nine
 

1293
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,570
a 92 FS Beretta which is a nine
millimeter pistol uh Italian made

1294
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:20,580
millimeter pistol uh Italian made
 

1295
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,029
millimeter pistol uh Italian made
we got to shoot 20 rounds out of that

1296
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
we got to shoot 20 rounds out of that
 

1297
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,350
we got to shoot 20 rounds out of that
gun

1298
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,360
gun
 

1299
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,810
gun
and then we when we got out we were

1300
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:26,820
and then we when we got out we were
 

1301
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,430
and then we when we got out we were
handed a Glock uh 17 which

1302
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
handed a Glock uh 17 which
 

1303
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,710
handed a Glock uh 17 which
um I've never seen one in my life

1304
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:33,720
um I've never seen one in my life
 

1305
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,930
um I've never seen one in my life
I was uh trying to figure out where the

1306
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:35,940
I was uh trying to figure out where the
 

1307
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,909
I was uh trying to figure out where the
safety was and

1308
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
safety was and
 

1309
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,430
safety was and
a few other people there were uh

1310
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:40,440
a few other people there were uh
 

1311
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,190
a few other people there were uh
handling those guns in a horrible manner

1312
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
handling those guns in a horrible manner
 

1313
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,090
handling those guns in a horrible manner
um

1314
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,100
um
 

1315
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,370
um
uh so we were very under trained under

1316
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,380
uh so we were very under trained under
 

1317
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,570
uh so we were very under trained under
equipped and there was a lot of

1318
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:47,580
equipped and there was a lot of
 

1319
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,250
equipped and there was a lot of
assumptions about what we knew and all

1320
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,260
assumptions about what we knew and all
 

1321
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,930
assumptions about what we knew and all
of a sudden we were being cast into this

1322
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:50,940
of a sudden we were being cast into this
 

1323
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,529
of a sudden we were being cast into this
the in the start of one of the

1324
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:54,539
the in the start of one of the
 

1325
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,690
the in the start of one of the
you know bloodiest and longest lived

1326
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:56,700
you know bloodiest and longest lived
 

1327
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,570
you know bloodiest and longest lived
modern conflicts in our history that

1328
00:23:59,570 --> 00:23:59,580
modern conflicts in our history that
 

1329
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,490
modern conflicts in our history that
doesn't get called that but it's it's

1330
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:01,500
doesn't get called that but it's it's
 

1331

that uh
 

1335
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,789
that uh
that is still to this day you know

1336
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:07,799
that is still to this day you know

there
 

1495
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,390
there
uh I don't have a current estimate but

1496
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:11,400
uh I don't have a current estimate but
 

1497
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,890
uh I don't have a current estimate but
last time I checked it was somewhere

1498
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:12,900
last time I checked it was somewhere
 

1499
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,430
last time I checked it was somewhere
where in the vicinity of 50 to 70 the

1500
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:16,440
where in the vicinity of 50 to 70 the
 

1501
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,529
where in the vicinity of 50 to 70 the
different groups some small that just

1502
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:18,539
different groups some small that just
 

1503
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,029
different groups some small that just
dedicate themselves to a single little

1504
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:20,039
dedicate themselves to a single little
 

1505
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,310

town somewhere there are armed groups
that are basically in control of that

1508
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
that are basically in control of that
 

1509
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,730
that are basically in control of that
area to some bigger federations like the

1510
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:25,740
area to some bigger federations like the
 

1511
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,130
area to some bigger federations like the
Sinaloa cartel which is probably

1512
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,140
Sinaloa cartel which is probably
 

1513
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,049
Sinaloa cartel which is probably
currently the largest and most powerful

1514
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,059
currently the largest and most powerful
 

1515
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,490
currently the largest and most powerful
one in Mexico

1516
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,500
one in Mexico
 

1517
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,649
one in Mexico
and the new generation cartel which is

and the new generation cartel which is
growing exponentially right now

1520
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:36,679
growing exponentially right now
 

1521
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,890
growing exponentially right now
so these criminal groups are are players

1522
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:39,900
so these criminal groups are are players

craft it's a tree craft it's straight
 

1809
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,389
craft it's a tree craft it's straight
it's it's tradecraft and it's uh it

1810
00:32:59,389 --> 00:32:59,399
it's it's tradecraft and it's uh it
 

1811

there's there's a link to the EOS as far

1812
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,140
there's there's a link to the EOS as far
 

1813
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,570
there's there's a link to the EOS as far
as having that trade graph you have to

1814
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:02,580
as having that trade graph you have to
 

1815
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,090
as having that trade graph you have to
remember that uh the United States had a

1816
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,100
remember that uh the United States had a
 

1817
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,130
remember that uh the United States had a
thing called School of the Americas and

1818
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,140
thing called School of the Americas and
 

1819
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,269
thing called School of the Americas and
and the CIA and they showed things and a

and the CIA and they showed things and a
lot of that stuff is out there in the

1822
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:13,500
lot of that stuff is out there in the
 

1823
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,230
lot of that stuff is out there in the
hands of people that are of that

1824
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,240
hands of people that are of that
 

1825
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,310
hands of people that are of that
generation

1826
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
generation
 

1827
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,769
generation
so yeah there's a manual there's a

1828
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:18,779
so yeah there's a manual there's a
 

1829
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,049
so yeah there's a manual there's a
manual sign uh like with chapters and

1830
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:21,059
manual sign uh like with chapters and
 

1831
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,310
manual sign uh like with chapters and
it's like how to get rid of the body

1832
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,320
it's like how to get rid of the body
 

1833
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,470
it's like how to get rid of the body
there's manuals out there under time

1834
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
there's manuals out there under time
 

1835
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,909
there's manuals out there under time
constraints or what what are how

1836
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
constraints or what what are how
 

1837
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,470
constraints or what what are how
identifiable can the body be afterwards

1838
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
identifiable can the body be afterwards
 

1839
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,169
identifiable can the body be afterwards
what what a geographical constraints all

1840
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:33,179
what what a geographical constraints all
 

1841
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,669
what what a geographical constraints all
that kind of stuff I think I think that

1842
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:34,679
that kind of stuff I think I think that
 

1843
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,549
that kind of stuff I think I think that
was common back in the early 2000s uh

1844
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:37,559
was common back in the early 2000s uh
 

1845
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,590
was common back in the early 2000s uh
and maybe the late 90s when some of

1846
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:39,600
and maybe the late 90s when some of
 

1847
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,029
and maybe the late 90s when some of
these things were going on

1848
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
these things were going on
 

1849
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,029
these things were going on
but they've lost even that as far as

1850
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:44,039
but they've lost even that as far as
 

1851
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,070
but they've lost even that as far as
respect for the government or bodies

1852
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,080
respect for the government or bodies
 

1853

respect for the government or bodies
being found right now you what you

1854
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:47,820
being found right now you what you
 

1855
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,610
being found right now you what you
usually see is just bodies being burnt

going through training some people get
pulled out during training because they

1936
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,280

1937
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,010
pulled out during training because they
were found out to have some sort of

1938

00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:26,760
check came back negative you know when
 

1945
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,310
check came back negative you know when
they were already in the training

1946
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,320
they were already in the training
 

1947
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,230
they were already in the training
program

1948
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,240
program
 

1949
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,950
program
um so I I think part of it is

1950
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:33,960
um so I I think part of it is
 

1951
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,290
um so I I think part of it is
first off they take advantage of the

1952
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,300
first off they take advantage of the
 

1953
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,030
first off they take advantage of the
fact that Mexico is a young country it's

1954
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,040
fact that Mexico is a young country it's
 

1955
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,650
fact that Mexico is a young country it's
a country of young people

1956
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:39,660
a country of young people
 

1957
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,250
a country of young people
um

1958
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:40,260

groups
um so they have this going for them they

1976
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:00,780
um so they have this going for them they
 

1977
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,390
um so they have this going for them they
basically have a lot of bodies to to to

1978
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
basically have a lot of bodies to to to
 

1979

hire cheaply and leverage in terms of uh
 

1981
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,349
hire cheaply and leverage in terms of uh
forcing those bodies to do whatever is

1982
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
forcing those bodies to do whatever is
 

1983
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,849
forcing those bodies to do whatever is
needed because the alternative for those

1984
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:10,859
needed because the alternative for those
 

1985
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,890
needed because the alternative for those
people is is nothing there's no options

1986
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:12,900
people is is nothing there's no options

think that some of that that meeting was
about film rights and and stories and

00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:35,700
about film rights and and stories and

if it's I wasn't there but I suspect
 

3141
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:44,030
if it's I wasn't there but I suspect
that some of that was going on

3142
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:44,040
that some of that was going on
 

3143
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,150
that some of that was going on
if you can bring an honest voice down

there they can trust to put that out
 

3147
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,829
there they can trust to put that out
there you know I mean

interested in that kind of thing I
um because ultimately in some of those

3154
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:58,380
um because ultimately in some of those
 

3155
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,829
um because ultimately in some of those
places like

3156
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:00,839
places like
 

3157
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:04,010
places like
inside a cartel at the very top is when

3158
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:04,020
inside a cartel at the very top is when
 

3159
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,670
inside a cartel at the very top is when
you can really look at the raw aspects

3160

you can really look at the raw aspects
 

3161
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,890
you can really look at the raw aspects

basically dropping explosives uh they
 

3805
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:20,330
basically dropping explosives uh they
found some explosive testing ranges out

3806
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:20,340
found some explosive testing ranges out
 

3807
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,310
found some explosive testing ranges out
there that are basically replicating

3808
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:22,320
there that are basically replicating
 

3809
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,169
there that are basically replicating
stuff that you would see the IRA use

3810
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:24,179
stuff that you would see the IRA use
 

3811
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:26,090
stuff that you would see the IRA use
during the con during the troubles out

3812
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:26,100
during the con during the troubles out
 

3813
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:29,090
during the con during the troubles out
there from homemade mortars

3814
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:29,100
there from homemade mortars
 

3815
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,890
there from homemade mortars
um you know IEDs have been used in

3816
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:30,900
um you know IEDs have been used in
 

3817
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,410
um you know IEDs have been used in
Mexico that not that much but they're

3818
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:33,420
Mexico that not that much but they're
 

3819
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,450
Mexico that not that much but they're
they're making like a presence again you

3820
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:35,460
they're making like a presence again you
 

3821
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,709
they're making like a presence again you
know we don't have a lot of ordinance

3822
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:36,719
know we don't have a lot of ordinance
 

3823
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,169
know we don't have a lot of ordinance
around like Iraq but we do have a big

3824
01:10:39,169 --> 01:10:39,179
around like Iraq but we do have a big
 

3825
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:41,510
around like Iraq but we do have a big
mining industry down there so mining

3826
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:41,520
mining industry down there so mining
 

3827
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,490
mining industry down there so mining
mining explosives of all kinds are

3828
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:43,500
mining explosives of all kinds are
 

3829
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,930
mining explosives of all kinds are
pretty easy to get

3830
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:44,940
pretty easy to get
 

3831
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:48,530
pretty easy to get
so you start seeing that and also I mean

3832
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:48,540
so you start seeing that and also I mean
 

3833
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,330
so you start seeing that and also I mean
there's some exotic Weaponry coming in

3834
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:50,340
there's some exotic Weaponry coming in
 

3835
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,250
there's some exotic Weaponry coming in
from the south now and from the ocean

3836
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:52,260
from the south now and from the ocean
 

3837
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:56,090
from the south now and from the ocean
now that some of it is probably a U.S

3838
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:56,100
now that some of it is probably a U.S
 

3839
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,910
now that some of it is probably a U.S
military equipment sold to various South

American governments that are now
not as stable as they were and they're

3844
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:03,540
not as stable as they were and they're
 

3845
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,729
not as stable as they were and they're
kind of making their way into black

3846
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:04,739
kind of making their way into black
 

3847

missiles that you that have been found
 

3857
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,669
missiles that you that have been found
in cartel hands are probably come making

3858
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:19,679
in cartel hands are probably come making
 

3859
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,770
in cartel hands are probably come making
their way up from down south to get

3860
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:21,780
their way up from down south to get
 

3861
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,810
their way up from down south to get
these like multi-million dollar systems

3862
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:23,820
these like multi-million dollar systems
 

3863
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,669
these like multi-million dollar systems
like the high Mar system in the in the

3864
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
like the high Mar system in the in the
 

3865
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,830

Ukraine you get like super sophisticated

3866
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
Ukraine you get like super sophisticated
 

3867
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,169
Ukraine you get like super sophisticated
advanced technology or we're not so like

3868
01:11:30,169 --> 01:11:30,179
advanced technology or we're not so like
 

3869
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:32,330

this is like military grade I'm not sure

3870
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:32,340
this is like military grade I'm not sure
 

3871
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,950
this is like military grade I'm not sure
what the applications would be exactly

3872
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:33,960
what the applications would be exactly
 

3873
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,729
what the applications would be exactly
in Mexico some are sophisticated stuff I

3874
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:37,739
in Mexico some are sophisticated stuff I
 

3875
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:39,470
in Mexico some are sophisticated stuff I
see in our man pads which is basically

3876
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:39,480
see in our man pads which is basically
 

3877
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,870
see in our man pads which is basically
remote guided missiles I've seen some of

3878
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:41,880
remote guided missiles I've seen some of
 

3879
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,189
remote guided missiles I've seen some of
those found out what is the application

3880
01:11:43,189 --> 01:11:43,199
those found out what is the application
 

3881
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,110
those found out what is the application
exactly

3882
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
exactly
 

3883
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,990
exactly
a display of power there are no-fly

3884
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
a display of power there are no-fly
 

3885
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,030
a display of power there are no-fly
zones over parts of Mexico

3886
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:50,040
zones over parts of Mexico
 

3887
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,250
zones over parts of Mexico
for this reason the new generation

3888
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:52,260
for this reason the new generation
 

3889
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:56,270
for this reason the new generation
cartel took down a helicopter

helicopters falling from the sky and it
 

3895
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:02,689
helicopters falling from the sky and it
it they said that it was mechanical

3896
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:02,699
it they said that it was mechanical
 

3897
01:12:02,699 --> 01:12:03,709
it they said that it was mechanical
issues

3898
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:03,719
issues
 

3899
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:07,010
issues
but again I'm not I'm not gonna do

3900
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:07,020
but again I'm not I'm not gonna do
 

3901
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,689
but again I'm not I'm not gonna do
conspiracy theories out there but

3902
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:08,699
conspiracy theories out there but
 

3903
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,030
conspiracy theories out there but
there's there's a lot of videos on Tick

3904
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
there's there's a lot of videos on Tick
 

3905
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,090
there's there's a lot of videos on Tick
Tock of uh Cena Laura cartel forces at

3906
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:14,100
Tock of uh Cena Laura cartel forces at
 

3907
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,910
Tock of uh Cena Laura cartel forces at
parties you know carrying around uh

3908
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:16,920
parties you know carrying around uh
 

3909
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,709
parties you know carrying around uh
rocket launchers on their backs and you

3910
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:18,719
rocket launchers on their backs and you
 

3911
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,229
rocket launchers on their backs and you
know and so so there's an increased

3912
01:12:21,229 --> 01:12:21,239
know and so so there's an increased
 

3913
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:23,390
know and so so there's an increased
probability of mechanical failures over

3914
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:23,400
probability of mechanical failures over
 

3915
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,669
probability of mechanical failures over
those areas when you're flying a

3916
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
those areas when you're flying a
 

3917
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,709
those areas when you're flying a
helicopter yeah there's no fly zones

3918
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:27,719
helicopter yeah there's no fly zones
 

3919
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,770
helicopter yeah there's no fly zones
over certain parts of Mexico okay and uh

3920
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:30,780
over certain parts of Mexico okay and uh
 

3921
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,510
over certain parts of Mexico okay and uh
um another thing you're seeing now is

3922
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:32,520
um another thing you're seeing now is
 

3923
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,430
um another thing you're seeing now is
night vision uh night vision equipment

3924
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:34,440
night vision uh night vision equipment
 

3925
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,430
night vision uh night vision equipment
uh that is clearly military grade from

3926
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:37,440
uh that is clearly military grade from
 

3927
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,890
uh that is clearly military grade from
the US that was probably abandoned in

3928
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:39,900
the US that was probably abandoned in
 

3929
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,870
the US that was probably abandoned in
some War Field out there so maybe

3930
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:41,880
some War Field out there so maybe
 

3931
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,450
some War Field out there so maybe
Afghanistan or somewhere like that and

3932

Afghanistan or somewhere like that and
 

3933
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,610
Afghanistan or somewhere like that and
it's uh it's being found in safe houses

3934
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:46,620
it's uh it's being found in safe houses
 

3935
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,830
it's uh it's being found in safe houses
and in the hands of cartel forces you

3936
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:48,840
and in the hands of cartel forces you
 

3937
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,470
and in the hands of cartel forces you
want to talk about a scary opponent

3938
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:51,480
want to talk about a scary opponent

capabilities are now out there

3944
01:12:59,390 --> 01:12:59,400
capabilities are now out there
 

3945
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,510
capabilities are now out there

01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:11,940
laughed at them because
 

3959
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:14,750
laughed at them because
the 50 cal or anything like that without

3960
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:14,760
the 50 cal or anything like that without
 

3961
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,390
the 50 cal or anything like that without
an optic on it you know is like you're

3962
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:17,400
an optic on it you know is like you're
 

3963
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,010
an optic on it you know is like you're
gonna shoot you're praying shoot

3964
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:19,020
gonna shoot you're praying shoot
 

3965
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,209
gonna shoot you're praying shoot
basically see if you can hit anything

3966
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:20,219
basically see if you can hit anything
 

3967
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:24,110
basically see if you can hit anything
with it uh but now there's a a few of my

3968
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:24,120
with it uh but now there's a a few of my
 

3969
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,390
with it uh but now there's a a few of my
sources I've seen you know sophisticated

3970
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:26,400
sources I've seen you know sophisticated
 

3971
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,930
sources I've seen you know sophisticated
uh laser-guided uh rangefinders and and

3972
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:29,940
uh laser-guided uh rangefinders and and
 

3973
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,669
uh laser-guided uh rangefinders and and
sighting systems on some of these that

3974
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
sighting systems on some of these that
 

3975
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,470
sighting systems on some of these that
are being found out there how much

3976
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:33,480
are being found out there how much
 

3977
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,689
are being found out there how much
damage can 50 cal what's the application

3978
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:35,699
damage can 50 cal what's the application
 

3979
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:37,669

they started getting them specifically

3980
01:13:37,669 --> 01:13:37,679
they started getting them specifically
 

3981
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,709
they started getting them specifically
with the proliferation of armored

3982
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:39,719
with the proliferation of armored
 

3983
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:41,689
with the proliferation of armored
vehicles in Mexico Mexico has a giant

vehicles in Mexico Mexico has a giant
 

3985
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:43,370
vehicles in Mexico Mexico has a giant
industry and armored vehicles as far as

3986
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:43,380
industry and armored vehicles as far as
 

3987
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,950
industry and armored vehicles as far as
so there's a race in terms of uh

3988
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:45,960
so there's a race in terms of uh
 

3989
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,410
so there's a race in terms of uh
armoring like protecting especially high

3990
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:48,420
armoring like protecting especially high
 

3991
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:53,149
armoring like protecting especially high
value targets and then weapons they can

3992
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:53,159
value targets and then weapons they can
 

3993
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:55,910
value targets and then weapons they can
deal with those armored protected high

3994
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:55,920
deal with those armored protected high
 

3995
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,430
deal with those armored protected high
value targets there was a an attempted

3996
01:13:58,430 --> 01:13:58,440
value targets there was a an attempted
 

3997
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,189

assassination of a state prosecutor
 

3999
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,990
assassination of a state prosecutor
somewhere in I think central Mexico I

4000
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:03,000
somewhere in I think central Mexico I
 

4001
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,550
somewhere in I think central Mexico I
forget exactly where but she was uh

4002
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,560
forget exactly where but she was uh
 

4003
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,270
forget exactly where but she was uh
riding around up armored uh Jeep

4004
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:08,280
riding around up armored uh Jeep
 

4005
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,510
riding around up armored uh Jeep
uh Cherokee I think it was and their

4006
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
uh Cherokee I think it was and their
 

4007
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,570
uh Cherokee I think it was and their
main means of of uh Firepower was 50

4008
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:14,580
main means of of uh Firepower was 50
 

4009
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:18,530

cows and that car was left in pieces he

4010
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:18,540
cows and that car was left in pieces he
 

4011
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,630
cows and that car was left in pieces he
survived in it so I think the armored

4012
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:20,640
survived in it so I think the armored
 

4013
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,370
survived in it so I think the armored
vehicle company that sold her that

4014

vehicle company that sold her that
 

4015

violated by the people that I was
 

4571
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:37,250
violated by the people that I was
replacing so I had to gain that back

analyze two routes and then on the Fly
 

4731
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,290
analyze two routes and then on the Fly
you just change

4732
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:27,300
you just change
 

4733
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:31,450
you just change
trajectory to to create Randomness an

4734
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:31,460
trajectory to to create Randomness an
 

4735

trajectory to to create Randomness an
unpredictability and have that as a

4736
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:34,260
unpredictability and have that as a
 

4737
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:36,290

pretty strict schedule and being a
little bit off in terms of timing just

little bit off in terms of timing just
 

4763
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,790
little bit off in terms of timing just
like showing up 15 minutes late or to a

amazing counter Ambush team you have to
you know you have to make them ambushers

4798
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:42,000
you know you have to make them ambushers
 

4799
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,209
you know you have to make them ambushers
and with ambushing you

4800
01:28:44,209 --> 01:28:44,219
and with ambushing you
 

4801
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:47,030
and with ambushing you
figure out where all the opportunities

4802
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:47,040
figure out where all the opportunities
 

4803

down there but uh
we start learning about some of these

4820
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:03,060
we start learning about some of these
 

4821
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,790
we start learning about some of these
things and also seeing you know cartel

talking about so that's a surprise
attack with an asymmetry power kind of

4832
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,400
attack with an asymmetry power kind of
 

4833
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,669
attack with an asymmetry power kind of
thing there's a contingency somewhere

4834

and own where you have the advantages
 

4839
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,270
and own where you have the advantages
where they can't see you but you can't

where they can't see you but you can't
see you can see them where they can't

4842
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:25,080
see you can see them where they can't
 

4843
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,810
see you can see them where they can't
predict you but you can predict where

4844
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:26,820
predict you but you can predict where
 

4845
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,490
predict you but you can predict where
they're going to pass go through you

4846

they're going to pass go through you
know places where they forcibly have to

4848
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:30,120
know places where they forcibly have to
 

4849
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:30,890
know places where they forcibly have to

pass
 

4851
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,870
pass
uh places where they're predictable

4852
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
uh places where they're predictable
 

4853
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,810
uh places where they're predictable
places where you can not only predict

4854
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:35,820
places where you can not only predict
 

4855
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,790
places where you can not only predict
but also have a plan for yourself to

4856
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:37,800
but also have a plan for yourself to
 

4857
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,310
but also have a plan for yourself to
escape and exit that place so how do you

4858
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
escape and exit that place so how do you
 

4859
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,770
escape and exit that place so how do you
transfer Connor Ambush you turn into a

4860
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:42,780
transfer Connor Ambush you turn into a
 

4861
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,810
transfer Connor Ambush you turn into a
like a perfect ambusher that's how you

4862
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:44,820
like a perfect ambusher that's how you
 

4863
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,669
like a perfect ambusher that's how you
train for camera also always trying to

4864
01:29:46,669 --> 01:29:46,679
train for camera also always trying to
 

4865
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:47,930
train for camera also always trying to
make sure you have more information

4866
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:47,940
make sure you have more information
 

4867
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,689
make sure you have more information
about other people you have the element

4868
01:29:50,689 --> 01:29:50,699
about other people you have the element
 

4869
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:52,669
about other people you have the element
of surprise all of those things and

4870
01:29:52,669 --> 01:29:52,679
of surprise all of those things and
 

4871
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:54,229
of surprise all of those things and
Musashi would say you know your enemy

4872
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:54,239
Musashi would say you know your enemy
 

4873
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,149
Musashi would say you know your enemy
know his sword you know but basically

4874
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
know his sword you know but basically
 

4875
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,910
know his sword you know but basically
that you know simplified there's a lot

4876
01:29:58,910 --> 01:29:58,920
that you know simplified there's a lot
 

4877
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,669
that you know simplified there's a lot
of enemies around you in Mexico there's

4878
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:01,679
of enemies around you in Mexico there's
 

4879
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,709
of enemies around you in Mexico there's
a lot of uncertainty right because it's

4880
01:30:03,709 --> 01:30:03,719
a lot of uncertainty right because it's
 

4881
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:05,629
a lot of uncertainty right because it's
well I guess that's what route analysis

4882
01:30:05,629 --> 01:30:05,639
well I guess that's what route analysis
 

4883
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:07,850
well I guess that's what route analysis
is yeah you prepare for the probable

prerequisite is to see the enemy in the
same way you see the enemy when you play

focus on the uh
 

7127
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:54,109
focus on the uh
this is a system and this is a way but

7128
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:54,119
this is a system and this is a way but
 

7129
02:13:54,119 --> 02:13:55,490
this is a system and this is a way but
there's other ways out there that might

7130
02:13:55,490 --> 02:13:55,500
there's other ways out there that might
 

7131
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:57,470
there's other ways out there that might
negate or defeat the ways that you are

7132
02:13:57,470 --> 02:13:57,480
negate or defeat the ways that you are
 

7133

so kind of get out of that bubble my

7136
02:14:02,089 --> 02:14:02,099
so kind of get out of that bubble my
 

7137
02:14:02,099 --> 02:14:04,850
so kind of get out of that bubble my
whole kind of specialty or what I focus

whole kind of specialty or what I focus
 

7139
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:07,310
whole kind of specialty or what I focus
on is mindset and figuring out the

7140
02:14:07,310 --> 02:14:07,320
on is mindset and figuring out the
 

7141
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:08,930
on is mindset and figuring out the
software that some of these people gain

7142
02:14:08,930 --> 02:14:08,940
software that some of these people gain
 

7143
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:11,149
software that some of these people gain
and gather from

7144
02:14:11,149 --> 02:14:11,159
and gather from
 

7145
02:14:11,159 --> 02:14:13,669
and gather from
if I need to arm myself you know the

7146
02:14:13,669 --> 02:14:13,679
if I need to arm myself you know the
 

7147
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:15,109
if I need to arm myself you know the
easiest thing to manufacture in most

7148
02:14:15,109 --> 02:14:15,119
easiest thing to manufacture in most
 

7149
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:17,930
easiest thing to manufacture in most
places is a pointed object so I can take

7150
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:17,940
places is a pointed object so I can take
 

7151
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:19,669
places is a pointed object so I can take
that Crystal big pen that you're writing

7152
02:14:19,669 --> 02:14:19,679
that Crystal big pen that you're writing
 

7153
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:22,550
that Crystal big pen that you're writing
on that notepad with and using the

7154
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:22,560
on that notepad with and using the
 

7155
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:23,930
on that notepad with and using the
friction from the carpet I can turn it

7156
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:23,940
friction from the carpet I can turn it
 

7157
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:26,390
friction from the carpet I can turn it
into a hypodermic needle that you can

7158
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:26,400
into a hypodermic needle that you can
 

7159
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:27,770
into a hypodermic needle that you can
then poke into somebody's neck what's

7160
02:14:27,770 --> 02:14:27,780
then poke into somebody's neck what's
 

7161
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:29,510
then poke into somebody's neck what's
the process of doing that so I can do it

7162
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:29,520
the process of doing that so I can do it
 

7163
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:31,609
the process of doing that so I can do it
right now if you want no but can you can

7164
02:14:31,609 --> 02:14:31,619
right now if you want no but can you can
 

7165
02:14:31,619 --> 02:14:33,169
right now if you want no but can you can
you use your words for The Listener and

7166
02:14:33,169 --> 02:14:33,179
you use your words for The Listener and
 

7167
02:14:33,179 --> 02:14:35,510
you use your words for The Listener and
also because I'm terrified I know I

7168
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:35,520
also because I'm terrified I know I
 

7169
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,129
also because I'm terrified I know I
could basically you can take the

7170
02:14:37,129 --> 02:14:37,139
could basically you can take the
 

7171
02:14:37,139 --> 02:14:38,810
could basically you can take the
friction the the Heat and friction

7172
02:14:38,810 --> 02:14:38,820
friction the the Heat and friction
 

7173
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:40,729
friction the the Heat and friction
created from this carpet yes you can

7174
02:14:40,729 --> 02:14:40,739
created from this carpet yes you can
 

7175
02:14:40,739 --> 02:14:43,129
created from this carpet yes you can
grab that pen in and of itself it will

7176
02:14:43,129 --> 02:14:43,139
grab that pen in and of itself it will
 

7177
02:14:43,139 --> 02:14:45,050
grab that pen in and of itself it will
pierce flesh but it will slow itself

7178
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:45,060
pierce flesh but it will slow itself
 

7179
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:47,689
pierce flesh but it will slow itself
down because it has a few uh angles on

7180
02:14:47,689 --> 02:14:47,699
down because it has a few uh angles on
 

7181
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:49,370
down because it has a few uh angles on
to the on the tip oh you want to wear

7182
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:49,380
to the on the tip oh you want to wear
 

7183
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:51,470
to the on the tip oh you want to wear
down the angles so if you take that tip

7184
02:14:51,470 --> 02:14:51,480
down the angles so if you take that tip
 

7185
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:53,870
down the angles so if you take that tip
off and you grab it and grind it on an

7186
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:53,880
off and you grab it and grind it on an
 

7187
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:55,669
off and you grab it and grind it on an
angle on the carpet the heat will

7188
02:14:55,669 --> 02:14:55,679
angle on the carpet the heat will
 

7189
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:57,589
angle on the carpet the heat will
actually turn it into a hypodermic

7190
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:57,599
actually turn it into a hypodermic
 

7191
02:14:57,599 --> 02:14:59,270
actually turn it into a hypodermic
needle if you know what you're doing I

7192
02:14:59,270 --> 02:14:59,280
needle if you know what you're doing I
 

7193
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,770
needle if you know what you're doing I
have a dermic meaning like it's it

7194
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:00,780
have a dermic meaning like it's it
 

7195
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:03,169
have a dermic meaning like it's it
smoothens the entry it'll make a point

7196
02:15:03,169 --> 02:15:03,179
smoothens the entry it'll make a point
 

7197
02:15:03,179 --> 02:15:05,270
smoothens the entry it'll make a point
and an angle that will guide its way

7198
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:05,280
and an angle that will guide its way
 

7199
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,069
and an angle that will guide its way
into your flesh so you can actually go

7200
02:15:07,069 --> 02:15:07,079
into your flesh so you can actually go
 

7201
02:15:07,079 --> 02:15:08,990
into your flesh so you can actually go
through a torso with that if you know

7202
02:15:08,990 --> 02:15:09,000
through a torso with that if you know
 

7203

non-magnetic non-ferrous objects that
 

7229
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:42,290
non-magnetic non-ferrous objects that
can be utilized as a stabbing implement

7230
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:42,300
can be utilized as a stabbing implement
 

7231
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:46,010
can be utilized as a stabbing implement
uh the core of it isn't uh isn't an

7232
02:15:46,010 --> 02:15:46,020
uh the core of it isn't uh isn't an
 

7233
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:48,169
uh the core of it isn't uh isn't an
actual pencil core it's a G10 core and

7234
02:15:48,169 --> 02:15:48,179
actual pencil core it's a G10 core and
 

7235
02:15:48,179 --> 02:15:52,550
actual pencil core it's a G10 core and
it's uh encased in uh Oak hard Oak

7236

it's uh encased in uh Oak hard Oak
 

7237
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,589
it's uh encased in uh Oak hard Oak
so that is capable again of stabbing

7238
02:15:54,589 --> 02:15:54,599
so that is capable again of stabbing
 

7239
02:15:54,599 --> 02:15:57,109
so that is capable again of stabbing
through a torso now the guy that made

7240
02:15:57,109 --> 02:15:57,119
through a torso now the guy that made
 

7241
02:15:57,119 --> 02:15:59,870
through a torso now the guy that made
that uh is an Hardison you know it makes

7242
02:15:59,870 --> 02:15:59,880
that uh is an Hardison you know it makes
 

7243
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:01,430
that uh is an Hardison you know it makes
that it looks like a pencil it's

7244
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:01,440
that it looks like a pencil it's
 

7245
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,770
that it looks like a pencil it's
concealed in in the nature of the object

um you know all it takes is about the
 

7255
02:16:14,699 --> 02:16:16,550
um you know all it takes is about the
half of your thumb or the length of your

thinking about it in a full and on all
the dimensions of it you know you know

7412
02:19:14,389 --> 02:19:14,399
the dimensions of it you know you know
 

7413
02:19:14,399 --> 02:19:16,849
the dimensions of it you know you know
there's there's all weapon all knowledge

7414
02:19:16,849 --> 02:19:16,859
there's there's all weapon all knowledge
 

7415
02:19:16,859 --> 02:19:18,889
there's there's all weapon all knowledge
can be weaponized and I think that's the

7416
02:19:18,889 --> 02:19:18,899
can be weaponized and I think that's the
 

7417
02:19:18,899 --> 02:19:21,290
can be weaponized and I think that's the
approach to all people should kind of

7418
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:21,300
approach to all people should kind of
 

7419
02:19:21,300 --> 02:19:22,610
approach to all people should kind of
figure out for themselves when they

7420
02:19:22,610 --> 02:19:22,620
figure out for themselves when they
 

7421
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:25,129
figure out for themselves when they
start getting ready or if they want to

7422
02:19:25,129 --> 02:19:25,139
start getting ready or if they want to
 

7423
02:19:25,139 --> 02:19:26,450
start getting ready or if they want to
take the responsibility of their own

7424
02:19:26,450 --> 02:19:26,460
take the responsibility of their own
 

7425
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:28,190
take the responsibility of their own
safety in their hands so in a

7426
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:28,200
safety in their hands so in a
 

7427
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:29,690
safety in their hands so in a
self-defense situation there's a lot of

7428
02:19:29,690 --> 02:19:29,700
self-defense situation there's a lot of
 

7429
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:31,370
self-defense situation there's a lot of
questions here but what what does one

7430
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:31,380
questions here but what what does one
 

7431
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:32,270
questions here but what what does one

7437
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:38,750
arteries which are used commonly in Jiu
Jitsu as something to choke because they

Jitsu as something to choke because they
 

7439
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:41,209
Jitsu as something to choke because they
feed a computer you know so there's a

02:19:41,209 --> 02:19:41,219
feed a computer you know so there's a
 

7441
02:19:41,219 --> 02:19:43,370
feed a computer you know so there's a
lot of blood flowing through that

7442
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:43,380
lot of blood flowing through that
 

7443

02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:51,840
carotid arteries that's a really weird
 

7451
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:54,830
carotid arteries that's a really weird
design by the way it is not a smart one

7452
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:54,840
design by the way it is not a smart one
 

7453
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:56,330
design by the way it is not a smart one
it doesn't even make sense because with

7454
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:56,340
it doesn't even make sense because with
 

7455
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:57,770
it doesn't even make sense because with
mammals they bite each other's and act

7456
02:19:57,770 --> 02:19:57,780
mammals they bite each other's and act
 

7457
02:19:57,780 --> 02:19:59,750
mammals they bite each other's and act
like why can't you have more

7458
02:19:59,750 --> 02:19:59,760
like why can't you have more
 

7459
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:02,150
like why can't you have more
protection because this is the only like

7460
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:02,160
protection because this is the only like
 

7461
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:04,370
protection because this is the only like
us humans don't use their mouth to kill

7462
02:20:04,370 --> 02:20:04,380
us humans don't use their mouth to kill
 

7463
02:20:04,380 --> 02:20:06,349
us humans don't use their mouth to kill
each other but most mammals most

7464
02:20:06,349 --> 02:20:06,359
each other but most mammals most
 

7465
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:08,450

predators do it's like why the hell

7466
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:08,460
predators do it's like why the hell
 

7467
02:20:08,460 --> 02:20:10,310
predators do it's like why the hell
don't we protect this we do have a

7468
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:10,320
don't we protect this we do have a
 

7469
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:12,590
don't we protect this we do have a
defensive mechanism and you you see it

7470
02:20:12,590 --> 02:20:12,600
defensive mechanism and you you see it
 

7471
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:14,090
defensive mechanism and you you see it
sometimes when people are ambushed and

7472
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:14,100
sometimes when people are ambushed and
 

7473
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:15,950
sometimes when people are ambushed and
people try to open up each other's necks

7474
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:15,960
people try to open up each other's necks
 

7475
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:17,210
people try to open up each other's necks
from behind

7476
02:20:17,210 --> 02:20:17,220
from behind
 

7477
02:20:17,220 --> 02:20:20,270
from behind
if you push somebody's neck forward the

7478
02:20:20,270 --> 02:20:20,280
if you push somebody's neck forward the
 

7479
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:22,610
if you push somebody's neck forward the
carotids will actually lower themselves

7480
02:20:22,610 --> 02:20:22,620
carotids will actually lower themselves
 

7481
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:24,469
carotids will actually lower themselves
and be encased in more flesh and muscle

7482
02:20:24,469 --> 02:20:24,479
and be encased in more flesh and muscle
 

7483
02:20:24,479 --> 02:20:28,670
and be encased in more flesh and muscle
if you pull a head back not so much so

7484
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:28,680
if you pull a head back not so much so
 

7485
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,830
if you pull a head back not so much so
that's a way that at least I think the

7486
02:20:30,830 --> 02:20:30,840
that's a way that at least I think the
 

7487
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:33,050
that's a way that at least I think the
evolutionary we've have a defensive

7488
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:33,060
evolutionary we've have a defensive
 

7489
02:20:33,060 --> 02:20:35,450
evolutionary we've have a defensive
mechanism for that uh there's a few

7490
02:20:35,450 --> 02:20:35,460
mechanism for that uh there's a few
 

7491
02:20:35,460 --> 02:20:37,610
mechanism for that uh there's a few
videos out there of people's getting

7492
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:37,620
videos out there of people's getting
 

7493
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:40,010
videos out there of people's getting
their neck sewn back shut after somebody

7494
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:40,020
their neck sewn back shut after somebody
 

7495
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:41,510
their neck sewn back shut after somebody
pushed their head forward to try and

7496
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:41,520
pushed their head forward to try and
 

7497
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:43,429
pushed their head forward to try and
slice their necks and they survived you

7498
02:20:43,429 --> 02:20:43,439
slice their necks and they survived you
 

7499
02:20:43,439 --> 02:20:44,630
slice their necks and they survived you
know

7500
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:44,640
know
 

7501
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:48,110
know
um so this is a viable Target uh the

7502
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:48,120
um so this is a viable Target uh the
 

7503
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:50,450
um so this is a viable Target uh the
heart is another one interesting about

7504
02:20:50,450 --> 02:20:50,460
heart is another one interesting about
 

7505
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:52,190
heart is another one interesting about
the thing about the heart and people get

7506
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:52,200
the thing about the heart and people get
 

7507
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:54,050
the thing about the heart and people get
alarmed when I talk about this and show

7508
02:20:54,050 --> 02:20:54,060
alarmed when I talk about this and show
 

7509
02:20:54,060 --> 02:20:55,730
alarmed when I talk about this and show
it in classes

7510
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:55,740
it in classes
 

7511
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:58,370
it in classes
uh again a lot of the classes I do are

7512
02:20:58,370 --> 02:20:58,380
uh again a lot of the classes I do are
 

7513
02:20:58,380 --> 02:21:00,950
uh again a lot of the classes I do are
for orientation and to for people to

7514
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:00,960
for orientation and to for people to
 

7515
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:03,590
for orientation and to for people to
recognize that behavior so a lot of law

7516
02:21:03,590 --> 02:21:03,600
recognize that behavior so a lot of law
 

7517
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:04,910
recognize that behavior so a lot of law
enforcement comes to some of these

7518
02:21:04,910 --> 02:21:04,920
enforcement comes to some of these
 

7519
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:07,309
enforcement comes to some of these
classes though oh that's horrible

7520
02:21:07,309 --> 02:21:07,319
classes though oh that's horrible
 

7521
02:21:07,319 --> 02:21:08,750
classes though oh that's horrible
that's how somebody will kill somebody

7522
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:08,760
that's how somebody will kill somebody
 

7523
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,429
that's how somebody will kill somebody
yeah this is how people that know their

7524
02:21:10,429 --> 02:21:10,439
yeah this is how people that know their
 

7525
02:21:10,439 --> 02:21:12,469
yeah this is how people that know their
thing their [\h__\h] will try and approach

7526
02:21:12,469 --> 02:21:12,479
thing their [\h__\h] will try and approach
 

7527
02:21:12,479 --> 02:21:14,330
thing their [\h__\h] will try and approach
somebody and stab you to death This Is

7528
02:21:14,330 --> 02:21:14,340
somebody and stab you to death This Is
 

7529
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:15,710
somebody and stab you to death This Is
How They would do it

7530
02:21:15,710 --> 02:21:15,720
How They would do it
 

7531
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:17,750
How They would do it
uh there's a tendency to

7532
02:21:17,750 --> 02:21:17,760
uh there's a tendency to
 

7533
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:20,030
uh there's a tendency to
view what we see in John Wick or view

7534
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:20,040
view what we see in John Wick or view
 

7535
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:22,309
view what we see in John Wick or view
what we see in uh this martial arts

7536
02:21:22,309 --> 02:21:22,319
what we see in uh this martial arts

Community where they're you know slicing

7538
02:21:24,110 --> 02:21:24,120
Community where they're you know slicing
 

7539
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:26,330
Community where they're you know slicing
and dicing people different myriadders

7540
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:26,340
and dicing people different myriadders
 

7541
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:27,410
and dicing people different myriadders
of ways

7542
02:21:27,410 --> 02:21:27,420
of ways
 

7543
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:29,510
of ways
a lot of that is based on dueling based

7544
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:29,520
a lot of that is based on dueling based
 

7545
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:32,030
a lot of that is based on dueling based
cultures like the Filipino martial arts

7546
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:32,040
cultures like the Filipino martial arts
 

7547
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:34,429
cultures like the Filipino martial arts
or some of the Italian martial arts out

7548
02:21:34,429 --> 02:21:34,439
or some of the Italian martial arts out
 

7549
02:21:34,439 --> 02:21:36,170
or some of the Italian martial arts out
there where somebody's facing off with

7550
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:36,180
there where somebody's facing off with
 

7551
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:37,490
there where somebody's facing off with
somebody else with a similar weapon

7552
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:37,500
somebody else with a similar weapon
 

7553
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:39,590
somebody else with a similar weapon
where both of us are agreeing to

7554
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:39,600
where both of us are agreeing to
 

7555
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:40,730
where both of us are agreeing to
basically get into a stabbing

7556
02:21:40,730 --> 02:21:40,740
basically get into a stabbing
 

7557
02:21:40,740 --> 02:21:42,469
basically get into a stabbing
competition

7558
02:21:42,469 --> 02:21:42,479
competition
 

7559
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:44,870
competition
that would make sense in that scenario

7560
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:44,880
that would make sense in that scenario
 

7561
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:46,790
that would make sense in that scenario
in that context but I've never seen a

7562
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:46,800
in that context but I've never seen a
 

7563
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,170
in that context but I've never seen a
lot of people actually get into these

7564
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:48,180
lot of people actually get into these
 

7565
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:50,750
lot of people actually get into these
one-on-one knife altercations

7566

one-on-one knife altercations
 

7567
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:52,969
one-on-one knife altercations

this example every now and then where I

7662
02:23:35,389 --> 02:23:35,399
this example every now and then where I
 

7663
02:23:35,399 --> 02:23:37,190
this example every now and then where I
have people bring in a

7664

have people bring in a
 

7665
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:39,290

butter knife and I asked them which will
go through a torso we have a pig there

7670

go through a torso we have a pig there
 

7671
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:45,889
go through a torso we have a pig there
so it simulates a torso pretty closely

7672
02:23:45,889 --> 02:23:45,899
so it simulates a torso pretty closely

02:23:55,319 --> 02:23:57,290
that'll go through
um kitchen knife

7684
02:23:57,290 --> 02:23:57,300
um kitchen knife
 

7685
02:23:57,300 --> 02:24:00,889

7689
02:24:04,319 --> 02:24:06,469
a Walmart and a expensive 400 one yeah
and the the cheap one will outperform

and the the cheap one will outperform
 

7691
02:24:06,479 --> 02:24:08,570
and the the cheap one will outperform
the expensive ones the tip will snap off

small uh tangent I went to farm
 

7699
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:20,270
small uh tangent I went to farm
and uh just seeing the butchering of

me and pigs and cows
that's uncomfortable yeah but I think it

that's uncomfortable yeah but I think it
 

7707
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:32,870
that's uncomfortable yeah but I think it
also it's honest and raw and like that's

7708
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:32,880
also it's honest and raw and like that's
 

7709
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:34,309
also it's honest and raw and like that's
something that probably everyone should

7710
02:24:34,309 --> 02:24:34,319
something that probably everyone should
 

7711
02:24:34,319 --> 02:24:37,250
something that probably everyone should
experience regularly uh

7712
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:37,260
experience regularly uh
 

7713
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:39,950

carried him he's like 200 something

7724
02:24:53,090 --> 02:24:53,100
carried him he's like 200 something
 

7725
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:55,910
carried him he's like 200 something
pounds and it said to carry him I had to

7726
02:24:55,910 --> 02:24:55,920
pounds and it said to carry him I had to
 

7727
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:58,490
pounds and it said to carry him I had to
put him to sleep and like one of the

put him to sleep and like one of the
 

7729
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:01,010
put him to sleep and like one of the
biggest realizations is like oh this is

7730
02:25:01,010 --> 02:25:01,020
biggest realizations is like oh this is
 

7731
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:02,090
biggest realizations is like oh this is
just a

7732
02:25:02,090 --> 02:25:02,100
just a
 

7733
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:04,370
just a
this is just a biological thing yeah

7734
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:04,380
this is just a biological thing yeah
 

7735
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:07,250
this is just a biological thing yeah
it's just and then to to realize that

7736
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:07,260
it's just and then to to realize that
 

7737
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:08,630
it's just and then to to realize that
this is just meat

7738

this is just meat
 

7739
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:11,270
this is just meat
this is not and you can cut it

02:25:11,270 --> 02:25:11,280
this is not and you can cut it
 

7741
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:13,550
this is not and you can cut it
and then you if you bleed you all sudden

7742

and then you if you bleed you all sudden
 

7743

you know people would come back from
 

7761
02:25:31,979 --> 02:25:33,590
you know people would come back from
battling we would hear things next to

02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:33,600
battling we would hear things next to
 

7763
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:34,610
battling we would hear things next to
the campfire

this happens but now we live in an age
 

7769
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:39,530
this happens but now we live in an age
where you can you know when I do a class

7770
02:25:39,530 --> 02:25:39,540
where you can you know when I do a class
 

7771
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:42,290
where you can you know when I do a class
I this is this is a stab to the heart

7772
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:42,300
I this is this is a stab to the heart
 

7773
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:44,809
I this is this is a stab to the heart
and here's like five videos of it

7774
02:25:44,809 --> 02:25:44,819
and here's like five videos of it
 

7775
02:25:44,819 --> 02:25:47,570
and here's like five videos of it
happening live you know on live leaks or

7776
02:25:47,570 --> 02:25:47,580
happening live you know on live leaks or
 

7777
02:25:47,580 --> 02:25:49,610
happening live you know on live leaks or
whatever and we can deconstruct that not

7778
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:49,620
whatever and we can deconstruct that not
 

7779
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:53,090
whatever and we can deconstruct that not
only that but what weapon was used oh it

7780
02:25:53,090 --> 02:25:53,100
only that but what weapon was used oh it
 

7781
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:55,429
only that but what weapon was used oh it
was a gas station folder it was a

7782
02:25:55,429 --> 02:25:55,439
was a gas station folder it was a
 

7783
02:25:55,439 --> 02:25:57,590
was a gas station folder it was a
Pioneer Woman knife from Walmart with

Pioneer Woman knife from Walmart with
flowers on the handle you know whatever

7786
02:25:59,389 --> 02:25:59,399
flowers on the handle you know whatever
 

7787
02:25:59,399 --> 02:26:02,630
flowers on the handle you know whatever
it was uh and people start realizing

7788
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:02,640
it was uh and people start realizing
 

7789
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:04,630
it was uh and people start realizing
that it doesn't take a lot

7790
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:04,640
that it doesn't take a lot
 

7791
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:06,650
that it doesn't take a lot
that it doesn't take a lot of training

7792
02:26:06,650 --> 02:26:06,660
that it doesn't take a lot of training
 

7793
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:08,150
that it doesn't take a lot of training
because a lot of these people are not

7794
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,160
because a lot of these people are not
 

7795
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:11,330
because a lot of these people are not
high level assassins trained by ninjas

7796
02:26:11,330 --> 02:26:11,340
high level assassins trained by ninjas
 

7797
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:12,710
high level assassins trained by ninjas
in the Hills or anything like that there

7798
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
in the Hills or anything like that there
 

7799
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,330
in the Hills or anything like that there
are people that you know grew up rurally

7800
02:26:14,330 --> 02:26:14,340
are people that you know grew up rurally
 

7801
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:16,490
are people that you know grew up rurally
or learned by seeing that behavior in

7802
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:16,500
or learned by seeing that behavior in
 

7803
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:18,469
or learned by seeing that behavior in
others

7804
02:26:18,469 --> 02:26:18,479
others
 

7805
02:26:18,479 --> 02:26:19,670
others
and when they start coming to the

7806
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:19,680
and when they start coming to the
 

7807
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:21,590
and when they start coming to the
realization that it's pretty easy to do

7808
02:26:21,590 --> 02:26:21,600
realization that it's pretty easy to do
 

7809
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:22,969
realization that it's pretty easy to do
that and they start figuring out like

7810
02:26:22,969 --> 02:26:22,979
that and they start figuring out like
 

7811
02:26:22,979 --> 02:26:24,469
that and they start figuring out like
how do you counteract that well number

7812
02:26:24,469 --> 02:26:24,479
how do you counteract that well number
 

7813
02:26:24,479 --> 02:26:26,450
how do you counteract that well number
one learn the behavior yourself so you

7814
02:26:26,450 --> 02:26:26,460
one learn the behavior yourself so you
 

7815
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:27,950
one learn the behavior yourself so you
can recognize it the whole aspect of

7816
02:26:27,950 --> 02:26:27,960
can recognize it the whole aspect of
 

7817
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:30,290
can recognize it the whole aspect of
being a good counter Ambush team is to

7818
02:26:30,290 --> 02:26:30,300
being a good counter Ambush team is to
 

7819
02:26:30,300 --> 02:26:32,150
being a good counter Ambush team is to
be a best the best ambusher in the

7820
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:32,160
be a best the best ambusher in the
 

7821
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:33,050
be a best the best ambusher in the
planet

7822
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:33,060
planet
 

7823
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:35,510
planet
so again the whole aspect of Musashi

7824
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,520
so again the whole aspect of Musashi
 

7825
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:37,130
so again the whole aspect of Musashi
saying know your enemy know his sword

7826
02:26:37,130 --> 02:26:37,140
saying know your enemy know his sword
 

7827
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:39,410
saying know your enemy know his sword
you know you figure that out as far as

7828
02:26:39,410 --> 02:26:39,420
you know you figure that out as far as
 

7829
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:40,910
you know you figure that out as far as
learning that behavior

7830
02:26:40,910 --> 02:26:40,920
learning that behavior
 

7831
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:42,950
learning that behavior
you know when you start seeing how some

7832
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:42,960
you know when you start seeing how some
 

7833
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:45,349
you know when you start seeing how some
of these stabbings occurred occur the

7834
02:26:45,349 --> 02:26:45,359
of these stabbings occurred occur the
 

7835
02:26:45,359 --> 02:26:47,030
of these stabbings occurred occur the
first thing you notice is that one of

7836
02:26:47,030 --> 02:26:47,040
first thing you notice is that one of
 

7837
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:48,770
first thing you notice is that one of
one of the hands is always kind of out

7838
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:48,780
one of the hands is always kind of out
 

7839
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:50,330
one of the hands is always kind of out
of the picture or there's a lack of

7840
02:26:50,330 --> 02:26:50,340
of the picture or there's a lack of
 

7841
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:51,950
of the picture or there's a lack of
symmetry in the people that are about to

7842
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:51,960
symmetry in the people that are about to
 

7843
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:53,570
symmetry in the people that are about to
do something horrible

7844
02:26:53,570 --> 02:26:53,580
do something horrible
 

7845
02:26:53,580 --> 02:26:55,670
do something horrible
so when you see lack of symmetry in the

7846
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:55,680
so when you see lack of symmetry in the
 

7847
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:57,110
so when you see lack of symmetry in the
environment somebody with their hands

7848
02:26:57,110 --> 02:26:57,120
environment somebody with their hands
 

7849
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:58,910
environment somebody with their hands
going backwards

7850
02:26:58,910 --> 02:26:58,920
going backwards
 

7851
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:00,710
going backwards
um there's a crowd of people and some

7852
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:00,720
um there's a crowd of people and some
 

7853
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:03,650

7855
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:07,550
and and two or one individual is looking
counter where everybody else is looking

7856
02:27:07,550 --> 02:27:07,560
counter where everybody else is looking
 

7857
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:10,070
counter where everybody else is looking
or there's a hyper-aware individual in

7858
02:27:10,070 --> 02:27:10,080
or there's a hyper-aware individual in
 

7859
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:13,309
or there's a hyper-aware individual in
the crowd uh the hyper aware are always

7860
02:27:13,309 --> 02:27:13,319
the crowd uh the hyper aware are always
 

7861
02:27:13,319 --> 02:27:15,650
the crowd uh the hyper aware are always
usually out there to [\h__\h] somebody over

7862
02:27:15,650 --> 02:27:15,660
usually out there to [\h__\h] somebody over
 

7863
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:17,990
usually out there to [\h__\h] somebody over
or are there trying to keep those

7864
02:27:17,990 --> 02:27:18,000
or are there trying to keep those
 

7865
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,429
or are there trying to keep those

Predators from plucking somebody else
 

7867
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:21,830
Predators from plucking somebody else
over so

unless you step back and you put
 

7871
02:27:24,180 --> 02:27:25,790
unless you step back and you put
yourself in the process of learning how

7872
02:27:25,790 --> 02:27:25,800
yourself in the process of learning how
 

7873
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:29,210
yourself in the process of learning how
they learn and you become that potential

7874
02:27:29,210 --> 02:27:29,220
they learn and you become that potential
 

7875
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:31,250
they learn and you become that potential

02:27:31,250 --> 02:27:31,260
nightmare person it's hard to recognize
 

7877
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:34,990
nightmare person it's hard to recognize
that in a crowd it feels like one of the

7878
02:27:34,990 --> 02:27:35,000

aspect of me showing how some of these
 

8195
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:26,809
aspect of me showing how some of these
things

8196
02:33:26,809 --> 02:33:26,819
things
 

8197
02:33:26,819 --> 02:33:29,210
things
not only some of these methodologies and

people and it's a fun video you know see

8220
02:33:52,309 --> 02:33:52,319
people and it's a fun video you know see
 

8221
02:33:52,319 --> 02:33:54,710
people and it's a fun video you know see
it and it's uh the first thing you learn

8222
02:33:54,710 --> 02:33:54,720
it and it's uh the first thing you learn
 

8223
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:58,429
it and it's uh the first thing you learn
about it is how they Target people

know doing something the fairies are
wrong uh and how they pick who they're

8246
02:34:21,110 --> 02:34:21,120

going to turn around punch them in the

8258
02:34:31,670 --> 02:34:31,680
going to turn around punch them in the
 

8259
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:33,050
going to turn around punch them in the
face you know what are they looking for

8260
02:34:33,050 --> 02:34:33,060
face you know what are they looking for
 

8261
02:34:33,060 --> 02:34:34,190
face you know what are they looking for
you know

8262
02:34:34,190 --> 02:34:34,200
you know
 

8263
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:36,590
you know
well first off you know you notice that

8264
02:34:36,590 --> 02:34:36,600
well first off you know you notice that
 

8265
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:38,710
well first off you know you notice that
the the men that are in that environment

8266
02:34:38,710 --> 02:34:38,720
the the men that are in that environment
 

8267
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:41,330
the the men that are in that environment
that look at them and are aware of their

8268
02:34:41,330 --> 02:34:41,340
that look at them and are aware of their
 

8269
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:43,309
that look at them and are aware of their
presence the hyper aware are the ones

8270
02:34:43,309 --> 02:34:43,319
presence the hyper aware are the ones
 

8271
02:34:43,319 --> 02:34:45,530
presence the hyper aware are the ones
that are not a good to Target so that's

8272
02:34:45,530 --> 02:34:45,540
that are not a good to Target so that's
 

8273
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:47,330
that are not a good to Target so that's
the first lesson there so probably a

8274
02:34:47,330 --> 02:34:47,340
the first lesson there so probably a
 

8275
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:49,730
the first lesson there so probably a
good idea not only to be hyper aware but

8276
02:34:49,730 --> 02:34:49,740
good idea not only to be hyper aware but
 

8277
02:34:49,740 --> 02:34:51,230
good idea not only to be hyper aware but
to recognize that hyper awareness than

8278
02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:51,240
to recognize that hyper awareness than
 

8279
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:53,330
to recognize that hyper awareness than
others if I want to separate myself from

others if I want to separate myself from
 

8281
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:54,889
others if I want to separate myself from
the victim crap

8282
02:34:54,889 --> 02:34:54,899
the victim crap
 

8283
02:34:54,899 --> 02:34:56,450
the victim crap

02:35:04,979 --> 02:35:07,730
and you see them you know kind of
getting outside of the grasp of the

for the women around them uh you see
other men that are with women and you

8304
02:35:16,969 --> 02:35:16,979
other men that are with women and you

behind them
and immediately they'll say this this is

8310
02:35:21,530 --> 02:35:21,540
and immediately they'll say this this is
 

8311
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:22,910
and immediately they'll say this this is
the wrong one let me move off to the

8312
02:35:22,910 --> 02:35:22,920
the wrong one let me move off to the
 

8313
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:24,230
the wrong one let me move off to the
next one

8314
02:35:24,230 --> 02:35:24,240
next one
 

8315
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:27,170
next one
so that that small little lesson in the

8316
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:27,180
so that that small little lesson in the
 

8317
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:29,570
so that that small little lesson in the
in those videos will show you first how

8318
02:35:29,570 --> 02:35:29,580
in those videos will show you first how
 

8319
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:32,809
in those videos will show you first how
these kids are growing up Target to

8320
02:35:32,809 --> 02:35:32,819
these kids are growing up Target to
 

8321
02:35:32,819 --> 02:35:34,250
these kids are growing up Target to
profile and Target who the perfect

8322
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:34,260
profile and Target who the perfect
 

8323
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:36,830
profile and Target who the perfect
victims are that's a school for them

8324
02:35:36,830 --> 02:35:36,840
victims are that's a school for them
 

8325
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:39,650
victims are that's a school for them
and that is an adversarial school we

8326
02:35:39,650 --> 02:35:39,660
and that is an adversarial school we
 

8327
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:42,230
and that is an adversarial school we
should look at that school and apply to

8328
02:35:42,230 --> 02:35:42,240
should look at that school and apply to
 

8329
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:44,030
should look at that school and apply to
ourselves so in general you think

8330
02:35:44,030 --> 02:35:44,040
ourselves so in general you think
 

8331
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:46,849
ourselves so in general you think
conflict ultimately the people that are

8332
02:35:46,849 --> 02:35:46,859
conflict ultimately the people that are
 

8333
02:35:46,859 --> 02:35:48,530
conflict ultimately the people that are
doing conflict they're looking for for

8334
02:35:48,530 --> 02:35:48,540
doing conflict they're looking for for
 

8335
02:35:48,540 --> 02:35:50,870
doing conflict they're looking for for
weakness I mean they're looking for

8336
02:35:50,870 --> 02:35:50,880
weakness I mean they're looking for
 

8337
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:54,110
weakness I mean they're looking for
opportunity opportunistic that's the

8338
02:35:54,110 --> 02:35:54,120
opportunity opportunistic that's the
 

8339
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:55,309
opportunity opportunistic that's the
Predators that's what they do they look

8340
02:35:55,309 --> 02:35:55,319
Predators that's what they do they look
 

8341
02:35:55,319 --> 02:35:57,410
Predators that's what they do they look
for an opportunity you know uh from

8342
02:35:57,410 --> 02:35:57,420
for an opportunity you know uh from
 

8343
02:35:57,420 --> 02:35:59,330
for an opportunity you know uh from
jumping down from a tree and and getting

8344
02:35:59,330 --> 02:35:59,340
jumping down from a tree and and getting
 

8345
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:01,490
jumping down from a tree and and getting

them out and I have them place them on
each other in a just playing manner I

9284
02:52:55,550 --> 02:52:55,560
each other in a just playing manner I
 

9285
02:52:55,560 --> 02:52:57,230
each other in a just playing manner I
have Hank I have handcuffed Keith there

9286
02:52:57,230 --> 02:52:57,240
have Hank I have handcuffed Keith there
 

9287

have Hank I have handcuffed Keith there
and I have a pair of bolt cutters there

9288
02:52:59,150 --> 02:52:59,160
and I have a pair of bolt cutters there
 

9289
02:52:59,160 --> 02:53:00,290
and I have a pair of bolt cutters there
in case somebody gets stuck that's

9290
02:53:00,290 --> 02:53:00,300
in case somebody gets stuck that's
 

9291
02:53:00,300 --> 02:53:01,429
in case somebody gets stuck that's
something stupid

9292
02:53:01,429 --> 02:53:01,439
something stupid
 

9293
02:53:01,439 --> 02:53:03,410
something stupid
so they they play with each other as far

9294
02:53:03,410 --> 02:53:03,420
so they they play with each other as far
 

9295
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:04,969
so they they play with each other as far
as putting them on randomly I show them

9296
02:53:04,969 --> 02:53:04,979
as putting them on randomly I show them
 

9297
02:53:04,979 --> 02:53:07,190
as putting them on randomly I show them
how to put them on appropriately and

9298
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:07,200
how to put them on appropriately and
 

9299
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:09,889
how to put them on appropriately and
then I show them a handcuff key and a

9300
02:53:09,889 --> 02:53:09,899
then I show them a handcuff key and a
 

9301
02:53:09,899 --> 02:53:11,809
then I show them a handcuff key and a
handcuff key will open up handcuffs

9302
02:53:11,809 --> 02:53:11,819
handcuff key will open up handcuffs
 

9303
02:53:11,819 --> 02:53:13,309
handcuff key will open up handcuffs
interestingly enough

9304
02:53:13,309 --> 02:53:13,319
interestingly enough
 

9305
02:53:13,319 --> 02:53:15,530
interestingly enough
but the thing about a handcuff key is

9306
02:53:15,530 --> 02:53:15,540
but the thing about a handcuff key is
 

9307
02:53:15,540 --> 02:53:17,510
but the thing about a handcuff key is
it's not made to be used by the person

9308
02:53:17,510 --> 02:53:17,520
it's not made to be used by the person
 

9309
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:19,490
it's not made to be used by the person
that is in those handcuffs

9310
02:53:19,490 --> 02:53:19,500
that is in those handcuffs
 

9311
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:21,469
that is in those handcuffs
so that's the first lesson there

9312
02:53:21,469 --> 02:53:21,479
so that's the first lesson there
 

9313
02:53:21,479 --> 02:53:23,690
so that's the first lesson there
if you have a hank of key handcuff keys

02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:28,010
it a passive resistance again you go
through a process within where you

9374
02:54:28,010 --> 02:54:28,020
through a process within where you
 

9375
02:54:28,020 --> 02:54:30,550
through a process within where you
deconstruct how people are handcuffed

9376
02:54:30,550 --> 02:54:30,560
deconstruct how people are handcuffed
 

9377

cookie to be able to use on yourself and
these all of these things they're

9382
02:54:35,630 --> 02:54:35,640
these all of these things they're
 

9383
02:54:35,640 --> 02:54:37,370
these all of these things they're
constructing as we go

9384
02:54:37,370 --> 02:54:37,380
constructing as we go
 

9385
02:54:37,380 --> 02:54:39,889
constructing as we go
so they basically hey what's a grinding

9386
02:54:39,889 --> 02:54:39,899
so they basically hey what's a grinding
 

9387
02:54:39,899 --> 02:54:41,510
so they basically hey what's a grinding
surface well there's concrete outside so

9388
02:54:41,510 --> 02:54:41,520
surface well there's concrete outside so
 

9389
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:43,370
surface well there's concrete outside so
they grind and angle on the key so you

9390
02:54:43,370 --> 02:54:43,380
they grind and angle on the key so you
 

9391
02:54:43,380 --> 02:54:46,370
they grind and angle on the key so you
can get a key not to go straight into

9392
02:54:46,370 --> 02:54:46,380
can get a key not to go straight into
 

9393
02:54:46,380 --> 02:54:48,530
can get a key not to go straight into
the keyway but you can get it into the

9394
02:54:48,530 --> 02:54:48,540
the keyway but you can get it into the
 

9395
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:50,210
the keyway but you can get it into the
keyway at an angle for example it's

9396
02:54:50,210 --> 02:54:50,220
keyway at an angle for example it's
 

9397
02:54:50,220 --> 02:54:51,889
keyway at an angle for example it's
something it's something that is out

9398
02:54:51,889 --> 02:54:51,899
something it's something that is out
 

9399
02:54:51,899 --> 02:54:54,290
something it's something that is out
there as far as a method you can't spin

9400
02:54:54,290 --> 02:54:54,300
there as far as a method you can't spin
 

9401
02:54:54,300 --> 02:54:55,490
there as far as a method you can't spin
a key behind your back because it's

9402
02:54:55,490 --> 02:54:55,500
a key behind your back because it's
 

9403
02:54:55,500 --> 02:54:57,230
a key behind your back because it's
small it's designed to be used by

02:54:58,849 --> 02:54:58,859
somebody else opening those handcuffs on
 

9407
02:54:58,859 --> 02:55:00,769
somebody else opening those handcuffs on
you so you put an arm on it so you can

9408
02:55:00,769 --> 02:55:00,779
you so you put an arm on it so you can
 

9409
02:55:00,779 --> 02:55:02,210
you so you put an arm on it so you can
leverage our arm so you can spin it

9410
02:55:02,210 --> 02:55:02,220
leverage our arm so you can spin it
 

9411
02:55:02,220 --> 02:55:04,550
leverage our arm so you can spin it
behind your back

9412
02:55:04,550 --> 02:55:04,560
behind your back

02:55:09,410 --> 02:55:09,420
compromised position if somebody asks
 

9417
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:11,570
compromised position if somebody asks
you for your hand cut or your hands so

9418

you for your hand cut or your hands so
they could be cuffed you don't do this

9420
02:55:14,150 --> 02:55:14,160
they could be cuffed you don't do this
 

9421
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:16,070
they could be cuffed you don't do this
you know you do that or you put yourself

9422
02:55:16,070 --> 02:55:16,080
you know you do that or you put yourself
 

9423
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:18,349
you know you do that or you put yourself
in a cable grip behind your back which

9424

in a cable grip behind your back which
 

9425
02:55:18,359 --> 02:55:20,210
in a cable grip behind your back which
is a pretty strong grip and it's hard to

9426
02:55:20,210 --> 02:55:20,220
is a pretty strong grip and it's hard to
 

9427
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:21,710
is a pretty strong grip and it's hard to
spread those hands apart it's also

9428
02:55:21,710 --> 02:55:21,720
spread those hands apart it's also
 

9429
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:23,050
spread those hands apart it's also
something that people go into

9430
02:55:23,050 --> 02:55:23,060
something that people go into
 

9431
02:55:23,060 --> 02:55:25,969
something that people go into
automatically when they're in fear so

9432
02:55:25,969 --> 02:55:25,979
automatically when they're in fear so
 

9433
02:55:25,979 --> 02:55:27,410
automatically when they're in fear so
all these things are advantageous for

9434
02:55:27,410 --> 02:55:27,420
all these things are advantageous for
 

9435
02:55:27,420 --> 02:55:28,130
all these things are advantageous for
you

9436
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:28,140
you
 

9437
02:55:28,140 --> 02:55:31,429
you

so that was a pretty valuable lesson

9950
03:04:20,990 --> 03:04:21,000
so that was a pretty valuable lesson
 

9951
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:22,730
so that was a pretty valuable lesson
that I got there yeah so that that's

9952
03:04:22,730 --> 03:04:22,740
that I got there yeah so that that's
 

9953
03:04:22,740 --> 03:04:25,730
that I got there yeah so that that's
interesting but like I have this belief

9954
03:04:25,730 --> 03:04:25,740
interesting but like I have this belief
 

9955
03:04:25,740 --> 03:04:28,190
interesting but like I have this belief
it has to do with the way I operate in

9956
03:04:28,190 --> 03:04:28,200
it has to do with the way I operate in
 

9957
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:31,429
it has to do with the way I operate in
this world I suppose but if you come off

9958
03:04:31,429 --> 03:04:31,439
this world I suppose but if you come off
 

9959
03:04:31,439 --> 03:04:33,469
this world I suppose but if you come off
as a person legitimately I guess you

9960
03:04:33,469 --> 03:04:33,479
as a person legitimately I guess you
 

9961
03:04:33,479 --> 03:04:36,050
as a person legitimately I guess you
could fake it but I I think it it just

9962
03:04:36,050 --> 03:04:36,060
could fake it but I I think it it just
 

9963
03:04:36,060 --> 03:04:39,730
could fake it but I I think it it just
feels like you can be extremely good

9964
03:04:39,730 --> 03:04:39,740
feels like you can be extremely good
 

9965

which uh you know people talking about
 

11155

which uh you know people talking about
marijuana legalization thought it was

marijuana legalization thought it was
 

11157
03:27:20,160 --> 03:27:21,349
marijuana legalization thought it was
going to hit the cartels in their

11158
03:27:21,349 --> 03:27:21,359
going to hit the cartels in their
 

11159
03:27:21,359 --> 03:27:22,969
going to hit the cartels in their
pockets and it was going to be like a

11160
03:27:22,969 --> 03:27:22,979
pockets and it was going to be like a
 

11161
03:27:22,979 --> 03:27:25,070
pockets and it was going to be like a
you know a death blow to these criminal

11162
03:27:25,070 --> 03:27:25,080
you know a death blow to these criminal
 

11163

you know a death blow to these criminal
groups

11164
03:27:26,210 --> 03:27:26,220
groups
 

11165
03:27:26,220 --> 03:27:30,410
groups
well now there's a illegal pot grows in

11166
03:27:30,410 --> 03:27:30,420
well now there's a illegal pot grows in
 

11167
03:27:30,420 --> 03:27:32,030
well now there's a illegal pot grows in
the United States being run by cartels

11168
03:27:32,030 --> 03:27:32,040
the United States being run by cartels
 

11169
03:27:32,040 --> 03:27:35,389
the United States being run by cartels
in federal lands there's the legal pot

11170
03:27:35,389 --> 03:27:35,399
in federal lands there's the legal pot
 

11171
03:27:35,399 --> 03:27:38,090
in federal lands there's the legal pot
grows that are in some way shape or form

11172
03:27:38,090 --> 03:27:38,100
grows that are in some way shape or form
 

11173
03:27:38,100 --> 03:27:40,190
grows that are in some way shape or form
influence and or run or owned by some

influence and or run or owned by some
 

11175
03:27:40,200 --> 03:27:42,110
influence and or run or owned by some
camera groups that are kind of utilizing

11176
03:27:42,110 --> 03:27:42,120
camera groups that are kind of utilizing
 

11177
03:27:42,120 --> 03:27:43,010
camera groups that are kind of utilizing
that

11178
03:27:43,010 --> 03:27:43,020
that
 

11179
03:27:43,020 --> 03:27:45,590
that
the the marijuana fields in Mexico turn

11180
03:27:45,590 --> 03:27:45,600
the the marijuana fields in Mexico turn
 

11181
03:27:45,600 --> 03:27:49,610
the the marijuana fields in Mexico turn
into poppy fields once again

11182
03:27:49,610 --> 03:27:49,620
into poppy fields once again
 

11183
03:27:49,620 --> 03:27:51,349
into poppy fields once again
the problem is that some of these lands

11184
03:27:51,349 --> 03:27:51,359
the problem is that some of these lands
 

11185
03:27:51,359 --> 03:27:53,210
the problem is that some of these lands
were leached of all the nutrients and

11186
03:27:53,210 --> 03:27:53,220
were leached of all the nutrients and
 

11187
03:27:53,220 --> 03:27:55,070
were leached of all the nutrients and
you know they're not as good as

11188
03:27:55,070 --> 03:27:55,080
you know they're not as good as
 

11189
03:27:55,080 --> 03:27:56,450
you know they're not as good as
something you would find somewhere in

11190
03:27:56,450 --> 03:27:56,460
something you would find somewhere in
 

11191
03:27:56,460 --> 03:27:59,090
something you would find somewhere in
Afghanistan so the the yield and the

11192
03:27:59,090 --> 03:27:59,100
Afghanistan so the the yield and the
 

11193
03:27:59,100 --> 03:28:01,190
Afghanistan so the the yield and the
quality of it wasn't as strong as it

11194
03:28:01,190 --> 03:28:01,200
quality of it wasn't as strong as it
 

11195
03:28:01,200 --> 03:28:02,330
quality of it wasn't as strong as it
could be

11196
03:28:02,330 --> 03:28:02,340
could be
 

11197
03:28:02,340 --> 03:28:04,610
could be
so somebody thought about the right idea

11198
03:28:04,610 --> 03:28:04,620
so somebody thought about the right idea
 

11199
03:28:04,620 --> 03:28:07,450
so somebody thought about the right idea
of putting fentanyl into the mix

11200
03:28:07,450 --> 03:28:07,460
of putting fentanyl into the mix
 

11201
03:28:07,460 --> 03:28:11,750
of putting fentanyl into the mix
and not only that but also figuring out

11202
03:28:11,750 --> 03:28:11,760
and not only that but also figuring out
 

11203
03:28:11,760 --> 03:28:14,710
and not only that but also figuring out
a get fentanyl into Mexico

11204
03:28:14,710 --> 03:28:14,720
a get fentanyl into Mexico
 

11205
03:28:14,720 --> 03:28:18,110
a get fentanyl into Mexico
has a giant pharmaceutical industry that

11206
03:28:18,110 --> 03:28:18,120
has a giant pharmaceutical industry that
 

11207
03:28:18,120 --> 03:28:19,910
has a giant pharmaceutical industry that
people kind of also don't kind of know

11208
03:28:19,910 --> 03:28:19,920
people kind of also don't kind of know
 

11209
03:28:19,920 --> 03:28:22,490
people kind of also don't kind of know
or factor into this equation which leads

11210
03:28:22,490 --> 03:28:22,500
or factor into this equation which leads
 

11211
03:28:22,500 --> 03:28:24,830
or factor into this equation which leads
into

11212
03:28:24,830 --> 03:28:24,840

 

11213
03:28:24,840 --> 03:28:28,610

the free ability of chemicals going in

11214
03:28:28,610 --> 03:28:28,620
the free ability of chemicals going in
 

11215
03:28:28,620 --> 03:28:30,710
the free ability of chemicals going in
and out of the country and legal means

11216
03:28:30,710 --> 03:28:30,720
and out of the country and legal means
 

11217
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:33,590
and out of the country and legal means
of it happening right so not only the

11218
03:28:33,590 --> 03:28:33,600
of it happening right so not only the
 

11219
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:35,450
of it happening right so not only the
precursors to make it but also the

11220
03:28:35,450 --> 03:28:35,460
precursors to make it but also the
 

11221
03:28:35,460 --> 03:28:38,389
precursors to make it but also the
chemists then the industry to create it

11222
03:28:38,389 --> 03:28:38,399
chemists then the industry to create it
 

11223
03:28:38,399 --> 03:28:40,070
chemists then the industry to create it
in Mexico as well

11224
03:28:40,070 --> 03:28:40,080
in Mexico as well
 

11225
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:42,889
in Mexico as well
some clandestine factories of fentanyl

11226
03:28:42,889 --> 03:28:42,899
some clandestine factories of fentanyl
 

11227
03:28:42,899 --> 03:28:44,690
some clandestine factories of fentanyl
have been found in Mexico

11228
03:28:44,690 --> 03:28:44,700
have been found in Mexico
 

11229
03:28:44,700 --> 03:28:46,849
have been found in Mexico
but realistically it's not needed with

11230
03:28:46,849 --> 03:28:46,859
but realistically it's not needed with
 

11231
03:28:46,859 --> 03:28:49,309
but realistically it's not needed with
the with the ways that the ports and the

11232
03:28:49,309 --> 03:28:49,319
the with the ways that the ports and the
 

11233
03:28:49,319 --> 03:28:51,590
the with the ways that the ports and the
borders are down in Mexico

11234
03:28:51,590 --> 03:28:51,600
borders are down in Mexico
 

11235
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:52,570
borders are down in Mexico
um

11236
03:28:52,570 --> 03:28:52,580
um
 

11237
03:28:52,580 --> 03:28:55,670
um
you started seeing an influx and a flood

11238
03:28:55,670 --> 03:28:55,680
you started seeing an influx and a flood
 

11239
03:28:55,680 --> 03:28:58,309
you started seeing an influx and a flood
of uh fentanyl into Mexico specifically

11240
03:28:58,309 --> 03:28:58,319
of uh fentanyl into Mexico specifically
 

11241
03:28:58,319 --> 03:29:01,130
of uh fentanyl into Mexico specifically
related to infusing it into heroin

11242
03:29:01,130 --> 03:29:01,140
related to infusing it into heroin
 

11243
03:29:01,140 --> 03:29:03,710
related to infusing it into heroin
and not only using that to feed local

11244
03:29:03,710 --> 03:29:03,720
and not only using that to feed local
 

11245
03:29:03,720 --> 03:29:05,570
and not only using that to feed local
drug markets but send it up into the

11246
03:29:05,570 --> 03:29:05,580
drug markets but send it up into the
 

11247
03:29:05,580 --> 03:29:07,490
drug markets but send it up into the
United States which started off this

11248
03:29:07,490 --> 03:29:07,500
United States which started off this
 

11249
03:29:07,500 --> 03:29:09,290
United States which started off this
process that we're kind of going through

11250
03:29:09,290 --> 03:29:09,300
process that we're kind of going through
 

11251
03:29:09,300 --> 03:29:12,469
process that we're kind of going through
still are these like similar highs and

11252
03:29:12,469 --> 03:29:12,479
still are these like similar highs and
 

11253
03:29:12,479 --> 03:29:15,530
still are these like similar highs and
drug-wise why do you infuse I mean

11254
03:29:15,530 --> 03:29:15,540
drug-wise why do you infuse I mean
 

11255
03:29:15,540 --> 03:29:16,849
drug-wise why do you infuse I mean
probably you're not the right person to

11256
03:29:16,849 --> 03:29:16,859
probably you're not the right person to
 

11257
03:29:16,859 --> 03:29:19,190
probably you're not the right person to
have this biochemical discussion or how

11258
03:29:19,190 --> 03:29:19,200
have this biochemical discussion or how
 

11259
03:29:19,200 --> 03:29:20,510
have this biochemical discussion or how
I don't know about the biochemical

11260
03:29:20,510 --> 03:29:20,520
I don't know about the biochemical
 

11261
03:29:20,520 --> 03:29:23,030
I don't know about the biochemical
aspect of it but like speaking to guys

11262
03:29:23,030 --> 03:29:23,040
aspect of it but like speaking to guys
 

11263
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:24,889
aspect of it but like speaking to guys
that do Chiva down there that's what

11264
03:29:24,889 --> 03:29:24,899
that do Chiva down there that's what
 

11265

11267
03:29:26,520 --> 03:29:27,950
they do that's that's what we call
heroin down there it's like a nickname

11268
03:29:27,950 --> 03:29:27,960
heroin down there it's like a nickname
 

11269
03:29:27,960 --> 03:29:31,610
heroin down there it's like a nickname
for it uh having them describe uh some

11270
03:29:31,610 --> 03:29:31,620
for it uh having them describe uh some
 

11271
03:29:31,620 --> 03:29:34,010
for it uh having them describe uh some
of the older stinkier darker heroin they

11272
03:29:34,010 --> 03:29:34,020
of the older stinkier darker heroin they
 

11273
03:29:34,020 --> 03:29:36,050
of the older stinkier darker heroin they
used to get before this whole fentanyl

11274
03:29:36,050 --> 03:29:36,060
used to get before this whole fentanyl
 

11275
03:29:36,060 --> 03:29:37,849
used to get before this whole fentanyl
thing and the highs they would get and

11276
03:29:37,849 --> 03:29:37,859
thing and the highs they would get and
 

11277
03:29:37,859 --> 03:29:39,349
thing and the highs they would get and
how much they would have to take versus

11278
03:29:39,349 --> 03:29:39,359
how much they would have to take versus
 

11279
03:29:39,359 --> 03:29:41,030
how much they would have to take versus
some of the stuff loaded with fentanyl

11280
03:29:41,030 --> 03:29:41,040
some of the stuff loaded with fentanyl
 

11281
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:43,250
some of the stuff loaded with fentanyl
that they have to

11282

that they have to
 

11283
03:29:43,260 --> 03:29:45,650
that they have to
you know also there's more higher

11284
03:29:45,650 --> 03:29:45,660
you know also there's more higher
 

11285
03:29:45,660 --> 03:29:47,750
you know also there's more higher
potency yeah there's a higher potency to

11286
03:29:47,750 --> 03:29:47,760
potency yeah there's a higher potency to
 

11287
03:29:47,760 --> 03:29:49,969
potency yeah there's a higher potency to

uh so the evolution right now you're
seeing is

11422

seeing is
 

11423
03:32:30,779 --> 03:32:32,950
seeing is
making something

to China
uh most and this is something that's

11482
03:33:35,510 --> 03:33:35,520
uh most and this is something that's
 

11483
03:33:35,520 --> 03:33:37,790
uh most and this is something that's
come out recently a few years back I

11484
03:33:37,790 --> 03:33:37,800
come out recently a few years back I
 

11485
03:33:37,800 --> 03:33:40,070
come out recently a few years back I
think but basically the ways you would

11486
03:33:40,070 --> 03:33:40,080
think but basically the ways you would
 

11487
03:33:40,080 --> 03:33:42,050
think but basically the ways you would
move money back into Mexico after you

11488
03:33:42,050 --> 03:33:42,060
move money back into Mexico after you
 

11489
03:33:42,060 --> 03:33:43,849
move money back into Mexico after you
have a load up here is that you would

11490
03:33:43,849 --> 03:33:43,859
have a load up here is that you would
 

11491
03:33:43,859 --> 03:33:46,550
have a load up here is that you would
give it to a Chinese money broker they

11492
03:33:46,550 --> 03:33:46,560
give it to a Chinese money broker they
 

11493
03:33:46,560 --> 03:33:47,929
give it to a Chinese money broker they
would put into the Chinese banking

11494
03:33:47,929 --> 03:33:47,939
would put into the Chinese banking
 

11495
03:33:47,939 --> 03:33:49,429
would put into the Chinese banking
system and it immediately it would just

11496
03:33:49,429 --> 03:33:49,439
system and it immediately it would just
 

11497
03:33:49,439 --> 03:33:51,410
system and it immediately it would just
disappear from American eyes

11498

disappear from American eyes
 

11499
03:33:51,420 --> 03:33:53,210
disappear from American eyes
and then another money broker in Mexico

11500
03:33:53,210 --> 03:33:53,220
and then another money broker in Mexico

and then another money broker in Mexico
would receive it through a money

11502
03:33:54,469 --> 03:33:54,479
would receive it through a money
 

11503
03:33:54,479 --> 03:33:56,389
would receive it through a money
transfer from China so China's

and and training them in such a way so
it's like a it's a it's an interesting

11756
03:38:40,309 --> 03:38:40,319
it's like a it's a it's an interesting
 

11757
03:38:40,319 --> 03:38:41,750
it's like a it's a it's an interesting
maneuver like Mexico has been

11758
03:38:41,750 --> 03:38:41,760
maneuver like Mexico has been
 

11759
03:38:41,760 --> 03:38:43,370
maneuver like Mexico has been
historically neutral about getting

11760
03:38:43,370 --> 03:38:43,380
historically neutral about getting
 

11761
03:38:43,380 --> 03:38:46,370
historically neutral about getting
involved in foreign conflicts about

11762
03:38:46,370 --> 03:38:46,380
involved in foreign conflicts about
 

11763
03:38:46,380 --> 03:38:48,110
involved in foreign conflicts about
voting and resolutions as far as

11764
03:38:48,110 --> 03:38:48,120
voting and resolutions as far as
 

11765
03:38:48,120 --> 03:38:50,030
voting and resolutions as far as
invading or not invading or doing all

11766
03:38:50,030 --> 03:38:50,040
invading or not invading or doing all
 

11767
03:38:50,040 --> 03:38:50,990
invading or not invading or doing all
these things

11768
03:38:50,990 --> 03:38:51,000
these things
 

11769
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:52,849
these things
Mexico has been historically kind of

11770
03:38:52,849 --> 03:38:52,859
Mexico has been historically kind of
 

11771
03:38:52,859 --> 03:38:54,110
Mexico has been historically kind of
neutral when it comes to some of these

11772
03:38:54,110 --> 03:38:54,120
neutral when it comes to some of these
 

11773
03:38:54,120 --> 03:38:56,210
neutral when it comes to some of these
things and now we're training foreign

11774
03:38:56,210 --> 03:38:56,220
things and now we're training foreign
 

11775
03:38:56,220 --> 03:38:59,030
things and now we're training foreign
military forces to go and do that role

11776
03:38:59,030 --> 03:38:59,040
military forces to go and do that role
 

11777
03:38:59,040 --> 03:39:00,710
military forces to go and do that role
somewhere else

11778
03:39:00,710 --> 03:39:00,720
somewhere else
 

11779
03:39:00,720 --> 03:39:02,330
somewhere else
um we have the military building

11780
03:39:02,330 --> 03:39:02,340
um we have the military building
 

11781
03:39:02,340 --> 03:39:04,250
um we have the military building
airports and building infrastructure in

11782
03:39:04,250 --> 03:39:04,260
airports and building infrastructure in
 

11783
03:39:04,260 --> 03:39:06,229
airports and building infrastructure in
Mexico when a lot of their higher ups

11784
03:39:06,229 --> 03:39:06,239
Mexico when a lot of their higher ups
 

11785
03:39:06,239 --> 03:39:08,690
Mexico when a lot of their higher ups
getting very you know wealthy around it

11786
03:39:08,690 --> 03:39:08,700
getting very you know wealthy around it
 

11787
03:39:08,700 --> 03:39:11,570
getting very you know wealthy around it
you know and they basically have a

11788
03:39:11,570 --> 03:39:11,580
you know and they basically have a
 

11789
03:39:11,580 --> 03:39:13,550
you know and they basically have a
monopoly over

11790
03:39:13,550 --> 03:39:13,560
monopoly over
 

11791
03:39:13,560 --> 03:39:15,530
monopoly over
you know who gets to have guns down

11792
03:39:15,530 --> 03:39:15,540
you know who gets to have guns down
 

11793
03:39:15,540 --> 03:39:17,090
you know who gets to have guns down
there you know there's one gun store in

11794
03:39:17,090 --> 03:39:17,100
there you know there's one gun store in
 

11795
03:39:17,100 --> 03:39:18,830
there you know there's one gun store in
all Mexico and it's run by the military

11796
03:39:18,830 --> 03:39:18,840
all Mexico and it's run by the military
 

11797
03:39:18,840 --> 03:39:21,050
all Mexico and it's run by the military
and the only way you can buy a gun there

11798
03:39:21,050 --> 03:39:21,060
and the only way you can buy a gun there
 

11799
03:39:21,060 --> 03:39:22,729
and the only way you can buy a gun there
is if you can buy a plane ticket to fly

11800
03:39:22,729 --> 03:39:22,739
is if you can buy a plane ticket to fly
 

11801
03:39:22,739 --> 03:39:25,070
is if you can buy a plane ticket to fly
there and have enough money to sustain

11802
03:39:25,070 --> 03:39:25,080
there and have enough money to sustain
 

11803
03:39:25,080 --> 03:39:27,650
there and have enough money to sustain
that uh that right or that privilege

11804
03:39:27,650 --> 03:39:27,660
that uh that right or that privilege
 

11805
03:39:27,660 --> 03:39:30,590
that uh that right or that privilege
So you you're seeing the military not

11806
03:39:30,590 --> 03:39:30,600
So you you're seeing the military not
 

11807
03:39:30,600 --> 03:39:33,410
So you you're seeing the military not
being in its traditional role of just

11808
03:39:33,410 --> 03:39:33,420
being in its traditional role of just
 

11809
03:39:33,420 --> 03:39:34,969
being in its traditional role of just
being the security Force now it's

11810
03:39:34,969 --> 03:39:34,979
being the security Force now it's
 

11811
03:39:34,979 --> 03:39:38,090
being the security Force now it's
policing it's involved in it's it's

11812
03:39:38,090 --> 03:39:38,100
policing it's involved in it's it's
 

11813
03:39:38,100 --> 03:39:40,250
policing it's involved in it's it's
getting involved in politics in a big

11814
03:39:40,250 --> 03:39:40,260
getting involved in politics in a big
 

11815
03:39:40,260 --> 03:39:42,889
getting involved in politics in a big
way you know it's uh legislation that

11816
03:39:42,889 --> 03:39:42,899
way you know it's uh legislation that
 

11817
03:39:42,899 --> 03:39:44,990
way you know it's uh legislation that
has passed to keep it on the streets and

11818
03:39:44,990 --> 03:39:45,000
has passed to keep it on the streets and
 

11819
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:48,170
has passed to keep it on the streets and
the policing role for more years now so

11820
03:39:48,170 --> 03:39:48,180
the policing role for more years now so
 

11821
03:39:48,180 --> 03:39:49,849
the policing role for more years now so
that should be looked at Closer by

11822
03:39:49,849 --> 03:39:49,859
that should be looked at Closer by
 

11823
03:39:49,859 --> 03:39:52,070
that should be looked at Closer by
anybody observing it uh from afar how

11824
03:39:52,070 --> 03:39:52,080
anybody observing it uh from afar how
 

11825
03:39:52,080 --> 03:39:53,870
anybody observing it uh from afar how
the militarization of Mexico and where

11826
03:39:53,870 --> 03:39:53,880
the militarization of Mexico and where
 

11827
03:39:53,880 --> 03:39:57,229
the militarization of Mexico and where
it's going because if you move towards a

11828
03:39:57,229 --> 03:39:57,239
it's going because if you move towards a
 

11829
03:39:57,239 --> 03:39:59,929
it's going because if you move towards a
world where a world war three happens it

11830
03:39:59,929 --> 03:39:59,939
world where a world war three happens it
 

11831
03:39:59,939 --> 03:40:02,990
world where a world war three happens it
feels like Mexico will be the center

11832
03:40:02,990 --> 03:40:03,000
feels like Mexico will be the center
 

11833
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:06,229
feels like Mexico will be the center
because a hot War would be fought on the

11834
03:40:06,229 --> 03:40:06,239
because a hot War would be fought on the
 

11835
03:40:06,239 --> 03:40:07,309
because a hot War would be fought on the
ground

11836
03:40:07,309 --> 03:40:07,319
ground
 

11837
03:40:07,319 --> 03:40:10,010
ground
and so you have a very difficult

11838
03:40:10,010 --> 03:40:10,020
and so you have a very difficult
 

11839
03:40:10,020 --> 03:40:12,590
and so you have a very difficult
parallel between Mexico and Ukraine both

11840
03:40:12,590 --> 03:40:12,600
parallel between Mexico and Ukraine both
 

11841
03:40:12,600 --> 03:40:14,750
parallel between Mexico and Ukraine both
don't have nuclear weapons both have

11842
03:40:14,750 --> 03:40:14,760
don't have nuclear weapons both have
 

11843
03:40:14,760 --> 03:40:16,610
don't have nuclear weapons both have
relationships so Ukraine has a

11844
03:40:16,610 --> 03:40:16,620
relationships so Ukraine has a
 

11845
03:40:16,620 --> 03:40:18,950
relationships so Ukraine has a
relationship or a pull towards the

11846
03:40:18,950 --> 03:40:18,960
relationship or a pull towards the
 

11847
03:40:18,960 --> 03:40:21,110
relationship or a pull towards the
European Union and NATO

11848
03:40:21,110 --> 03:40:21,120
European Union and NATO
 

11849
03:40:21,120 --> 03:40:24,530
European Union and NATO
Mexico at least currently has a kind of

11850
03:40:24,530 --> 03:40:24,540
Mexico at least currently has a kind of
 

11851
03:40:24,540 --> 03:40:27,830
Mexico at least currently has a kind of
slow pull towards China India

11852
03:40:27,830 --> 03:40:27,840
slow pull towards China India
 

11853
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:29,990
slow pull towards China India
potentially and Russia and you have this

11854
03:40:29,990 --> 03:40:30,000
potentially and Russia and you have this
 

11855
03:40:30,000 --> 03:40:32,809
potentially and Russia and you have this
divide between power centers in the

11856
03:40:32,809 --> 03:40:32,819
divide between power centers in the
 

11857
03:40:32,819 --> 03:40:33,469
divide between power centers in the
world

11858
03:40:33,469 --> 03:40:33,479
world
 

11859
03:40:33,479 --> 03:40:37,190
world
and in terms of just imagine

11860
03:40:37,190 --> 03:40:37,200
and in terms of just imagine
 

11861
03:40:37,200 --> 03:40:40,070
and in terms of just imagine
hundreds of thousands of Mexican troops

11862
03:40:40,070 --> 03:40:40,080
hundreds of thousands of Mexican troops
 

11863
03:40:40,080 --> 03:40:42,170
hundreds of thousands of Mexican troops
hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops

11864
03:40:42,170 --> 03:40:42,180
hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops
 

11865
03:40:42,180 --> 03:40:43,729
hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops
on the border

11866
03:40:43,729 --> 03:40:43,739
on the border
 

11867
03:40:43,739 --> 03:40:46,490
on the border
on the U.S border yeah on the Mexican

11868
03:40:46,490 --> 03:40:46,500
on the U.S border yeah on the Mexican
 

11869
03:40:46,500 --> 03:40:49,130
on the U.S border yeah on the Mexican
side and also the fact that that border

11870
03:40:49,130 --> 03:40:49,140
side and also the fact that that border
 

11871
03:40:49,140 --> 03:40:51,410
side and also the fact that that border
doesn't mean anything to any sort of

11872
03:40:51,410 --> 03:40:51,420
doesn't mean anything to any sort of
 

11873
03:40:51,420 --> 03:40:54,110
doesn't mean anything to any sort of
conflict that would happen regionally

11874
03:40:54,110 --> 03:40:54,120
conflict that would happen regionally
 

11875
03:40:54,120 --> 03:40:56,750
conflict that would happen regionally
because that that's a very easy to

11876
03:40:56,750 --> 03:40:56,760
because that that's a very easy to
 

11877
03:40:56,760 --> 03:40:58,429
because that that's a very easy to
cross-border doesn't matter how many

11878
03:40:58,429 --> 03:40:58,439
cross-border doesn't matter how many
 

11879
03:40:58,439 --> 03:41:00,469
cross-border doesn't matter how many
walls you put across it people are

11880
03:41:00,469 --> 03:41:00,479
walls you put across it people are
 

11881
03:41:00,479 --> 03:41:02,870
walls you put across it people are
already here uh this is not going to be

11882
03:41:02,870 --> 03:41:02,880
already here uh this is not going to be
 

11883
03:41:02,880 --> 03:41:05,269
already here uh this is not going to be
a war fought off in some overseas place

11884
03:41:05,269 --> 03:41:05,279
a war fought off in some overseas place
 

11885
03:41:05,279 --> 03:41:07,550
a war fought off in some overseas place
like you're not gonna this is something

11886
03:41:07,550 --> 03:41:07,560
like you're not gonna this is something
 

11887
03:41:07,560 --> 03:41:10,490
like you're not gonna this is something
if if it happens if destabilization is

11888
03:41:10,490 --> 03:41:10,500
if if it happens if destabilization is
 

11889
03:41:10,500 --> 03:41:11,990
if if it happens if destabilization is
utilized in Mexico

11890
03:41:11,990 --> 03:41:12,000
utilized in Mexico
 

11891
03:41:12,000 --> 03:41:14,450
utilized in Mexico
to cause a conflict there and it turns

11892
03:41:14,450 --> 03:41:14,460
to cause a conflict there and it turns
 

11893
03:41:14,460 --> 03:41:16,729
to cause a conflict there and it turns
into a Vietnam or a proxy war down there

11894
03:41:16,729 --> 03:41:16,739
into a Vietnam or a proxy war down there
 

11895
03:41:16,739 --> 03:41:19,550
into a Vietnam or a proxy war down there
of a sword which I think

11896
03:41:19,550 --> 03:41:19,560
of a sword which I think
 

11897
03:41:19,560 --> 03:41:21,229
of a sword which I think
in a way you're already kind of seeing

11898
03:41:21,229 --> 03:41:21,239
in a way you're already kind of seeing
 

11899
03:41:21,239 --> 03:41:22,910
in a way you're already kind of seeing
some of that uh through some of the

11900
03:41:22,910 --> 03:41:22,920
some of that uh through some of the
 

11901
03:41:22,920 --> 03:41:24,830
some of that uh through some of the
conflicts going on down there you have a

11902
03:41:24,830 --> 03:41:24,840
conflicts going on down there you have a
 

11903
03:41:24,840 --> 03:41:27,889
conflicts going on down there you have a
a new generation cartel that is being

11904
03:41:27,889 --> 03:41:27,899
a new generation cartel that is being
 

11905
03:41:27,899 --> 03:41:30,590
a new generation cartel that is being
fed fentanyl from the Pacific side ports

11906
03:41:30,590 --> 03:41:30,600
fed fentanyl from the Pacific side ports
 

11907
03:41:30,600 --> 03:41:31,370
fed fentanyl from the Pacific side ports
and

11908
03:41:31,370 --> 03:41:31,380
and
 

11909
03:41:31,380 --> 03:41:34,790
and
and suspiciously you know you you want

11910
03:41:34,790 --> 03:41:34,800

11951
03:42:23,640 --> 03:42:26,510
wave of uh Caravans coming to Tijuana
you saw it was it was pretty bad you

11952
03:42:26,510 --> 03:42:26,520
you saw it was it was pretty bad you
 

11953
03:42:26,520 --> 03:42:28,610
you saw it was it was pretty bad you
know it was pretty bad it could have

11954
03:42:28,610 --> 03:42:28,620
know it was pretty bad it could have
 

11955
03:42:28,620 --> 03:42:30,050
know it was pretty bad it could have
gotten worse

11956
03:42:30,050 --> 03:42:30,060
gotten worse
 

11957
03:42:30,060 --> 03:42:32,330
gotten worse
now what is going to happen when that

11958
03:42:32,330 --> 03:42:32,340
now what is going to happen when that
 

11959
03:42:32,340 --> 03:42:35,510
now what is going to happen when that
wave is no not no longer 3 000 but you

11960
03:42:35,510 --> 03:42:35,520
wave is no not no longer 3 000 but you
 

11961
03:42:35,520 --> 03:42:37,610
wave is no not no longer 3 000 but you
know a million people being displaced by

11962
03:42:37,610 --> 03:42:37,620
know a million people being displaced by
 

11963
03:42:37,620 --> 03:42:39,889
know a million people being displaced by
violence or being

11964
03:42:39,889 --> 03:42:39,899
violence or being
 

11965
03:42:39,899 --> 03:42:42,650

03:42:42,650 --> 03:42:42,660
in fear of whatever conflict might
 

11967
03:42:42,660 --> 03:42:44,990
in fear of whatever conflict might
originate down there and just that

11968
03:42:44,990 --> 03:42:45,000
originate down there and just that
 

11969
03:42:45,000 --> 03:42:49,610
originate down there and just that
massive wave of migration and move like

11970
03:42:49,610 --> 03:42:49,620

 

11971
03:42:49,620 --> 03:42:50,929

I think that that's a that's an

11972
03:42:50,929 --> 03:42:50,939
I think that that's a that's an
 

11973
03:42:50,939 --> 03:42:52,910
I think that that's a that's an
interesting thing that people should

11974
03:42:52,910 --> 03:42:52,920
interesting thing that people should
 

11975
03:42:52,920 --> 03:42:56,210
interesting thing that people should
look at and you know how can you affect

11976
03:42:56,210 --> 03:42:56,220
look at and you know how can you affect
 

11977
03:42:56,220 --> 03:42:58,670
look at and you know how can you affect
change to try and stop some of the these

11978
03:42:58,670 --> 03:42:58,680
change to try and stop some of the these
 

11979
03:42:58,680 --> 03:42:59,809
change to try and stop some of the these
things that happen

11980
03:42:59,809 --> 03:42:59,819
things that happen
 

11981
03:42:59,819 --> 03:43:01,969
things that happen
well let me ask you to philosophical at

11982
03:43:01,969 --> 03:43:01,979
well let me ask you to philosophical at
 

11983
03:43:01,979 --> 03:43:03,170
well let me ask you to philosophical at
a human level what do you think about

11984
03:43:03,170 --> 03:43:03,180
a human level what do you think about
 

11985

a legal and legal immigration
from the direction of Mexico to the

from the direction of Mexico to the
 

11991
03:43:10,680 --> 03:43:13,610
from the direction of Mexico to the
United States so we have an estimated 11

11992
03:43:13,610 --> 03:43:13,620
United States so we have an estimated 11
 

11993
03:43:13,620 --> 03:43:15,290
United States so we have an estimated 11
million illegal immigrants in the United

States
 

11997
03:43:17,520 --> 03:43:21,190
States
and uh estimated 45 million legal

11998
03:43:21,190 --> 03:43:21,200
and uh estimated 45 million legal
 

11999
03:43:21,200 --> 03:43:25,250
and uh estimated 45 million legal
immigrants a few things about that when

12000
03:43:25,250 --> 03:43:25,260
immigrants a few things about that when
 

12001
03:43:25,260 --> 03:43:27,710
immigrants a few things about that when
cobit hit there was no shortages of uh

12002
03:43:27,710 --> 03:43:27,720
cobit hit there was no shortages of uh
 

12003
03:43:27,720 --> 03:43:30,530
cobit hit there was no shortages of uh
produce on the in the supermarkets

12004
03:43:30,530 --> 03:43:30,540
produce on the in the supermarkets
 

12005
03:43:30,540 --> 03:43:33,590
produce on the in the supermarkets
which means that I mean illegal

12006
03:43:33,590 --> 03:43:33,600
which means that I mean illegal
 

12007
03:43:33,600 --> 03:43:35,210
which means that I mean illegal
immigration is pretty much the backbone

12008
03:43:35,210 --> 03:43:35,220
immigration is pretty much the backbone
 

12009
03:43:35,220 --> 03:43:37,070
immigration is pretty much the backbone
of all uh produce and some of the

12010
03:43:37,070 --> 03:43:37,080
of all uh produce and some of the
 

12011
03:43:37,080 --> 03:43:38,870
of all uh produce and some of the
farming Industries out there you know

12012
03:43:38,870 --> 03:43:38,880
farming Industries out there you know
 

12013
03:43:38,880 --> 03:43:40,130
farming Industries out there you know
most of it

12014
03:43:40,130 --> 03:43:40,140
most of it
 

12015
03:43:40,140 --> 03:43:43,090
most of it
so illegal immigration and illegal

12016
03:43:43,090 --> 03:43:43,100
so illegal immigration and illegal
 

12017

12019
03:43:45,479 --> 03:43:47,690
illegal workers in those fields are
essential workers in a way

12020

essential workers in a way
 

12021
03:43:47,700 --> 03:43:49,370
essential workers in a way
I think there's a weird relationship in

03:43:49,370 --> 03:43:49,380
I think there's a weird relationship in
 

12023
03:43:49,380 --> 03:43:50,389
I think there's a weird relationship in
the United States with some of these

12024
03:43:50,389 --> 03:43:50,399
the United States with some of these
 

12025
03:43:50,399 --> 03:43:52,550
the United States with some of these
workers and how they're demonized and

12027
03:43:52,560 --> 03:43:54,110

how they're called criminals I think

12028
03:43:54,110 --> 03:43:54,120
how they're called criminals I think
 

12029
03:43:54,120 --> 03:43:55,070
how they're called criminals I think
there's

12030
03:43:55,070 --> 03:43:55,080
there's
