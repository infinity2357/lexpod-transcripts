really at that age at 18 years old I

2100
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:01,500
really at that age at 18 years old I
 

2101
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,530
really at that age at 18 years old I
sort of

2102
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:02,540
sort of
 

2103
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,690
sort of
started dabbling with the idea of that I

2104
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:05,700
started dabbling with the idea of that I
 

2105
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,270
started dabbling with the idea of that I
could be part of helping these people to

2106
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:08,280
could be part of helping these people to
 

2107
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,430
could be part of helping these people to
protect this place that I loved and of

2108
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:10,440
protect this place that I loved and of
 

2109
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,010
protect this place that I loved and of
course at that time that idea seemed

2110
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,020
course at that time that idea seemed
 

2111
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,410
course at that time that idea seemed
like too large of a dream or too large

2112
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,420
like too large of a dream or too large
 

2113
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,630
like too large of a dream or too large
of a of a challenge so that I could

2114
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:17,640
of a of a challenge so that I could
 

2115
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,970
of a of a challenge so that I could
actually impact it

2116
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:19,980
actually impact it
 

2117
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,670
actually impact it
so what was the Journey of looking for

2118
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:22,680
so what was the Journey of looking for
 

2119
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,490
so what was the Journey of looking for
these giant snakes

2120
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:24,500
these giant snakes
 

2121
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,130
these giant snakes
of uh looking for anacondas

2122
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,140
of uh looking for anacondas
 

2123
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,569
of uh looking for anacondas
what are anacondas Anaconda is

2124
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:32,579
what are anacondas Anaconda is
 

2125
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,910
what are anacondas Anaconda is
the largest snake on earth so you have

2126
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:34,920
the largest snake on earth so you have
 

2127
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,710
the largest snake on earth so you have
reticulated pythons in Southeast Asia

2128
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,720
reticulated pythons in Southeast Asia
 

2129
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,089
reticulated pythons in Southeast Asia
they're actually longer

2130
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:38,099
they're actually longer
 

2131
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,329
they're actually longer
but anacondas are these massive boas

2132
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:41,339
but anacondas are these massive boas
 

2133
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:44,390
but anacondas are these massive boas
they give live birth and unlike a lot of

2134
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,400
they give live birth and unlike a lot of
 

2135
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,490
they give live birth and unlike a lot of
other species so an anaconda starts off

2136
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:46,500
other species so an anaconda starts off
 

2137
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,290
other species so an anaconda starts off
you know a little two foot anaconda just

you know a little two foot anaconda just
a little thicker than your finger a

2140
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:49,500
a little thicker than your finger a
 

2141
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,130
a little thicker than your finger a
little baby and their food for

2142
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:52,140

about a 25 30 foot 300 400 pound snake
with a head bigger than a football and

2164
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
with a head bigger than a football and
 

2165
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,609
with a head bigger than a football and
these things that means that they impact

2166
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:19,619
these things that means that they impact
 

2167
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,470
these things that means that they impact
the entire ecosystem which is very

2168
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:21,480
the entire ecosystem which is very
 

2169
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,390
the entire ecosystem which is very
unique moves up the food chain to become

2170
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:23,400
unique moves up the food chain to become
 

2171
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,390
unique moves up the food chain to become
basically the best Predator yeah yeah

2172
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400

so that's so interesting is just eating
 

2177
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:32,450
so that's so interesting is just eating
your way up to food eating your way up

2178

your way up to food eating your way up
the food chain if you can survive and

2180
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:33,960
the food chain if you can survive and

2187
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,150
you know so I showed up in the Amazon I
was like so where the anaconda's at and

2199
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,690
special swamps they're people kill them
and so we went to the floating Forest

2200
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:53,700
and so we went to the floating Forest
 

2201
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,609
and so we went to the floating Forest
after we'd come back from

2202
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:55,619
after we'd come back from
 

2203
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,589
after we'd come back from
an expedition we'd call like a 12-foot

00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
an expedition we'd call like a 12-foot
 

2205
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,270
an expedition we'd call like a 12-foot
anaconda and it's now it's become like

00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,569
the on the ground and it All Shook and
the stars are reflecting on the ground

2252
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:47,579
the stars are reflecting on the ground
 

2253
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,089
the stars are reflecting on the ground
and what we realize is that it's a lake

2254
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:50,099
and what we realize is that it's a lake
 

2255
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,030
and what we realize is that it's a lake
with floating grass on top of it yeah

2256
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
with floating grass on top of it yeah
 

2257
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,370
with floating grass on top of it yeah
and there's islands of grass floating on

2258
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:55,380
and there's islands of grass floating on
 

2259
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,130
and there's islands of grass floating on
this Lake very life of pie and the tops

2260
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,140
this Lake very life of pie and the tops

of trees are coming out of the surface
 

2263
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,490
of trees are coming out of the surface
of the water and so we start walking

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:01,500
of the water and so we start walking
 

2265
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,490
of the water and so we start walking
across this and JJ's going

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,190
yeah so I jumped on the snake and the
only measurement I have of this animal

2328
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,200
only measurement I have of this animal
 

2329
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,810
only measurement I have of this animal
is that when I wrapped my arms around it

2330
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:17,820
is that when I wrapped my arms around it
 

2331
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,490
is that when I wrapped my arms around it
I couldn't touch my fingers yeah yeah

2332
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:19,500
I couldn't touch my fingers yeah yeah
 

2333
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,310
I couldn't touch my fingers yeah yeah
and so I was you know my my feet were

2334
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:22,320
and so I was you know my my feet were
 

2335
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,349
and so I was you know my my feet were
dragging into her credit this Anaconda

2336
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:24,359
dragging into her credit this Anaconda
 

2337
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,609
dragging into her credit this Anaconda
did not turn around and eat me because

2338
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:25,619
did not turn around and eat me because
 

2339
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,010
did not turn around and eat me because
her head was you know this bad and and

2340
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,020
her head was you know this bad and and
 

2341
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,650
her head was you know this bad and and
she went and she reached the edge of the

2342
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:30,660
she went and she reached the edge of the
 

2343
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,810
she went and she reached the edge of the
the Grass Island and she starts plunging

2344
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:32,820
the Grass Island and she starts plunging
 

2345
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,329
the Grass Island and she starts plunging
into the dark and so I'm watching the

2346
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:35,339
into the dark and so I'm watching the
 

2347
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,730
into the dark and so I'm watching the
Stars vibrate as this anaconda's going

2348
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:37,740
Stars vibrate as this anaconda's going
 

2349
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,349
Stars vibrate as this anaconda's going
and I had to make the choice

2350
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:39,359
and I had to make the choice
 

2351
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,410
and I had to make the choice
of either going head first down into the

2352
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:42,420
of either going head first down into the
 

2353
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,670
of either going head first down into the
black which no thank you or stopping and

2354
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:46,680
black which no thank you or stopping and
 

2355
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,530
black which no thank you or stopping and
just keeping my hand on this thing as it

2356
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:48,540
just keeping my hand on this thing as it
 

2357
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,329
just keeping my hand on this thing as it
raced by me and I just felt the scales

2358
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:50,339
raced by me and I just felt the scales
 

2359
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,730
raced by me and I just felt the scales
and the muscle and the power go by and

2360
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:52,740
and the muscle and the power go by and
 

2361
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,349
and the muscle and the power go by and
then eventually taper down to the tail

2362
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:54,359
then eventually taper down to the tail
 

2363
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,030
then eventually taper down to the tail
until it slipped away into the darkness

2364
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,040
until it slipped away into the darkness
 

2365
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,270
until it slipped away into the darkness
and I was laying there just panting

2366
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
and I was laying there just panting
 

2367
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,890
and I was laying there just panting
then I turned around and went JJ what

2368
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:00,900
then I turned around and went JJ what
 

2369
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,290
then I turned around and went JJ what
the [\h__\h] like where were you man and he

2370
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:03,300
the [\h__\h] like where were you man and he
 

2371
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,089
the [\h__\h] like where were you man and he
was just like completely white circuits

2372
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:05,099
was just like completely white circuits
 

2373
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,530
was just like completely white circuits
blown and I had to go then like kind of

2374
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:06,540
blown and I had to go then like kind of
 

2375
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,730
blown and I had to go then like kind of
like take care of him I was like are you

2376
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:07,740
like take care of him I was like are you
 

2377
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,250
like take care of him I was like are you
okay and he was like no

2378
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:10,260
okay and he was like no
 

2379
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,190
okay and he was like no
he you know he just couldn't and so we

2380
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,200
he you know he just couldn't and so we
 

2381
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,930
he you know he just couldn't and so we
came back with that and then

2382
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:14,940
came back with that and then
 

2383
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,270
came back with that and then
after that we were like okay clearly

2384
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,280
after that we were like okay clearly
 

2385
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,250
after that we were like okay clearly
clearly the parameters of reality that

2386
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:19,260
clearly the parameters of reality that
 

2387
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,170
clearly the parameters of reality that
we thought were possible are are are

2388
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:21,180
we thought were possible are are are
 

2389
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,030
we thought were possible are are are
just a tiny fraction of what's out there

2390
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
just a tiny fraction of what's out there
 

2391
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,710
just a tiny fraction of what's out there
like we we now that that sort of

2392
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:24,720
like we we now that that sort of
 

2393
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,990
like we we now that that sort of
recalibrated us we were like okay we're

2394
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,000
recalibrated us we were like okay we're
 

2395
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,430
recalibrated us we were like okay we're
rubbing up against things that are

2396
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:28,440
rubbing up against things that are
 

2397
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,450
rubbing up against things that are
bigger than we thought were ever

2398
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:29,460
bigger than we thought were ever
 

2399
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,309
bigger than we thought were ever
possible and so we were like okay now we

2400
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:31,319
possible and so we were like okay now we
 

2401
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:34,069
possible and so we were like okay now we
need to we need to concentrate on this

2402
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,079
need to we need to concentrate on this
 

2403
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,730
need to we need to concentrate on this
so how dangerous is that creature to you

2890
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:51,540
I've done I've gotten more head catches
 

2891
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,030
I've done I've gotten more head catches
than anybody so I'm usually Point guy

2892
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
than anybody so I'm usually Point guy
 

2893
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,970
than anybody so I'm usually Point guy
and you know you get you're the you're

2894
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:55,980
and you know you get you're the you're
 

2895
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,930
and you know you get you're the you're
the the first the the point guy okay the

2896
00:51:59,930 --> 00:51:59,940
the the first the the point guy okay the
 

2897
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,809
the the first the the point guy okay the
the taking the big risky yes First Step

2898
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:02,819
the taking the big risky yes First Step
 

2899
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,490
the taking the big risky yes First Step
yes although it could be argued that

2900
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:04,500
yes although it could be argued that
 

2901
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,589
yes although it could be argued that
there's a similarly large risk for the

2902
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:06,599
there's a similarly large risk for the
 

2903
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,510
there's a similarly large risk for the
tail guy because the anaconda's defense

2904
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:08,520
tail guy because the anaconda's defense
 

2905
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,569
tail guy because the anaconda's defense
is to take a giant projectile [\h__\h] and

2906
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:11,579
is to take a giant projectile [\h__\h] and
 

2907
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,490
is to take a giant projectile [\h__\h] and
so the person that gets the tail is

2908
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:13,500
so the person that gets the tail is
 

2909
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,230
so the person that gets the tail is
gonna smell like Anaconda for like at

2910
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:15,240
gonna smell like Anaconda for like at
 

2911
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,329
gonna smell like Anaconda for like at

00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:35,220
the Mercury that's coming off the gold
 

2933
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,069
the Mercury that's coming off the gold
mining in the region and so anacondas

2934
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:37,079
mining in the region and so anacondas
 

2935
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:38,030
mining in the region and so anacondas
can be

2936
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:38,040
can be
 

2937
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,609
can be
indicative for us of how is Mercury

2938
00:52:40,609 --> 00:52:40,619
indicative for us of how is Mercury
 

2939
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,609
indicative for us of how is Mercury
moving through this ecosystem and this

2940
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:43,619
moving through this ecosystem and this
 

2941
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,349
moving through this ecosystem and this
is a region where we've lost hundreds of

2942
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:45,359
is a region where we've lost hundreds of
 

2943
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,849
is a region where we've lost hundreds of
thousands of acres to artisanal gold

2944
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:46,859
thousands of acres to artisanal gold
 

2945
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:49,250
thousands of acres to artisanal gold
mining where they use mercury to bind

2946
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:49,260
mining where they use mercury to bind
 

2947
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,109
mining where they use mercury to bind
the gold they cut the forest burn the

2948
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:51,119
the gold they cut the forest burn the
 

2949
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,130
the gold they cut the forest burn the
forest

2950
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:52,140
forest
 

2951
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,109
forest
and then they run water through the sand

2952
00:52:54,109 --> 00:52:54,119
and then they run water through the sand
 

2953
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,270
and then they run water through the sand
and the sand particles have bits of gold

2954
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:56,280
and the sand particles have bits of gold
 

2955
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,309
and the sand particles have bits of gold
in it not chunks but just little almost

2956
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
in it not chunks but just little almost
 

2957
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,130
in it not chunks but just little almost
microscopic flecks of gold and then they

2958
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:01,140
microscopic flecks of gold and then they
 

2959
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,010
microscopic flecks of gold and then they
use the Mercury to bind that and then

2960
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:04,020
use the Mercury to bind that and then
 

2961
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,930
use the Mercury to bind that and then
they burn off the Mercury and that Vapor

2962
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:05,940
they burn off the Mercury and that Vapor
 

2963
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,670
they burn off the Mercury and that Vapor
goes up into the clouds just like

2964
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:07,680
goes up into the clouds just like
 

2965
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,170
goes up into the clouds just like
everything else it's all connected down

2966
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:09,180
everything else it's all connected down
 

2967
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,030
everything else it's all connected down
there and then rains down into the

2968
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,040
there and then rains down into the
 

2969
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,770
there and then rains down into the
rivers and so the people in the region

2970
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:12,780
rivers and so the people in the region
 

2971
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,870
rivers and so the people in the region
are having birth defects from the amount

2972
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:14,880
are having birth defects from the amount
 

2973
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,130
are having birth defects from the amount
of Mercury

2974
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,140
of Mercury
 

2975
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,809
of Mercury
that's in the water and so we were

2976
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:17,819
that's in the water and so we were
 

2977
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,490
that's in the water and so we were
starting at at one point when we were

2978
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:19,500
starting at at one point when we were
 

2979
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,589
starting at at one point when we were
doing most of our Anaconda research we

2980
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:21,599
doing most of our Anaconda research we
 

2981
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,150
doing most of our Anaconda research we
were learning things like these animals

2982
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:23,160
were learning things like these animals
 

2983
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,890
were learning things like these animals
actually aren't just Ambush Predators

2984
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:24,900
actually aren't just Ambush Predators
 

2985
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,150
actually aren't just Ambush Predators
which is what most of the literature

2986
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:26,160
which is what most of the literature
 

2987
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,410
which is what most of the literature
will tell you is that anacondas are

2988
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,420
will tell you is that anacondas are
 

2989
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,670
will tell you is that anacondas are
Ambush predators no they actually go

2990
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:28,680
Ambush predators no they actually go
 

2991
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,609
Ambush predators no they actually go
hunting they'll go find clay licks and

2992
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:31,619
hunting they'll go find clay licks and
 

2993
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:33,170
hunting they'll go find clay licks and
salt deposits and they'll wait there

2994
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:33,180
salt deposits and they'll wait there
 

2995
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,930
salt deposits and they'll wait there
they'll actually pursue animals and we

2996
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:35,940
they'll actually pursue animals and we
 

2997
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,730
they'll actually pursue animals and we
were trying to take tissue samples to

2998
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:37,740
were trying to take tissue samples to
 

2999
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,770
were trying to take tissue samples to
find out if anacondas could be used to

3000
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:39,780
find out if anacondas could be used to
 

3001
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,990
find out if anacondas could be used to
study how Mercury is moving through the

3002
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
study how Mercury is moving through the
 

3003
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,030
study how Mercury is moving through the
ecosystem and so that was really it

3004
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,040
ecosystem and so that was really it
 

3005
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,309
ecosystem and so that was really it
became can we use these animals not only

3006
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
became can we use these animals not only
 

3007
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,349
became can we use these animals not only
as ambassadors for wildlife because

3008
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:48,359
as ambassadors for wildlife because
 

3009
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,109
as ambassadors for wildlife because
everybody wants to see the anacondas but

3010
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
everybody wants to see the anacondas but
 

3011
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,370
everybody wants to see the anacondas but
also

3012
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:52,380
also
 

3013
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,290
also
you know what can we learn from studying

3014
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:54,300
you know what can we learn from studying
 

3015
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,329
you know what can we learn from studying
this very very little understood apex

3016
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:56,339
this very very little understood apex
 

3017
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:57,710
this very very little understood apex
predator and one of the things you can

3018
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:57,720
predator and one of the things you can
 

3019
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,329
predator and one of the things you can
learn is how Mercury moves through

3020
00:53:59,329 --> 00:53:59,339
learn is how Mercury moves through
 

3021
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:01,370
learn is how Mercury moves through
through the ecosystem which can damage

3022
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:01,380
through the ecosystem which can damage
 

3023
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,750
through the ecosystem which can damage
the ecosystem with all kinds of

3024
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:02,760
the ecosystem with all kinds of
 

3025
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,549
the ecosystem with all kinds of
different ways yeah it's it's brutal man

3026
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:04,559
different ways yeah it's it's brutal man
 

3027
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,710
different ways yeah it's it's brutal man
the the gold mining that's happening

3028
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
the the gold mining that's happening
 

3029
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,569
the the gold mining that's happening
down there is is it's funny because

3030
00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:08,579
down there is is it's funny because
 

3031
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,950
down there is is it's funny because
we've been hearing a lot recently about

3032
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:09,960
we've been hearing a lot recently about
 

3033
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,710
we've been hearing a lot recently about
like the Cobalt mines in Africa and it's

3034
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,720
like the Cobalt mines in Africa and it's
 

3035
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,690
like the Cobalt mines in Africa and it's
like where we are in the Amazon

3036
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:14,700
like where we are in the Amazon
 

3037
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,650
like where we are in the Amazon
um we were down there with ABC News I

3038
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:18,660
um we were down there with ABC News I
 

3039
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,230
um we were down there with ABC News I
want to say like a year and a half ago

3040
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:21,240
want to say like a year and a half ago
 

3041
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,150
want to say like a year and a half ago
um with my friend Matt Gutman who's the

3042
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:23,160
um with my friend Matt Gutman who's the
 

3043
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,490
um with my friend Matt Gutman who's the
chief correspondent for ABC and we he

3044
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,500
chief correspondent for ABC and we he
 

3045
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,530
chief correspondent for ABC and we he
wanted to see the Amazon fires he wanted

3046
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:27,540
wanted to see the Amazon fires he wanted
 

3047
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,390
wanted to see the Amazon fires he wanted
to see some Wildlife he wanted to see

3048
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:29,400
to see some Wildlife he wanted to see
 

3049
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,770
to see some Wildlife he wanted to see
the areas that we're protecting and then

3050
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:30,780
the areas that we're protecting and then
 

3051
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,270
the areas that we're protecting and then
he goes I want to see

3052
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:32,280
he goes I want to see
 

3053
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,690
he goes I want to see
the gold mining areas and and I'd never

3054
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:35,700
the gold mining areas and and I'd never
 

3055
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,670
the gold mining areas and and I'd never
gotten in so deep but we we met these

3056
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:37,680
gotten in so deep but we we met these
 

3057
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,809
gotten in so deep but we we met these
Russian guy you can't go with the

3058
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:38,819
Russian guy you can't go with the
 

3059
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:40,190
Russian guy you can't go with the
proving they will kill you like our

3060
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:40,200
proving they will kill you like our
 

3061
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,049
proving they will kill you like our
lawyer's father was was assassinated for

3062
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:42,059
lawyer's father was was assassinated for
 

3063
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,790
lawyer's father was was assassinated for
standing up to the gold miners

3064
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:43,800
standing up to the gold miners
 

3065
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,710
standing up to the gold miners
there was two Russian guys though who

3066
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:45,720
there was two Russian guys though who
 

3067
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,990
there was two Russian guys though who
had a legal mining concession somehow

3068
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
had a legal mining concession somehow
 

3069
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,109
had a legal mining concession somehow
way out past the machine gun guarded

3070
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:51,119
way out past the machine gun guarded
 

3071
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,089
way out past the machine gun guarded
limit of the pumpus which is where they

3072
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:53,099
limit of the pumpus which is where they
 

3073
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:54,530
limit of the pumpus which is where they
do all this gold mining and we got in

3074
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:54,540
do all this gold mining and we got in
 

3075
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,370
do all this gold mining and we got in
there and

3076
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:55,380
there and
 

3077
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,950
there and
took footage of the desert that is

3078
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:57,960
took footage of the desert that is
 

3079
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,829
took footage of the desert that is
forming in what used to be the

3080
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:00,839
forming in what used to be the
 

3081
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,690
forming in what used to be the
headwaters of the Amazon rainforest and

3082
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:02,700
headwaters of the Amazon rainforest and
 

3083
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,750
headwaters of the Amazon rainforest and
it's like there's a massive global scale

3084
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
it's like there's a massive global scale
 

3085
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,569
it's like there's a massive global scale
ecological crime happening down there

3086
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:08,579
ecological crime happening down there
 

3087
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:11,270
ecological crime happening down there
that you can see from space from this

we had the mahogany boom where they went
out after the mahogany and you almost

3396
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:35,640
out after the mahogany and you almost
 

3397
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,370
out after the mahogany and you almost
can't find a mahogany tree in the jungle

3398
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:37,380
can't find a mahogany tree in the jungle
 

3399
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,270
can't find a mahogany tree in the jungle
anymore

3400
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:38,280
anymore
 

3401
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,250
anymore
and and if you want to talk about like

3402
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:40,260
and and if you want to talk about like
 

3403
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,410
and and if you want to talk about like
carbon sequestration in the rainforest

3404
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:42,420
carbon sequestration in the rainforest
 

3405
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,410
carbon sequestration in the rainforest
the the ancient Hardwoods hold like 60

3406
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:45,420
the the ancient Hardwoods hold like 60
 

3407
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,930
the the ancient Hardwoods hold like 60
percent of the carbon of the whole

3408
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:47,940
percent of the carbon of the whole
 

3409
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,690
percent of the carbon of the whole
rainforest they have an outsized

3410
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:49,700
rainforest they have an outsized
 

3411
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,250
rainforest they have an outsized
disproportionate Mass from from that

3412
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,260
disproportionate Mass from from that
 

3413
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,650
disproportionate Mass from from that
ancient density of the wood

3414
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:54,660
ancient density of the wood
 

3415
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,750
ancient density of the wood
and so these these these loggers go out

3416
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:56,760
and so these these these loggers go out
 

3417
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,069
and so these these these loggers go out
and they cut the wood that's most

3418
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
and they cut the wood that's most
 

3419
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,690
and they cut the wood that's most
valuable and then they bring it back to

3420
01:00:59,690 --> 01:00:59,700
valuable and then they bring it back to
 

3421
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,890
valuable and then they bring it back to
town and they sell it and then people

3422
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:00,900
town and they sell it and then people
 

3423
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,450
town and they sell it and then people
like us buy it and put it on our kitchen

3424
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:02,460
like us buy it and put it on our kitchen
 

3425
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,829
like us buy it and put it on our kitchen
floors yeah

3426
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:03,839
floors yeah
 

3427
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,430
floors yeah
and you know and so

3428
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:06,440
and you know and so
 

3429
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,410
and you know and so
the thing is is I should you know when I

3430
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:09,420
the thing is is I should you know when I
 

3431
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,670
the thing is is I should you know when I
got to the Amazon it was you know

3432
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:10,680
got to the Amazon it was you know
 

3433
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,890
got to the Amazon it was you know
loggers are the bad guys

3434
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:12,900
loggers are the bad guys
 

3435
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,510
loggers are the bad guys
and if you talk to you know a lot of

3436
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:14,520
and if you talk to you know a lot of
 

3437
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,950
and if you talk to you know a lot of
like the phds that I worked with down

3438
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:15,960
like the phds that I worked with down
 

3439
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,510
like the phds that I worked with down
there where you know always very at odds

3440
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:17,520
there where you know always very at odds
 

3441
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,010
there where you know always very at odds
with the miners at odds with the with

3442
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:19,020
with the miners at odds with the with
 

3443
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,710
with the miners at odds with the with
the loggers and then I'd be with JJ and

3444
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:21,720
the loggers and then I'd be with JJ and
 

3445
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,390
the loggers and then I'd be with JJ and
JJ would sit down and he'd be like hey

3446
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:23,400
JJ would sit down and he'd be like hey
 

3447
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,069
JJ would sit down and he'd be like hey
let's pour a drink oh they have masato

3448
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:25,079
let's pour a drink oh they have masato
 

3449
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:26,510
let's pour a drink oh they have masato
let's all sit down like we'd all be

3450
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:26,520
let's all sit down like we'd all be
 

3451
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,309
let's all sit down like we'd all be
chilling and throwing them back with a

3452
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:28,319
chilling and throwing them back with a
 

3453
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,870
chilling and throwing them back with a
bunch of lagers

3454
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:29,880
bunch of lagers
 

3455
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,930
bunch of lagers
and and then those the opportunity

3456
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:32,940
and and then those the opportunity
 

3457
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,030
and and then those the opportunity
through through not vilifying these

3458
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,040
through through not vilifying these
 

3459
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,569
through through not vilifying these
people came to be like oh these are

3460
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:38,579
people came to be like oh these are
 

3461
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:40,549
people came to be like oh these are
these are these guys are great you know

3462
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:40,559
these are these guys are great you know
 

3463
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:41,870
these are these guys are great you know
and then of course out in the wild every

3464
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:41,880
and then of course out in the wild every
 

3465
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,770
and then of course out in the wild every
now and then something will happen

3466
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:42,780
now and then something will happen
 

3467
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,450
now and then something will happen
you'll see somebody's boat flipped over

3468
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:44,460
you'll see somebody's boat flipped over
 

3469
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,069
you'll see somebody's boat flipped over
and you go you go help them out and then

3470
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:46,079
and you go you go help them out and then
 

3471
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,450
and you go you go help them out and then
that that creates a certain type of

3472
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:47,460
that that creates a certain type of
 

3473
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,670
that that creates a certain type of
kinship so they're ultimately people who

3474
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:49,680
kinship so they're ultimately people who
 

3475
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,410
kinship so they're ultimately people who
love

3476
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:51,420
love
 

3477
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,049
love
who love the same thing you love often

3478
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:54,059
who love the same thing you love often
 

3479
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:55,370
who love the same thing you love often
yeah even if they don't love it they're

3480
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:55,380
yeah even if they don't love it they're
 

3481
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,530
yeah even if they don't love it they're
people that aren't necessarily looking

3482
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:57,540
people that aren't necessarily looking
 

3483
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,809
people that aren't necessarily looking
to destroy it I've met loggers who have

3484
01:01:59,809 --> 01:01:59,819
to destroy it I've met loggers who have
 

3485
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:02,270
to destroy it I've met loggers who have
looked at at trees they're about to cut

3486
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:02,280
looked at at trees they're about to cut
 

3487
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,970
looked at at trees they're about to cut
and gone ah this is a shame start it up

3488
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:04,980
and gone ah this is a shame start it up
 

3489
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,010
and gone ah this is a shame start it up
you know they're just like this is where

3490
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:07,020
you know they're just like this is where
 

3491
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,650
you know they're just like this is where
the paycheck comes from let's come back

3492
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:09,660
the paycheck comes from let's come back
 

3493
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,849
the paycheck comes from let's come back
briefly to anacondas

3494
01:02:13,849 --> 01:02:13,859

 

3495
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,849

can you tell me uh this whole situation

3496
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:16,859
can you tell me uh this whole situation
 

3497
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,710
can you tell me uh this whole situation
with discoveries eaten alive there's

3498
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:18,720
with discoveries eaten alive there's
 

3499
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,510
with discoveries eaten alive there's
some drama and controversy around that

3500
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:20,520
some drama and controversy around that
 

3501
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,430
some drama and controversy around that
can you explain that whole Saga with

3502
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:22,440
can you explain that whole Saga with
 

3503
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,470
can you explain that whole Saga with
Discovery with

3504
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
Discovery with
 

3505
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,930
Discovery with
um with your whole effort maybe outside

3506
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:26,940
um with your whole effort maybe outside
 

3507
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,890
um with your whole effort maybe outside
of even the drama the the initial thing

3508
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:30,900
of even the drama the the initial thing
 

3509
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,190
of even the drama the the initial thing
which I now feel you're sufficiently

3510
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:34,200
which I now feel you're sufficiently
 

3511
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,190
which I now feel you're sufficiently
insane to actually do of being eaten by

3512
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,200
insane to actually do of being eaten by
 

3513
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,809
insane to actually do of being eaten by
Anaconda is that actually possible to

3514
01:02:38,809 --> 01:02:38,819
Anaconda is that actually possible to
 

3515
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:40,730
Anaconda is that actually possible to
survive something like that I mean if

3516
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:40,740
survive something like that I mean if
 

3517
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,470
survive something like that I mean if
anaconda swallows you while you're

3518
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:42,480
anaconda swallows you while you're
 

3519
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,970
anaconda swallows you while you're
wearing the suit that they made maybe

3520
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:43,980
wearing the suit that they made maybe
 

3521
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,849
wearing the suit that they made maybe
but that was in hindsight whether that

3522
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:46,859
but that was in hindsight whether that
 

3523
01:02:46,859 --> 01:02:50,270
but that was in hindsight whether that
was the result of look

3524
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:50,280
was the result of look
 

3525
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,890
was the result of look
I go to the Jungle

3526
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:51,900
I go to the Jungle
 

3527
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,170
I go to the Jungle
and you start seeing these beautiful

3528
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:54,180
and you start seeing these beautiful
 

3529
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,809
and you start seeing these beautiful
places these incredible species you

3530
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:56,819
places these incredible species you
 

3531
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,309
places these incredible species you
start developing a relationship with

3532
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
start developing a relationship with
 

3533
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,690
start developing a relationship with
these animals

3534
01:02:59,690 --> 01:02:59,700
these animals
 

3535
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,589
these animals
and then you watch it get destroyed

3536
01:03:02,589 --> 01:03:02,599
and then you watch it get destroyed
 

3537
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:06,410
and then you watch it get destroyed
every year we watch it burn every year

3538
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:06,420
every year we watch it burn every year
 

3539
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:10,309
every year we watch it burn every year
places that are are crucial to my soul I

3540
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
places that are are crucial to my soul I
 

3541
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,609
places that are are crucial to my soul I
have seen leveled and turned to Ash

3542
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:13,619
have seen leveled and turned to Ash
 

3543
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:16,789
have seen leveled and turned to Ash
and at some point we started going

3544
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:16,799
and at some point we started going
 

3545
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,670
and at some point we started going
someone has to do something about this

3546
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:19,680
someone has to do something about this
 

3547
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,230
someone has to do something about this
and you look to your right and you look

3548
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:21,240
and you look to your right and you look
 

3549
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,730
and you look to your right and you look
to your left and there is no one because

3550
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:22,740
to your left and there is no one because
 

3551
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,190
to your left and there is no one because
it's the middle of the Amazon and the

3552
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
it's the middle of the Amazon and the
 

3553
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,990
it's the middle of the Amazon and the
rainforests have been being destroyed

3554
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:27,000
rainforests have been being destroyed
 

3555
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,630
rainforests have been being destroyed
since the 70s it's a cliche

3556
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:29,640
since the 70s it's a cliche
 

3557
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,109
since the 70s it's a cliche
and so we started trying to do something

3558
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:33,119
and so we started trying to do something
 

3559
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,670
and so we started trying to do something
about it and so I started putting a

3560
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:34,680
about it and so I started putting a
 

3561
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,069
about it and so I started putting a
little bit more emphasis on

3562
01:03:37,069 --> 01:03:37,079
little bit more emphasis on
 

3563
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,049
little bit more emphasis on
on publicity a little bit more emphasis

3564
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:39,059
on publicity a little bit more emphasis
 

3565
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:40,490
on publicity a little bit more emphasis
on getting the message out there and so

3566
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:40,500
on getting the message out there and so
 

3567
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,890
on getting the message out there and so
I started trying to see how what was

3568
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:42,900
I started trying to see how what was
 

3569
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,930

in front of this Boulder and hold it
 

3609
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,549
in front of this Boulder and hold it
back

3610
01:04:25,549 --> 01:04:25,559
back
 

3611
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,130

tuna can you pour a little bit of diesel
 

4829
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,750
tuna can you pour a little bit of diesel
in it it burns slow you light it and you

4830
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
in it it burns slow you light it and you
 

4831

something or you just eat a fish raw how
 

4847
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,890
something or you just eat a fish raw how
important is it to stay dry is it

4848
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:39,900
important is it to stay dry is it
 

4849
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,149
important is it to stay dry is it
basically impossible it's impossible to

4850
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:41,159
basically impossible it's impossible to
 

4851
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:43,130
basically impossible it's impossible to
stay dry you're wet all the time you're

4852
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:43,140
stay dry you're wet all the time you're
 

4853
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,870
stay dry you're wet all the time you're
wet all the time what does that mean

4854
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880
wet all the time what does that mean
 

4855
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,090
wet all the time what does that mean
that means infections are more efficient

4856
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:47,100
that means infections are more efficient
 

4857
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,130
that means infections are more efficient
yeah

4858
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:49,140

years old and also when you when you see

4938
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:13,739
years old and also when you when you see
 

4939
01:27:13,739 --> 01:27:16,370
years old and also when you when you see
that picture you can imagine that I

4940
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:16,380
that picture you can imagine that I
 

4941
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:19,070
that picture you can imagine that I
assumed that my life was over because I

4942
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:19,080
assumed that my life was over because I
 

4943
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,570
assumed that my life was over because I
didn't know what it was and I also

4944
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:20,580
didn't know what it was and I also
 

4945
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,189
didn't know what it was and I also
didn't assume that or at the very least

4946
01:27:22,189 --> 01:27:22,199
didn't assume that or at the very least
 

4947
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:23,810
didn't assume that or at the very least
I figured I'd be disfigured the rest of

4948
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:23,820
I figured I'd be disfigured the rest of
 

4949
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:24,770
I figured I'd be disfigured the rest of
my life I didn't think there was any

4950
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:24,780
my life I didn't think there was any
 

4951
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,450
my life I didn't think there was any
getting better from that

4952
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:26,460
getting better from that
 

4953
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,310
getting better from that
and so I remember sitting by the side of

4954
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,320
and so I remember sitting by the side of
 

4955
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,870
and so I remember sitting by the side of
the river praying that a boat would come

4956
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:29,880
the river praying that a boat would come
 

4957
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,490
the river praying that a boat would come
by but it was the rainy season there

4958
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:31,500
by but it was the rainy season there
 

4959
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,810
by but it was the rainy season there
aren't going to be any boats because the

4960
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:32,820
aren't going to be any boats because the
 

4961
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,209
aren't going to be any boats because the
river is psychotic

4962

infections so like forget Neosporin

5166
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:55,080
infections so like forget Neosporin
 

5167
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,470
infections so like forget Neosporin
that's a joke these are heavy chemical

5168
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:57,480
that's a joke these are heavy chemical
 

5169
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,910
that's a joke these are heavy chemical
compounds running through these trees

5170
01:30:58,910 --> 01:30:58,920
compounds running through these trees
 

5171
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:01,010
compounds running through these trees
and they know all about them and so

5172
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:01,020
and they know all about them and so
 

5173
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,689
and they know all about them and so
whatever it is so now at this point

5174
01:31:02,689 --> 01:31:02,699
whatever it is so now at this point
 

5175
01:31:02,699 --> 01:31:04,550
whatever it is so now at this point
that's no longer an issue like because

5176
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:04,560
that's no longer an issue like because
 

5177
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,649
that's no longer an issue like because
we know how to handle it which at that

5178
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:06,659
we know how to handle it which at that
 

5179
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:09,110
we know how to handle it which at that
time if JJ had been there I would have

5180
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:09,120
time if JJ had been there I would have
 

5181

emotional level
and you know when you think about

5738
01:40:29,209 --> 01:40:29,219
and you know when you think about
 

5739
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:31,129
and you know when you think about
elephants in terms of the fact that you

5740
01:40:31,129 --> 01:40:31,139
elephants in terms of the fact that you
 

5741
01:40:31,139 --> 01:40:33,229
elephants in terms of the fact that you
know people go oh you know they they use

medication to induce labor it's like
 

5745
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,770
medication to induce labor it's like
yeah that's not that surprising they

5746
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:36,780
yeah that's not that surprising they
 

5747
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,750
yeah that's not that surprising they
they they hold the bones of the dead

5748

it's like yeah they have the best smell
 

5751
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,810
it's like yeah they have the best smell
of pretty much any animal that's also

5752
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:41,820
of pretty much any animal that's also
 

5753
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:42,950
of pretty much any animal that's also
not surprising they probably know

5754
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:42,960
not surprising they probably know
 

5755
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,890
not surprising they probably know
exactly who that was that bone

5756
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:45,900
exactly who that was that bone
 

5757
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:49,010
exactly who that was that bone
but they can navigate to water holes and

5758
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:49,020
but they can navigate to water holes and
 

5759
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:51,649
but they can navigate to water holes and
communicate in ways that we cannot

5760
01:40:51,649 --> 01:40:51,659
communicate in ways that we cannot
 

5761
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:53,390
communicate in ways that we cannot
really figure out and so when you hear

5762
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:53,400
really figure out and so when you hear
 

5763
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,070
really figure out and so when you hear
about people measuring out elephant

5764
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:55,080
about people measuring out elephant
 

5765
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:56,570
about people measuring out elephant
intelligence

5766
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:56,580
intelligence
 

5767
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,250
intelligence
you'll hear about scientists being like

5768
01:40:58,250 --> 01:40:58,260
you'll hear about scientists being like
 

5769
01:40:58,260 --> 01:40:59,689
you'll hear about scientists being like
oh well we gave it a you know a bucket

5770
01:40:59,689 --> 01:40:59,699
oh well we gave it a you know a bucket
 

5771

01:41:01,129 --> 01:41:01,139
with a hole in it and then it had like a
 

5773
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,629
with a hole in it and then it had like a
key and there was a rope and you're like

5774
01:41:02,629 --> 01:41:02,639
key and there was a rope and you're like
 

5775
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,610
key and there was a rope and you're like
bro this is all

5776
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:04,620
bro this is all
 

5777
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:07,910
bro this is all
human stuff yeah can you go walking with

5778
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:07,920
human stuff yeah can you go walking with
 

5779
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,350
human stuff yeah can you go walking with
them for three weeks in the wild and

5780
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:09,360
them for three weeks in the wild and
 

5781
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,550
them for three weeks in the wild and
watch how they deal with the problems

5782
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:10,560
watch how they deal with the problems
 

5783
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,709
watch how they deal with the problems
that they encounter in the forest

5784
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:12,719
that they encounter in the forest
 

5785
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:15,830
that they encounter in the forest
and so elephants have become especially

5786
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:15,840
and so elephants have become especially
 

5787
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,209
and so elephants have become especially
recently with the work that's been gone

you know
elephants the elephant the African

elephants the elephant the African
 

5801
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,410
elephants the elephant the African
elephant population right now is down at

5802
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:30,420
elephant population right now is down at
 

5803
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:32,030
elephant population right now is down at
two percent of what it was a few hundred

5804
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:32,040
two percent of what it was a few hundred
 

5805
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:34,129
two percent of what it was a few hundred
years ago were really we're really

5806
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:34,139
years ago were really we're really
 

5807
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:35,629
years ago were really we're really
putting them on the brink of you know

5808
01:41:35,629 --> 01:41:35,639
putting them on the brink of you know
 

5809
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:36,950
putting them on the brink of you know
there's there's some elephants that are

5810
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:36,960
there's there's some elephants that are
 

5811
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,689
there's there's some elephants that are
being born tuskless

5812
01:41:38,689 --> 01:41:38,699
being born tuskless
 

5813
01:41:38,699 --> 01:41:40,129
being born tuskless
because we've

5814
01:41:40,129 --> 01:41:40,139
because we've
 

5815
01:41:40,139 --> 01:41:42,709
because we've
poaching has taken down

5816
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:42,719
poaching has taken down
 

5817
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:44,750
poaching has taken down
the great tuskers to the point where now

5818
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:44,760
the great tuskers to the point where now
 

5819
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,490
the great tuskers to the point where now
it's it's actually beneficial for some

5820
01:41:46,490 --> 01:41:46,500
it's it's actually beneficial for some
 

5821
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,870
it's it's actually beneficial for some
elephants to not have tusks because

5822
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:47,880
elephants to not have tusks because
 

5823
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,370
elephants to not have tusks because
anyone have humans but that's that's

5824
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:49,380
anyone have humans but that's that's
 

5825
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:50,990
anyone have humans but that's that's
like we've created deformed elephants

5826
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:51,000
like we've created deformed elephants
 

5827
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,209
like we've created deformed elephants
and so like now I'm

5828
01:41:53,209 --> 01:41:53,219
and so like now I'm
 

5829
01:41:53,219 --> 01:41:55,250
and so like now I'm
gotten very concerned with

5830
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:55,260
gotten very concerned with
 

5831
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:57,470
gotten very concerned with
issues of elephants and tusks are

5832
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:57,480
issues of elephants and tusks are
 

5833
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:58,850
issues of elephants and tusks are
fundamental to the interaction between

5834
01:41:58,850 --> 01:41:58,860
fundamental to the interaction between
 

5835
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:00,890
fundamental to the interaction between
elephants absolutely I mean with males

5836
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:00,900
elephants absolutely I mean with males
 

5837
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,270
elephants absolutely I mean with males
compete with each other but also

5838
01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:02,280
compete with each other but also
 

5839

01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:05,340
they'll they'll break a branch and
 

5843
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:06,590
they'll they'll break a branch and
they'll be like this is a good Branch

5844
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:06,600
they'll be like this is a good Branch
 

5845
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:07,850
they'll be like this is a good Branch
I'm going to eat the hell out of this

5846
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:07,860
I'm going to eat the hell out of this
 

5847
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,709
I'm going to eat the hell out of this
and they'll like hang it on their Tusk

5848
01:42:09,709 --> 01:42:09,719
and they'll like hang it on their Tusk
 

5849
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:11,030
and they'll like hang it on their Tusk
and they'll like grab a bunch of other

5884
01:42:45,709 --> 01:42:45,719
mean if you got the big tusks and there
 

5885
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:47,330
mean if you got the big tusks and there
are elephants out there like the mammoth

5886
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:47,340
are elephants out there like the mammoth
 

5887
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:51,169
are elephants out there like the mammoth
big tuskers that have tusks down to the

big tuskers that have tusks down to the
 

5889
01:42:51,179 --> 01:42:53,390
big tuskers that have tusks down to the
ground like huge and when you see them

5890
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:53,400
ground like huge and when you see them
 

5891
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,010
ground like huge and when you see them
it's like seeing something unique on

5892
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:55,020
it's like seeing something unique on
 

5893
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,510
it's like seeing something unique on
Earth Earth unique in history because

5894
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:56,520
Earth Earth unique in history because
 

5895
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:57,649
Earth Earth unique in history because
we're at a point where we might lose

5896
01:42:57,649 --> 01:42:57,659
we're at a point where we might lose
 

5897
01:42:57,659 --> 01:42:59,810
we're at a point where we might lose
those there are only a few of them left

5898
01:42:59,810 --> 01:42:59,820
those there are only a few of them left
 

5899
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:01,729
those there are only a few of them left
and then they're so prized by hunters

5900
01:43:01,729 --> 01:43:01,739
and then they're so prized by hunters
 

5901
01:43:01,739 --> 01:43:03,890
and then they're so prized by hunters
yeah it's interesting because I I forget

5902
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:03,900
yeah it's interesting because I I forget
 

5903
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,350
yeah it's interesting because I I forget
what the actual conclusion on that is

5904
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:06,360
what the actual conclusion on that is
 

5905
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,570
what the actual conclusion on that is
because there's some studies of the use

5906
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:08,580
because there's some studies of the use
 

5907
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:11,570
because there's some studies of the use
of the value of Beauty in evolution like

5908
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:11,580
of the value of Beauty in evolution like
 

5909
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:14,030
of the value of Beauty in evolution like
birds yeah and peacocks and so on that

5910
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:14,040
birds yeah and peacocks and so on that
 

5911
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,370
birds yeah and peacocks and so on that
there's no actual

5912
01:43:16,370 --> 01:43:16,380
there's no actual
 

5913
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:19,910
there's no actual
value to it but it

5914
01:43:19,910 --> 01:43:19,920
value to it but it
 

5915
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,250
value to it but it
plays a role in in sexual selection

5916
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:22,260
plays a role in in sexual selection
 

5917
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:24,229
plays a role in in sexual selection
meaning value like

5918
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:24,239
meaning value like
 

5919
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:25,490
meaning value like
it's much easier to understand

5920
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:25,500
it's much easier to understand
 

5921
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,649
it's much easier to understand
competition like a Tusk helps you defeat

5922
01:43:27,649 --> 01:43:27,659
competition like a Tusk helps you defeat
 

5923
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:30,290
competition like a Tusk helps you defeat
sure the competitive tool but I bet you

5924
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:30,300
sure the competitive tool but I bet you
 

5925
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:32,090
sure the competitive tool but I bet you
there's a component to the Tusk where

5926
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:32,100
there's a component to the Tusk where
 

5927
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:34,570
there's a component to the Tusk where
the ladies go goddamn that's a nice

like there's a visual beautiful
 

5931
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,209
like there's a visual beautiful
component maybe not I don't know but

5932
01:43:38,209 --> 01:43:38,219
component maybe not I don't know but
 

5933
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:40,129
component maybe not I don't know but
what if what if beauty though as we're

5934
01:43:40,129 --> 01:43:40,139
what if what if beauty though as we're
 

5935
01:43:40,139 --> 01:43:43,310
what if what if beauty though as we're
defining it though is is is symmetry and

5936
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:43,320
defining it though is is is symmetry and
 

5937
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,649
defining it though is is is symmetry and
the the absence of yellow spots on your

would swipe left on that yeah
 

5953
01:44:02,699 --> 01:44:04,729
would swipe left on that yeah
at least it's like really desirable

5954
01:44:04,729 --> 01:44:04,739
at least it's like really desirable
 

5955

you mean speaking of elephant
 

5959
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:11,149

intelligence and something I I think and

5960
01:44:11,149 --> 01:44:11,159
intelligence and something I I think and
 

5961
01:44:11,159 --> 01:44:14,090
intelligence and something I I think and
work quite a bit on as with artificial

5962
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:14,100
work quite a bit on as with artificial
 

5963
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:16,430
work quite a bit on as with artificial
intelligence is what the philosophical

5964
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:16,440
intelligence is what the philosophical
 

5965
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,350
intelligence is what the philosophical
question that comes up is what is

5966
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:18,360
question that comes up is what is
 

5967
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:21,590
question that comes up is what is
intelligence what is intelligent

5968
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:21,600
intelligence what is intelligent
 

5969
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,030
intelligence what is intelligent
um humans Homo sapiens are often

5970
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:25,040
um humans Homo sapiens are often
 

5971
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:28,490
um humans Homo sapiens are often
thought to be highly intelligent that's

5972
01:44:28,490 --> 01:44:28,500
thought to be highly intelligent that's
 

5973
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,609
thought to be highly intelligent that's
the reason they stand out

5974
01:44:30,609 --> 01:44:30,619
the reason they stand out
 

5975
01:44:30,619 --> 01:44:33,229
the reason they stand out
in your understanding

5976
01:44:33,229 --> 01:44:33,239
in your understanding
 

5977
01:44:33,239 --> 01:44:36,590
in your understanding
of different species like the elephant

5978
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:36,600
of different species like the elephant
 

5979
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:40,370
of different species like the elephant
what stands out to about humans or are

5980
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:40,380
what stands out to about humans or are
 

5981
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:43,310
what stands out to about humans or are
they just another animal

5982
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:43,320
they just another animal
 

5983
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:46,970
they just another animal
or different kinds of intelligence

5984
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:46,980
or different kinds of intelligence
 

5985
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,430
or different kinds of intelligence
well we're certainly unique because we

5986
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:49,440
well we're certainly unique because we
 

5987
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,370
well we're certainly unique because we
have altered the entire planet yeah you

5988
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:52,380
have altered the entire planet yeah you
 

5989
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:54,109
have altered the entire planet yeah you
know the term the anthropocene I mean

5990
01:44:54,109 --> 01:44:54,119
know the term the anthropocene I mean
 

5991
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:55,490
know the term the anthropocene I mean
it's like we've literally created a

5992
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:55,500
it's like we've literally created a
 

5993
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,649
it's like we've literally created a
geological layer of us

5994
01:44:57,649 --> 01:44:57,659
geological layer of us
 

5995
01:44:57,659 --> 01:45:00,530
geological layer of us
whereas other animals don't and

5996
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:00,540
whereas other animals don't and
 

5997
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:02,629
whereas other animals don't and
going back to elephants it's like they

5998
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:02,639
going back to elephants it's like they
 

5999
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,669
going back to elephants it's like they
also engineer their environment if

6000
01:45:04,669 --> 01:45:04,679
also engineer their environment if
 

6001
01:45:04,679 --> 01:45:06,590
also engineer their environment if
you're in a forest like if you drop me

6002
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:06,600
you're in a forest like if you drop me
 

6003
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,689
you're in a forest like if you drop me
in a forest on Earth I can tell you in

6004
01:45:08,689 --> 01:45:08,699
in a forest on Earth I can tell you in
 

6005
01:45:08,699 --> 01:45:10,070
in a forest on Earth I can tell you in
two seconds if there's elephants there

6006
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:10,080
two seconds if there's elephants there
 

6007
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,169
two seconds if there's elephants there
because this Twisted branches and

6008
01:45:12,169 --> 01:45:12,179
because this Twisted branches and
 

6009
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:14,390
because this Twisted branches and

6143
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,770
of its ability to inspire yeah there's
uh somebody I forgot who uh told me this

01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:41,940
Earth's atmosphere that allows you to
 

6151
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:44,090
Earth's atmosphere that allows you to
look up and see the stars like if we

6152
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:44,100
look up and see the stars like if we
 

6153
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:46,310
look up and see the stars like if we
didn't have that human civilization

6154
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:46,320
didn't have that human civilization
 

6155
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,590
didn't have that human civilization
would not have happened meaning like

6156
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:48,600
would not have happened meaning like
 

6157
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,450

down there and at the start of the
 

6511
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:34,729
down there and at the start of the
Industrial Revolution the only way to

6512
01:54:34,729 --> 01:54:34,739
Industrial Revolution the only way to
 

6513
01:54:34,739 --> 01:54:36,169
Industrial Revolution the only way to
get rubber

6514
01:54:36,169 --> 01:54:36,179
get rubber
 

6515
01:54:36,179 --> 01:54:38,149
get rubber
was to mine it from the trees that were

6516
01:54:38,149 --> 01:54:38,159
was to mine it from the trees that were
 

6517
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:40,070
was to mine it from the trees that were
out in the forest and so the only way to

6518
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,080
out in the forest and so the only way to
 

6519
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,629
out in the forest and so the only way to
do that because you can't make a rubber

6520
01:54:41,629 --> 01:54:41,639
do that because you can't make a rubber
 

6521
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:44,330
do that because you can't make a rubber
Plantation in the jungle the the rubber

when it's in Plantation form when it's a

6524
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:46,380
when it's in Plantation form when it's a
 

6525
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,930
when it's in Plantation form when it's a
monoculture it gets this Leaf blight and

6526
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:47,940
monoculture it gets this Leaf blight and
 

6527
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:50,390
monoculture it gets this Leaf blight and
it all dies Henry Ford tried it didn't

6528
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:50,400
it all dies Henry Ford tried it didn't

02:12:49,079 --> 02:12:50,510
I don't know how they do it like
sometimes at night and again we don't

7556
02:12:50,510 --> 02:12:50,520
sometimes at night and again we don't
 

7557
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:52,250
sometimes at night and again we don't
have night vision whereas almost every

7558
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:52,260
have night vision whereas almost every
 

7559
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:53,930
have night vision whereas almost every
other animal does

7560
02:12:53,930 --> 02:12:53,940
other animal does
 

7561
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:56,089
other animal does
and sometimes we'll be sitting you know

7562
02:12:56,089 --> 02:12:56,099
and sometimes we'll be sitting you know
 

7563
02:12:56,099 --> 02:12:58,490
and sometimes we'll be sitting you know
on our you know at the research station

7564
02:12:58,490 --> 02:12:58,500
on our you know at the research station
 

7565
02:12:58,500 --> 02:13:00,470
on our you know at the research station
at night and we'll be just drinking and

7566
02:13:00,470 --> 02:13:00,480
at night and we'll be just drinking and
 

7567
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:02,149
at night and we'll be just drinking and
like looking out and at the you know

7568
02:13:02,149 --> 02:13:02,159
like looking out and at the you know
 

7569
02:13:02,159 --> 02:13:03,709
like looking out and at the you know
we'll scare each other we'll go you know

7570
02:13:03,709 --> 02:13:03,719
we'll scare each other we'll go you know
 

7571
02:13:03,719 --> 02:13:04,790
we'll scare each other we'll go you know
we realize if they were out there right

7572
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:04,800
we realize if they were out there right
 

7573
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,050
we realize if they were out there right
now they could be looking at us and it's

7574
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:06,060
now they could be looking at us and it's
 

7575
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:08,390
now they could be looking at us and it's
like the truth is is that when it's dark

7576
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:08,400
like the truth is is that when it's dark
 

7577
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:09,770
like the truth is is that when it's dark
out there

7578
02:13:09,770 --> 02:13:09,780
out there
 

7579
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:11,450
out there
they can't see

7580
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:11,460
they can't see
 

7581
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:13,729
they can't see
it's not easy to start a fire with

7582
02:13:13,729 --> 02:13:13,739
it's not easy to start a fire with
 

7583
02:13:13,739 --> 02:13:16,490
it's not easy to start a fire with
matches and a lighter and gasoline they

7584
02:13:16,490 --> 02:13:16,500
matches and a lighter and gasoline they
 

7585
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:18,609
matches and a lighter and gasoline they
do it with friction

7586
02:13:18,609 --> 02:13:18,619
do it with friction
 

7587
02:13:18,619 --> 02:13:22,129
do it with friction
they have some some beads on Survival

7588
02:13:22,129 --> 02:13:22,139
they have some some beads on Survival
 

7589
02:13:22,139 --> 02:13:25,189
they have some some beads on Survival
that we could really learn from

7590
02:13:25,189 --> 02:13:25,199
that we could really learn from
 

7591
02:13:25,199 --> 02:13:26,390
that we could really learn from
um

7592
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:26,400
um
 

7593
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,609
um
not to mention that then you have people

7594
02:13:28,609 --> 02:13:28,619
not to mention that then you have people
 

7595
02:13:28,619 --> 02:13:30,830
not to mention that then you have people
that believe that they are actually the

7596
02:13:30,830 --> 02:13:30,840
that believe that they are actually the
 

7597
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:32,569
that believe that they are actually the
Guardians of the extinct giant ground

7598
02:13:32,569 --> 02:13:32,579
Guardians of the extinct giant ground
 

7599
02:13:32,579 --> 02:13:34,370
Guardians of the extinct giant ground
sloth and what they're doing is you know

7600
02:13:34,370 --> 02:13:34,380
sloth and what they're doing is you know
 

7601
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:35,569
sloth and what they're doing is you know
living out there because they're

7602
02:13:35,569 --> 02:13:35,579
living out there because they're
 

7603
02:13:35,579 --> 02:13:37,250
living out there because they're
protecting a secret population of

7604
02:13:37,250 --> 02:13:37,260
protecting a secret population of
 

7605
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:39,830
protecting a secret population of
previously extinct megafauna but there's

7606
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:39,840
previously extinct megafauna but there's
 

7607
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:41,390
previously extinct megafauna but there's
all kinds I mean this it's like you you

7608
02:13:41,390 --> 02:13:41,400
all kinds I mean this it's like you you
 

7609
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,490
all kinds I mean this it's like you you
go into the crypto world so quick I've

7610
02:13:43,490 --> 02:13:43,500
go into the crypto world so quick I've
 

7611
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:45,589
go into the crypto world so quick I've
heard so many people be like

7612
02:13:45,589 --> 02:13:45,599
heard so many people be like
 

7613
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,689
heard so many people be like
but then again you have to be humble at

7614
02:13:47,689 --> 02:13:47,699
but then again you have to be humble at
 

7615
02:13:47,699 --> 02:13:50,750
but then again you have to be humble at
how little we know about

7616
02:13:50,750 --> 02:13:50,760
how little we know about
 

7617
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:53,089
how little we know about
about that world about the world of life

7618
02:13:53,089 --> 02:13:53,099
about that world about the world of life
 

7619
02:13:53,099 --> 02:13:55,010
about that world about the world of life
like you said there's so much of life in

7620
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:55,020
like you said there's so much of life in
 

7621
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,990
like you said there's so much of life in
the Amazon that we don't uh creatures

7622
02:13:56,990 --> 02:13:57,000
the Amazon that we don't uh creatures
 

7623
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,430
the Amazon that we don't uh creatures
with no names

7624
02:13:58,430 --> 02:13:58,440
with no names
 

7625
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:00,169
with no names
tons of them we could go out on a night

7626
02:14:00,169 --> 02:14:00,179
tons of them we could go out on a night
 

7627
02:14:00,179 --> 02:14:01,250
tons of them we could go out on a night
walk right now and I could show you

7628
02:14:01,250 --> 02:14:01,260
walk right now and I could show you
 

7629
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:03,350
walk right now and I could show you
something that you know you I've done it

7630
02:14:03,350 --> 02:14:03,360
something that you know you I've done it
 

7631
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:05,990
something that you know you I've done it
you you pick up a bug and you go

7632
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,000
you you pick up a bug and you go
 

7633
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,470
you you pick up a bug and you go
that doesn't look right

7634
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:08,480
that doesn't look right
 

7635
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:11,030
that doesn't look right
that's not right he's got three heads

7636
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
that's not right he's got three heads
 

7637
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,189
that's not right he's got three heads
yeah you know and then you send it to to

7638
02:14:13,189 --> 02:14:13,199
yeah you know and then you send it to to
 

7639
02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:15,890
yeah you know and then you send it to to
the the greatest expert on that genus of

7640
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:15,900
the the greatest expert on that genus of
 

7641
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:17,990
the the greatest expert on that genus of
insects and and they go look

7642
02:14:17,990 --> 02:14:18,000
insects and and they go look
 

7643
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,810
insects and and they go look
I got no idea and you're talking to a

7644
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:20,820
I got no idea and you're talking to a
 

7645
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:23,510
I got no idea and you're talking to a
world expert and it's like that's it and

7646
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:23,520
world expert and it's like that's it and
 

7647
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,030
world expert and it's like that's it and
then 50 of the life is up in the canopy

7648
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:26,040
then 50 of the life is up in the canopy
 

7649
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:27,890
then 50 of the life is up in the canopy
and so like we started climbing the

7650
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:27,900
and so like we started climbing the
 

7651
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:30,109
and so like we started climbing the
trees like rock climbing like what Alex

7652
02:14:30,109 --> 02:14:30,119
trees like rock climbing like what Alex
 

7653
02:14:30,119 --> 02:14:32,089
trees like rock climbing like what Alex
Honnold does like well like I'll climb

7654
02:14:32,089 --> 02:14:32,099
Honnold does like well like I'll climb
 

7655
02:14:32,099 --> 02:14:34,250
Honnold does like well like I'll climb
up 50 feet and then I'll put a safety

7656
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:34,260
up 50 feet and then I'll put a safety
 

7657
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:36,109
up 50 feet and then I'll put a safety
like I'm basically Trad climbing and

7658
02:14:36,109 --> 02:14:36,119
like I'm basically Trad climbing and
 

7659
02:14:36,119 --> 02:14:37,550
like I'm basically Trad climbing and
then I'll climb up another 50 feet and

7660
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:37,560
then I'll climb up another 50 feet and
 

7661
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,950
then I'll climb up another 50 feet and
I'll have JJ belaying me from below and

7662
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:39,960
I'll have JJ belaying me from below and
 

7663
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:41,270
I'll have JJ belaying me from below and
then I'll be like oh look a snake I'm

7664
02:14:41,270 --> 02:14:41,280
then I'll be like oh look a snake I'm
 

7665
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:42,470
then I'll be like oh look a snake I'm
like JJ

7666
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:42,480
like JJ
 

7667
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:44,750
like JJ
pay attention to get up there and the

7668
02:14:44,750 --> 02:14:44,760
pay attention to get up there and the
 

7669
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:47,629
pay attention to get up there and the
the branches are as thick as this table

7670
02:14:47,629 --> 02:14:47,639
the branches are as thick as this table
 

7671
02:14:47,639 --> 02:14:49,490
the branches are as thick as this table
so you can like walk around freely oh

7672
02:14:49,490 --> 02:14:49,500
so you can like walk around freely oh
 

7673
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:51,410
so you can like walk around freely oh
it's like total like Avatar when they're

7674
02:14:51,410 --> 02:14:51,420
it's like total like Avatar when they're
 

7675
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:53,330
it's like total like Avatar when they're
in the floating islands like you can you

7676
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:53,340
in the floating islands like you can you
 

7677
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:54,649
in the floating islands like you can you
can go run around if that's what you

7678
02:14:54,649 --> 02:14:54,659
can go run around if that's what you
 

7679
02:14:54,659 --> 02:14:56,290
can go run around if that's what you
want to do

7680
02:14:56,290 --> 02:14:56,300
want to do
 

7681
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:59,089
want to do
bromeliads orchids cactuses because up

7682
02:14:59,089 --> 02:14:59,099
bromeliads orchids cactuses because up
 

7683
02:14:59,099 --> 02:15:00,770
bromeliads orchids cactuses because up
there it's against the Sun so it's a

7684
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:00,780
there it's against the Sun so it's a
 

7685
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:02,510
there it's against the Sun so it's a
different environment oh wow yeah

7686
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:02,520
different environment oh wow yeah
 

7687
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:03,890
different environment oh wow yeah
interesting

7688
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:03,900
interesting
 

7689
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:06,050
interesting
um and then you start seeing lizards and

7690
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:06,060
um and then you start seeing lizards and
 

7691
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:07,910
um and then you start seeing lizards and
snakes and birds and things that aren't

7692
02:15:07,910 --> 02:15:07,920
snakes and birds and things that aren't
 

7693
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:09,830
snakes and birds and things that aren't
down on the ground

7694
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
down on the ground
 

7695
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,810
down on the ground
and so how many scientists have actually

7696
02:15:11,810 --> 02:15:11,820
and so how many scientists have actually
 

7697
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:15,169
and so how many scientists have actually
gotten to really spend time up there and

7698
02:15:15,169 --> 02:15:15,179
gotten to really spend time up there and
 

7699
02:15:15,179 --> 02:15:17,089
gotten to really spend time up there and
really inventory the life that's why

7700
02:15:17,089 --> 02:15:17,099
really inventory the life that's why
 

7701
02:15:17,099 --> 02:15:18,830
really inventory the life that's why
when you hear about you like it it's

7702
02:15:18,830 --> 02:15:18,840
when you hear about you like it it's
 

7703
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:20,450
when you hear about you like it it's
like a taxonomical discussion of how

7704
02:15:20,450 --> 02:15:20,460
like a taxonomical discussion of how
 

7705
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:21,830
like a taxonomical discussion of how
many species there are on earth they're

7706
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:21,840
many species there are on earth they're
 

7707
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,169
many species there are on earth they're
like between you know 10 and 30 million

02:18:16,790 --> 02:18:16,800
in the Amazon like how much do we know
 

7865
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:19,969
in the Amazon like how much do we know
what are all the possibilities of what's

7866
02:18:19,969 --> 02:18:19,979
what are all the possibilities of what's
 

7867
02:18:19,979 --> 02:18:23,570
what are all the possibilities of what's
in the Amazon in this past so like when

7868
02:18:23,570 --> 02:18:23,580
in the Amazon in this past so like when
 

7869
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:27,049
in the Amazon in this past so like when
orianna went down the Amazon the reports

7870
02:18:27,049 --> 02:18:27,059
orianna went down the Amazon the reports
 

7871
02:18:27,059 --> 02:18:28,610
orianna went down the Amazon the reports
were that there was great civilizations

7872
02:18:28,610 --> 02:18:28,620
were that there was great civilizations
 

7873
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:31,250
were that there was great civilizations
in the Amazon and then you know a few

7874
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:31,260
in the Amazon and then you know a few
 

7875
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:32,870
in the Amazon and then you know a few
hundred years later when people got to

7876
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:32,880
hundred years later when people got to
 

7877
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,250
hundred years later when people got to
actually check up on this stuff it was

7878
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:34,260
actually check up on this stuff it was
 

7879
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:36,230
actually check up on this stuff it was
all gone and so was that because of

7880
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:36,240
all gone and so was that because of
 

7881
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:37,910
all gone and so was that because of
disease that we wiped out all these

7882
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:37,920
disease that we wiped out all these
 

7883
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:39,709
disease that we wiped out all these
civilizations and these communities of

7884
02:18:39,709 --> 02:18:39,719
civilizations and these communities of
 

7885
02:18:39,719 --> 02:18:42,650
civilizations and these communities of
people potentially probably

7886
02:18:42,650 --> 02:18:42,660
people potentially probably
 

7887
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:45,469
people potentially probably
was he just wrong probably not this is a

7888
02:18:45,469 --> 02:18:45,479
was he just wrong probably not this is a
 

7889
02:18:45,479 --> 02:18:47,270
was he just wrong probably not this is a
guy that navigated by the stars back to

7890
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:47,280
guy that navigated by the stars back to
 

7891
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,009
guy that navigated by the stars back to
Spain after building his own boat like

7892
02:18:49,009 --> 02:18:49,019
Spain after building his own boat like
 

7893
02:18:49,019 --> 02:18:51,230
Spain after building his own boat like
yeah or did he you know or was he trying

7894
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:51,240
yeah or did he you know or was he trying
 

7895
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:52,870
yeah or did he you know or was he trying
to just I don't know I don't know but

7896
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:52,880
to just I don't know I don't know but
 

7897
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:54,950
to just I don't know I don't know but
they're clearly

7902
02:19:00,410 --> 02:19:00,420
civilizations in the Amazon 100 there's
 

7903
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:02,270
civilizations in the Amazon 100 there's
no one that can deny that

02:19:02,270 --> 02:19:02,280
no one that can deny that
 

7905
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:05,990
no one that can deny that
the thing that I reacted to was that

02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:06,000
the thing that I reacted to was that
 

7907
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,290
the thing that I reacted to was that
I've heard videos I've seen moments in

7908
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:09,300
I've heard videos I've seen moments in
 

7909
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:12,830
I've heard videos I've seen moments in

there's there was more civilizations
 

7925

they start to say that the Amazon

they start to say that the Amazon
 

7933
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:39,950
they start to say that the Amazon
there's actually articles that that are

there's actually articles that that are

02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:43,070
there's actually articles that that are

which is not true so the actual which I

02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:49,500
which is not true so the actual which I
 

7941
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:52,490
which is not true so the actual which I
think is a really different idea that

02:19:52,490 --> 02:19:52,500
think is a really different idea that
 

7943
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:54,950
think is a really different idea that
the uh the entire ecosystem everything

the uh the entire ecosystem everything
 

7945
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:57,070
the uh the entire ecosystem everything
we've been talking about all the species

we've been talking about all the species
 

7947
02:19:57,080 --> 02:20:00,469
we've been talking about all the species
uh all the forestry and the different

ridiculous well it's not first of all

7956
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:11,460
ridiculous well it's not first of all
 

7957
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:14,630
ridiculous well it's not first of all
it's unlikely but it's not ridiculous so

7958
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:14,640
it's unlikely but it's not ridiculous so
 

7959
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:17,030
it's unlikely but it's not ridiculous so
we can't well there's no ridiculous in

7960
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:17,040
we can't well there's no ridiculous in
 

7961
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:17,929
we can't well there's no ridiculous in
um

7962
02:20:17,929 --> 02:20:17,939
um
 

7963
02:20:17,939 --> 02:20:19,510
um
in science

7964
02:20:19,510 --> 02:20:19,520
in science
 

7965
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:23,389
in science
no but the complexity of life is very

7966
02:20:23,389 --> 02:20:23,399
no but the complexity of life is very
 

7967
02:20:23,399 --> 02:20:26,150
no but the complexity of life is very
difficult to engineer as as you the more

7968
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:26,160
difficult to engineer as as you the more
 

7969
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:28,010
difficult to engineer as as you the more
you study about biological systems and

7970
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:28,020
you study about biological systems and
 

7971
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:30,050
you study about biological systems and
so on it's very difficult to create the

7972
02:20:30,050 --> 02:20:30,060
so on it's very difficult to create the
 

7973
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:33,110
so on it's very difficult to create the
kind of things that nature is able to do

7974
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:33,120
kind of things that nature is able to do
 

7975
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:36,290
kind of things that nature is able to do
that said I don't know if you've heard

7976
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:36,300
that said I don't know if you've heard
 

7977
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:39,889
that said I don't know if you've heard
but the entire Earth the world has gone

7978
02:20:39,889 --> 02:20:39,899
but the entire Earth the world has gone
 

7979
02:20:39,899 --> 02:20:41,690
but the entire Earth the world has gone
through pandemic recently

7980
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:41,700
through pandemic recently
 

7981
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:44,090
through pandemic recently
and if and everybody said of course it's

7982
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:44,100
and if and everybody said of course it's
 

7983
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:47,270
and if and everybody said of course it's
natural Origins viruses mutate all the

7984
02:20:47,270 --> 02:20:47,280
natural Origins viruses mutate all the
 

7985
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:48,530
natural Origins viruses mutate all the
time

7986
02:20:48,530 --> 02:20:48,540
time
 

7987
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:50,929
time
and nevertheless it seems more and more

7988
02:20:50,929 --> 02:20:50,939
and nevertheless it seems more and more
 

7989
02:20:50,939 --> 02:20:53,630
and nevertheless it seems more and more
likely than this particular case it was

7990
02:20:53,630 --> 02:20:53,640
likely than this particular case it was
 

7991
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:56,210
likely than this particular case it was
of an artificial origin leaked from a

7992
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:56,220
of an artificial origin leaked from a
 

7993
02:20:56,220 --> 02:20:58,790
of an artificial origin leaked from a
lab so humans are able to create stuff

7994
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:58,800
lab so humans are able to create stuff
 

7995
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:02,630
lab so humans are able to create stuff
at least modern technological uh genetic

at least modern technological uh genetic

7999
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:07,370

come on

8000
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:07,380
come on
 

8001
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:09,230
come on
you can't be that nice and that good

8002
02:21:09,230 --> 02:21:09,240
you can't be that nice and that good
 

8003
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:10,330
you can't be that nice and that good
looking

I used to be a wolf yeah but so that

8006
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:14,160
I used to be a wolf yeah but so that
 

8007
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:16,429
I used to be a wolf yeah but so that
bothers you because it it allows you to

8008
02:21:16,429 --> 02:21:16,439
bothers you because it it allows you to
 

8009
02:21:16,439 --> 02:21:17,870
bothers you because it it allows you to
think that

8010
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:17,880
think that
 

8011
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:19,190
think that
um we don't need to preserve the Amazon

8012
02:21:19,190 --> 02:21:19,200
um we don't need to preserve the Amazon
 

8013
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:21,590
um we don't need to preserve the Amazon
we can always engineer it yeah exactly

8014
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:21,600
we can always engineer it yeah exactly
 

8015
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:23,389
we can always engineer it yeah exactly
then just this is just to me that's a

8016
02:21:23,389 --> 02:21:23,399
then just this is just to me that's a
 

8017
02:21:23,399 --> 02:21:25,910
then just this is just to me that's a
slippery slope like I totally I'm it's

8018
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:25,920
slippery slope like I totally I'm it's
 

8019
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,809
slippery slope like I totally I'm it's
just it's so quick from I'm a fan of

8020
02:21:28,809 --> 02:21:28,819
just it's so quick from I'm a fan of
 

8021
02:21:28,819 --> 02:21:31,610
just it's so quick from I'm a fan of
expeditions to find ecological ruins and

8022
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:31,620
expeditions to find ecological ruins and
 

8023
02:21:31,620 --> 02:21:33,050
expeditions to find ecological ruins and
and to learn more about the ancient

8024
02:21:33,050 --> 02:21:33,060
and to learn more about the ancient
 

8025
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:35,330
and to learn more about the ancient
civilizations to which I don't think is

8026
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:35,340
civilizations to which I don't think is
 

8027
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:38,030
civilizations to which I don't think is
what he's putting out is that then sort

8028
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:38,040
what he's putting out is that then sort
 

8029
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:39,530
what he's putting out is that then sort
of like news articles which I think

8030
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:39,540
of like news articles which I think
 

8031
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:40,849
of like news articles which I think
they're trying to bait you where they're

8032
02:21:40,849 --> 02:21:40,859
they're trying to bait you where they're
 

8033
02:21:40,859 --> 02:21:42,770
they're trying to bait you where they're
going was the Amazon man-made and it's

8034
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:42,780
going was the Amazon man-made and it's
 

8035
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:44,150
going was the Amazon man-made and it's
like

8036
02:21:44,150 --> 02:21:44,160
like
 

8037
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:45,950
like
you know because then you get you're

8038
02:21:45,950 --> 02:21:45,960
you know because then you get you're
 

8039
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:47,630
you know because then you get you're
going to get a Brazilian president to go

8040
02:21:47,630 --> 02:21:47,640
going to get a Brazilian president to go
 

8041
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:50,210
going to get a Brazilian president to go
see see what they said it's man-made so

8042
02:21:50,210 --> 02:21:50,220
see see what they said it's man-made so
 

8043
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:51,950
see see what they said it's man-made so
we might as well continue to engineer it

8044
02:21:51,950 --> 02:21:51,960
we might as well continue to engineer it
 

8045
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:54,590
we might as well continue to engineer it
and manage it and it's like there's such

8046
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:54,600
and manage it and it's like there's such
 

8047
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:57,830
and manage it and it's like there's such
complex systems and interactions and

8048
02:21:57,830 --> 02:21:57,840
complex systems and interactions and
 

8049
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:59,929
complex systems and interactions and
such a such a giant Web of Life there

8050
02:21:59,929 --> 02:21:59,939
such a such a giant Web of Life there
 

8051
02:21:59,939 --> 02:22:01,429
such a such a giant Web of Life there
that

8052
02:22:01,429 --> 02:22:01,439
that
 

8053
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:03,550
that
at least in my opinion

8054
02:22:03,550 --> 02:22:03,560
at least in my opinion
 

8055
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:07,670
at least in my opinion
is clearly one of the most authentically

8056
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:07,680
is clearly one of the most authentically
 

8057
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:10,730
is clearly one of the most authentically
natural things and again are there

8058
02:22:10,730 --> 02:22:10,740
natural things and again are there
 

8059
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:12,050
natural things and again are there
things that we've engineered did the

8060
02:22:12,050 --> 02:22:12,060
things that we've engineered did the
 

8061
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:14,510
things that we've engineered did the
uncontacted tribes sometimes they they

8062
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:14,520
uncontacted tribes sometimes they they
 

8063
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:16,190
uncontacted tribes sometimes they they
have banana plants that they've stolen

8064
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:16,200
have banana plants that they've stolen
 

8065
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:18,110
have banana plants that they've stolen
and we could see it from the air that

8066
02:22:18,110 --> 02:22:18,120
and we could see it from the air that
 

8067
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:19,490
and we could see it from the air that
they've they have banana plants we made

8068
02:22:19,490 --> 02:22:19,500
they've they have banana plants we made
 

8069
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:21,889
they've they have banana plants we made
banana plants that's engineered by us we

8070
02:22:21,889 --> 02:22:21,899
banana plants that's engineered by us we
 

8071
02:22:21,899 --> 02:22:23,630
banana plants that's engineered by us we
know for a fact

8072
02:22:23,630 --> 02:22:23,640
know for a fact
 

8073
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:25,190
know for a fact
um so agricultural engineering

8074
02:22:25,190 --> 02:22:25,200
um so agricultural engineering
 

8075
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:26,870
um so agricultural engineering
agricultural engineering and stuff like

8076
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:26,880
agricultural engineering and stuff like
 

8077
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:29,110
agricultural engineering and stuff like
that but suggesting that the Amazon

8078
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:29,120
that but suggesting that the Amazon
 

8079
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:32,570
that but suggesting that the Amazon
basin you know it's just it's just a

8080
02:22:32,570 --> 02:22:32,580
basin you know it's just it's just a
 

8081
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:34,070
basin you know it's just it's just a
weird way to think about it I've just

8082
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:34,080
weird way to think about it I've just
 

8083
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:35,230
weird way to think about it I've just
heard people

8084
02:22:35,230 --> 02:22:35,240
heard people
 

8085
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:38,450
heard people
dismiss the conservative the protection

8086
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:38,460
dismiss the conservative the protection
 

8087
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:40,370
dismiss the conservative the protection
of the Amazon based on the fact they're

8088
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:40,380
of the Amazon based on the fact they're
 

8089
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:42,650
of the Amazon based on the fact they're
like oh well if people made it and it's

8090
02:22:42,650 --> 02:22:42,660
like oh well if people made it and it's
 

8091
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:45,469
like oh well if people made it and it's
such a giant leap from from from the

8092
02:22:45,469 --> 02:22:45,479
such a giant leap from from from the
 

8093
02:22:45,479 --> 02:22:47,929
such a giant leap from from from the
from zero to a hundred

8094
02:22:47,929 --> 02:22:47,939
from zero to a hundred
 

8095
02:22:47,939 --> 02:22:49,849
from zero to a hundred
um you know is there slash and burn that

8096
02:22:49,849 --> 02:22:49,859
um you know is there slash and burn that
 

8097
02:22:49,859 --> 02:22:53,150
um you know is there slash and burn that
the ancient civilizations did of course

8098
02:22:53,150 --> 02:22:53,160
the ancient civilizations did of course
 

8099
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:54,889
the ancient civilizations did of course
are there areas that were affected by

8100
02:22:54,889 --> 02:22:54,899
are there areas that were affected by
 

8101
02:22:54,899 --> 02:22:57,349
are there areas that were affected by
people of course I just get worried when

8102
02:22:57,349 --> 02:22:57,359
people of course I just get worried when
 

8103
02:22:57,359 --> 02:23:00,410
people of course I just get worried when
we start talking about it was a man-made

8104
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:00,420
we start talking about it was a man-made
 

8105
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:03,190
we start talking about it was a man-made
thing here you loud and clear on that

8106
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:03,200
thing here you loud and clear on that
 

8107
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:05,929
thing here you loud and clear on that
and I personally think that's completely

8108
02:23:05,929 --> 02:23:05,939
and I personally think that's completely
 

8109
02:23:05,939 --> 02:23:08,929
and I personally think that's completely
separate from wondering about what the

8110
02:23:08,929 --> 02:23:08,939
separate from wondering about what the
 

8111
02:23:08,939 --> 02:23:10,670
separate from wondering about what the
ancient civilization have been able to

8112
02:23:10,670 --> 02:23:10,680
ancient civilization have been able to
 

8113
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:12,889
ancient civilization have been able to
accomplish oh sure it's almost really

8114
02:23:12,889 --> 02:23:12,899
accomplish oh sure it's almost really
 

8115
02:23:12,899 --> 02:23:14,570
accomplish oh sure it's almost really
sad because if all the humans on Earth

8116
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:14,580
sad because if all the humans on Earth
 

8117
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:18,170
sad because if all the humans on Earth
die no how long does it take before all

8118
02:23:18,170 --> 02:23:18,180
die no how long does it take before all
 

8119
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:20,630
die no how long does it take before all
signs of humans ever exist and disappear

8120
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:20,640
signs of humans ever exist and disappear
 

8121
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:23,730
signs of humans ever exist and disappear
oh for the most part

8122
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:23,740
oh for the most part
 

8123
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:24,830
oh for the most part

um from an alien perspective

8126
02:23:27,349 --> 02:23:27,359
um from an alien perspective
 

8127
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:29,270
um from an alien perspective
what timeline are we talking about I

8128
02:23:29,270 --> 02:23:29,280
what timeline are we talking about I
 

8129
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,010
what timeline are we talking about I
mean like I mean there's there's a

8130
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:31,020
mean like I mean there's there's a
 

8131
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:32,450
mean like I mean there's there's a
hundred thousand years like it could be

8132
02:23:32,450 --> 02:23:32,460
hundred thousand years like it could be
 

8133
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:34,490
hundred thousand years like it could be
less it could be less it could be like a

8134
02:23:34,490 --> 02:23:34,500
less it could be less it could be like a
 

8135
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:36,349
less it could be less it could be like a
few thousand because a hundred thousand

8136
02:23:36,349 --> 02:23:36,359
few thousand because a hundred thousand
 

8137
02:23:36,359 --> 02:23:38,690
few thousand because a hundred thousand
is complete destruction 100 000 is like

8138
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:38,700
is complete destruction 100 000 is like
 

8139
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:41,929
is complete destruction 100 000 is like
nothing but but then it could be in just

8140
02:23:41,929 --> 02:23:41,939
nothing but but then it could be in just
 

8141
02:23:41,939 --> 02:23:44,030
nothing but but then it could be in just
a few hundred years yes it starts

8142
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:44,040
a few hundred years yes it starts
 

8143
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:46,550
a few hundred years yes it starts
becoming you're gonna the government of

8144
02:23:46,550 --> 02:23:46,560
becoming you're gonna the government of
 

8145
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,110
becoming you're gonna the government of
the alien civilization is gonna have to

8146
02:23:48,110 --> 02:23:48,120
the alien civilization is gonna have to
 

8147
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:49,610
the alien civilization is gonna have to
pay quite a bit of money to do the

8148
02:23:49,610 --> 02:23:49,620
pay quite a bit of money to do the
 

8149
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,410
pay quite a bit of money to do the
research right because they're going to

8150
02:23:51,410 --> 02:23:51,420
research right because they're going to
 

8151
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:54,650
research right because they're going to
find other life first trying to find the

8152
02:23:54,650 --> 02:23:54,660
find other life first trying to find the
 

8153
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:56,270
find other life first trying to find the
Dolphins in the fish and so on they're

8154
02:23:56,270 --> 02:23:56,280
Dolphins in the fish and so on they're
 

8155
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:57,950
Dolphins in the fish and so on they're
gonna find the trees maybe the trees are

8156
02:23:57,950 --> 02:23:57,960
gonna find the trees maybe the trees are
 

8157
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:00,410
gonna find the trees maybe the trees are
the interesting thing sure the buildings

8158
02:24:00,410 --> 02:24:00,420
the interesting thing sure the buildings
 

8159
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:02,510
the interesting thing sure the buildings
are not that interesting humans but

8160
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:02,520
are not that interesting humans but
 

8161
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:03,830
are not that interesting humans but
there must be examples of cities that

8162
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:03,840
there must be examples of cities that
 

8163
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,910
there must be examples of cities that
have been left

8164
02:24:04,910 --> 02:24:04,920
have been left
 

8165
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:07,790
have been left
on unattended for a few decades and like

8166
02:24:07,790 --> 02:24:07,800
on unattended for a few decades and like
 

8167
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:09,710
on unattended for a few decades and like
how quickly the

8168
02:24:09,710 --> 02:24:09,720
how quickly the
 

8169
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,750
how quickly the
the plants push up through the street

8170
02:24:11,750 --> 02:24:11,760
the plants push up through the street
 

8171
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:13,250
the plants push up through the street
and everything starts to get broken down

8172
02:24:13,250 --> 02:24:13,260
and everything starts to get broken down
 

8173
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:14,929
and everything starts to get broken down
if you really look you'll be like oh

8174
02:24:14,929 --> 02:24:14,939
if you really look you'll be like oh
 

8175
02:24:14,939 --> 02:24:16,370
if you really look you'll be like oh
that's some interesting geometry here

8176
02:24:16,370 --> 02:24:16,380
that's some interesting geometry here
 

8177
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:18,110
that's some interesting geometry here

8332
02:27:14,690 --> 02:27:14,700
is you know weird lakes or shapes in the
 

8333
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:16,730
is you know weird lakes or shapes in the
jungle that don't make sense that are

8334
02:27:16,730 --> 02:27:16,740
jungle that don't make sense that are
 

8335
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:19,730
jungle that don't make sense that are
that are that are strange and like so

8336
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:19,740
that are that are strange and like so
 

8337
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:21,290
that are that are strange and like so
even at that level you can see weirdness

8338
02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:21,300
even at that level you can see weirdness
 

8339
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:24,469
even at that level you can see weirdness
you can see different oh yeah like signs

8340
02:27:24,469 --> 02:27:24,479
you can see different oh yeah like signs
 

8341
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:26,210
you can see different oh yeah like signs
of possible awesomeness oh the jungle is

8342
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:26,220
of possible awesomeness oh the jungle is
 

8343
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:27,710
of possible awesomeness oh the jungle is
so weird and here's the other thing is

8344
02:27:27,710 --> 02:27:27,720
so weird and here's the other thing is
 

8345
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:28,910
so weird and here's the other thing is
that most

8346
02:27:28,910 --> 02:27:28,920
that most
 

8347
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:31,070
that most
so like the region I've been working in

8348
02:27:31,070 --> 02:27:31,080
so like the region I've been working in
 

8349
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:32,330
so like the region I've been working in
you see

8350
02:27:32,330 --> 02:27:32,340
you see
 

8351
02:27:32,340 --> 02:27:35,150
you see
where the researchers go the certain

8352
02:27:35,150 --> 02:27:35,160
where the researchers go the certain
 

8353
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:37,429
where the researchers go the certain
biological stations the certain places

8354
02:27:37,429 --> 02:27:37,439
biological stations the certain places
 

8355
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:39,290
biological stations the certain places
where like oh like this university has a

8356
02:27:39,290 --> 02:27:39,300
where like oh like this university has a
 

8357
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:41,090
where like oh like this university has a
relationship with this this for

8358
02:27:41,090 --> 02:27:41,100
relationship with this this for
 

8359
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:43,250
relationship with this this for
Universal is this so everybody goes to

8360
02:27:43,250 --> 02:27:43,260
Universal is this so everybody goes to
 

8361
02:27:43,260 --> 02:27:45,710
Universal is this so everybody goes to
the same few study sites and then they

8362
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:45,720
the same few study sites and then they
 

8363
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:47,330
the same few study sites and then they
walk on the same trails and they have

8364
02:27:47,330 --> 02:27:47,340
walk on the same trails and they have
 

8365
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:49,670
walk on the same trails and they have
the same guides when you fly in a Cessna

8366
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:49,680
the same guides when you fly in a Cessna
 

8367
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:51,349
the same guides when you fly in a Cessna
and you fly

8368
02:27:51,349 --> 02:27:51,359
and you fly
 

8369
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:53,570
and you fly
few hours away from all that and you see

8370
02:27:53,570 --> 02:27:53,580
few hours away from all that and you see
 

8371
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:56,150
few hours away from all that and you see
a tiny little tributary and then you fly

8372
02:27:56,150 --> 02:27:56,160
a tiny little tributary and then you fly
 

8373
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:59,330
a tiny little tributary and then you fly
for 40 minutes over unbroken green just

8374
02:27:59,330 --> 02:27:59,340
for 40 minutes over unbroken green just
 

8375
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:02,870
for 40 minutes over unbroken green just
wild before you reach another tributary

8376
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:02,880
wild before you reach another tributary
 

8377
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:05,570
wild before you reach another tributary
even if somebody could survive going up

8378
02:28:05,570 --> 02:28:05,580
even if somebody could survive going up
 

8379
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:07,309
even if somebody could survive going up
that tributary had the expeditionary

8380
02:28:07,309 --> 02:28:07,319
that tributary had the expeditionary
 

8381
02:28:07,319 --> 02:28:09,770
that tributary had the expeditionary
expertise and the ability to survive

8382
02:28:09,770 --> 02:28:09,780
expertise and the ability to survive
 

8383
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:11,630
expertise and the ability to survive
getting shot at by arrows if they could

8384
02:28:11,630 --> 02:28:11,640
getting shot at by arrows if they could
 

8385
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:13,910
getting shot at by arrows if they could
get up that tributary

8386
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:13,920
get up that tributary
 

8387
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:15,110
get up that tributary
now

8388
02:28:15,110 --> 02:28:15,120
now
 

8389
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:17,570
now
cut perpendicular into the jungle which

8390
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:17,580
cut perpendicular into the jungle which
 

8391
02:28:17,580 --> 02:28:19,790
cut perpendicular into the jungle which
I don't do on the solos you can't you

8392
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:19,800
I don't do on the solos you can't you
 

8393
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:22,130
I don't do on the solos you can't you
can never don't ever leave the river

8394
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,140
can never don't ever leave the river
 

8395
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:25,010
can never don't ever leave the river
but you tell me that in that span of 70

8396
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:25,020
but you tell me that in that span of 70
 

8397
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:27,590
but you tell me that in that span of 70
miles between tiny tributaries at the

8398
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:27,600
miles between tiny tributaries at the
 

8399
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,750
miles between tiny tributaries at the
edge of the world no one's been there

8400
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:29,760
edge of the world no one's been there
 

8401
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:31,429
edge of the world no one's been there
none of us have been there you know

8402
02:28:31,429 --> 02:28:31,439
none of us have been there you know
 

8403
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:33,110
none of us have been there you know
maybe somebody 10 000 years ago was

8404
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:33,120
maybe somebody 10 000 years ago was
 

8405
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:35,870
maybe somebody 10 000 years ago was
there but we don't know what populations

8406
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:35,880
there but we don't know what populations
 

8407
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:37,070
there but we don't know what populations
of things are there we don't know what

8408
02:28:37,070 --> 02:28:37,080
of things are there we don't know what
 

8409
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:38,570
of things are there we don't know what
ruins are there

8410
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:38,580
ruins are there
 

8411
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:41,090
ruins are there
and so there's so much undiscovered

8412
02:28:41,090 --> 02:28:41,100
and so there's so much undiscovered
 

8413
02:28:41,100 --> 02:28:43,010
and so there's so much undiscovered
stuff in the Amazon that is

8414
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:43,020
stuff in the Amazon that is
 

8415
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:45,830
stuff in the Amazon that is
just waiting just waiting

8416
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:45,840
just waiting just waiting
 

8417
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:47,870
just waiting just waiting
what what is the process of exploring

8418
02:28:47,870 --> 02:28:47,880
what what is the process of exploring
 

8419
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:50,210
what what is the process of exploring
that so how does money get converted

8420
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:50,220
that so how does money get converted
 

8421
02:28:50,220 --> 02:28:52,370
that so how does money get converted
towards exploration

8422
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:52,380
towards exploration
 

8423
02:28:52,380 --> 02:28:53,990
towards exploration
is there

8424
02:28:53,990 --> 02:28:54,000
is there
 

8425
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,450
is there
is there safe ways of doing that there's

8426
02:28:56,450 --> 02:28:56,460
is there safe ways of doing that there's
 

8427
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:58,730
is there safe ways of doing that there's
places where you know we found out about

8428
02:28:58,730 --> 02:28:58,740
places where you know we found out about
 

8429
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:01,250
places where you know we found out about
things that have to be explored but

8430
02:29:01,250 --> 02:29:01,260
things that have to be explored but
 

8431
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:03,830
things that have to be explored but
where you come up with well how do we do

8432
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:03,840
where you come up with well how do we do
 

8433
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:06,290
where you come up with well how do we do
this without getting shot and all and

8434
02:29:06,290 --> 02:29:06,300
this without getting shot and all and
 

8435
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:08,030
this without getting shot and all and
not only without getting shot but also

8436
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:08,040
not only without getting shot but also
 

8437
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:10,309
not only without getting shot but also
without endangering them too

8438
02:29:10,309 --> 02:29:10,319
without endangering them too
 

8439
02:29:10,319 --> 02:29:12,710
without endangering them too
because how stupid are we if we if we go

8440
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:12,720
because how stupid are we if we if we go
 

8441
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:14,150
because how stupid are we if we if we go
in there to people that are living in

8442
02:29:14,150 --> 02:29:14,160
in there to people that are living in
 

8443
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:16,490
in there to people that are living in
the jungle not bothering us and we go

8444
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:16,500
the jungle not bothering us and we go
 

8445
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:17,809
the jungle not bothering us and we go
insert ourselves into there because

8446
02:29:17,809 --> 02:29:17,819
insert ourselves into there because
 

8447
02:29:17,819 --> 02:29:20,030
insert ourselves into there because
we're curious about some rocks

8448
02:29:20,030 --> 02:29:20,040
we're curious about some rocks
 

8449
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:22,190
we're curious about some rocks
as that doesn't seem fair for the loss

8450
02:29:22,190 --> 02:29:22,200
as that doesn't seem fair for the loss
 

8451
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:24,290
as that doesn't seem fair for the loss
of life and So like

8452
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:24,300
of life and So like
 

8453
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:26,270
of life and So like
um but yeah that's that's something that

8454
02:29:26,270 --> 02:29:26,280
um but yeah that's that's something that
 

8455
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:27,650
um but yeah that's that's something that
we're working on and like one thing of

8456
02:29:27,650 --> 02:29:27,660
we're working on and like one thing of
 

8457
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:29,090
we're working on and like one thing of
course is like lidar and stuff but

8458
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:29,100
course is like lidar and stuff but
 

8459
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:31,250
course is like lidar and stuff but
eventually eventually at the end of

8460
02:29:31,250 --> 02:29:31,260
eventually eventually at the end of
 

8461
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:33,230
eventually eventually at the end of
everything it comes down to boots on the

8462
02:29:33,230 --> 02:29:33,240
everything it comes down to boots on the
 

8463
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:36,650
everything it comes down to boots on the
ground yeah as somebody who has to ask

8464
02:29:36,650 --> 02:29:36,660
ground yeah as somebody who has to ask
 

8465
02:29:36,660 --> 02:29:38,690
ground yeah as somebody who has to ask
that very question about how to deal

8466
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:38,700
that very question about how to deal
 

8467
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:40,370
that very question about how to deal
with uncontacted tribes they're they're

8468
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:40,380
with uncontacted tribes they're they're
 

8469
02:29:40,380 --> 02:29:41,929
with uncontacted tribes they're they're
going to kill you

8470
02:29:41,929 --> 02:29:41,939
going to kill you
 

8471
02:29:41,939 --> 02:29:43,969
going to kill you
but you also don't want to disturb their

8472
02:29:43,969 --> 02:29:43,979
but you also don't want to disturb their
 

8473
02:29:43,979 --> 02:29:47,090
but you also don't want to disturb their
environment if you were an intelligent

8474
02:29:47,090 --> 02:29:47,100
environment if you were an intelligent
 

8475
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:49,969
environment if you were an intelligent
alien civilization oh boy

8476
02:29:49,969 --> 02:29:49,979
alien civilization oh boy
 

8477
02:29:49,979 --> 02:29:53,450
alien civilization oh boy
and you came about Earth

8478
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:53,460
and you came about Earth
 

8479
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:55,969
and you came about Earth
how how would you interact with it can

8480
02:29:55,969 --> 02:29:55,979
how how would you interact with it can
 

8481
02:29:55,979 --> 02:29:57,830
how how would you interact with it can
you put yourself in the mind of an

8482
02:29:57,830 --> 02:29:57,840
you put yourself in the mind of an
 

8483
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:00,590
you put yourself in the mind of an
aliens civilization because there seems

8484
02:30:00,590 --> 02:30:00,600
aliens civilization because there seems
 

8485
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:02,809
aliens civilization because there seems
to be some parallels here

8486
02:30:02,809 --> 02:30:02,819
to be some parallels here
 

8487
02:30:02,819 --> 02:30:04,730
to be some parallels here
it is actually right it's like a

8488
02:30:04,730 --> 02:30:04,740
it is actually right it's like a
 

8489
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:07,550
it is actually right it's like a
microcosm of we're very aggressive human

8490
02:30:07,550 --> 02:30:07,560
microcosm of we're very aggressive human
 

8491
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:10,010
microcosm of we're very aggressive human
civilization is very aggressive so if we

8492
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:10,020
civilization is very aggressive so if we
 

8493
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:13,250
civilization is very aggressive so if we
were easily we get threatened easily

8494
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:13,260
were easily we get threatened easily
 

8495
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:14,570
were easily we get threatened easily
yeah

8496
02:30:14,570 --> 02:30:14,580
yeah
 

8497
02:30:14,580 --> 02:30:16,910
yeah
for stupid reasons because we start like

8498
02:30:16,910 --> 02:30:16,920
for stupid reasons because we start like
 

8499
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:19,130
for stupid reasons because we start like
American Military probably thinks it's

8500
02:30:19,130 --> 02:30:19,140
American Military probably thinks it's
 

8501
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:21,230
American Military probably thinks it's
like the Chinese or the Russians

8502
02:30:21,230 --> 02:30:21,240
like the Chinese or the Russians
 

8503
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:24,349
like the Chinese or the Russians
if we see any kind of flying objects it

8504
02:30:24,349 --> 02:30:24,359
if we see any kind of flying objects it
 

8505
02:30:24,359 --> 02:30:27,530
if we see any kind of flying objects it
gets very on edge I don't know I mean

8506
02:30:27,530 --> 02:30:27,540
gets very on edge I don't know I mean
 

8507
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:29,330
gets very on edge I don't know I mean
because you know part of it is like you

8508
02:30:29,330 --> 02:30:29,340
because you know part of it is like you
 

8509
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:30,650
because you know part of it is like you
just want to ask like that's the thing I

8510
02:30:30,650 --> 02:30:30,660
just want to ask like that's the thing I
 

8511
02:30:30,660 --> 02:30:32,330
just want to ask like that's the thing I
just want to ask questions yeah but you

8512
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:32,340
just want to ask questions yeah but you
 

8513
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:33,469
just want to ask questions yeah but you
know but you don't know the same

8514
02:30:33,469 --> 02:30:33,479
know but you don't know the same
 

8515
02:30:33,479 --> 02:30:34,969
know but you don't know the same
language yeah you're going to get first

8516
02:30:34,969 --> 02:30:34,979
language yeah you're going to get first
 

8517
02:30:34,979 --> 02:30:36,650
language yeah you're going to get first
of all you send a photo bananas you send

8518
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:36,660
of all you send a photo bananas you send
 

8519
02:30:36,660 --> 02:30:38,929
of all you send a photo bananas you send
a butter bananas you get shot

8520
02:30:38,929 --> 02:30:38,939
a butter bananas you get shot
 

8521
02:30:38,939 --> 02:30:40,550
a butter bananas you get shot
um I mean picture if aliens landed in

8522
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:40,560
um I mean picture if aliens landed in
 

8523
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:41,870
um I mean picture if aliens landed in
New York how long would it take for one

8524
02:30:41,870 --> 02:30:41,880
New York how long would it take for one
 

8525
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:44,870
New York how long would it take for one
of them to get shot three minutes if

8526
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:44,880
of them to get shot three minutes if
 

8527
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:47,270
of them to get shot three minutes if
you're a matter of minutes yeah that's

8528
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:47,280
you're a matter of minutes yeah that's
 

8529
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:48,710
you're a matter of minutes yeah that's
because it's New York and everywhere

8530
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:48,720
because it's New York and everywhere
 

8531
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:51,590
because it's New York and everywhere
else look where we are right now that's

8532
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:51,600
else look where we are right now that's
 

8533
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:54,530
else look where we are right now that's
true it'd be even worse here yeah uh

8534
02:30:54,530 --> 02:30:54,540
true it'd be even worse here yeah uh
 

8535
02:30:54,540 --> 02:30:58,010
true it'd be even worse here yeah uh
makes me really makes me wonder what is

8536
02:30:58,010 --> 02:30:58,020
makes me really makes me wonder what is
 

8537
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:01,070
makes me really makes me wonder what is
the right way to interact with

8538
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:01,080
the right way to interact with
 

8539
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:03,590
the right way to interact with
uh intelligent life that's not like our

8540
02:31:03,590 --> 02:31:03,600
uh intelligent life that's not like our
 

8541
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:06,830
uh intelligent life that's not like our
own I hope I I dream of In Our Lifetime

8542
02:31:06,830 --> 02:31:06,840
own I hope I I dream of In Our Lifetime
 

8543
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:08,929
own I hope I I dream of In Our Lifetime
we would interact with

8544
02:31:08,929 --> 02:31:08,939
we would interact with
 

8545
02:31:08,939 --> 02:31:12,230
we would interact with
possibly Life on Mars or on one of the

8546
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:12,240
possibly Life on Mars or on one of the
 

8547
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:15,650
possibly Life on Mars or on one of the
moons of Jupiter or Saturn and like how

8548
02:31:15,650 --> 02:31:15,660
moons of Jupiter or Saturn and like how
 

8549
02:31:15,660 --> 02:31:17,690
moons of Jupiter or Saturn and like how
do you interact with that thing

8550
02:31:17,690 --> 02:31:17,700
do you interact with that thing
 

8551
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:19,490
do you interact with that thing
well this is very technical biological

8552
02:31:19,490 --> 02:31:19,500
well this is very technical biological
 

8553
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:22,730
well this is very technical biological
and chemical processes but also if

8554
02:31:22,730 --> 02:31:22,740
and chemical processes but also if
 

8555
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,170
and chemical processes but also if
there's any kind of intelligence how do

8556
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:24,180
there's any kind of intelligence how do
 

8557
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:25,250
there's any kind of intelligence how do
you try to communicate with that

8558
02:31:25,250 --> 02:31:25,260
you try to communicate with that
 

8559
02:31:25,260 --> 02:31:26,929
you try to communicate with that
intelligence yeah so we're not talking

8560
02:31:26,929 --> 02:31:26,939
intelligence yeah so we're not talking
 

8561
02:31:26,939 --> 02:31:28,070
intelligence yeah so we're not talking
about like a cockroach we're talking

8562
02:31:28,070 --> 02:31:28,080
about like a cockroach we're talking
 

8563
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:29,330
about like a cockroach we're talking
about like some something that's clearly

8564
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:29,340
about like some something that's clearly
 

8565
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:31,250
about like some something that's clearly
like doing things making things well

8566
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:31,260
like doing things making things well
 

8567
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:33,110
like doing things making things well
cockroach possibly how do you know the

8568
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:33,120
cockroach possibly how do you know the
 

8569
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,670
cockroach possibly how do you know the
difference between a Cocker like how do

8570
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:34,680
difference between a Cocker like how do
 

8571
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:35,929
difference between a Cocker like how do
you know we were just talking just like

8572
02:31:35,929 --> 02:31:35,939
you know we were just talking just like
 

8573
02:31:35,939 --> 02:31:38,330
you know we were just talking just like
Australians yeah we don't know we don't

8574
02:31:38,330 --> 02:31:38,340
Australians yeah we don't know we don't
 

8575
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:40,370
Australians yeah we don't know we don't
know we have just like a race of like

8576
02:31:40,370 --> 02:31:40,380
know we have just like a race of like
 

8577
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:42,290
know we have just like a race of like
philosopher cockroaches right chilling

8578
02:31:42,290 --> 02:31:42,300
philosopher cockroaches right chilling
 

8579
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:44,630
philosopher cockroaches right chilling
on the Rocks well here on Earth we kind

8580
02:31:44,630 --> 02:31:44,640
on the Rocks well here on Earth we kind
 

8581
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:46,309
on the Rocks well here on Earth we kind
of there seems to be a strong

8582
02:31:46,309 --> 02:31:46,319
of there seems to be a strong
 

8583
02:31:46,319 --> 02:31:47,929
of there seems to be a strong
correlation between size and

8584
02:31:47,929 --> 02:31:47,939
correlation between size and
 

8585
02:31:47,939 --> 02:31:52,070
correlation between size and
intelligence like yes it seems like the

8586
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:52,080
intelligence like yes it seems like the
 

8587
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:54,530
intelligence like yes it seems like the
bigger things have bigger nervous

8588
02:31:54,530 --> 02:31:54,540
bigger things have bigger nervous
 

8589
02:31:54,540 --> 02:31:55,969
bigger things have bigger nervous
systems and brains and so they're

8590
02:31:55,969 --> 02:31:55,979
systems and brains and so they're
 

8591
02:31:55,979 --> 02:31:58,790
systems and brains and so they're
usually smarter but that doesn't I think

8592
02:31:58,790 --> 02:31:58,800
usually smarter but that doesn't I think
 

8593
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:01,670
usually smarter but that doesn't I think
it's brain it's the ratio brain to body

8594
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:01,680
it's brain it's the ratio brain to body
 

8595
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:03,830
it's brain it's the ratio brain to body
sure because you have like crows yeah

8596
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:03,840
sure because you have like crows yeah
 

8597
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:05,570
sure because you have like crows yeah
that are up among the most intelligent

8598
02:32:05,570 --> 02:32:05,580
that are up among the most intelligent
 

8599
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:08,150
that are up among the most intelligent
it's like the size of the brain to the

8600
02:32:08,150 --> 02:32:08,160
it's like the size of the brain to the
 

8601
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:09,950
it's like the size of the brain to the
size of the body but there also could be

8602
02:32:09,950 --> 02:32:09,960
size of the body but there also could be
 

8603
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:12,770
size of the body but there also could be
kinds of intelligence completely no idea

8604
02:32:12,770 --> 02:32:12,780
kinds of intelligence completely no idea

02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:14,870
kinds of intelligence completely no idea
we're not appreciating maybe cockroaches

8606
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:14,880
we're not appreciating maybe cockroaches
 

8607
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:16,910
we're not appreciating maybe cockroaches
it's survived the longest they're

8608
02:32:16,910 --> 02:32:16,920
it's survived the longest they're
 

8609
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:18,349
it's survived the longest they're
talking [\h__\h] about us right now it's

8610
02:32:18,349 --> 02:32:18,359
talking [\h__\h] about us right now it's
 

8611
02:32:18,359 --> 02:32:20,830
talking [\h__\h] about us right now it's
dumb humans like dude

8612
02:32:20,830 --> 02:32:20,840
dumb humans like dude
 

8613
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:23,210
dumb humans like dude
these rocks are so great a couple of

8614
02:32:23,210 --> 02:32:23,220
these rocks are so great a couple of
 

8615
02:32:23,220 --> 02:32:25,790
these rocks are so great a couple of
hundred years exactly

8616
02:32:25,790 --> 02:32:25,800
hundred years exactly
 

8617
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:27,050

um did you ever ever hear that Kurt

8618
02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:27,060
um did you ever ever hear that Kurt

Vonnegut where the two space Travelers

8620
02:32:28,969 --> 02:32:28,979
Vonnegut where the two space Travelers
 

8621
02:32:28,979 --> 02:32:31,010
Vonnegut where the two space Travelers
get lost this this this really impacted

8622
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:31,020
get lost this this this really impacted
 

8623
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:32,450
get lost this this this really impacted
me as a kid because my dad was an

8624
02:32:32,450 --> 02:32:32,460
me as a kid because my dad was an
 

8625
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:34,090
me as a kid because my dad was an
English teacher so he's always quoting

8626
02:32:34,090 --> 02:32:34,100
English teacher so he's always quoting
 

8627
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:37,610
English teacher so he's always quoting
Dostoyevsky and uh and Kurt Vonnegut and

8628
02:32:37,610 --> 02:32:37,620
Dostoyevsky and uh and Kurt Vonnegut and
 

8629
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:39,410
Dostoyevsky and uh and Kurt Vonnegut and
there's this there's two space Travelers

8630
02:32:39,410 --> 02:32:39,420
there's this there's two space Travelers
 

8631
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:41,690
there's this there's two space Travelers
get like crash landed in a cave

8632
02:32:41,690 --> 02:32:41,700
get like crash landed in a cave
 

8633
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,730
get like crash landed in a cave
and on the walls of the cave are the

8634
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:43,740
and on the walls of the cave are the
 

8635
02:32:43,740 --> 02:32:46,550
and on the walls of the cave are the
harmoniums and these kite-shaped animals

8636
02:32:46,550 --> 02:32:46,560
harmoniums and these kite-shaped animals
 

8637
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:48,290
harmoniums and these kite-shaped animals
and they feed off the vibrations of the

8638
02:32:48,290 --> 02:32:48,300
and they feed off the vibrations of the
 

8639
02:32:48,300 --> 02:32:49,490
and they feed off the vibrations of the
cave and that's all they do they don't

8640
02:32:49,490 --> 02:32:49,500
cave and that's all they do they don't
 

8641
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,889
cave and that's all they do they don't
hurt each other they just do that and so

8642
02:32:51,889 --> 02:32:51,899
hurt each other they just do that and so
 

8643
02:32:51,899 --> 02:32:53,929
hurt each other they just do that and so
for like two years these Travelers are

8644
02:32:53,929 --> 02:32:53,939
for like two years these Travelers are
 

8645
02:32:53,939 --> 02:32:55,190
for like two years these Travelers are
stuck and they're trying to fix their

8646
02:32:55,190 --> 02:32:55,200
stuck and they're trying to fix their
 

8647
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:56,929
stuck and they're trying to fix their
ship and one of them starts playing

8648
02:32:56,929 --> 02:32:56,939
ship and one of them starts playing
 

8649
02:32:56,939 --> 02:32:59,389
ship and one of them starts playing
music for the harmoniums and the

8650
02:32:59,389 --> 02:32:59,399
music for the harmoniums and the
 

8651
02:32:59,399 --> 02:33:01,370
music for the harmoniums and the
harmoniums love him for the music and

harmoniums love him for the music and
they all come around him and and he

they all come around him and and he
 

8655
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:05,210
they all come around him and and he
plays this music for him and finally

plays this music for him and finally
 

8657
02:33:05,220 --> 02:33:08,030
plays this music for him and finally
they they fix the ship

they they fix the ship
 

8659
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:09,889
they they fix the ship
and then the one guy is like all right

yeah this whole ambition thing we've got
 

8675
02:33:24,300 --> 02:33:26,990
yeah this whole ambition thing we've got
going on always trying to build the

8676
02:33:26,990 --> 02:33:27,000
going on always trying to build the
 

8677
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,690
going on always trying to build the
bigger boat bigger thing that might not

8678
02:33:29,690 --> 02:33:29,700
bigger boat bigger thing that might not
 

8679
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:32,150
bigger boat bigger thing that might not
be the the ultimate um

8680
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:32,160
be the the ultimate um
 

8681
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:35,809
be the the ultimate um
conclusion of a of a happy existence as

8682
02:33:35,809 --> 02:33:35,819
conclusion of a of a happy existence as
 

8683
02:33:35,819 --> 02:33:38,330
conclusion of a of a happy existence as
a civilization that's probably that's

8684
02:33:38,330 --> 02:33:38,340
a civilization that's probably that's
 

8685
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:39,710
a civilization that's probably that's
one of the possibilities why we haven't

8686
02:33:39,710 --> 02:33:39,720
one of the possibilities why we haven't
 

8687
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:43,190
one of the possibilities why we haven't
met the aliens yet at scale it's because

8688
02:33:43,190 --> 02:33:43,200
met the aliens yet at scale it's because
 

8689
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,710
met the aliens yet at scale it's because
they're once you get good enough at

8690
02:33:45,710 --> 02:33:45,720
they're once you get good enough at
 

8691
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:47,510
they're once you get good enough at
technology you realize that happiness

8692
02:33:47,510 --> 02:33:47,520
technology you realize that happiness
 

8693
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:50,330
technology you realize that happiness
lies in a peaceful coexistence as

8694
02:33:50,330 --> 02:33:50,340
lies in a peaceful coexistence as
 

8695
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:52,250
lies in a peaceful coexistence as
possible

8696
02:33:52,250 --> 02:33:52,260
possible
 

8697
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:54,830
possible
so where do you stand on like aliens now

8698
02:33:54,830 --> 02:33:54,840
so where do you stand on like aliens now
 

8699
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:57,050
so where do you stand on like aliens now
like there's a lot coming out about the

8700
02:33:57,050 --> 02:33:57,060
like there's a lot coming out about the
 

8701
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:58,910
like there's a lot coming out about the
the pilots and the

8702
02:33:58,910 --> 02:33:58,920
the pilots and the
 

8703
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:00,469
the pilots and the
the things people have been seeing and

8704
02:34:00,469 --> 02:34:00,479
the things people have been seeing and
 

8705
02:34:00,479 --> 02:34:01,849
the things people have been seeing and
again like I kind of come in and out of

8706
02:34:01,849 --> 02:34:01,859
again like I kind of come in and out of
 

8707
02:34:01,859 --> 02:34:02,870
again like I kind of come in and out of
this stuff like I'll be in the jungle

8708
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:02,880
this stuff like I'll be in the jungle
 

8709
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,790
this stuff like I'll be in the jungle
for three months I miss I miss a lot so

8710
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:04,800
for three months I miss I miss a lot so
 

8711
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:07,429
for three months I miss I miss a lot so
like update me like or or are we are we

8712
02:34:07,429 --> 02:34:07,439
like update me like or or are we are we
 

8713
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:09,650
like update me like or or are we are we
being contacted right now like of course

8714
02:34:09,650 --> 02:34:09,660
being contacted right now like of course
 

8715
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:11,570
being contacted right now like of course
nobody knows but I tend to believe my

8716
02:34:11,570 --> 02:34:11,580
nobody knows but I tend to believe my
 

8717
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:13,849
nobody knows but I tend to believe my
intuition says there's aliens everywhere

8718
02:34:13,849 --> 02:34:13,859
intuition says there's aliens everywhere
 

8719
02:34:13,859 --> 02:34:15,650
intuition says there's aliens everywhere
that

8720
02:34:15,650 --> 02:34:15,660
that
 

8721
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:18,230
that
um there are even our galaxy

8722
02:34:18,230 --> 02:34:18,240
um there are even our galaxy
 

8723
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:20,750
um there are even our galaxy
sure that's a biggerly but I believe our

8724
02:34:20,750 --> 02:34:20,760
sure that's a biggerly but I believe our
 

8725
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:23,450
sure that's a biggerly but I believe our
galaxy has

8726
02:34:23,450 --> 02:34:23,460
galaxy has
 

8727
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:26,750
galaxy has
probably billions

8728
02:34:26,750 --> 02:34:26,760
probably billions
 

8729
02:34:26,760 --> 02:34:29,450
probably billions
hundreds of millions of planets with

8730
02:34:29,450 --> 02:34:29,460
hundreds of millions of planets with
 

8731
02:34:29,460 --> 02:34:32,150
hundreds of millions of planets with
life on it like bacteria type of life

8732
02:34:32,150 --> 02:34:32,160
life on it like bacteria type of life
 

8733
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:35,090
life on it like bacteria type of life
sure and I believe there is

8734
02:34:35,090 --> 02:34:35,100
sure and I believe there is
 

8735
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:38,990
sure and I believe there is
I don't know thousands of alien civil

8736
02:34:38,990 --> 02:34:39,000
I don't know thousands of alien civil
 

8737
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,670
I don't know thousands of alien civil
intelligent aliens civilizations that

8738
02:34:40,670 --> 02:34:40,680
intelligent aliens civilizations that
 

8739
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:43,429
intelligent aliens civilizations that
exist or have existed the problem is

8740
02:34:43,429 --> 02:34:43,439
exist or have existed the problem is
 

8741
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:45,530
exist or have existed the problem is
there's a lot of time and it's very

8742
02:34:45,530 --> 02:34:45,540
there's a lot of time and it's very
 

8743
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:47,510
there's a lot of time and it's very
difficult to contact each other

8744
02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:47,520
difficult to contact each other
 

8745
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:49,849
difficult to contact each other
so to achieve

8746
02:34:49,849 --> 02:34:49,859
so to achieve
 

8747
02:34:49,859 --> 02:34:52,670
so to achieve
a kind of civilization that's able to

8748
02:34:52,670 --> 02:34:52,680
a kind of civilization that's able to
 

8749
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:56,990
a kind of civilization that's able to
actually send out enough signal or

8750
02:34:56,990 --> 02:34:57,000
actually send out enough signal or
 

8751
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,090
actually send out enough signal or
um radiate enough energy where we would

8752
02:34:59,090 --> 02:34:59,100
um radiate enough energy where we would
 

8753
02:34:59,100 --> 02:35:01,429
um radiate enough energy where we would
notice I think that's really tough

8754
02:35:01,429 --> 02:35:01,439
notice I think that's really tough
 

8755
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:03,770
notice I think that's really tough
that said statistically speaking it

8756
02:35:03,770 --> 02:35:03,780
that said statistically speaking it
 

8757
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:04,790
that said statistically speaking it
seems like that should have been

8758
02:35:04,790 --> 02:35:04,800
seems like that should have been
 

8759
02:35:04,800 --> 02:35:06,469
seems like that should have been
possible inside our galaxy or maybe

8760
02:35:06,469 --> 02:35:06,479
possible inside our galaxy or maybe
 

8761
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:09,590
possible inside our galaxy or maybe
nearby and so

8762
02:35:09,590 --> 02:35:09,600
nearby and so
 

8763
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:12,950
nearby and so
I suspect that

8764
02:35:12,950 --> 02:35:12,960
I suspect that
 

8765
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:13,969
I suspect that
um

8766
02:35:13,969 --> 02:35:13,979
um
 

8767
02:35:13,979 --> 02:35:17,870
um
once an alien civilization is just many

8768
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:17,880
once an alien civilization is just many
 

8769
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:20,090
once an alien civilization is just many
orders of magnitude smarter than us

8770
02:35:20,090 --> 02:35:20,100
orders of magnitude smarter than us
 

8771
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:23,510
orders of magnitude smarter than us
humans the way you would contact us

8772
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:23,520
humans the way you would contact us
 

8773
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:25,309
humans the way you would contact us
is going to be very difficult for us

8774
02:35:25,309 --> 02:35:25,319
is going to be very difficult for us
 

8775
02:35:25,319 --> 02:35:27,710
is going to be very difficult for us
humans to understand we're very

8776
02:35:27,710 --> 02:35:27,720
humans to understand we're very
 

8777
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:30,349
humans to understand we're very
egocentric we want the message to be

02:35:30,349 --> 02:35:30,359
egocentric we want the message to be
 

8779

02:35:45,479 --> 02:35:49,370
thoughts
could be like fingertips

8792
02:35:49,370 --> 02:35:49,380
could be like fingertips
 

8793
02:35:49,380 --> 02:35:52,429
could be like fingertips
um could be words in the story that the

8794
02:35:52,429 --> 02:35:52,439
um could be words in the story that the
 

8795
02:35:52,439 --> 02:35:53,809
um could be words in the story that the
aliens are telling us

8796

aliens are telling us
 

8797

things that are just like a low
dimensional projection of a much higher

8802
02:36:00,230 --> 02:36:00,240
dimensional projection of a much higher
 

8803
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:01,969
dimensional projection of a much higher
dimensional message that's being said by

8804
02:36:01,969 --> 02:36:01,979
dimensional message that's being said by
 

8805
02:36:01,979 --> 02:36:04,490
dimensional message that's being said by
aliens and it may be our striving to

8806
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:04,500
aliens and it may be our striving to
 

8807
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:07,429
aliens and it may be our striving to
create technology is to create the kind

8808
02:36:07,429 --> 02:36:07,439
create technology is to create the kind
 

8809
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:09,110
create technology is to create the kind
of sensor that's actually able to hear

8810
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:09,120
of sensor that's actually able to hear
 

8811
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:11,150
of sensor that's actually able to hear
some of the message maybe that's what AI

8812
02:36:11,150 --> 02:36:11,160
some of the message maybe that's what AI
 

8813
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:14,330
some of the message maybe that's what AI
is trying to do so I I think that

8814
02:36:14,330 --> 02:36:14,340
is trying to do so I I think that
 

8815
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:16,270
is trying to do so I I think that
bridging that barrier of communication

8816
02:36:16,270 --> 02:36:16,280
bridging that barrier of communication
 

8817
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:19,130
bridging that barrier of communication
between us and cockroaches

8818
02:36:19,130 --> 02:36:19,140
between us and cockroaches
 

8819
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:20,830
between us and cockroaches
I think that's the biggest challenge

8820
02:36:20,830 --> 02:36:20,840
I think that's the biggest challenge
 

8821
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:23,210
I think that's the biggest challenge
interesting like the messages are all

8822
02:36:23,210 --> 02:36:23,220
interesting like the messages are all
 

8823
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:24,710
interesting like the messages are all
around us they're here

8824
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:24,720
around us they're here
 

8825
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:27,530
around us they're here
I I suspect that the the alien messages

8826
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:27,540
I I suspect that the the alien messages
 

8827
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:29,929
I I suspect that the the alien messages
are here the aliens are here we're just

8828
02:36:29,929 --> 02:36:29,939
are here the aliens are here we're just
 

8829
02:36:29,939 --> 02:36:31,849
are here the aliens are here we're just
too dumb to see it

8830
02:36:31,849 --> 02:36:31,859
too dumb to see it
 

8831
02:36:31,859 --> 02:36:33,050
too dumb to see it
so

8832
02:36:33,050 --> 02:36:33,060
so
 

8833
02:36:33,060 --> 02:36:35,510
so
first of all the imagining planets where

8834
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:35,520
first of all the imagining planets where
 

8835
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:36,650
first of all the imagining planets where
there are

8836
02:36:36,650 --> 02:36:36,660
there are
 

8837
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:38,570
there are
like just picturing like a site like a

8838
02:36:38,570 --> 02:36:38,580
like just picturing like a site like a
 

8839
02:36:38,580 --> 02:36:40,070
like just picturing like a site like a
not a silent Planet but just like a

8840
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:40,080
not a silent Planet but just like a
 

8841
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:41,510
not a silent Planet but just like a
planet of

8842
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:41,520
planet of
 

8843
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:43,849
planet of
alternate life forms you know maybe it's

8844
02:36:43,849 --> 02:36:43,859
alternate life forms you know maybe it's
 

8845
02:36:43,859 --> 02:36:45,469
alternate life forms you know maybe it's
not something that's that we can

8846
02:36:45,469 --> 02:36:45,479
not something that's that we can
 

8847
02:36:45,479 --> 02:36:47,510
not something that's that we can
communicate and have a conversation with

8848
02:36:47,510 --> 02:36:47,520
communicate and have a conversation with
 

8849
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:49,130
communicate and have a conversation with
but just like a planet of like

8850
02:36:49,130 --> 02:36:49,140
but just like a planet of like
 

8851
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:51,170
but just like a planet of like
butterflies and centipedes and and weird

8852
02:36:51,170 --> 02:36:51,180
butterflies and centipedes and and weird
 

8853
02:36:51,180 --> 02:36:53,690
butterflies and centipedes and and weird
you know unfortunately bacteria for

8854
02:36:53,690 --> 02:36:53,700
you know unfortunately bacteria for
 

8855
02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:57,170
you know unfortunately bacteria for
billions of years it was uh bacteria as

8856
02:36:57,170 --> 02:36:57,180
billions of years it was uh bacteria as
 

8857
02:36:57,180 --> 02:37:01,010
billions of years it was uh bacteria as
a single cell prokaryotes and eukaryotes

8858
02:37:01,010 --> 02:37:01,020
a single cell prokaryotes and eukaryotes
 

8859
02:37:01,020 --> 02:37:03,349
a single cell prokaryotes and eukaryotes
but they're not they're boring but yeah

8860
02:37:03,349 --> 02:37:03,359
but they're not they're boring but yeah
 

8861
02:37:03,359 --> 02:37:06,230
but they're not they're boring but yeah
but animal animals of some sort in an

8862
02:37:06,230 --> 02:37:06,240
but animal animals of some sort in an
 

8863
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:07,910
but animal animals of some sort in an
environment of some sort imagine that

8864
02:37:07,910 --> 02:37:07,920
environment of some sort imagine that
 

8865
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:09,290
environment of some sort imagine that
would just be such an interesting

8866
02:37:09,290 --> 02:37:09,300
would just be such an interesting
 

8867
02:37:09,300 --> 02:37:11,809
would just be such an interesting
beautiful amazing thing and I'm sure

8868
02:37:11,809 --> 02:37:11,819
beautiful amazing thing and I'm sure
 

8869
02:37:11,819 --> 02:37:14,090
beautiful amazing thing and I'm sure
they're out on that I'm yeah the kind of

8870
02:37:14,090 --> 02:37:14,100
they're out on that I'm yeah the kind of
 

8871
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:17,710
they're out on that I'm yeah the kind of
viruses they got going on

8872
02:37:17,710 --> 02:37:17,720
viruses they got going on
 

8873
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:20,570
viruses they got going on
it's uh but they could also not be

8874
02:37:20,570 --> 02:37:20,580
it's uh but they could also not be
 

8875
02:37:20,580 --> 02:37:22,370
it's uh but they could also not be
biologically based they could be

8876
02:37:22,370 --> 02:37:22,380
biologically based they could be
 

8877
02:37:22,380 --> 02:37:23,929
biologically based they could be
different chemistry so you have to be

8878
02:37:23,929 --> 02:37:23,939
different chemistry so you have to be
 

8879
02:37:23,939 --> 02:37:26,150
different chemistry so you have to be
humble to that too sure

8880
02:37:26,150 --> 02:37:26,160
humble to that too sure
 

8881
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:28,190
humble to that too sure
but then you know depends on the day

8882
02:37:28,190 --> 02:37:28,200
but then you know depends on the day
 

8883
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:30,889
but then you know depends on the day
like I think you caught me on that day

8884
02:37:30,889 --> 02:37:30,899
like I think you caught me on that day
 

8885
02:37:30,899 --> 02:37:34,130
like I think you caught me on that day
today an optimistic one sometimes I I

8886
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:34,140
today an optimistic one sometimes I I
 

8887
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:36,250
today an optimistic one sometimes I I
think that we're all we

8888
02:37:36,250 --> 02:37:36,260
think that we're all we
 

8889
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:38,750
think that we're all we
this is all there is because you start

8890
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:38,760
this is all there is because you start
 

8891
02:37:38,760 --> 02:37:40,910
this is all there is because you start
you ask that question the family Paradox

8892
02:37:40,910 --> 02:37:40,920
you ask that question the family Paradox
 

8893
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:43,070
you ask that question the family Paradox
like why aren't they here

8894
02:37:43,070 --> 02:37:43,080
like why aren't they here
 

8895
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:45,349
like why aren't they here
you can't imagine an advanced sales

8896
02:37:45,349 --> 02:37:45,359
you can't imagine an advanced sales
 

8897
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:47,090
you can't imagine an advanced sales
civilization that would not be explorers

8898
02:37:47,090 --> 02:37:47,100
civilization that would not be explorers
 

8899
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:50,990
civilization that would not be explorers
because we're explorers why is that

8900
02:37:50,990 --> 02:37:51,000
because we're explorers why is that
 

8901
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,450
because we're explorers why is that
depressing to you that the idea that

8902
02:37:53,450 --> 02:37:53,460
depressing to you that the idea that
 

8903
02:37:53,460 --> 02:37:55,610
depressing to you that the idea that
that let's just say you found out right

8904
02:37:55,610 --> 02:37:55,620
that let's just say you found out right
 

8905
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:58,010
that let's just say you found out right
now that there isn't anything else let's

8906
02:37:58,010 --> 02:37:58,020
now that there isn't anything else let's
 

8907
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:01,190
now that there isn't anything else let's
just say that for for example sake that

8908
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:01,200
just say that for for example sake that
 

8909
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:03,830
just say that for for example sake that
the Earth is the earth and the universe

8910
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:03,840
the Earth is the earth and the universe
 

8911
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:05,090
the Earth is the earth and the universe
is the universe and it's sort of like

8912
02:38:05,090 --> 02:38:05,100
is the universe and it's sort of like
 

8913
02:38:05,100 --> 02:38:07,130
is the universe and it's sort of like
the backdrop of a video game

8914
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:07,140
the backdrop of a video game
 

8915
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:09,290
the backdrop of a video game
and it's just what's out there

8916
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:09,300
and it's just what's out there
 

8917
02:38:09,300 --> 02:38:11,570
and it's just what's out there
would that be tremendously depressing to

8918
02:38:11,570 --> 02:38:11,580
would that be tremendously depressing to
 

8919
02:38:11,580 --> 02:38:13,849
would that be tremendously depressing to
you I think it's exciting for an

8920
02:38:13,849 --> 02:38:13,859
you I think it's exciting for an
 

8921
02:38:13,859 --> 02:38:15,650
you I think it's exciting for an
engineer it's probably exciting for an

8922
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:15,660
engineer it's probably exciting for an
 

8923
02:38:15,660 --> 02:38:18,170
engineer it's probably exciting for an
Explorer but I would equate that to your

8924
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:18,180
Explorer but I would equate that to your
 

8925
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:21,170
Explorer but I would equate that to your
going out hiking for three days with one

8926

match
 

8929
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:24,710
match
it kind of terrifies me that we only got

8930
02:38:24,710 --> 02:38:24,720
it kind of terrifies me that we only got
 

8931
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:26,450
it kind of terrifies me that we only got
one match really

saying is that is is your worry then
that we need to have a backup plan yeah

8956
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:51,840
that we need to have a backup plan yeah
 

8957
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:55,070
that we need to have a backup plan yeah
really well there has so like what if we

8958
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:55,080
really well there has so like what if we

at the edge of space like you know
there's the conundrums of of space-time

9114
02:42:03,530 --> 02:42:03,540
there's the conundrums of of space-time
 

9115
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:07,070
there's the conundrums of of space-time
and but but I'm so to me I'm like what

9116
02:42:07,070 --> 02:42:07,080
and but but I'm so to me I'm like what
 

9117
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:09,349
and but but I'm so to me I'm like what
if what if the aliens are watching us or

9118
02:42:09,349 --> 02:42:09,359
if what if the aliens are watching us or
 

9119
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:10,670
if what if the aliens are watching us or
what if the aliens aren't watching us

9120
02:42:10,670 --> 02:42:10,680
what if the aliens aren't watching us
 

9121
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:13,190
what if the aliens aren't watching us
but what if the challenge here is we've

9122
02:42:13,190 --> 02:42:13,200
but what if the challenge here is we've
 

9123
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:16,330
but what if the challenge here is we've
been put on on Earth as as the most

9124
02:42:16,330 --> 02:42:16,340
been put on on Earth as as the most
 

9125
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:19,190
been put on on Earth as as the most
intellectually complex of these

9126
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:19,200
intellectually complex of these
 

9127
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:21,469
intellectually complex of these
creatures and and and we're being

9128
02:42:21,469 --> 02:42:21,479
creatures and and and we're being
 

9129
02:42:21,479 --> 02:42:23,570
creatures and and and we're being
observed to see how we manage it and

9130
02:42:23,570 --> 02:42:23,580
observed to see how we manage it and
 

9131
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:25,190
observed to see how we manage it and
it's like yeah we haven't made a good

9132
02:42:25,190 --> 02:42:25,200
it's like yeah we haven't made a good
 

9133
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:27,410
it's like yeah we haven't made a good
job of managing each other

9134
02:42:27,410 --> 02:42:27,420
job of managing each other
 

9135
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:29,929
job of managing each other
you know before

9136
02:42:29,929 --> 02:42:29,939
you know before
 

9137
02:42:29,939 --> 02:42:33,170

02:42:43,490 --> 02:42:43,500
I just sometimes I wonder
 

9149
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:46,309
I just sometimes I wonder
you know what what the is is there a

9150
02:42:46,309 --> 02:42:46,319
you know what what the is is there a
 

9151
02:42:46,319 --> 02:42:47,750
you know what what the is is there a
grand narrative with with what we're

9152
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:47,760
grand narrative with with what we're
 

9153
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:49,370
grand narrative with with what we're
doing to Wildlife because it's like we

9154
02:42:49,370 --> 02:42:49,380
doing to Wildlife because it's like we
 

9155
02:42:49,380 --> 02:42:50,990
doing to Wildlife because it's like we
have all these other species and we're

9156
02:42:50,990 --> 02:42:51,000
have all these other species and we're
 

9157
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,730
have all these other species and we're
we're struggling even here in this

9158
02:42:52,730 --> 02:42:52,740
we're struggling even here in this
 

9159
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:54,590
we're struggling even here in this
conversation to sort of quantify like

9160
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:54,600
conversation to sort of quantify like
 

9161
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:56,090
conversation to sort of quantify like
you know

9162
02:42:56,090 --> 02:42:56,100
you know
 

9163
02:42:56,100 --> 02:42:57,889
you know
I I think that most people don't think

9164
02:42:57,889 --> 02:42:57,899
I I think that most people don't think
 

9165
02:42:57,899 --> 02:43:00,290
I I think that most people don't think
outside of the human framework

9166
02:43:00,290 --> 02:43:00,300
outside of the human framework
 

9167
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:01,490
outside of the human framework
you know what I mean like just driving

9168
02:43:01,490 --> 02:43:01,500
you know what I mean like just driving
 

9169
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:03,170
you know what I mean like just driving
around for me living outside of the

9170
02:43:03,170 --> 02:43:03,180
around for me living outside of the
 

9171
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:05,510
around for me living outside of the
Jungle even just for a few weeks I get

9172
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:05,520
Jungle even just for a few weeks I get
 

9173
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:07,610
Jungle even just for a few weeks I get
you don't you don't you don't even think

9174
02:43:07,610 --> 02:43:07,620
you don't you don't you don't even think
 

9175
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:08,990
you don't you don't you don't even think
about the fact that there's other

9176
02:43:08,990 --> 02:43:09,000
about the fact that there's other
 

9177
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,630
about the fact that there's other
species around us we really don't day to

9178
02:43:11,630 --> 02:43:11,640
species around us we really don't day to
 

9179
02:43:11,640 --> 02:43:13,910
species around us we really don't day to
day you look at TV and you look at when

9180
02:43:13,910 --> 02:43:13,920
day you look at TV and you look at when
 

9181
02:43:13,920 --> 02:43:15,230
day you look at TV and you look at when
you listen to the radio and it doesn't

9182
02:43:15,230 --> 02:43:15,240
you listen to the radio and it doesn't
 

9183
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:17,389
you listen to the radio and it doesn't
it's not very consequential to the

9184
02:43:17,389 --> 02:43:17,399
it's not very consequential to the
 

9185
02:43:17,399 --> 02:43:19,429
it's not very consequential to the
average person living in a city that

9186
02:43:19,429 --> 02:43:19,439
average person living in a city that
 

9187
02:43:19,439 --> 02:43:20,990
average person living in a city that
there are these

9188
02:43:20,990 --> 02:43:21,000
there are these
 

9189
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,210
there are these
you know Islands covered in walruses and

9190
02:43:23,210 --> 02:43:23,220
you know Islands covered in walruses and
 

9191
02:43:23,220 --> 02:43:25,490
you know Islands covered in walruses and
that there's rainforests filled with

9192
02:43:25,490 --> 02:43:25,500
that there's rainforests filled with
 

9193
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:27,770
that there's rainforests filled with
birds and and frogs and all these things

birds and and frogs and all these things
 

9195

are contributing to our fresh water and

9198
02:43:32,450 --> 02:43:32,460
are contributing to our fresh water and
 

9199
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:35,150
are contributing to our fresh water and
and that that life is literally given to

9200
02:43:35,150 --> 02:43:35,160
and that that life is literally given to
 

9201
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:37,429
and that that life is literally given to

us and made possible by these ecological
 

9203
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:39,050
us and made possible by these ecological
systems to me

9204
02:43:39,050 --> 02:43:39,060
systems to me
 

9205
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:40,790
systems to me
that's where like the whole you know

9206
02:43:40,790 --> 02:43:40,800
that's where like the whole you know
 

9207
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:43,190
that's where like the whole you know
essence of my existence comes from and

9208
02:43:43,190 --> 02:43:43,200
essence of my existence comes from and
 

9209
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:45,110
essence of my existence comes from and
so like

9210

yeah thank you for that reminder because
 

9213
02:43:46,740 --> 02:43:49,309
yeah thank you for that reminder because
you're basically saying like the alien

9214
02:43:49,309 --> 02:43:49,319
you're basically saying like the alien
 

9215
02:43:49,319 --> 02:43:51,290
you're basically saying like the alien
civilizations you dream about are here

9216
02:43:51,290 --> 02:43:51,300
civilizations you dream about are here
 

9217
02:43:51,300 --> 02:43:52,250
civilizations you dream about are here
on Earth

9218
02:43:52,250 --> 02:43:52,260
on Earth
 

9219
02:43:52,260 --> 02:43:55,610
on Earth
those those those worlds are here

9220
02:43:55,610 --> 02:43:55,620
those those those worlds are here
 

9221
02:43:55,620 --> 02:43:57,950
those those those worlds are here
for me yeah yeah no I agree with you I

9222
02:43:57,950 --> 02:43:57,960
for me yeah yeah no I agree with you I

of the time the you know I I think I'm
on mushrooms all the time

9230
02:44:07,389 --> 02:44:07,399
on mushrooms all the time
 

9231
02:44:07,399 --> 02:44:09,650
on mushrooms all the time
genetically somehow because when I go

9232
02:44:09,650 --> 02:44:09,660
genetically somehow because when I go
 

9233
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:11,750
genetically somehow because when I go
out in nature it's just the the beauty

9234
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:11,760
out in nature it's just the the beauty
 

9235
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:13,790
out in nature it's just the the beauty
even of nothing you talk about the

9236
02:44:13,790 --> 02:44:13,800
even of nothing you talk about the
 

9237
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:17,469
even of nothing you talk about the
Amazon man just basics of nature yeah

9238
02:44:17,469 --> 02:44:17,479
Amazon man just basics of nature yeah
 

9239
02:44:17,479 --> 02:44:21,469
Amazon man just basics of nature yeah
fill you fill me with awe and the other

9240
02:44:21,469 --> 02:44:21,479
fill you fill me with awe and the other
 

9241
02:44:21,479 --> 02:44:23,650
fill you fill me with awe and the other
thing that fills me with all

9242
02:44:23,650 --> 02:44:23,660
thing that fills me with all
 

9243
02:44:23,660 --> 02:44:27,950
thing that fills me with all
is our own mind like the the biology of

9244
02:44:27,950 --> 02:44:27,960
is our own mind like the the biology of
 

9245
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:30,710
is our own mind like the the biology of
these things firing basically are not

9246
02:44:30,710 --> 02:44:30,720
these things firing basically are not
 

9247
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:33,230
these things firing basically are not
our own mind but biology yeah of any

9248
02:44:33,230 --> 02:44:33,240
our own mind but biology yeah of any
 

9249
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:34,910
our own mind but biology yeah of any
living organisms

9250
02:44:34,910 --> 02:44:34,920
living organisms
 

9251
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:37,130
living organisms
because it's like an ecosystem they've

9252
02:44:37,130 --> 02:44:37,140
because it's like an ecosystem they've
 

9253
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:38,510
because it's like an ecosystem they've
came these cells came together they

9254
02:44:38,510 --> 02:44:38,520
came these cells came together they
 

9255
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:41,330
came these cells came together they
somehow functional they delegate they

9256
02:44:41,330 --> 02:44:41,340
somehow functional they delegate they
 

9257
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:43,429
somehow functional they delegate they
mostly operate in a local way but they

9258
02:44:43,429 --> 02:44:43,439
mostly operate in a local way but they
 

9259
02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:44,990
mostly operate in a local way but they
uh

9260
02:44:44,990 --> 02:44:45,000
uh
 

9261
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,790
uh
first of all it's just like you said

9262
02:44:46,790 --> 02:44:46,800
first of all it's just like you said
 

9263
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:48,290
first of all it's just like you said
with the anacondas you start out as a

9264
02:44:48,290 --> 02:44:48,300
with the anacondas you start out as a
 

9265
02:44:48,300 --> 02:44:50,090
with the anacondas you start out as a
tiny snake and you become giant when

9266
02:44:50,090 --> 02:44:50,100
tiny snake and you become giant when
 

9267
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:51,770
tiny snake and you become giant when
you're a tiny snake you're you're

embryo single cell is a human and
 

9279
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:04,010
embryo single cell is a human and
through the embryogenic process

9280
02:45:04,010 --> 02:45:04,020
through the embryogenic process
 

9281
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:06,590
through the embryogenic process
constructing this giant human that's

9282

this Earth
 

9327
02:45:53,939 --> 02:45:55,610
this Earth
and I'm holding this thing that's been

9328
02:45:55,610 --> 02:45:55,620
and I'm holding this thing that's been
 

9329
02:45:55,620 --> 02:45:57,830
and I'm holding this thing that's been
places that we can't even think about

9330
02:45:57,830 --> 02:45:57,840
places that we can't even think about
 

9331

and it blows my mind and I love it but
but when it comes to like intelligence

9334
02:46:02,570 --> 02:46:02,580
but when it comes to like intelligence
 

9335
02:46:02,580 --> 02:46:04,969
but when it comes to like intelligence
I think it's like

9336
02:46:04,969 --> 02:46:04,979
I think it's like
 

9337
02:46:04,979 --> 02:46:07,670
I think it's like
I'm I'm so concerned with the fact that

9338
02:46:07,670 --> 02:46:07,680
I'm I'm so concerned with the fact that
 

9339
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:10,190
I'm I'm so concerned with the fact that
we're at this moment in history

9340
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:10,200
we're at this moment in history
 

9341
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:11,929
we're at this moment in history
and it's interesting to me that you know

9342
02:46:11,929 --> 02:46:11,939
and it's interesting to me that you know
 

9343
02:46:11,939 --> 02:46:13,370
and it's interesting to me that you know
we had the internet and now that with

9344
02:46:13,370 --> 02:46:13,380
we had the internet and now that with
 

9345
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:16,370
we had the internet and now that with
the emergence of AI and more and more I

9346
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:16,380
the emergence of AI and more and more I
 

9347
02:46:16,380 --> 02:46:18,410
the emergence of AI and more and more I
feel like we are starting to resemble

9348
02:46:18,410 --> 02:46:18,420
feel like we are starting to resemble
 

9349
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:20,630
feel like we are starting to resemble
like an ant colony where there's more

9350
02:46:20,630 --> 02:46:20,640
like an ant colony where there's more
 

9351
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:22,490
like an ant colony where there's more
and more connection and there's more and

9352
02:46:22,490 --> 02:46:22,500
and more connection and there's more and
 

9353
02:46:22,500 --> 02:46:23,870
and more connection and there's more and
more interaction globally between

9354
02:46:23,870 --> 02:46:23,880
more interaction globally between
 

9355
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:26,150
more interaction globally between
everybody in the next 10 years we're

9356
02:46:26,150 --> 02:46:26,160
everybody in the next 10 years we're
 

9357
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:27,650
everybody in the next 10 years we're
gonna have to decide are we gonna let

9358
02:46:27,650 --> 02:46:27,660
gonna have to decide are we gonna let
 

9359
02:46:27,660 --> 02:46:29,929
gonna have to decide are we gonna let
our ocean ecosystems just collapse are

9360
02:46:29,929 --> 02:46:29,939
our ocean ecosystems just collapse are
 

9361
02:46:29,939 --> 02:46:31,070
our ocean ecosystems just collapse are
we going to just take that three percent

9362
02:46:31,070 --> 02:46:31,080
we going to just take that three percent
 

9363
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:33,050
we going to just take that three percent
of rainforest and just let them log the

9364
02:46:33,050 --> 02:46:33,060
of rainforest and just let them log the
 

9365
02:46:33,060 --> 02:46:34,550
of rainforest and just let them log the
[\h__\h] out of it until it's gone and it's

9366
02:46:34,550 --> 02:46:34,560
[\h__\h] out of it until it's gone and it's
 

9367
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:36,230
[\h__\h] out of it until it's gone and it's
like we're gonna be in a very different

9368
02:46:36,230 --> 02:46:36,240
like we're gonna be in a very different
 

9369
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:38,170
like we're gonna be in a very different
reality then then it's going to be very

9370
02:46:38,170 --> 02:46:38,180
reality then then it's going to be very
 

9371
02:46:38,180 --> 02:46:41,150
reality then then it's going to be very
dystopian future or

9372
02:46:41,150 --> 02:46:41,160
dystopian future or
 

9373
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:43,510
dystopian future or
can we keep the good things about Earth

9374
02:46:43,510 --> 02:46:43,520
can we keep the good things about Earth
 

9375
02:46:43,520 --> 02:46:46,490
can we keep the good things about Earth
transcend that realize that we have

9376
02:46:46,490 --> 02:46:46,500
transcend that realize that we have
 

9377
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:48,950
transcend that realize that we have
these incredible alien species around us

9378
02:46:48,950 --> 02:46:48,960
these incredible alien species around us
 

9379
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:50,510
these incredible alien species around us
that are animals that we grew up with

9380
02:46:50,510 --> 02:46:50,520
that are animals that we grew up with
 

9381
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:52,250
that are animals that we grew up with
that we wouldn't be here without that we

9382
02:46:52,250 --> 02:46:52,260
that we wouldn't be here without that we
 

9383
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:53,929
that we wouldn't be here without that we
owe something to

9384
02:46:53,929 --> 02:46:53,939
owe something to
 

9385
02:46:53,939 --> 02:46:57,110
owe something to
and I feel like at that stage then

9386
02:46:57,110 --> 02:46:57,120
and I feel like at that stage then
 

9387
02:46:57,120 --> 02:46:59,690
and I feel like at that stage then
the the the outward look becomes

9388
02:46:59,690 --> 02:46:59,700
the the the outward look becomes
 

9389
02:46:59,700 --> 02:47:01,070
the the the outward look becomes
something else it's almost like we've

9390
02:47:01,070 --> 02:47:01,080
something else it's almost like we've
 

9391
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:03,230
something else it's almost like we've
we've proven that if aliens came up to

9392
02:47:03,230 --> 02:47:03,240
we've proven that if aliens came up to
 

9393
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:05,150
we've proven that if aliens came up to
us that's when I'd feel good

9394
02:47:05,150 --> 02:47:05,160
us that's when I'd feel good
 

9395

it's just you know I I have trouble
trouble looking out into space I have

9434
02:47:45,950 --> 02:47:45,960
trouble looking out into space I have
 

9435
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:47,929
trouble looking out into space I have
trouble looking out into normal life as

9436
02:47:47,929 --> 02:47:47,939
trouble looking out into normal life as
 

9437
02:47:47,939 --> 02:47:49,790
trouble looking out into normal life as
a human because I'm so concerned with

9438
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:49,800
a human because I'm so concerned with
 

9439
02:47:49,800 --> 02:47:51,349
a human because I'm so concerned with
trying to make sure that they're okay

9440
02:47:51,349 --> 02:47:51,359
trying to make sure that they're okay
 

9441
02:47:51,359 --> 02:47:53,030
trying to make sure that they're okay
because not enough people are doing that

9442
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:53,040
because not enough people are doing that
 

9443
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:54,710
because not enough people are doing that
oh the interesting thing about all the

9444
02:47:54,710 --> 02:47:54,720
oh the interesting thing about all the
 

9445
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:57,290
oh the interesting thing about all the
development with AI and just that we're

9446
02:47:57,290 --> 02:47:57,300
development with AI and just that we're
 

9447
02:47:57,300 --> 02:47:59,630
development with AI and just that we're
living more and more of our life online

9448
02:47:59,630 --> 02:47:59,640
living more and more of our life online
 

9449
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:03,770
living more and more of our life online
I think we're actually learning

9450
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:03,780

 

9451
02:48:03,780 --> 02:48:07,070

what's missing when it's online

9452
02:48:07,070 --> 02:48:07,080
what's missing when it's online
 

9453
02:48:07,080 --> 02:48:08,630
what's missing when it's online
like

9454
02:48:08,630 --> 02:48:08,640
like
 

9455
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:12,050
like
I think people realize that online

9456
02:48:12,050 --> 02:48:12,060
I think people realize that online
 

9457
02:48:12,060 --> 02:48:14,150
I think people realize that online
interaction is shallow but we're just

9458
02:48:14,150 --> 02:48:14,160
interaction is shallow but we're just
 

9459
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:16,429
interaction is shallow but we're just
learning that that that's a reality yeah

9460
02:48:16,429 --> 02:48:16,439
learning that that that's a reality yeah
 

9461
02:48:16,439 --> 02:48:18,710
learning that that that's a reality yeah
that we need that human connection and I

9462
02:48:18,710 --> 02:48:18,720
that we need that human connection and I
 

9463
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:20,210
that we need that human connection and I
think there's going to be the swing back

9464
02:48:20,210 --> 02:48:20,220
think there's going to be the swing back
 

9465
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:23,570
think there's going to be the swing back
to like sadly AI systems of the future

9466
02:48:23,570 --> 02:48:23,580
to like sadly AI systems of the future
 

9467
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:25,969
to like sadly AI systems of the future
might be able to live fulfilling lives

9468
02:48:25,969 --> 02:48:25,979
might be able to live fulfilling lives
 

9469
02:48:25,979 --> 02:48:29,750
might be able to live fulfilling lives
online but us humans have have to have a

9470
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:29,760
online but us humans have have to have a
 

9471
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:31,969
online but us humans have have to have a
deep connection with Earth and like with

9472
02:48:31,969 --> 02:48:31,979
deep connection with Earth and like with
 

9473
02:48:31,979 --> 02:48:33,889
deep connection with Earth and like with
with each other physical connection I

9474
02:48:33,889 --> 02:48:33,899
with each other physical connection I
 

9475
02:48:33,899 --> 02:48:36,170
with each other physical connection I
think there's going to be a phase

9476
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:36,180
think there's going to be a phase
 

9477
02:48:36,180 --> 02:48:38,450
think there's going to be a phase
somewhere in the century where we go

9478
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:38,460
somewhere in the century where we go
 

9479
02:48:38,460 --> 02:48:40,429
somewhere in the century where we go
back to deep physical connection and

9480
02:48:40,429 --> 02:48:40,439
back to deep physical connection and
 

9481
02:48:40,439 --> 02:48:42,530
back to deep physical connection and
there will be a digital world sure that

9482
02:48:42,530 --> 02:48:42,540
there will be a digital world sure that
 

9483
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:44,510
there will be a digital world sure that
we visit that it would be separate and

9484
02:48:44,510 --> 02:48:44,520
we visit that it would be separate and
 

9485
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:46,190
we visit that it would be separate and
that's the you have

9486
02:48:46,190 --> 02:48:46,200
that's the you have
 

9487
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:47,990
that's the you have
a discussion with that with Twitter with

out like Okay so
how do we use them

how do we use them
 

9501
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:04,490
how do we use them
in a way that does connect us does

9502
02:49:04,490 --> 02:49:04,500
in a way that does connect us does
 

9503
02:49:04,500 --> 02:49:07,429
in a way that does connect us does
educate us grow a knowledge base but

9504
02:49:07,429 --> 02:49:07,439
educate us grow a knowledge base but
 

9505
02:49:07,439 --> 02:49:10,190

9509
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:15,050
fulfilling in a deep human way that
we're for good and for bad genetically

9510
02:49:15,050 --> 02:49:15,060
we're for good and for bad genetically
 

9511
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:17,750
we're for good and for bad genetically
designed we could they can't overcome so

9512
02:49:17,750 --> 02:49:17,760
designed we could they can't overcome so
 

9513
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:21,710
designed we could they can't overcome so
we can't escape these meet Vehicles yeah

don't know is it that bad that this is

9526
02:49:32,330 --> 02:49:32,340
don't know is it that bad that this is
 

9527
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:33,530
don't know is it that bad that this is
how it works like that we don't

9528
02:49:33,530 --> 02:49:33,540
how it works like that we don't
 

9529
02:49:33,540 --> 02:49:35,570
how it works like that we don't
understand it

9530
02:49:35,570 --> 02:49:35,580
understand it
 

9531
02:49:35,580 --> 02:49:37,910
understand it
um yeah the that's it's often from the

9532
02:49:37,910 --> 02:49:37,920
um yeah the that's it's often from the
 

9533
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:39,469
um yeah the that's it's often from the
tech sector the discussions about

9534
02:49:39,469 --> 02:49:39,479
tech sector the discussions about
 

9535
02:49:39,479 --> 02:49:41,870
tech sector the discussions about
immortality and so on yeah I think

9536
02:49:41,870 --> 02:49:41,880
immortality and so on yeah I think
 

9537
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:44,210
immortality and so on yeah I think
that's somehow trying to escape the the

9538
02:49:44,210 --> 02:49:44,220
that's somehow trying to escape the the
 

9539
02:49:44,220 --> 02:49:47,030
that's somehow trying to escape the the
beauty of this Earth for sure that that

9540
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,040
beauty of this Earth for sure that that
 

9541
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:48,349
beauty of this Earth for sure that that
there's something you've right to look

9542
02:49:48,349 --> 02:49:48,359
there's something you've right to look
 

9543
02:49:48,359 --> 02:49:52,309
there's something you've right to look
at like yeah and I I I perhaps like you

9544
02:49:52,309 --> 02:49:52,319
at like yeah and I I I perhaps like you
 

9545
02:49:52,319 --> 02:49:53,929
at like yeah and I I I perhaps like you
I'm worried about

9546
02:49:53,929 --> 02:49:53,939
I'm worried about
 

9547
02:49:53,939 --> 02:49:56,570
I'm worried about
the uh unintended negative consequences

9548
02:49:56,570 --> 02:49:56,580
the uh unintended negative consequences
 

9549
02:49:56,580 --> 02:49:58,730
the uh unintended negative consequences
of trying to escape the way things are

9550
02:49:58,730 --> 02:49:58,740
of trying to escape the way things are
 

9551
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:00,349
of trying to escape the way things are
on this Earth because this is an

9552
02:50:00,349 --> 02:50:00,359
on this Earth because this is an
 

9553
02:50:00,359 --> 02:50:02,929
on this Earth because this is an
incredible mechanism how many times in

9554
02:50:02,929 --> 02:50:02,939
incredible mechanism how many times in
 

9555
02:50:02,939 --> 02:50:04,550
incredible mechanism how many times in
the past has new technology come out

9556
02:50:04,550 --> 02:50:04,560
the past has new technology come out
 

9557
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:06,469
the past has new technology come out
that people have hailed as you know

9558
02:50:06,469 --> 02:50:06,479
that people have hailed as you know
 

9559
02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:08,090
that people have hailed as you know
blasphemy or it's not going to work or

9560
02:50:08,090 --> 02:50:08,100
blasphemy or it's not going to work or
 

9561
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:10,429
blasphemy or it's not going to work or
it's it goes against nature and and now

9562
02:50:10,429 --> 02:50:10,439
it's it goes against nature and and now
 

9563
02:50:10,439 --> 02:50:13,130
it's it goes against nature and and now
well heart transplants are pretty cool

it probably but it's like I don't know
how to handle like I don't know how to

9656
02:52:01,250 --> 02:52:01,260
how to handle like I don't know how to
 

9657

handle either nobody knows anything
 

9659
02:52:02,939 --> 02:52:07,429
handle either nobody knows anything
about it because the it's really

9660
02:52:07,429 --> 02:52:07,439
about it because the it's really
 

9661
02:52:07,439 --> 02:52:09,889
about it because the it's really
everything is terrifying here because it

everything is terrifying here because it
 

9663
02:52:09,899 --> 02:52:13,190
everything is terrifying here because it
could be as simple as Consciousness is

9664
02:52:13,190 --> 02:52:13,200
could be as simple as Consciousness is
 

9665
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:14,690

as many wild heartbeats as I can because

9862
02:56:12,110 --> 02:56:12,120
as many wild heartbeats as I can because
 

9863
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:14,170
as many wild heartbeats as I can because
they're under constant fire and so

9864

they're under constant fire and so
 

9865

don't think probably you can better than
 

9889
02:56:39,420 --> 02:56:42,349
don't think probably you can better than
I can no I I think one of the criticism

9890
02:56:42,349 --> 02:56:42,359
I can no I I think one of the criticism
 

9891
02:56:42,359 --> 02:56:44,809
I can no I I think one of the criticism
I'd love to get your opinion on is uh

9892
02:56:44,809 --> 02:56:44,819
I'd love to get your opinion on is uh
 

9893
02:56:44,819 --> 02:56:46,910
I'd love to get your opinion on is uh
one of the criticisms that somebody like

9894
02:56:46,910 --> 02:56:46,920
one of the criticisms that somebody like
 

9895
02:56:46,920 --> 02:56:49,429
one of the criticisms that somebody like
Jordan Peterson provides yeah is that

9896
02:56:49,429 --> 02:56:49,439
Jordan Peterson provides yeah is that
 

9897
02:56:49,439 --> 02:56:50,870
Jordan Peterson provides yeah is that
the climate

9898
02:56:50,870 --> 02:56:50,880
the climate
 

9899
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:53,750
the climate
is such a complex system there's so many

9900
02:56:53,750 --> 02:56:53,760
is such a complex system there's so many
 

9901
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:56,510
is such a complex system there's so many
variables that

9902
02:56:56,510 --> 02:56:56,520
variables that
 

9903
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:58,610
variables that
making conclusive statements about

9904
02:56:58,610 --> 02:56:58,620
making conclusive statements about
 

9905
02:56:58,620 --> 02:56:59,929
making conclusive statements about
what's going to happen with the

9906
02:56:59,929 --> 02:56:59,939
what's going to happen with the
 

9907
02:56:59,939 --> 02:57:02,870
what's going to happen with the
quote-unquote climate in the next 10 20

9908
02:57:02,870 --> 02:57:02,880
quote-unquote climate in the next 10 20
 

9909
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:07,070
quote-unquote climate in the next 10 20
50 years yeah is nearly impossible

9910
02:57:07,070 --> 02:57:07,080
50 years yeah is nearly impossible
 

9911
02:57:07,080 --> 02:57:08,650
50 years yeah is nearly impossible
task

9912
02:57:08,650 --> 02:57:08,660
task
 

9913
02:57:08,660 --> 02:57:11,870
task
therefore as he would say

9914
02:57:11,870 --> 02:57:11,880
therefore as he would say
 

9915
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:14,590
therefore as he would say
as people like Bjorn Lombard would say

9916
02:57:14,590 --> 02:57:14,600
as people like Bjorn Lombard would say
 

9917
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:17,809
as people like Bjorn Lombard would say
the kind of fear-mongering that is done

9918
02:57:17,809 --> 02:57:17,819
the kind of fear-mongering that is done
 

9919
02:57:17,819 --> 02:57:19,790
the kind of fear-mongering that is done
saying we should spend

9920
02:57:19,790 --> 02:57:19,800
saying we should spend
 

9921
02:57:19,800 --> 02:57:22,309
saying we should spend
humongous amounts of money to change the

9922
02:57:22,309 --> 02:57:22,319
humongous amounts of money to change the
 

9923
02:57:22,319 --> 02:57:23,929
humongous amounts of money to change the
trajectory of everything we're doing in

9924
02:57:23,929 --> 02:57:23,939
trajectory of everything we're doing in
 

9925
02:57:23,939 --> 02:57:26,090
trajectory of everything we're doing in
terms of energy

9926
02:57:26,090 --> 02:57:26,100
terms of energy
 

9927
02:57:26,100 --> 02:57:26,750
terms of energy
um

9928
02:57:26,750 --> 02:57:26,760
um
 

9929
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:29,210
um
in terms of infrastructure and so on in

9930
02:57:29,210 --> 02:57:29,220
in terms of infrastructure and so on in
 

9931
02:57:29,220 --> 02:57:31,130
in terms of infrastructure and so on in
terms of how we allocate money is not

9932
02:57:31,130 --> 02:57:31,140
terms of how we allocate money is not
 

9933
02:57:31,140 --> 02:57:33,469
terms of how we allocate money is not
justified because predicting is very

9934
02:57:33,469 --> 02:57:33,479
justified because predicting is very
 

9935
02:57:33,479 --> 02:57:35,450
justified because predicting is very
difficult and instead it's better

9936
02:57:35,450 --> 02:57:35,460
difficult and instead it's better
 

9937
02:57:35,460 --> 02:57:37,730
difficult and instead it's better
exactly what you're saying which is

9938
02:57:37,730 --> 02:57:37,740
exactly what you're saying which is
 

9939
02:57:37,740 --> 02:57:41,389
exactly what you're saying which is
focusing on local problem local saying

02:57:41,389 --> 02:57:41,399
focusing on local problem local saying
 

9941
02:57:41,399 --> 02:57:44,750
focusing on local problem local saying
uh we need to protect the Amazon

9942
02:57:44,750 --> 02:57:44,760
uh we need to protect the Amazon
 

9943
02:57:44,760 --> 02:57:46,190
uh we need to protect the Amazon
what are the what are the things

9944
02:57:46,190 --> 02:57:46,200
what are the what are the things
 

9945
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:48,889
what are the what are the things
attacking the Amazon this year in the

9946
02:57:48,889 --> 02:57:48,899
attacking the Amazon this year in the
 

9947
02:57:48,899 --> 02:57:50,929
attacking the Amazon this year in the
next five years how can we stop the

9948
02:57:50,929 --> 02:57:50,939
next five years how can we stop the
 

9949
02:57:50,939 --> 02:57:53,389
next five years how can we stop the
deforestation how can we stop different

9950
02:57:53,389 --> 02:57:53,399
deforestation how can we stop different
 

9951
02:57:53,399 --> 02:57:55,910
deforestation how can we stop different
things and then and then and humans are

9952
02:57:55,910 --> 02:57:55,920
things and then and then and humans are
 

9953
02:57:55,920 --> 02:57:57,830
things and then and then and humans are
exceptionally good and

9954
02:57:57,830 --> 02:57:57,840
exceptionally good and
 

9955
02:57:57,840 --> 02:58:00,050
exceptionally good and
um at coming up with solutions for that

9956
02:58:00,050 --> 02:58:00,060
um at coming up with solutions for that
 

9957
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:01,550
um at coming up with solutions for that
especially when you put money behind it

9958
02:58:01,550 --> 02:58:01,560
especially when you put money behind it
 

9959
02:58:01,560 --> 02:58:03,830
especially when you put money behind it
you put attention to it and that's the

9960
02:58:03,830 --> 02:58:03,840
you put attention to it and that's the
 

9961
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:06,110
you put attention to it and that's the
way we solve all the different problems

9962
02:58:06,110 --> 02:58:06,120
way we solve all the different problems
 

9963
02:58:06,120 --> 02:58:10,070
way we solve all the different problems
that are are going to that are projected

9964
02:58:10,070 --> 02:58:10,080
that are are going to that are projected
 

9965
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:11,870
that are are going to that are projected
for the climate change in its worst case

9966
02:58:11,870 --> 02:58:11,880
for the climate change in its worst case
 

9967
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:14,389
for the climate change in its worst case
scenarios uh to be realized on this

9968
02:58:14,389 --> 02:58:14,399
scenarios uh to be realized on this
 

9969
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:16,250
scenarios uh to be realized on this
Earth so that that's kind of the the

9970
02:58:16,250 --> 02:58:16,260
Earth so that that's kind of the the
 

9971
02:58:16,260 --> 02:58:17,750
Earth so that that's kind of the the
case he would make and I should also

9972
02:58:17,750 --> 02:58:17,760
case he would make and I should also
 

9973
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:20,030
case he would make and I should also
mention that one of the reasons

9974
02:58:20,030 --> 02:58:20,040
mention that one of the reasons
 

9975
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:21,950
mention that one of the reasons

and then I looked and Jordan hasn't yet
 

9997
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:44,769
and then I looked and Jordan hasn't yet
I thought

9998
02:58:44,769 --> 02:58:44,779
I thought
 

9999
02:58:44,779 --> 02:58:47,690
I thought
my goal is for you to talk to to Rogan

10000
02:58:47,690 --> 02:58:47,700
my goal is for you to talk to to Rogan
 

10001
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:49,730
my goal is for you to talk to to Rogan
and to Jordan Peterson for for different

10002
02:58:49,730 --> 02:58:49,740
and to Jordan Peterson for for different
 

10003
02:58:49,740 --> 02:58:51,710
and to Jordan Peterson for for different
reasons but for the same reason they get

10004
02:58:51,710 --> 02:58:51,720
reasons but for the same reason they get
 

10005
02:58:51,720 --> 02:58:54,110
reasons but for the same reason they get
connected to uh the human being that

10006
02:58:54,110 --> 02:58:54,120
connected to uh the human being that
 

10007
02:58:54,120 --> 02:58:56,030
connected to uh the human being that
deeply cares about this Earth and I

10008
02:58:56,030 --> 02:58:56,040
deeply cares about this Earth and I
 

10009
02:58:56,040 --> 02:58:57,530
deeply cares about this Earth and I
think that's probably the right lens

10010
02:58:57,530 --> 02:58:57,540
think that's probably the right lens
 

10011
02:58:57,540 --> 02:59:00,769
think that's probably the right lens
through which to look at the effects of

10012
02:59:00,769 --> 02:59:00,779
through which to look at the effects of
 

10013
02:59:00,779 --> 02:59:02,030
through which to look at the effects of
climate change

10014
02:59:02,030 --> 02:59:02,040
climate change
 

10015
02:59:02,040 --> 02:59:04,130
climate change
in terms of focusing on the different

10016
02:59:04,130 --> 02:59:04,140
in terms of focusing on the different
 

10017
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:05,990
in terms of focusing on the different
things that are threatening threatening

10018
02:59:05,990 --> 02:59:06,000
things that are threatening threatening
 

10019
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:07,969
things that are threatening threatening
the diversity of species

10020
02:59:07,969 --> 02:59:07,979
the diversity of species
 

10021
02:59:07,979 --> 02:59:10,130
the diversity of species
in this most magical place on Earth

10022
02:59:10,130 --> 02:59:10,140
in this most magical place on Earth
 

10023
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:13,250
in this most magical place on Earth
which is the Amazon but also as you'll

10024
02:59:13,250 --> 02:59:13,260
which is the Amazon but also as you'll
 

10025
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:15,050
which is the Amazon but also as you'll
talk about with elephants and tigers in

10026
02:59:15,050 --> 02:59:15,060
talk about with elephants and tigers in
 

10027
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:16,190
talk about with elephants and tigers in
India

10028
02:59:16,190 --> 02:59:16,200
India
 

10029
02:59:16,200 --> 02:59:17,750
India
and focusing on how to solve those

10030
02:59:17,750 --> 02:59:17,760
and focusing on how to solve those
 

10031
02:59:17,760 --> 02:59:19,370
and focusing on how to solve those
problems I don't know if there's any

10032
02:59:19,370 --> 02:59:19,380
problems I don't know if there's any
 

10033
02:59:19,380 --> 02:59:21,469
problems I don't know if there's any
comment you want to make on folks like

10034
02:59:21,469 --> 02:59:21,479
comment you want to make on folks like
 

10035
02:59:21,479 --> 02:59:24,650
comment you want to make on folks like
Jordan Peterson who are sort of raising

10036
02:59:24,650 --> 02:59:24,660
Jordan Peterson who are sort of raising
 

10037
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:26,330
Jordan Peterson who are sort of raising
questions about how much do we really

10038
02:59:26,330 --> 02:59:26,340
questions about how much do we really
 

10039
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:27,950
questions about how much do we really
understand about the climate

10040
02:59:27,950 --> 02:59:27,960
understand about the climate
 

10041
02:59:27,960 --> 02:59:30,170
understand about the climate
yeah first of all I'm such a Jordan

10042
02:59:30,170 --> 02:59:30,180
yeah first of all I'm such a Jordan
 

10043
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:31,849
yeah first of all I'm such a Jordan
Peterson fan and I think the guy is

10044
02:59:31,849 --> 02:59:31,859
Peterson fan and I think the guy is
 

10045
02:59:31,859 --> 02:59:34,490

practice practice with being effective
 

10203
03:02:29,340 --> 03:02:33,050
practice practice with being effective
at one thing at a time and so for me

10204
03:02:33,050 --> 03:02:33,060
at one thing at a time and so for me
 

10205
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:35,150
at one thing at a time and so for me
like I said from those early days of

10206
03:02:35,150 --> 03:02:35,160
like I said from those early days of
 

10207
03:02:35,160 --> 03:02:36,710
like I said from those early days of
sitting there with JJ on the side of a

10208
03:02:36,710 --> 03:02:36,720
sitting there with JJ on the side of a
 

10209
03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:38,630
sitting there with JJ on the side of a
river and going someone has to protect

10210
03:02:38,630 --> 03:02:38,640
river and going someone has to protect
 

10211
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:40,550
river and going someone has to protect
this

10212
03:02:40,550 --> 03:02:40,560
this
 

10213
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:43,790
this
um my concern is that we've lost 70

10214
03:02:43,790 --> 03:02:43,800
um my concern is that we've lost 70
 

10215
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:45,530
um my concern is that we've lost 70
percent of the wildlife on this planet

10216
03:02:45,530 --> 03:02:45,540
percent of the wildlife on this planet
 

10217
03:02:45,540 --> 03:02:47,690
percent of the wildlife on this planet
in the last 50 years that's a huge

10218
03:02:47,690 --> 03:02:47,700
in the last 50 years that's a huge
 

10219
03:02:47,700 --> 03:02:50,389
in the last 50 years that's a huge
problem Wildlife maintain the ecosystems

10220
03:02:50,389 --> 03:02:50,399
problem Wildlife maintain the ecosystems
 

10221
03:02:50,399 --> 03:02:52,730
problem Wildlife maintain the ecosystems
and so I have a very clear-cut very

10222
03:02:52,730 --> 03:02:52,740
and so I have a very clear-cut very
 

10223
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:55,130
and so I have a very clear-cut very
definable very measurable and provable

10224
03:02:55,130 --> 03:02:55,140
definable very measurable and provable
 

10225
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:56,929
definable very measurable and provable
thing that I'm fighting against and it's

10226
03:02:56,929 --> 03:02:56,939
thing that I'm fighting against and it's
 

10227
03:02:56,939 --> 03:02:59,750
thing that I'm fighting against and it's
a very to me it's a very like small ask

10228
03:02:59,750 --> 03:02:59,760
a very to me it's a very like small ask
 

10229
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:01,969
a very to me it's a very like small ask
don't cut down the three percent of the

10230
03:03:01,969 --> 03:03:01,979
don't cut down the three percent of the
 

10231
03:03:01,979 --> 03:03:04,250
don't cut down the three percent of the
world that has 50 of the biodiversity in

10232
03:03:04,250 --> 03:03:04,260
world that has 50 of the biodiversity in
 

10233
03:03:04,260 --> 03:03:06,830
world that has 50 of the biodiversity in
it maybe let's keep some wild tigers for

10234
03:03:06,830 --> 03:03:06,840
it maybe let's keep some wild tigers for
 

10235
03:03:06,840 --> 03:03:08,389
it maybe let's keep some wild tigers for
future generations and because tigers

10236
03:03:08,389 --> 03:03:08,399
future generations and because tigers
 

10237
03:03:08,399 --> 03:03:10,490
future generations and because tigers
have their own inherent right to exist

10238
03:03:10,490 --> 03:03:10,500
have their own inherent right to exist
 

10239
03:03:10,500 --> 03:03:12,950
have their own inherent right to exist
here that's my thing in terms of when we

10240
03:03:12,950 --> 03:03:12,960
here that's my thing in terms of when we
 

10241
03:03:12,960 --> 03:03:15,530
here that's my thing in terms of when we
get to you know I get attacked for you

10242
03:03:15,530 --> 03:03:15,540
get to you know I get attacked for you
 

10243
03:03:15,540 --> 03:03:16,130
get to you know I get attacked for you
know

10244
03:03:16,130 --> 03:03:16,140

okay
you show you you have me roll into a

10250
03:03:22,610 --> 03:03:22,620
you show you you have me roll into a
 

10251
03:03:22,620 --> 03:03:24,530
you show you you have me roll into a
village in the Amazon when they offer me

10252
03:03:24,530 --> 03:03:24,540
village in the Amazon when they offer me
 

10253
03:03:24,540 --> 03:03:26,030
village in the Amazon when they offer me
spider monkey and you tell me that I

10254
03:03:26,030 --> 03:03:26,040
spider monkey and you tell me that I
 

10255
03:03:26,040 --> 03:03:27,590
spider monkey and you tell me that I
should be a vegan and you you see how

10256
03:03:27,590 --> 03:03:27,600
should be a vegan and you you see how
 

10257
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:28,849
should be a vegan and you you see how
much they respect you and you tell them

10258
03:03:28,849 --> 03:03:28,859
much they respect you and you tell them
 

10259
03:03:28,859 --> 03:03:30,170
much they respect you and you tell them
that you're a vegan

10260
03:03:30,170 --> 03:03:30,180
that you're a vegan
 

10261
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:32,150
that you're a vegan
like

10262
03:03:32,150 --> 03:03:32,160
like
 

10263
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:34,010
like
um but no so for someone like Peterson I

10264
03:03:34,010 --> 03:03:34,020
um but no so for someone like Peterson I
 

10265
03:03:34,020 --> 03:03:35,990
um but no so for someone like Peterson I
think it's actually good that he's first

10266
03:03:35,990 --> 03:03:36,000
think it's actually good that he's first
 

10267
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:37,130
think it's actually good that he's first
of all telling everyone to make their

10268
03:03:37,130 --> 03:03:37,140
of all telling everyone to make their
 

10269
03:03:37,140 --> 03:03:40,610
of all telling everyone to make their
damn beds and uh and and exploring it

10270
03:03:40,610 --> 03:03:40,620
damn beds and uh and and exploring it
 

10271
03:03:40,620 --> 03:03:42,170
damn beds and uh and and exploring it
through a different lens you know he's

10272
03:03:42,170 --> 03:03:42,180
through a different lens you know he's
 

10273
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:43,849
through a different lens you know he's
he's coming at it from a totally

10274
03:03:43,849 --> 03:03:43,859
he's coming at it from a totally
 

10275
03:03:43,859 --> 03:03:46,130
he's coming at it from a totally
different thing and saying you know are

10276
03:03:46,130 --> 03:03:46,140
different thing and saying you know are
 

10277
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:49,370
different thing and saying you know are
we just being alarmist here are we what

10278
03:03:49,370 --> 03:03:49,380
we just being alarmist here are we what
 

10279
03:03:49,380 --> 03:03:51,710
we just being alarmist here are we what
I mean again imagine if you know that

10280
03:03:51,710 --> 03:03:51,720
I mean again imagine if you know that
 

10281
03:03:51,720 --> 03:03:53,210
I mean again imagine if you know that
imagine if they're

10282
03:03:53,210 --> 03:03:53,220
imagine if they're
 

10283
03:03:53,220 --> 03:03:54,769
imagine if they're
there isn't a problem and they're then

10284
03:03:54,769 --> 03:03:54,779
there isn't a problem and they're then
 

10285
03:03:54,779 --> 03:03:56,269
there isn't a problem and they're then
they're making one out of it and all the

10286
03:03:56,269 --> 03:03:56,279
they're making one out of it and all the
 

10287
03:03:56,279 --> 03:03:57,710
they're making one out of it and all the
implications that that could have for

10288
03:03:57,710 --> 03:03:57,720
implications that that could have for
 

10289
03:03:57,720 --> 03:03:59,750
implications that that could have for
Progress it's like so I think what he's

10290
03:03:59,750 --> 03:03:59,760
Progress it's like so I think what he's
 

10291
03:03:59,760 --> 03:04:02,030
Progress it's like so I think what he's
doing is is perfectly reasonable

10292
03:04:02,030 --> 03:04:02,040
doing is is perfectly reasonable
 

10293
03:04:02,040 --> 03:04:03,590
doing is is perfectly reasonable
um there is a podcast though where he's

10294
03:04:03,590 --> 03:04:03,600
um there is a podcast though where he's
 

10295
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:05,030
um there is a podcast though where he's
he's

10296
03:04:05,030 --> 03:04:05,040
he's
 

10297
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:06,710
he's
it was a great one though where he's

10298
03:04:06,710 --> 03:04:06,720
it was a great one though where he's
 

10299
03:04:06,720 --> 03:04:09,710
it was a great one though where he's
he's discussing animal intelligence and

10300
03:04:09,710 --> 03:04:09,720
he's discussing animal intelligence and
 

10301
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:11,990
he's discussing animal intelligence and
and I could really see that that you

10302
03:04:11,990 --> 03:04:12,000
and I could really see that that you
 

10303
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,750
and I could really see that that you
know the human psyche and Theology and

10304
03:04:14,750 --> 03:04:14,760
know the human psyche and Theology and
 

10305
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:17,210
know the human psyche and Theology and
and religion is so much his world that

10306
03:04:17,210 --> 03:04:17,220
and religion is so much his world that
 

10307
03:04:17,220 --> 03:04:19,670
and religion is so much his world that
that the the really the the idea of

10308
03:04:19,670 --> 03:04:19,680
that the the really the the idea of
 

10309
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:22,010
that the the really the the idea of
animals being intelligent was novel and

10310
03:04:22,010 --> 03:04:22,020
animals being intelligent was novel and
 

10311
03:04:22,020 --> 03:04:24,050
animals being intelligent was novel and
it was and it was fascinating yeah

10312
03:04:24,050 --> 03:04:24,060
it was and it was fascinating yeah
 

10313
03:04:24,060 --> 03:04:26,570
it was and it was fascinating yeah
that's why I would love the two years to

10314
03:04:26,570 --> 03:04:26,580
that's why I would love the two years to
 

10315
03:04:26,580 --> 03:04:29,330
that's why I would love the two years to
talk just I don't know and hopefully I'm

10316
03:04:29,330 --> 03:04:29,340
talk just I don't know and hopefully I'm
 

10317
03:04:29,340 --> 03:04:31,969
talk just I don't know and hopefully I'm
not out of line here but he is so

10318
03:04:31,969 --> 03:04:31,979
not out of line here but he is so
 

10319
03:04:31,979 --> 03:04:35,389
not out of line here but he is so
focused on the human mind

10320
03:04:35,389 --> 03:04:35,399

 

10321
03:04:35,399 --> 03:04:38,690

that I think he forgets

10322
03:04:38,690 --> 03:04:38,700
that I think he forgets
 

10323
03:04:38,700 --> 03:04:41,389
that I think he forgets
that there's other

10324
03:04:41,389 --> 03:04:41,399
that there's other
 

10325
03:04:41,399 --> 03:04:44,469
that there's other
life out there there's this whole

10326
03:04:44,469 --> 03:04:44,479
life out there there's this whole
 

10327
03:04:44,479 --> 03:04:47,630
life out there there's this whole
machine of intelligence of a kind of

10328
03:04:47,630 --> 03:04:47,640
machine of intelligence of a kind of
 

10329
03:04:47,640 --> 03:04:49,510
machine of intelligence of a kind of
intelligence out there

10330
03:04:49,510 --> 03:04:49,520
intelligence out there
 

10331
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:53,630
intelligence out there
this entire trillions of species tiny

10332
03:04:53,630 --> 03:04:53,640
this entire trillions of species tiny
 

10333
03:04:53,640 --> 03:04:57,349
this entire trillions of species tiny
and big just calling just moving and

10334
03:04:57,349 --> 03:04:57,359
and big just calling just moving and
 

10335
03:04:57,359 --> 03:04:59,330
and big just calling just moving and
everywhere everywhere and we're actually

10336
03:04:59,330 --> 03:04:59,340
everywhere everywhere and we're actually
 

10337
03:04:59,340 --> 03:05:02,150

part of it so like to look at a human

10338
03:05:02,150 --> 03:05:02,160
part of it so like to look at a human
 

10339
03:05:02,160 --> 03:05:04,849
part of it so like to look at a human
psychologist distinct from that is

10340
03:05:04,849 --> 03:05:04,859
psychologist distinct from that is
 

10341
03:05:04,859 --> 03:05:06,650
psychologist distinct from that is
missing at least some of the picture

10342
03:05:06,650 --> 03:05:06,660
missing at least some of the picture
 

10343
03:05:06,660 --> 03:05:08,750
missing at least some of the picture
some of the picture I do believe though

10344
03:05:08,750 --> 03:05:08,760
some of the picture I do believe though
 

10345
03:05:08,760 --> 03:05:11,090
some of the picture I do believe though
I would agree with him on that humans

10346
03:05:11,090 --> 03:05:11,100
I would agree with him on that humans
 

10347
03:05:11,100 --> 03:05:13,610
I would agree with him on that humans
are unique human psychology is unique we

10348
03:05:13,610 --> 03:05:13,620
are unique human psychology is unique we
 

10349
03:05:13,620 --> 03:05:16,849
are unique human psychology is unique we
just are but but I also you know it's

10350
03:05:16,849 --> 03:05:16,859
just are but but I also you know it's
 

10351
03:05:16,859 --> 03:05:19,550
just are but but I also you know it's
he's in such an interesting

10352
03:05:19,550 --> 03:05:19,560
he's in such an interesting
 

10353
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:22,370
he's in such an interesting
place because usually you have

10354
03:05:22,370 --> 03:05:22,380
place because usually you have
 

10355
03:05:22,380 --> 03:05:24,230
place because usually you have
you know environmentalists who are like

10356
03:05:24,230 --> 03:05:24,240
you know environmentalists who are like
 

10357
03:05:24,240 --> 03:05:25,790
you know environmentalists who are like
you know nature nature nature and then

10358
03:05:25,790 --> 03:05:25,800
you know nature nature nature and then
 

10359
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:27,710
you know nature nature nature and then
you and that's very anti-human

10360
03:05:27,710 --> 03:05:27,720
you and that's very anti-human
 

10361
03:05:27,720 --> 03:05:29,210
you and that's very anti-human
and then you have the other side and

10362
03:05:29,210 --> 03:05:29,220
and then you have the other side and
 

10363
03:05:29,220 --> 03:05:31,730
and then you have the other side and
it's like he's he's he's on this path

10364

it's like he's he's he's on this path
 

10365
03:05:31,740 --> 03:05:34,610
it's like he's he's he's on this path
where he's he's starting to explore what

10366
03:05:34,610 --> 03:05:34,620
where he's he's starting to explore what
 

10367
03:05:34,620 --> 03:05:36,710
where he's he's starting to explore what
those like diverse intelligences mean

10368
03:05:36,710 --> 03:05:36,720
those like diverse intelligences mean
 

10369
03:05:36,720 --> 03:05:38,809
those like diverse intelligences mean
and that that to me is really amazing

10370
03:05:38,809 --> 03:05:38,819
and that that to me is really amazing
 

10371
03:05:38,819 --> 03:05:40,190
and that that to me is really amazing
because I love hearing what he'll do

10372
03:05:40,190 --> 03:05:40,200
because I love hearing what he'll do
 

10373
03:05:40,200 --> 03:05:42,349
because I love hearing what he'll do
with that and I think also on top of

10374
03:05:42,349 --> 03:05:42,359
with that and I think also on top of
 

10375
03:05:42,359 --> 03:05:43,130
with that and I think also on top of
that

10376
03:05:43,130 --> 03:05:43,140
that
 

10377
03:05:43,140 --> 03:05:45,710
that
I think if you're aware of nature

10378
03:05:45,710 --> 03:05:45,720
I think if you're aware of nature
 

10379
03:05:45,720 --> 03:05:47,809
I think if you're aware of nature
deeply aware of nature it gives you

10380
03:05:47,809 --> 03:05:47,819
deeply aware of nature it gives you
 

10381
03:05:47,819 --> 03:05:49,550
deeply aware of nature it gives you
another perspective on their

another perspective on their
 

10383
03:05:49,560 --> 03:05:51,650
another perspective on their
evolutionary history of humans

evolutionary history of humans
 

10385
03:05:51,660 --> 03:05:53,929
evolutionary history of humans
it's one thing to be an evolutionary

10386
03:05:53,929 --> 03:05:53,939
it's one thing to be an evolutionary
 

10387
03:05:53,939 --> 03:05:56,150
it's one thing to be an evolutionary
biologist and kind of study it from a

10388
03:05:56,150 --> 03:05:56,160
biologist and kind of study it from a
 

10389
03:05:56,160 --> 03:05:58,429
biologist and kind of study it from a
like philosophical perspective and it's

10390
03:05:58,429 --> 03:05:58,439
like philosophical perspective and it's
 

10391
03:05:58,439 --> 03:06:00,230
like philosophical perspective and it's
the other to really I think experience

10392
03:06:00,230 --> 03:06:00,240
the other to really I think experience
 

10393
03:06:00,240 --> 03:06:02,690
the other to really I think experience
it and deeply know it to see I don't

know
 

10397
03:06:03,859 --> 03:06:06,830
know
the fact that we came from fish should

10398
03:06:06,830 --> 03:06:06,840
the fact that we came from fish should
 

10399
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:09,050
the fact that we came from fish should
really be cognizant of that that's

10400
03:06:09,050 --> 03:06:09,060
really be cognizant of that that's
 

10401
03:06:09,060 --> 03:06:11,150

I don't know uh to realize that we're
 

10405
03:06:13,380 --> 03:06:16,210
I don't know uh to realize that we're
part of a Computing machine that created

10406
03:06:16,210 --> 03:06:16,220
part of a Computing machine that created
 

10407

part of a Computing machine that created
intelligence report well part of the

10408
03:06:18,769 --> 03:06:18,779
intelligence report well part of the
 

10409
03:06:18,779 --> 03:06:22,250
intelligence report well part of the
thing that started bacteria and is now

10410
03:06:22,250 --> 03:06:22,260
thing that started bacteria and is now
 

10411
03:06:22,260 --> 03:06:24,050
thing that started bacteria and is now
creating AI

10412
03:06:24,050 --> 03:06:24,060
creating AI
 

10413
03:06:24,060 --> 03:06:27,050
creating AI
and yeah and uh

10414
03:06:27,050 --> 03:06:27,060
and yeah and uh
 

10415
03:06:27,060 --> 03:06:29,090

great view I was thinking well what's
 

10423
03:06:33,120 --> 03:06:34,849
great view I was thinking well what's
interesting about Boston but I feel like

10424
03:06:34,849 --> 03:06:34,859
interesting about Boston but I feel like
 

10425
03:06:34,859 --> 03:06:36,530
interesting about Boston but I feel like
we keep we keep scratching up against

10426
03:06:36,530 --> 03:06:36,540
we keep we keep scratching up against
 

10427
03:06:36,540 --> 03:06:38,030
we keep we keep scratching up against
this thing in this conversation that

10428
03:06:38,030 --> 03:06:38,040
this thing in this conversation that
 

10429
03:06:38,040 --> 03:06:40,849
this thing in this conversation that
that that it's so easy 50 I think

10430
03:06:40,849 --> 03:06:40,859
that that it's so easy 50 I think
 

10431
03:06:40,859 --> 03:06:42,590
that that it's so easy 50 I think
something like 50 or more percent of the

10432
03:06:42,590 --> 03:06:42,600
something like 50 or more percent of the
 

10433
03:06:42,600 --> 03:06:44,870
something like 50 or more percent of the
humans on this planet live in cities

10434
03:06:44,870 --> 03:06:44,880
humans on this planet live in cities
 

10435
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:48,650
humans on this planet live in cities
and I think it's so easy for people to

10436
03:06:48,650 --> 03:06:48,660
and I think it's so easy for people to
 

10437
03:06:48,660 --> 03:06:51,650
and I think it's so easy for people to
forget that we share this planet with so

10438
03:06:51,650 --> 03:06:51,660
forget that we share this planet with so
 

10439
03:06:51,660 --> 03:06:54,769
forget that we share this planet with so
many other things and and

10440
03:06:54,769 --> 03:06:54,779
many other things and and
 

10441
03:06:54,779 --> 03:06:57,290
many other things and and
and I think that that sort of that we're

10442
03:06:57,290 --> 03:06:57,300
and I think that that sort of that we're
 

10443
03:06:57,300 --> 03:06:59,269
and I think that that sort of that we're
we're in a little in a way we're almost

10444
03:06:59,269 --> 03:06:59,279
we're in a little in a way we're almost
 

10445
03:06:59,279 --> 03:07:01,190
we're in a little in a way we're almost
like ecological orphans and that we've

10446
03:07:01,190 --> 03:07:01,200
like ecological orphans and that we've
 

10447
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:04,670
like ecological orphans and that we've
left the the things that actually make

10448
03:07:04,670 --> 03:07:04,680
left the the things that actually make
 

10449
03:07:04,680 --> 03:07:07,250
left the the things that actually make
us feel at home and that's a bit of a

10450
03:07:07,250 --> 03:07:07,260
us feel at home and that's a bit of a
 

10451
03:07:07,260 --> 03:07:08,210
us feel at home and that's a bit of a
stretch because I don't know if

10452
03:07:08,210 --> 03:07:08,220
stretch because I don't know if
 

10453
03:07:08,220 --> 03:07:11,570
stretch because I don't know if
everybody feels that way but for me I

10454
03:07:11,570 --> 03:07:11,580
everybody feels that way but for me I
 

10455
03:07:11,580 --> 03:07:12,889
everybody feels that way but for me I
mean professionally as an expedition

10456
03:07:12,889 --> 03:07:12,899
mean professionally as an expedition
 

10457
03:07:12,899 --> 03:07:14,929
mean professionally as an expedition
guide when I take people into nature I

10458
03:07:14,929 --> 03:07:14,939
guide when I take people into nature I
 

10459
03:07:14,939 --> 03:07:16,610
guide when I take people into nature I
see what happens to them

10460
03:07:16,610 --> 03:07:16,620
see what happens to them
 

10461
03:07:16,620 --> 03:07:18,710
see what happens to them
and they leave going I mean it doesn't

10462
03:07:18,710 --> 03:07:18,720
and they leave going I mean it doesn't
 

10463
03:07:18,720 --> 03:07:20,450

life if they don't if they don't live in
 

10485
03:07:39,359 --> 03:07:40,790
life if they don't if they don't live in
that you know then there's those of us

10486
03:07:40,790 --> 03:07:40,800
that you know then there's those of us
 

10487
03:07:40,800 --> 03:07:42,950
that you know then there's those of us
who spend our lives doing that but for a

who spend our lives doing that but for a

who spend our lives doing that but for a
reason

10490

reason
 

10491
03:07:44,100 --> 03:07:47,269
reason
because it's the only place we feel sane

we might travel together for a time at
 

10497
03:07:51,840 --> 03:07:54,650
we might travel together for a time at
some point if uh if we do that if we

some point if uh if we do that if we
 

10499
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:56,929
some point if uh if we do that if we

equipment dry I keep the equipment dry
 

10651
03:10:45,779 --> 03:10:47,630
equipment dry I keep the equipment dry
and I actually don't a lot of people put

10652
03:10:47,630 --> 03:10:47,640
and I actually don't a lot of people put
 

10653
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:49,309
and I actually don't a lot of people put
their [\h__\h] in silica at night and like

10654
03:10:49,309 --> 03:10:49,319
their [\h__\h] in silica at night and like
 

10655
03:10:49,319 --> 03:10:51,349
their [\h__\h] in silica at night and like
keep it dry and then they take it out

10656
03:10:51,349 --> 03:10:51,359
keep it dry and then they take it out
 

10657
03:10:51,359 --> 03:10:53,450
keep it dry and then they take it out
and I find that when you do that the

10658
03:10:53,450 --> 03:10:53,460
and I find that when you do that the
 

10659
03:10:53,460 --> 03:10:55,309
and I find that when you do that the
temperature chain change creates

10660
03:10:55,309 --> 03:10:55,319
temperature chain change creates
 

10661
03:10:55,319 --> 03:10:57,230
temperature chain change creates
moisture inside the camera so what I do

10662
03:10:57,230 --> 03:10:57,240
moisture inside the camera so what I do
 

10663
03:10:57,240 --> 03:10:59,990
moisture inside the camera so what I do
is I never do that I just keep my

10664
03:10:59,990 --> 03:11:00,000
is I never do that I just keep my
 

10665
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,630
is I never do that I just keep my
cameras in my backpack with a zipper so

10666
03:11:02,630 --> 03:11:02,640
cameras in my backpack with a zipper so
 

10667
03:11:02,640 --> 03:11:04,610
cameras in my backpack with a zipper so
they're more or less exposed to the

10668
03:11:04,610 --> 03:11:04,620
they're more or less exposed to the
 

10669
03:11:04,620 --> 03:11:07,309
they're more or less exposed to the
elements yeah and so it sort of always

10670
03:11:07,309 --> 03:11:07,319
elements yeah and so it sort of always
 

10671
03:11:07,319 --> 03:11:09,530
elements yeah and so it sort of always
has a little bit of equilibrium

10672
03:11:09,530 --> 03:11:09,540
has a little bit of equilibrium
 

10673
03:11:09,540 --> 03:11:11,870
has a little bit of equilibrium
and that's it I mean I shoot on some

because there'll be like some leaching
 

10835
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:51,410
because there'll be like some leaching
there'll be some some salt deposit there

10836
03:13:51,410 --> 03:13:51,420
there'll be some some salt deposit there
 

10837
03:13:51,420 --> 03:13:52,370
there'll be some some salt deposit there
or something

10838
03:13:52,370 --> 03:13:52,380
or something
 

10839
03:13:52,380 --> 03:13:54,530
or something
and they'll all be Wings flat against

10840
03:13:54,530 --> 03:13:54,540
and they'll all be Wings flat against
 

10841
03:13:54,540 --> 03:13:55,790

the ground with their with their
proboscises on the sand and if you go

10844
03:13:58,849 --> 03:13:58,859
proboscises on the sand and if you go
 

10845
03:13:58,859 --> 03:14:03,110
proboscises on the sand and if you go
walk near them they will Vortex up and

10846
03:14:03,110 --> 03:14:03,120
walk near them they will Vortex up and
 

10847
03:14:03,120 --> 03:14:05,450
walk near them they will Vortex up and
you have a rainbow Vortex of butterflies

10848
03:14:05,450 --> 03:14:05,460
you have a rainbow Vortex of butterflies
 

10849
03:14:05,460 --> 03:14:08,750
you have a rainbow Vortex of butterflies
and you can like go run through that

10850
03:14:08,750 --> 03:14:08,760
and you can like go run through that

want to do is get the shot where I I
guess leave the phone recording in

10856
03:14:15,710 --> 03:14:15,720
guess leave the phone recording in
 

10857
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:18,830
guess leave the phone recording in
slow-mo facing up

10858
03:14:18,830 --> 03:14:18,840
slow-mo facing up
 

10859
03:14:18,840 --> 03:14:20,990
slow-mo facing up
and leave it there for an hour let the

10860
03:14:20,990 --> 03:14:21,000
and leave it there for an hour let the
 

10861
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:22,730
and leave it there for an hour let the
butterflies come in and settle and then

10862
03:14:22,730 --> 03:14:22,740
butterflies come in and settle and then
 

10863
03:14:22,740 --> 03:14:24,530
butterflies come in and settle and then
disturb them so I get the bottom of the

10864
03:14:24,530 --> 03:14:24,540
disturb them so I get the bottom of the
 

10865
03:14:24,540 --> 03:14:26,450
disturb them so I get the bottom of the
vortex of the bug I'm like these are the

10866
03:14:26,450 --> 03:14:26,460
vortex of the bug I'm like these are the
 

10867
03:14:26,460 --> 03:14:27,889
vortex of the bug I'm like these are the

but what people don't understand is that
 

11041
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:41,090
but what people don't understand is that
hunting happens all the time on the

hunting happens all the time on the
 

11043
03:17:41,100 --> 03:17:43,370
hunting happens all the time on the
reserve not for the elephants and the

11044
03:17:43,370 --> 03:17:43,380
reserve not for the elephants and the
 

11045
03:17:43,380 --> 03:17:45,950
reserve not for the elephants and the
Rhinos those are those are special and

03:17:53,870 --> 03:17:53,880
inyala a wildebeest a zebra
 

11053
03:17:53,880 --> 03:17:55,910
inyala a wildebeest a zebra
there aren't as many predators as there

11054
03:17:55,910 --> 03:17:55,920
there aren't as many predators as there
 

11055
03:17:55,920 --> 03:18:00,610
there aren't as many predators as there
used to be so if you leave those animals

11056
03:18:00,610 --> 03:18:00,620

 

11057
03:18:00,620 --> 03:18:02,809

unhunted you know without the wolf to

unhunted you know without the wolf to
 

11059
03:18:02,819 --> 03:18:05,210
unhunted you know without the wolf to
chase the herd to thin off the ones that

11060
03:18:05,210 --> 03:18:05,220
chase the herd to thin off the ones that
 

11061
03:18:05,220 --> 03:18:07,070
chase the herd to thin off the ones that
are old and dying or sick

11062
03:18:07,070 --> 03:18:07,080
are old and dying or sick
 

11063
03:18:07,080 --> 03:18:08,750
are old and dying or sick
well then you just have animals that are

11064
03:18:08,750 --> 03:18:08,760
well then you just have animals that are
 

11065
03:18:08,760 --> 03:18:10,250
well then you just have animals that are
old and dying and sick walking around

11066
03:18:10,250 --> 03:18:10,260
old and dying and sick walking around
 

11067
03:18:10,260 --> 03:18:12,950
old and dying and sick walking around
suffering and so on reserves like this

11068
03:18:12,950 --> 03:18:12,960
suffering and so on reserves like this
 

11069
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:14,030
suffering and so on reserves like this
they hunt

11070
03:18:14,030 --> 03:18:14,040
they hunt
 

11071
03:18:14,040 --> 03:18:16,190
they hunt
and they take the old ones and they use

11072
03:18:16,190 --> 03:18:16,200
and they take the old ones and they use
 

11073

the funding from hunting no one's going

11074
03:18:17,809 --> 03:18:17,819
the funding from hunting no one's going
 

11075
03:18:17,819 --> 03:18:18,950
the funding from hunting no one's going
to pay you thirty thousand dollars to

11076
03:18:18,950 --> 03:18:18,960
to pay you thirty thousand dollars to
 

11077
03:18:18,960 --> 03:18:20,450
to pay you thirty thousand dollars to
take a picture of a buffalo but they'll

11078

pay you thirty thousand dollars to hunt

11080
03:18:21,889 --> 03:18:21,899
pay you thirty thousand dollars to hunt
 

11081
03:18:21,899 --> 03:18:23,210
pay you thirty thousand dollars to hunt
a buffalo

11082
03:18:23,210 --> 03:18:23,220
a buffalo
 

11083
03:18:23,220 --> 03:18:26,269
a buffalo
and so these reserves responsibly and

11084
03:18:26,269 --> 03:18:26,279
and so these reserves responsibly and
 

11085
03:18:26,279 --> 03:18:28,969
and so these reserves responsibly and
ethically on foot

11086
03:18:28,969 --> 03:18:28,979
ethically on foot
 

11087
03:18:28,979 --> 03:18:31,370
ethically on foot
can go hunting and manage and again if

11088
03:18:31,370 --> 03:18:31,380
can go hunting and manage and again if
 

11089
03:18:31,380 --> 03:18:32,929
can go hunting and manage and again if
they if they were hunting rhinos or if

11090
03:18:32,929 --> 03:18:32,939
they if they were hunting rhinos or if
 

11091
03:18:32,939 --> 03:18:34,309
they if they were hunting rhinos or if
they're hunting elephants I'd be out in

11092
03:18:34,309 --> 03:18:34,319
they're hunting elephants I'd be out in
 

11093
03:18:34,319 --> 03:18:36,290
they're hunting elephants I'd be out in
a second the hunting non-endanger

11094
03:18:36,290 --> 03:18:36,300
a second the hunting non-endanger
 

11095
03:18:36,300 --> 03:18:37,790
a second the hunting non-endanger
species they're hunting non-endangered

11096
03:18:37,790 --> 03:18:37,800
species they're hunting non-endangered
 

11097
03:18:37,800 --> 03:18:40,190
species they're hunting non-endangered
species a hunting game species and the

11098
03:18:40,190 --> 03:18:40,200
species a hunting game species and the
 

11099
03:18:40,200 --> 03:18:42,230
species a hunting game species and the
the difference is that a poacher is

11100
03:18:42,230 --> 03:18:42,240
the difference is that a poacher is
 

11101
03:18:42,240 --> 03:18:43,790
the difference is that a poacher is
gonna and so those are responsible

11102
03:18:43,790 --> 03:18:43,800
gonna and so those are responsible
 

11103
03:18:43,800 --> 03:18:45,830
gonna and so those are responsible
Hunters that are ecologists and

11104
03:18:45,830 --> 03:18:45,840
