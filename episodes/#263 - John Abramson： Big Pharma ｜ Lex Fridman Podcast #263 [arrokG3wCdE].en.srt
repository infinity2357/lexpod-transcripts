so there's a tension

478
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
so there's a tension
 

479

so if we look
at particularly the task of helping

484
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519

you said that uh that was a radical idea

550
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
you said that uh that was a radical idea
 

551
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,350
you said that uh that was a radical idea
at the time but we're failing on all

552
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
at the time but we're failing on all
 

553
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,110
at the time but we're failing on all
three how are we failing and and uh also

554
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
three how are we failing and and uh also
 

555
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,030
three how are we failing and and uh also
maybe the bigger picture is what are the

556
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
maybe the bigger picture is what are the
 

557
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,509
maybe the bigger picture is what are the
strengths and weaknesses of capitalism

558
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
strengths and weaknesses of capitalism
 

559
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,750

can we separate those out because those
 

563
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,110
can we separate those out because those
are two huge questions

564
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
are two huge questions
 

565
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,310
are two huge questions
so

566
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
so
 

567
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,310
so
how we're failing in all three and these

568
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
how we're failing in all three and these
 

569
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,430
how we're failing in all three and these
are the

570
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
are the
 

571
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,269
are the
minimal functions

572
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279

how's this possible
so i believe

708
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
so i believe
 

709

so i believe
just in a small tangent that most people

710
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
just in a small tangent that most people
 

711
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,110
just in a small tangent that most people
are good

712
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
are good
 

713
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,430

and so
 

727
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,350
and so
and then we look at the outcomes

728
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
and then we look at the outcomes
 

729
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,509
and then we look at the outcomes
that you're describing

730
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
that you're describing
 

731
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,590
that you're describing
and uh it looks and that's why the

732
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
and uh it looks and that's why the
 

733
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,269
and uh it looks and that's why the
narrative takes hold

734
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
narrative takes hold
 

735
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,910

talked to
is

740
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
is
 

741
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,509
is
malevolent the sense is like

742
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
malevolent the sense is like
 

743

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
are we getting these outcomes yeah i
 

753
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,509
are we getting these outcomes yeah i
think it has to do

754
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
think it has to do
 

755
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,629
think it has to do
with

756
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
with
 

757
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,030

and
we need to look at sociology uh to

764
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
we need to look at sociology uh to
 

765
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,949
we need to look at sociology uh to
understand this that when the cultural

that there's a bubble that forms like

842
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
that there's a bubble that forms like
 

843
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,949
that there's a bubble that forms like
we're all in bubbles of different sizes

we're all in bubbles of different sizes
 

845
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,110

drift

848
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
drift
 

849
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,430
drift
in terms of what you see as

850
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,310
and without guard rails
it

868
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320

from within that culture and from
 

975
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,950
from within that culture and from
outside that culture

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,430
the answer is
that

1494
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
that
 

1495
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,149
that
we assume that the market has to solve

1496
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
we assume that the market has to solve
 

1497
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,830
we assume that the market has to solve
all these problems

1498
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
all these problems
 

1499
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,750
all these problems
and the market can't solve all these

1500
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
and the market can't solve all these
 

1501
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,230
and the market can't solve all these
problems there needs to be

1502
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
problems there needs to be
 

1503
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,310
problems there needs to be
some way of protecting the public

1504
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
some way of protecting the public

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
medical establishment yeah like
 

1601
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,310
medical establishment yeah like
something that the doctors really pay

1602
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
something that the doctors really pay
 

1603
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,990
something that the doctors really pay
attention to well there's there's an

attention to well there's there's an
 

1605
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,230
attention to well there's there's an
entire mechanism established for testing

1606
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
entire mechanism established for testing
 

1607
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,190
entire mechanism established for testing
drugs

1608
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
drugs
 

1609
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,470
drugs
there's not an

1610
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
there's not an
 

1611
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,389
there's not an
entire mechanism established for in

00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
entire mechanism established for in
 

1613
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,630

terms of scientific rigor of testing

1614
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,640
terms of scientific rigor of testing
 

1615
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,710
terms of scientific rigor of testing
lifestyle changes i mean it's it's it's

1616
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
lifestyle changes i mean it's it's it's
 

1617
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,310
lifestyle changes i mean it's it's it's
more difficult

1618
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,320
more difficult
 

1619
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,909
more difficult
i mean everything is difficult in

1620
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:21,919
i mean everything is difficult in
 

1621
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,950
i mean everything is difficult in
science

1622
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
science
 

1623
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,590
science
with that science that involves humans

1624
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
with that science that involves humans
 

1625
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,470
with that science that involves humans
especially uh but it's just it's these

1626
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,480
especially uh but it's just it's these
 

1627
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,470
especially uh but it's just it's these
studies are very expensive

1628
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
studies are very expensive
 

1629
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,710
studies are very expensive
they're difficult it's difficult to find

1630
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
they're difficult it's difficult to find
 

1631
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,230
they're difficult it's difficult to find
conclusions and to control all the

1632
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
conclusions and to control all the
 

1633
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,470
conclusions and to control all the
variables and so it's very easy to

1634
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
variables and so it's very easy to
 

1635
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,029
variables and so it's very easy to
dismiss them unless you really do a huge

1636
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
dismiss them unless you really do a huge
 

1637
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,110
dismiss them unless you really do a huge
study that's very well funded and so

1638
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
study that's very well funded and so
 

1639
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,269
study that's very well funded and so
maybe the doctors just lean towards the

1640
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
maybe the doctors just lean towards the
 

1641
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,029
maybe the doctors just lean towards the
simpler studies

1642
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,039
simpler studies
 

1643
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,549
simpler studies
over and over which is what the drug

1644
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
over and over which is what the drug
 

1645
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,990
over and over which is what the drug
companies fund

1646
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
companies fund
 

1647
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,269
companies fund
they can control more variables

1648
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:51,279
they can control more variables
 

1649
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,950
they can control more variables
see but the control there is sometimes

1650
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960

 

1651
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,509

by hiding things too

1652
00:30:59,509 --> 00:30:59,519
by hiding things too
 

1653
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,870
by hiding things too
right

1654
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:00,880
right
 

1655
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,110
right
so sometimes you can just

1656
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,120
so sometimes you can just
 

1657
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,310
so sometimes you can just

the peer reviewers don't have the data

they can't do it
 

2089
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,870
they can't do it
and then we have the clinical practice

00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
and then we have the clinical practice
 

2091
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,710

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,390
study may seem like nothing
except they completely changed the

2308
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:56,400
except they completely changed the
 

2309
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,630
except they completely changed the
statistics so that had the three heart

2310
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:58,640
statistics so that had the three heart
 

2311
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,550
statistics so that had the three heart
attacks been included the only

2312
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
attacks been included the only
 

2313
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,550
attacks been included the only
conclusion that merck could have made

2314
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:02,560
conclusion that merck could have made
 

2315
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,550
conclusion that merck could have made
was that vioxx significantly increased

2316
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,560
was that vioxx significantly increased
 

2317
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,309
was that vioxx significantly increased
the risk of heart attack

2318
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:06,319
the risk of heart attack
 

2319
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,589
the risk of heart attack
and they abbreviated their endpoint

2320
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:09,599
and they abbreviated their endpoint
 

2321
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,829
and they abbreviated their endpoint
from heart attacks strokes and blood

2322
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:11,839
from heart attacks strokes and blood
 

2323
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,630
from heart attacks strokes and blood
clots to just heart attacks yeah

2324
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:14,640
clots to just heart attacks yeah
 

2325
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,190
clots to just heart attacks yeah
so those are maybe in their mind they're

2326
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,200
so those are maybe in their mind they're
 

2327
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,630
so those are maybe in their mind they're
also playing by the rules because of

2328
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:18,640
also playing by the rules because of
 

2329
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,230
also playing by the rules because of
some technical excuse that you mentioned

2330
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,240
some technical excuse that you mentioned
 

2331
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,230
some technical excuse that you mentioned
that was rejected

2332
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,240
that was rejected
 

2333
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,069
that was rejected
how can this no because this is not let

how can this no because this is not let
 

2335
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,710
how can this no because this is not let
me interrupt no that's not true

2336
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,720
me interrupt no that's not true
 

2337

um
the study was completed the blind was

the study was completed the blind was
 

2341
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,390
the study was completed the blind was
broken meaning they looked at the data

2342
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
broken meaning they looked at the data

cardiovascular events are there
 

2365
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,670
cardiovascular events are there
but

2366
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680

 

2367
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,510

removing malevolence from the table

2432
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:28,319
removing malevolence from the table
 

2433
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,069
removing malevolence from the table
where it's just a pure psychopathic

2434
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:30,079
where it's just a pure psychopathic
 

2435
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,190
where it's just a pure psychopathic
person

2436
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
person
 

2437
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,589
person
that there's just no momentum

2438
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:33,599
that there's just no momentum
 

2439
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,510
that there's just no momentum
created by the game like you mentioned

2440
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:35,520
created by the game like you mentioned
 

2441
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,550
created by the game like you mentioned
yes

2442
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
yes
 

2443
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,829
yes
and so

2444
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:37,839
and so
 

2445
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,950
and so
it takes reversing the momentum

2446
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
it takes reversing the momentum
 

2447
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,550
it takes reversing the momentum
within the company

2448
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:42,560
within the company
 

2449
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,150
within the company
i think requires

2450
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,160
i think requires
 

2451
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,150
i think requires
many small acts of heroism not gigantic

2452
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,160
many small acts of heroism not gigantic
 

2453
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,750
many small acts of heroism not gigantic

it
 

2459
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,670
it
but small

2460
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
but small
 

2461
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,950

00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
asking is this the right thing to do
 

2471
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,109
asking is this the right thing to do
i mean that's how that's what integrity

2472
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:07,119
i mean that's how that's what integrity
 

2473
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,630
i mean that's how that's what integrity
is

2474
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,640
is
 

2475
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,109
is
acknowledging the pressures you're under

2476
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:11,119
acknowledging the pressures you're under
 

2477
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,190
acknowledging the pressures you're under
and then still be able to zoom out and

2478
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,200
and then still be able to zoom out and
 

2479
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,550
and then still be able to zoom out and
think what is the right thing to do here

2480
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,560
think what is the right thing to do here
 

2481
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,750
think what is the right thing to do here
but the data hiding the data

2482
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:19,760
but the data hiding the data
 

2483
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,550
but the data hiding the data
makes it too easy to live in ignorance

2484
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
makes it too easy to live in ignorance
 

2485
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,550
makes it too easy to live in ignorance
so like within those inside those

2486
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:24,560
so like within those inside those
 

2487
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,430
so like within those inside those
companies

2488
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440

 

2489
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,750

so your idea

2490
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:31,760
so your idea
 

2491
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,630
so your idea
is that the reviewer should see the data

2492
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:34,640
is that the reviewer should see the data
 

2493
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,430
is that the reviewer should see the data
that's that's one step so to even push

2494
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440
that's that's one step so to even push
 

2495
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,030
that's that's one step so to even push
back on that idea

2496
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
back on that idea
 

2497
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,790
back on that idea
is

2498
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
is
 

2499
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,710
is
i assume you mean that data remains

2500
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:42,720
i assume you mean that data remains
 

2501
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,990
i assume you mean that data remains
private except to the peer reviews

2502
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,000
private except to the peer reviews
 

2503
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,630
private except to the peer reviews
reviewers the problem of course is as

2504
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,640
reviewers the problem of course is as
 

2505
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,309
reviewers the problem of course is as
you probably know is the peer review

2506
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
you probably know is the peer review
 

2507
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,950
you probably know is the peer review
process is not perfect

2508
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:52,960
process is not perfect
 

2509
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,349
process is not perfect
you know it's individuals

2510
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
you know it's individuals
 

2511
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,589
you know it's individuals
it feels like there should be a lot more

2512
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599
it feels like there should be a lot more
 

2513
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,510
it feels like there should be a lot more
eyes on the data than just the peer

2514
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,520
eyes on the data than just the peer
 

2515
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,270
eyes on the data than just the peer
reviewers yes

2516
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
reviewers yes
 

2517
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,589
reviewers yes
this is not a hard problem to solve when

2518
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:03,599
this is not a hard problem to solve when
 

2519
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,150
this is not a hard problem to solve when
a study is completed

2520
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,160
a study is completed
 

2521
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,150
a study is completed
um a clinical study report is made

2522
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,160
um a clinical study report is made
 

2523
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,230
um a clinical study report is made
and it's usually several thousand pages

2524
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:12,240
and it's usually several thousand pages
 

2525
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,309
and it's usually several thousand pages
and what it does is it takes the raw

2526
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
and what it does is it takes the raw
 

2527
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,829
and what it does is it takes the raw
patient data

2528
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:15,839
patient data
 

2529
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,670
patient data
and it tabulates it

2530
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
and it tabulates it
 

2531
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,349
and it tabulates it
in the ways

2532
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:19,359
in the ways
 

2533
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,990
in the ways
uh it's supposedly and usually

2534
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,000
uh it's supposedly and usually
 

2535
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,670
uh it's supposedly and usually
in the ways that the company has

2536
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
in the ways that the company has
 

2537
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,510
in the ways that the company has
pre-specified

so that you then end up with a
 

2541
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,990
so that you then end up with a
searchable let's say 3 000 page document

00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
it's just a beautiful piece of work okay
 

2633
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,549
it's just a beautiful piece of work okay
those are easy

2634
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:14,559
those are easy
 

2635
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,150
those are easy
and then there is like the very

2636
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,160
and then there is like the very
 

2637
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,630
and then there is like the very
difficult gray area which may require

2638
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:18,640
difficult gray area which may require
 

2639
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,950
difficult gray area which may require
many many days of work on your part as a

2640
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:20,960
many many days of work on your part as a
 

2641
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,190
many many days of work on your part as a
peer reviewer so it's not you know it's

2642
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200
peer reviewer so it's not you know it's
 

2643
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,670
peer reviewer so it's not you know it's
not just a couple hours but really

2644
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
not just a couple hours but really
 

2645
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,230
not just a couple hours but really
seriously reading like some papers can

2646
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,240
seriously reading like some papers can
 

2647
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,630
seriously reading like some papers can
take months to really understand

2648
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640
take months to really understand
 

2649
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,589
take months to really understand
so if you really want to struggle um

2650
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:33,599
so if you really want to struggle um
 

2651
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,270
so if you really want to struggle um
there has to be an incentive for that

2652
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
there has to be an incentive for that
 

2653
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,349
there has to be an incentive for that
struggle yes and

pre-publication transparencies
 

2759
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,470
pre-publication transparencies
and that is critically important once a

2760
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:30,480
and that is critically important once a
 

2761
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,790
and that is critically important once a
paper is published the horses are out of

the barn and docs are going to read it
 

2765
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,870
the barn and docs are going to read it
take it as evidence-based medicine the

2766
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:36,880
take it as evidence-based medicine the
 

2767
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,309

what then happens as stickiness that the
 

2771
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,230
what then happens as stickiness that the
docs hold on to their beliefs and i my

that data the reason why that doesn't

3282
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:17,680
that data the reason why that doesn't

that data the reason why that doesn't
tip me over into the anti-vaxxer side is

3284
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:20,319
tip me over into the anti-vaxxer side is
 

3285
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,630
tip me over into the anti-vaxxer side is
because that's clinical trial data early

3286
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:22,640
because that's clinical trial data early

because that's clinical trial data early
clinical trial data that involved

clinical trial data that involved
 

3289
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,549
clinical trial data that involved
several thousand people we now have

so far knock on wood there aren't um

so far knock on wood there aren't um
side effects that overcome the benefits

but there's a lot of people that are
 

3313
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,190
but there's a lot of people that are
kind of saying well even the data on the

3314
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:57,200
kind of saying well even the data on the
 

3315
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,789
kind of saying well even the data on the
real the real world use large-scale data

well one thing is clear to me

3326
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
well one thing is clear to me
 

3327
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,990
well one thing is clear to me
that it is being politicized it's i mean

3328
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,000
that it is being politicized it's i mean
 

3329

that it is being politicized it's i mean
if you just look objectively

if you just look objectively
 

3331
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:17,910
if you just look objectively
don't

3332
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
don't
 

3333
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,470
don't
have to go to at the shallow surface

3334
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,480
have to go to at the shallow surface

have to go to at the shallow surface
level

3336

level
 

3337
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,190

it seems like there's two groups

3338
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:25,200
it seems like there's two groups
 

3339
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,630
it seems like there's two groups
that

3340
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,640
that
 

3341
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,589
that
i can't even put a term to it uh because

3342
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:29,599
i can't even put a term to it uh because
 

3343
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,270
i can't even put a term to it uh because
it's not really pro-vaccine versus

01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:31,280
it's not really pro-vaccine versus
 

3345
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,870
it's not really pro-vaccine versus
anti-vaccine because

3346
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,880
anti-vaccine because
 

3347
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,789
anti-vaccine because
it's it's it's pro

3348

but not really but kind of so those two
 

3363
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,190

groups that feel political and nature
 

3365
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,910
groups that feel political and nature
not scientific in nature it's they're

3366
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:55,920
not scientific in nature it's they're
 

3367
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,829
not scientific in nature it's they're
bickering and then

3368
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:57,839
bickering and then
 

3369
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,309
bickering and then
it's clear that this data is being

3370
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:00,319
it's clear that this data is being
 

3371
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,309
it's clear that this data is being

it's very difficult for me as a human
 

3377
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,430
it's very difficult for me as a human

understand where the truth lies
 

3383
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,789
understand where the truth lies
especially given how much money is

3384
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:12,799
especially given how much money is
 

3385
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,589
especially given how much money is
flying around on all sides so the

3386
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:15,599
flying around on all sides so the
 

3387
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,430
flying around on all sides so the
anti-vaxxers

3388
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:17,440
anti-vaxxers
 

3389
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,510
anti-vaxxers
can make a lot of money too let's not

3390
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:19,520
can make a lot of money too let's not
 

3391
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,750

perspective you can become famous being
 

3395
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,230
perspective you can become famous being
an anti-vaxxer and so there's a lot of

3396

they look at some slice of the data and
 

3419
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,950
they look at some slice of the data and
begin to interpret it in some kind of

begin to interpret it in some kind of
 

3421

dominating the discourse here especially
in the scientific community so i i don't

uh
 

3465
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,910
uh
it's very difficult to

01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:41,920
it's very difficult to
 

3467
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,589
it's very difficult to
know what to do with that

3468
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:43,599
know what to do with that
 

3469
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,510
know what to do with that
and let's just put this in perspective

about 20 billion dollars uh globally
over the past few years it it leveled

over the past few years it it leveled
 

3485
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,190
over the past few years it it leveled
out it peaked at that level

3486
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,200
out it peaked at that level
 

3487
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,390
out it peaked at that level
pfizer

what was done well

3508
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:41,839
what was done well
 

3509
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:44,549
what was done well
and what was done badly that you can

3510
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:44,559
and what was done badly that you can
 

3511
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:45,750
and what was done badly that you can
see now

3512
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:45,760
see now
 

3513
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,750
see now
it seems like we'll know

3514
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:47,760
it seems like we'll know
 

3515
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,349
it seems like we'll know
more decades from now yes

3516
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359
more decades from now yes
 

3517
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,950
more decades from now yes
but now in the fog of today

3518
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:54,960
but now in the fog of today
 

3519
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,829
but now in the fog of today
with the 65 billion dollars

3520
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
with the 65 billion dollars
 

3521
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,390
with the 65 billion dollars
flying around

3522
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,400
flying around
 

3523
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,029
flying around
where where do you land

3524
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:03,039
where where do you land
 

3525
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,029
where where do you land
so

3526
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
so
 

3527
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,470
so
we're going to get to

3528
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:06,480
we're going to get to
 

3529
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,390
we're going to get to
what i think is one of the key problems

3530
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
what i think is one of the key problems
 

3531
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,870
what i think is one of the key problems
with the pharmaceutical industry model

3532
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:10,880
with the pharmaceutical industry model
 

3533
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,390
with the pharmaceutical industry model
in the united states about being profit

3534
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:14,400
in the united states about being profit
 

3535
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,470
in the united states about being profit
driven

3536
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:16,480
driven
 

3537
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,430
driven
so

3538
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,440
so
 

3539
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,710
so
in 2016 the nih did the key

3540
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:20,720
in 2016 the nih did the key
 

3541
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,390
in 2016 the nih did the key
infrastructure work

3542
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:22,400
infrastructure work
 

3543
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,390
infrastructure work
to make mrna uh vaccines

3544
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
to make mrna uh vaccines
 

3545
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,549
to make mrna uh vaccines
uh that gets left out of the discussion

3546
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:28,559
uh that gets left out of the discussion
 

3547
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,750
uh that gets left out of the discussion
a lot and pfizer biontech actually paid

3548
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:31,760
a lot and pfizer biontech actually paid
 

3549
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,829
a lot and pfizer biontech actually paid
royalties

3550
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:33,839
royalties
 

3551
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,309
royalties
voluntarily to the nih i don't know how

3552
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:36,319
voluntarily to the nih i don't know how
 

3553
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:37,670
voluntarily to the nih i don't know how
much it was i don't think it was a whole

3554
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:37,680
much it was i don't think it was a whole
 

3555
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,589
much it was i don't think it was a whole
lot of money but i think they wanted to

3556
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
lot of money but i think they wanted to
 

3557
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,910
lot of money but i think they wanted to
avoid the litigation that moderna got

3558
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:41,920
avoid the litigation that moderna got
 

3559
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,910
avoid the litigation that moderna got
itself into by just taking that 2016

3560
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:45,920
itself into by just taking that 2016
 

3561
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,150
itself into by just taking that 2016
knowledge and having that be the

3562
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:48,160
knowledge and having that be the
 

3563
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,069
knowledge and having that be the
foundation of their product

3564
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:50,079
foundation of their product
 

3565
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,990
foundation of their product
so pfizer took that

3566
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:52,000
so pfizer took that
 

3567
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,750
so pfizer took that
and they did

3568
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:53,760
and they did
 

3569
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,470
and they did
their r d they paid for their r d having

3570
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:56,480
their r d they paid for their r d having
 

3571
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,829
their r d they paid for their r d having
received

3572
01:06:57,829 --> 01:06:57,839
received
 

3573
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,630
received
that technology and when they got the

3574
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:00,640
that technology and when they got the
 

3575
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,789
that technology and when they got the
genetic code from

3576
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:02,799
genetic code from
 

3577
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,150
genetic code from
china

3578
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:04,160

went to the first world and very
 

3631
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,430
went to the first world and very
very few vaccinations went to the third

3757
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,390

that that kind of allocation of vaccines

that that kind of allocation of vaccines
 

3759
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,709

01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,590
don't think people who are making

4031
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,709

i think that can be harmful

4032
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:36,719
i think that can be harmful
 

4033
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,470
i think that can be harmful
constraining their speech can be harmful

4034
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,480
constraining their speech can be harmful
 

4035
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,110
constraining their speech can be harmful
as well so i don't have an answer here

4036
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:41,120
as well so i don't have an answer here
 

4037
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,550
as well so i don't have an answer here
but yeah i tend to believe that

4038
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,560
but yeah i tend to believe that
 

4039
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,830
but yeah i tend to believe that
it's more dangerous to censor anti-vaxx

4040
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
it's more dangerous to censor anti-vaxx
 

4041
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,189
it's more dangerous to censor anti-vaxx
messages

4042

the way to defeat

4044
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:51,120
the way to defeat
 

4045
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,270
the way to defeat

4047
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,550

is by being great communicators

4048
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:56,560
is by being great communicators
 

4049
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,950
is by being great communicators
being great scientific communicators so

4050
01:15:58,950 --> 01:15:58,960
being great scientific communicators so
 

4051
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,990
being great scientific communicators so
it's not that we need to censor

4052
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
it's not that we need to censor
 

4053
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,990
it's not that we need to censor
the things we don't like

4054
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:04,000
the things we don't like
 

4055
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,630
the things we don't like
we need to be better communicating

4056
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:06,640
we need to be better communicating
 

4057
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,189
we need to be better communicating
the things we do like or the things that

4058
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:09,199
the things we do like or the things that
 

4059
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,830
the things we do like or the things that
we do believe represent the

4060
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:11,840
we do believe represent the
 

4061
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,830
we do believe represent the
a deep scientific truth

4062
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:13,840
a deep scientific truth
 

4063
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,350
a deep scientific truth
because

4064
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
because
 

4065
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,189
because
um i think

4066
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:17,199
um i think
 

4067
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,669
um i think
if you censor you get worse at doing

4068
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:19,679
if you censor you get worse at doing
 

4069
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,149
if you censor you get worse at doing
science

4070
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
science
 

4071
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:27,189
science
and you give the wrong people power

4072
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:27,199

 

4073
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,149

so i i tend to believe that you should

4074
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
so i i tend to believe that you should
 

4075
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,350
so i i tend to believe that you should
give power to the individual scientists

4076
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:33,360
give power to the individual scientists
 

4077
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,830
give power to the individual scientists
and also give them the responsibility of

4078
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:35,840
and also give them the responsibility of
 

4079
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,870
and also give them the responsibility of
being better educators communicators

4080
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:38,880
being better educators communicators
 

4081
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,590
being better educators communicators
expressers of scientific ideas

4082
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:41,600
expressers of scientific ideas
 

4083
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,510
expressers of scientific ideas
put pressure on them to release data to

4084
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:43,520
put pressure on them to release data to
 

4085
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,070
put pressure on them to release data to
release that data in a way that's easily

4086
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:46,080
release that data in a way that's easily
 

4087
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,470
release that data in a way that's easily
consumable not just like very difficult

4088
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
consumable not just like very difficult
 

4089
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,229

up doing the censorship

outraged will drive the censorship
 

4191
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,750
outraged will drive the censorship
and it doesn't seem like reason drives a

and it doesn't seem like reason drives a
 

4193
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,149

almost like we were talking about uh how

medical science clinical trials the

4604
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:54,159
medical science clinical trials the
 

4605
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:55,669
medical science clinical trials the
presentation of clinical trials to

4606

presentation of clinical trials to
 

4607
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:58,950
presentation of clinical trials to
physicians could be improved and

4608
01:25:58,950 --> 01:25:58,960
physicians could be improved and
 

4609
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,350
physicians could be improved and
the first thing we came up with is to

4610
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:01,360
the first thing we came up with is to
 

4611
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,470
the first thing we came up with is to
have pre-publication transparency in the

01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:04,480
have pre-publication transparency in the
 

4613
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,709
have pre-publication transparency in the
peer review process yes so bad

4614
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:06,719
peer review process yes so bad
 

4615

4617
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,990

get out as if it's legitimate and you

4618
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000
get out as if it's legitimate and you
 

4619
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,550
get out as if it's legitimate and you
can't put it back recapture it once it

i think there's an element of that

4624
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
i think there's an element of that
 

4625
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,669
i think there's an element of that
in the

arguments that are going on about
 

4629
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,350
arguments that are going on about
vaccines and they're on both sides but i

4630
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:23,360
vaccines and they're on both sides but i
 

4631
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,830
vaccines and they're on both sides but i
think the anti-fax side puts out more

4632
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
think the anti-fax side puts out more

and

4640
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:34,560
and
 

4641
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,550
and
i guess in an ideal situation there

4642
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:36,560
i guess in an ideal situation there
 

4643
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,669
i guess in an ideal situation there
would be real time fact checking by

01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,229
would be real time fact checking by

independent people not to censor it but
 

4647
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,830
independent people not to censor it but
to just say

4648
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:43,840
to just say
 

4649
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,830
to just say
that study was set up to do this and

4650
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,840
that study was set up to do this and
 

4651
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,229
that study was set up to do this and
this is what the conclusions were so the

4652
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:48,239
this is what the conclusions were so the
 

4653
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:51,270
this is what the conclusions were so the
way it was stated uh is on one side of

4654
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:51,280
way it was stated uh is on one side of
 

4655
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,950
way it was stated uh is on one side of
this argument but that's what i'm

4656
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:52,960
this argument but that's what i'm
 

4657
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,270
this argument but that's what i'm
arguing yeah i agree with you what i'm

4658
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
arguing yeah i agree with you what i'm
 

4659
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,990
arguing yeah i agree with you what i'm
arguing is that this big network of

4660
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,000
arguing is that this big network of
 

4661
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,430
arguing is that this big network of
humans that we have that is the

01:26:59,430 --> 01:26:59,440
humans that we have that is the
 

4663
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,430
humans that we have that is the
collective intelligence can't do that

4664
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:01,440
collective intelligence can't do that
 

4665
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,229
collective intelligence can't do that
real time if you allow it to if you

4666
01:27:04,229 --> 01:27:04,239
real time if you allow it to if you
 

4667
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,149
real time if you allow it to if you
encourage people to do it and the

4668
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
encourage people to do it and the
 

4669
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,310
encourage people to do it and the

interact with a lot of colleagues a lot
 

4673
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,470

they roll their eyes their response is

they roll their eyes their response is
 

4677
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,390
they roll their eyes their response is
like

01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:16,400
like
 

4679
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,070
like
like they don't want to interact with

01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:18,080
like they don't want to interact with
 

4681
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,149
like they don't want to interact with
this but it

4682

this but it
 

4683
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,870
this but it
that that's just not the right response

4684
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:22,880
that that's just not the right response
 

4685
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,510
that that's just not the right response
when a huge number of people believe

uh nerds that have been working on the

4698
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
uh nerds that have been working on the
 

4699
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,830
uh nerds that have been working on the
same problem forever i mean sure you can

4700
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
same problem forever i mean sure you can
 

4701
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,229
same problem forever i mean sure you can
do that but then you're

4702
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:42,239
do that but then you're
 

4703
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,590
do that but then you're
rejecting the responsibility you have

4704
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
rejecting the responsibility you have
 

4705
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,149
rejecting the responsibility you have
explicitly or implicitly accepted when

4706

explicitly or implicitly accepted when
 

4707

explicitly or implicitly accepted when
you go into this field that you will

01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:50,239
you go into this field that you will
 

4709
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:53,030
you go into this field that you will
defend the ideas of truth and the way to

4710
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:53,040
defend the ideas of truth and the way to
 

4711
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,750
defend the ideas of truth and the way to
defend them is in the open battlefield

4712
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:55,760
defend them is in the open battlefield
 

4713
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,830
defend them is in the open battlefield
of ideas and become a better

of ideas and become a better
 

4715
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,350

and i believe that when you have a large

and i believe that when you have a large
 

4719
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,550
and i believe that when you have a large
you said you invested one or two hours

4720
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:02,560
you said you invested one or two hours
 

4721
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,030
you said you invested one or two hours
in this particular but that's little

4722
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,040
in this particular but that's little
 

4723

ants interacting
 

4725
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:09,669
ants interacting
at scale i think that uh allows us to

4726
01:28:09,669 --> 01:28:09,679
at scale i think that uh allows us to
 

4727
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,270
at scale i think that uh allows us to
progress

4728
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
progress
 

4729
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,430
progress
towards truth at least you know

4730
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:13,440
towards truth at least you know
 

4731
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,270
towards truth at least you know
at least i hope so i think you're an

maybe you record well he does record it

4798
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:29,760
maybe you record well he does record it
 

4799
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,229
maybe you record well he does record it
obviously but maybe when there's a

obviously but maybe when there's a
 

4801
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,750
obviously but maybe when there's a

made as if it's fact-based
 

4807

really interesting idea by the way this
 

4827
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,790
really interesting idea by the way this
for some reason this idea popped into my

4828
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,800
for some reason this idea popped into my
 

4829
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,030
for some reason this idea popped into my
head now is i think real time is very

4830
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:05,040
head now is i think real time is very
 

4831
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,390
head now is i think real time is very
difficult and

4832
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:06,400
difficult and
 

4833
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,550
difficult and
it's not difficult but it kind of ruins

4834
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:08,560
it's not difficult but it kind of ruins
 

4835
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,830
it's not difficult but it kind of ruins
the conversation because you want the

4836
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840
the conversation because you want the
 

4837
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,669
the conversation because you want the
idea to breathe yeah

4838
01:30:11,669 --> 01:30:11,679
idea to breathe yeah
 

4839
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:13,189
idea to breathe yeah
i think what's

4840
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:13,199
i think what's
 

4841
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,110
i think what's
very possible is before it's published

4842

very possible is before it's published

very possible is before it's published
it's the pre-publication

4844
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:16,960
it's the pre-publication
 

4845
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,270
it's the pre-publication
before it's published you let a bunch of

01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,830
on some point in terms of anti-vaxx i've
been fascinated by listening to

4906
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:19,840
been fascinated by listening to
 

4907
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,310
been fascinated by listening to
arguments from uh this community of

4908
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:22,320
arguments from uh this community of
 

4909
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,149
arguments from uh this community of
folks that's been quite large called

4910
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:24,159
folks that's been quite large called
 

4911
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,070
folks that's been quite large called
flat earthers the people that believe

4912
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:26,080
flat earthers the people that believe
 

4913
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,990
flat earthers the people that believe
the earth is flat

4914
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,000
the earth is flat
 

4915
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,390
the earth is flat
and i don't know if you've ever listened

4916
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,400
and i don't know if you've ever listened
 

4917
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,149
and i don't know if you've ever listened
to them or read

4918
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:32,159
to them or read
 

4919
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,669
to them or read
their arguments

4920
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:33,679
their arguments
 

4921
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,310
their arguments
but it's fascinating how consistent and

4922
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:36,320
but it's fascinating how consistent and
 

4923
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,149
but it's fascinating how consistent and
convincing it all sounds when you just

4924
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:38,159
convincing it all sounds when you just
 

4925
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,870
convincing it all sounds when you just
kind of take it in just like

4926
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:40,880
kind of take it in just like
 

4927
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,709
kind of take it in just like
just to take it in like listening

4928
01:31:42,709 --> 01:31:42,719
just to take it in like listening
 

4929
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,390
just to take it in like listening
normally it's all very logical

4930
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:46,400
normally it's all very logical
 

4931
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,229
normally it's all very logical
like if you don't think

4932
01:31:48,229 --> 01:31:48,239
like if you don't think
 

4933
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,030
like if you don't think
very

4934
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,040
very
 

4935
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,629
very
well no i

4936
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
well no i
 

4937
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:53,350
well no i
um so the thing is

4938
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:53,360
um so the thing is
 

4939
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,430
um so the thing is
the reality is

4940
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:55,440
the reality is
 

4941
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,510
the reality is
at the very basic human level with our

4942
01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:57,520
at the very basic human level with our

the earth is pretty flat when you go

4948
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:03,120
the earth is pretty flat when you go
 

4949
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,110
the earth is pretty flat when you go
outside and you look it's flat so like

4950
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,120
outside and you look it's flat so like
 

4951
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,990
outside and you look it's flat so like
when you use common sense reasoning

4952
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:08,000
when you use common sense reasoning
 

4953
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,990
when you use common sense reasoning
it's very easy to play to that to

4954
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,000
it's very easy to play to that to
 

4955
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,149
it's very easy to play to that to
convince you that the earth is flat plus

4956
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:12,159
convince you that the earth is flat plus
 

4957
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:13,830
convince you that the earth is flat plus
there's powerful organizations that want

there's powerful organizations that want
 

4959
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,270
there's powerful organizations that want
to manipulate you and so on

4960
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:17,280
to manipulate you and so on
 

4961
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,590
to manipulate you and so on
but then there's you know the whole

4962
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:19,600
but then there's you know the whole
 

4963
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,750
but then there's you know the whole
progress of science and physics of the

4964
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,760
progress of science and physics of the
 

4965
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,430
progress of science and physics of the
past but

4966
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:23,440
past but
 

4967
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,350
past but
that's difficult to integrate into your

4968
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:25,360
that's difficult to integrate into your
 

4969
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,430
that's difficult to integrate into your
thought process so it's it's very true

4970
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:27,440
thought process so it's it's very true
 

4971
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,870
thought process so it's it's very true
that the

4972
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:28,880
that the
 

4973
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,709
that the
people should listen to flat earthers

4974
01:32:30,709 --> 01:32:30,719
people should listen to flat earthers
 

4975
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:31,669
people should listen to flat earthers
because

4976
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:31,679
because
 

4977
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,390
because
it was very revealing to me how easily

4978
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:34,400
it was very revealing to me how easily
 

4979
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,790
it was very revealing to me how easily
it is how easy it is to be convinced of

4980
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:36,800
it is how easy it is to be convinced of
 

4981
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,270
it is how easy it is to be convinced of
basically anything

it's the question of revolving doors
 

5043
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,350
it's the question of revolving doors
that there seems to be a revolving door

5044

that there seems to be a revolving door
 

5045

5053
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,229

what do you think about that so first of

5054
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:02,239
what do you think about that so first of
 

5055
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,310
what do you think about that so first of
all his response once again is there's

5056
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:04,320
all his response once again is there's
 

5057
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,629
all his response once again is there's
rules there's very strict rules and we

5058
01:34:06,629 --> 01:34:06,639
rules there's very strict rules and we
 

5059
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:08,629
rules there's very strict rules and we
follow them

5060
01:34:08,629 --> 01:34:08,639
follow them
 

5061
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,870
follow them
do you think that's a problem

5062
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880

 

5063
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,629

and also maybe this is a good time to

and also maybe this is a good time to
 

5065
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,149
and also maybe this is a good time to
talk about

5066
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:16,159
talk about
 

5067
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,950
talk about
this pfizer played by the rules

5068
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:18,960
this pfizer played by the rules
 

5069
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,189
this pfizer played by the rules
let's one at a time one time okay and

5070
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:21,199
let's one at a time one time okay and
 

5071
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:23,270
let's one at a time one time okay and
this isn't even about pfizer but it's an

5072
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:23,280
this isn't even about pfizer but it's an
 

5073
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,669
this isn't even about pfizer but it's an
answer to the question yes so there's

5074
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
answer to the question yes so there's
 

5075
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,229
answer to the question yes so there's
this drug agia helm that was approved by

5076
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:28,239
this drug agia helm that was approved by
 

5077
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:31,590
this drug agia helm that was approved by
the fda uh maybe six months ago it's a

5078
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:31,600
the fda uh maybe six months ago it's a
 

5079
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,629
the fda uh maybe six months ago it's a
drug

5080
01:34:32,629 --> 01:34:32,639
drug
 

5081
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,870
drug
to prevent the progression

5082
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:34,880
to prevent the progression
 

5083
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,310
to prevent the progression
of low-grade alzheimer's disease

5084
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,320

01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,590
the target for
drug development for alzheimer's disease

5088
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:43,600
drug development for alzheimer's disease
 

5089
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,910
drug development for alzheimer's disease
has been the amyloid reducing the

5090
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:45,920
has been the amyloid reducing the
 

5091
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,149
has been the amyloid reducing the
amyloid plaques in the brain which

5092
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:48,159
amyloid plaques in the brain which
 

5093
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:50,310
amyloid plaques in the brain which
correlate with the progression

5094
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:50,320

in the brain
 

5107
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,109
in the brain
they did two clinical trials to

5108
01:35:03,109 --> 01:35:03,119
they did two clinical trials to
 

5109
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:05,510
they did two clinical trials to
determine the clinical efficacy

5110
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
determine the clinical efficacy
 

5111
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,830
determine the clinical efficacy
and they found that neither trial

5112
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:07,840
and they found that neither trial
 

5113
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,910

showed a meaningful benefit
 

5115
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,149
showed a meaningful benefit
and in those two trials

01:35:12,149 --> 01:35:12,159
and in those two trials
 

5117
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:15,189

the approvability of agile helm given
 

5137
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,030
the approvability of agile helm given
those facts

those facts
 

5139
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,030
those facts
and those facts aren't in dispute

and those facts aren't in dispute
 

5141
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,750
and those facts aren't in dispute
they're in biogen slides uh as well as

5142
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:39,760
they're in biogen slides uh as well as
 

5143

the advisory committee

5146
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
the advisory committee
 

5147
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,790
the advisory committee
voted

unanimous vote against approving agile
 

5159
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,229
unanimous vote against approving agile
now the advisory committees have been

5160
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:58,239
now the advisory committees have been
 

5161
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:59,189
now the advisory committees have been
pretty

interrupting the amyloid plaques doesn't
mean that you're

mean that you're
that your alzheimer's

so it seems like
 

5223
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,390
so it seems like
it's a slam dunk and the fda made a

it's a slam dunk and the fda made a
 

5225
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,109
it's a slam dunk and the fda made a
mistake and they should do whatever they

01:37:09,109 --> 01:37:09,119
mistake and they should do whatever they
 

5227
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,790
mistake and they should do whatever they
do to protect their bureaucratic

so the head of the bureau of the fda the

as my knowledge of pharma
 

5521
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,430
as my knowledge of pharma
that said in broad brush strokes

01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:47,440
that said in broad brush strokes
 

5523
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:51,189
that said in broad brush strokes
the nih is doing the infrastructure work

5524
01:42:51,189 --> 01:42:51,199
the nih is doing the infrastructure work
 

5525
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,310
the nih is doing the infrastructure work
for

5526
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:52,320
for
 

5527
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,149
for
all drug development i think they've

5528
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:54,159
all drug development i think they've
 

5529
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,149
all drug development i think they've
participated in a hundred percent of the

5530
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
participated in a hundred percent of the
 

5531
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:57,590
participated in a hundred percent of the
drugs that have been approved by the

5532
01:42:57,590 --> 01:42:57,600
drugs that have been approved by the
 

5533
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,990
drugs that have been approved by the
united the fda over the past 10 years or

5534
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:00,000
united the fda over the past 10 years or
 

5535
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,350
united the fda over the past 10 years or
so

5536
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:01,360
so
 

5537
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,109
so
they've done infrastructure work and

5538
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
they've done infrastructure work and
 

5539
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:04,149
they've done infrastructure work and
what they do

5540
01:43:04,149 --> 01:43:04,159
what they do
 

5541
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,750
what they do
is not

5542
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:05,760
is not
 

5543
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,990
is not
work on particular drugs

5544
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:08,000
work on particular drugs
 

5545
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,590
work on particular drugs
but they develop

5546
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:09,600
but they develop
 

5547
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,310
but they develop
work on drug targets

and might be beneficial

5556
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
and might be beneficial
 

5557
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,430
and might be beneficial

and then the drug companies can when
 

5561
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,510
and then the drug companies can when
they find a target that is

01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:25,520
they find a target that is
 

5563
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,709
they find a target that is
mutable

um and potentially beneficial then the

01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:29,600
um and potentially beneficial then the
 

5567
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,149
um and potentially beneficial then the
drug companies can take the research and

5568
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:32,159
drug companies can take the research and
 

5569
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,830
drug companies can take the research and
choose to invest in the development of

how to make americans healthier

5586

how to make americans healthier
 

5587
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,990
how to make americans healthier
i think

5588
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:56,000
i think
 

5589
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,390
i think
again from the satellite view

5590
01:43:58,390 --> 01:43:58,400
again from the satellite view
 

5591
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:02,629
again from the satellite view
the nih is investing

5592
01:44:02,629 --> 01:44:02,639
the nih is investing
 

5593
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:05,350
the nih is investing
more in science that can lead to

5594
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:05,360
more in science that can lead to
 

5595
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,270
more in science that can lead to
commercial development

5596
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:07,280
commercial development
 

5597
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,870
commercial development
rather than as you said at the beginning

5598
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:08,880
rather than as you said at the beginning
 

5599
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,510
rather than as you said at the beginning
of the podcast there's no big fitness

5600
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:11,520
of the podcast there's no big fitness
 

5601
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,870
of the podcast there's no big fitness
and lifestyle industry that can counter

5602
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:14,880
and lifestyle industry that can counter
 

5603
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:15,910
and lifestyle industry that can counter

pharma
 

5605
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,629
pharma
so i think at the nih level that

5606
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:18,639
so i think at the nih level that
 

5607
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,790
so i think at the nih level that
countering can be done and the diabetes

5608
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:20,800
countering can be done and the diabetes
 

5609
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,950
countering can be done and the diabetes
prevention program study that we talked

5610
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:22,960
prevention program study that we talked
 

5611
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,350
prevention program study that we talked
about before where lifestyle was part of

5612
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:25,360
about before where lifestyle was part of
 

5613
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,109
about before where lifestyle was part of
a randomized trial and was shown to be

5614
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:27,119
a randomized trial and was shown to be
 

5615
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,870
a randomized trial and was shown to be
more effective than metformin at

5616
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:28,880
more effective than metformin at
 

5617
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,870
more effective than metformin at
preventing the development of diabetes

5618
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:30,880
preventing the development of diabetes
 

5619
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,550
preventing the development of diabetes
that is absolute proof positive that

5620
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:34,560
that is absolute proof positive that
 

5621
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,149
that is absolute proof positive that
investing in that kind of science can

5622
01:44:36,149 --> 01:44:36,159
investing in that kind of science can
 

5623
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,750
investing in that kind of science can
produce good results

5624
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:37,760
produce good results
 

5625
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,229
produce good results
so i think that

5626
01:44:40,229 --> 01:44:40,239
so i think that
 

5627
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,950
so i think that
we're aimed at drug development

5628
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:42,960
we're aimed at drug development
 

5629
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,229
we're aimed at drug development
and what we ought to be aimed at is an

01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:47,590
and what we ought to be aimed at is an

that the reason why we've gotten in this

crazy position
 

5653
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,070

is because

not just sickness yes and investing and
 

5685
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:44,390
not just sickness yes and investing and
investing in i mean

5686
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:44,400
investing in i mean
 

5687
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,270
investing in i mean
it's it's like uh

5688
01:45:47,270 --> 01:45:47,280
it's it's like uh
 

5689
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,350
it's it's like uh
it fee one fee is the other one you have

it fee one fee is the other one you have
 

5691
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,270
it fee one fee is the other one you have
to communicate to the public the

5692
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:51,280
to communicate to the public the
 

5693
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,990
to communicate to the public the
importance of of investing in health and

5694
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:54,000
importance of of investing in health and
 

5695
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,830
importance of of investing in health and
that leads to you

5696
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:55,840
that leads to you
 

5697
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,669
that leads to you
getting props for investing in health

5698
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:57,679
getting props for investing in health
 

5699
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,109
getting props for investing in health
and then you can invest in health more

5700
01:45:59,109 --> 01:45:59,119
and then you can invest in health more
 

5701
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,350
and then you can invest in health more
and more and then that communicates i

5702
01:46:01,350 --> 01:46:01,360
and more and then that communicates i
 

5703
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,189
and more and then that communicates i
mean everything that anthony fauci says

5704
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:03,199
mean everything that anthony fauci says
 

5705
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:05,750
mean everything that anthony fauci says
that francis collins says has an impact

5706
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:05,760
that francis collins says has an impact
 

5707
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,109
that francis collins says has an impact
on scientists

5708
01:46:07,109 --> 01:46:07,119
on scientists
 

5709
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:08,709
on scientists
i mean the

5710
01:46:08,709 --> 01:46:08,719
i mean the
 

5711
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:09,910
i mean the
you know it

5712
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:09,920
you know it
 

5713
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:12,550
you know it
it sets the priorities i i don't think

5714
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:12,560
it sets the priorities i i don't think
 

5715
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,590
it sets the priorities i i don't think
they

5716
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:13,600
they
 

5717
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,709
they
it's the sad thing about leaders

5718
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:16,719
it's the sad thing about leaders
 

5719
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:18,629
it's the sad thing about leaders
um

5720
01:46:18,629 --> 01:46:18,639
um
 

5721
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,149
um
forgive me for saying the word but

5885
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,550
and there's a cloud a point cloud of
different countries the

5886
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:30,560
different countries the
 

5887
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:33,270
different countries the
x-axis being healthcare spending is a

5888
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:33,280
x-axis being healthcare spending is a
 

5889
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,189
x-axis being healthcare spending is a
percentage of gdp which we just talked

5890
01:49:35,189 --> 01:49:35,199
percentage of gdp which we just talked
 

5891
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:36,310
percentage of gdp which we just talked
about

5892
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:36,320
about
 

5893
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,709
about
that uh us is you know seven percent

5894
01:49:38,709 --> 01:49:38,719
that uh us is you know seven percent
 

5895
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,950
that uh us is you know seven percent
higher than everyone the average

5896
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:40,960
higher than everyone the average
 

5897
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,390
higher than everyone the average
and then on the y-axis is uh performance

5898
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:44,400
and then on the y-axis is uh performance
 

5899
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:48,149
and then on the y-axis is uh performance
so x-axis spending y-axis performance

5900
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:48,159
so x-axis spending y-axis performance
 

5901
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:50,310
so x-axis spending y-axis performance
and there's a point cloud we'll overlay

5902
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:50,320
and there's a point cloud we'll overlay
 

5903
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,310
and there's a point cloud we'll overlay
this if you're watching on youtube

5904
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:52,320
this if you're watching on youtube
 

5905
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,830
this if you're watching on youtube
of a bunch of countries that have uh

5906
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:55,840
of a bunch of countries that have uh
 

5907
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,589
of a bunch of countries that have uh
performance

5908
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:57,599
performance
 

5909
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:58,550
performance
uh

5910
01:49:58,550 --> 01:49:58,560
uh
 

5911
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:02,629
uh
for what they're spending and then us

5912
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:02,639
for what they're spending and then us
 

5913
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:06,550
for what they're spending and then us
is is all alone on the right bottom side

5914
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:06,560
is is all alone on the right bottom side
 

5915
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,430
is is all alone on the right bottom side
of the chart where it's low performance

5916
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:09,440
of the chart where it's low performance
 

5917
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,790
of the chart where it's low performance
and high spending correct

5918
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:12,800
and high spending correct
 

5919
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,790
and high spending correct
so this is a system

5920
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:14,800
so this is a system
 

5921
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,109
so this is a system
that is abiding by

5922
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:17,119
that is abiding by
 

5923
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:19,830
that is abiding by
spending that is directed by

5924
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:19,840
spending that is directed by
 

5925
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,589
spending that is directed by
the most profitable ways to deliver

5926
01:50:21,589 --> 01:50:21,599
the most profitable ways to deliver
 

5927
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,589
the most profitable ways to deliver
health care so you put that in the hands

5928
01:50:23,589 --> 01:50:23,599
health care so you put that in the hands
 

5929
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:27,189
health care so you put that in the hands
of big pharma is you maximize for profit

5930
01:50:27,189 --> 01:50:27,199
of big pharma is you maximize for profit
 

5931
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:29,750
of big pharma is you maximize for profit
you're going to decrease performance

5932
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:29,760
you're going to decrease performance
 

5933
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,589
you're going to decrease performance
and increase spending

5934
01:50:31,589 --> 01:50:31,599
and increase spending
 

5935
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:34,709
and increase spending
yes but i want to qualify that and say

5936
01:50:34,709 --> 01:50:34,719
yes but i want to qualify that and say
 

5937
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,790
yes but i want to qualify that and say
it's not all big pharma's fault

5938
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:36,800
it's not all big pharma's fault
 

5939
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,790
it's not all big pharma's fault
uh they're not responsible for all the

01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:44,480
administrative costs for example
 

5947
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,990
administrative costs for example
but they are the largest component of

5948
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:48,000
but they are the largest component of
 

5949
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,189
but they are the largest component of
the rising our rising health care costs

5950
01:50:51,189 --> 01:50:51,199
the rising our rising health care costs
 

5951
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,109
the rising our rising health care costs
and it has to do with this knowledge

5952
01:50:53,109 --> 01:50:53,119
and it has to do with this knowledge

that's the problem

01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:42,880
that's the problem
 

6103
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,189
that's the problem
so and why do we do that well the answer

6104
01:53:45,189 --> 01:53:45,199
so and why do we do that well the answer
 

6105
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:47,589
so and why do we do that well the answer
is perfectly obvious that the way to

6106
01:53:47,589 --> 01:53:47,599
is perfectly obvious that the way to

01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:50,629
is perfectly obvious that the way to

and we don't we're kind of the wild west

6140
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:27,920
and we don't we're kind of the wild west
 

6141
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,910
and we don't we're kind of the wild west
and we let the market determine those

6142
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:29,920
and we let the market determine those
 

6143
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:33,270
and we let the market determine those
allocations and it's it's an

6144
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:33,280
allocations and it's it's an
 

6145
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,550

awful failure it's a horrendous failure
so one argument

6148
01:54:38,229 --> 01:54:38,239

have drugs that change serotonin
 

6397
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,510
have drugs that change serotonin
metabolism but we don't know if that's

6398
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:09,520
metabolism but we don't know if that's
 

6399
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,310
metabolism but we don't know if that's
why

6400
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:10,320
why
 

6401
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:11,270
why
uh

6402
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:11,280

antidepressants work on major depression
 

6405

antidepressants work on major depression
and they don't certainly don't work on

and they don't certainly don't work on

what the number needed to treat is i
 

6411
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,709
what the number needed to treat is i
think it's around four

6412
01:59:20,709 --> 01:59:20,719
think it's around four
 

6413
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:22,870
think it's around four
one out of four people have significant

6414
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:22,880
one out of four people have significant
 

6415
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,189
one out of four people have significant
improvement but the people without major

6416
01:59:25,189 --> 01:59:25,199
improvement but the people without major
 

6417
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:26,950

depression
don't get better and the vast majority

6420
01:59:29,589 --> 01:59:29,599
don't get better and the vast majority
 

6421
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:31,589
don't get better and the vast majority
of these drugs are used for people

6422
01:59:31,589 --> 01:59:31,599
of these drugs are used for people
 

6423
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,589
of these drugs are used for people
without major depression

6424

without major depression
 

6425
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:36,470
without major depression
so what's happened is that the

6426
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:36,480
so what's happened is that the
 

6427
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,589
so what's happened is that the
feelings of life satisfaction of

6428
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:39,599
feelings of life satisfaction of
 

6429
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:41,990
feelings of life satisfaction of
happiness and not sadness

6430
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:42,000
happiness and not sadness
 

6431
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,109
happiness and not sadness
have been

6432
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:43,119
have been
 

6433
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:45,750
have been
medicalized the normal range of feelings

6434
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:45,760
medicalized the normal range of feelings
 

6435
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,750
medicalized the normal range of feelings
have been medicalized

6436
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:47,760
have been medicalized
 

6437
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,109
have been medicalized
and that's not to say that they

6438
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,119
and that's not to say that they
 

6439
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:50,950
and that's not to say that they
shouldn't be attended to

6440
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:50,960
shouldn't be attended to
 

6441
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:53,830
shouldn't be attended to
but it the evidence shows that attending

6442
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:53,840
but it the evidence shows that attending
 

6443
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,229
but it the evidence shows that attending
to them by giving somebody a medicine

6444
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:56,239
to them by giving somebody a medicine
 

6445
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,229
to them by giving somebody a medicine
doesn't help except that they feel like

6446
01:59:58,229 --> 01:59:58,239
doesn't help except that they feel like
 

6447
01:59:58,239 --> 02:00:00,070
doesn't help except that they feel like
somebody cares about them and believes

6448
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:00,080
somebody cares about them and believes
 

6449
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:02,390
somebody cares about them and believes
that they're suffering but there are

6450
02:00:02,390 --> 02:00:02,400
that they're suffering but there are
 

6451
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,990
that they're suffering but there are
problems in living

6452
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:04,000
problems in living
 

6453
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,629
problems in living
that give rise to much of this

6454
02:00:06,629 --> 02:00:06,639
that give rise to much of this
 

6455
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:08,470
that give rise to much of this
symptomatology of

6456
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:08,480
symptomatology of
 

6457
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:10,629
symptomatology of
less than major depression and let's

6458
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
less than major depression and let's
 

6459
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:13,270
less than major depression and let's
call it what it is and figure out a way

6460
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
call it what it is and figure out a way
 

6461
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:14,709
call it what it is and figure out a way
to help people

6462
02:00:14,709 --> 02:00:14,719
to help people
 

6463
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:17,990
to help people
in visual therapy group therapy um

6464
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:18,000
in visual therapy group therapy um
 

6465
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,750
in visual therapy group therapy um
maybe lifestyle modification would work

6466
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:19,760
maybe lifestyle modification would work
 

6467
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:21,109
maybe lifestyle modification would work
we got to try that

6468
02:00:21,109 --> 02:00:21,119
we got to try that
 

6469
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:23,990
we got to try that
um but let's call it what it is instead

6470
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:24,000
um but let's call it what it is instead
 

6471
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:28,310
um but let's call it what it is instead
of saying oh you're uh in this vast

6472
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:28,320
of saying oh you're uh in this vast
 

6473
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,830
of saying oh you're uh in this vast
basket of people who are depressed so

6474
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:29,840
basket of people who are depressed so
 

6475
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,750
basket of people who are depressed so
we'll give you an antidepressant even

6476
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:31,760
we'll give you an antidepressant even
 

6477
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:34,070
we'll give you an antidepressant even
though the evidence shows that people

6478
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:34,080
though the evidence shows that people
 

6479
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:35,830
though the evidence shows that people
who are suffering from your level of

6480
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:35,840
who are suffering from your level of
 

6481
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,149
who are suffering from your level of
depression don't get better

6482
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:38,159
depression don't get better
 

6483
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:39,270
depression don't get better
and that's

6484
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:39,280
and that's
 

6485
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:40,390
and that's
a consequence

6486
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:40,400
a consequence
 

6487
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,430
a consequence
of not um focusing on

6488
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:43,440
of not um focusing on
 

6489
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,510
of not um focusing on
preventative medicine the lifestyle

6490
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:45,520
preventative medicine the lifestyle
 

6491
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:48,149
preventative medicine the lifestyle

6493
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:50,229
changes all that kind of stuff well yes
but it's really a consequence of the

6494
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:50,239
but it's really a consequence of the
 

6495
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:52,950
but it's really a consequence of the
drug companies creating the impression

6496
02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:52,960
drug companies creating the impression
 

6497

6551
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:56,390
be getting now let's figure out why
and whether that means some time with a

6552
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:56,400

effectively and efficiently but that's

6562
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:06,080
effectively and efficiently but that's
 

6563
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,430
effectively and efficiently but that's
what you need to do

6564
02:02:07,430 --> 02:02:07,440
what you need to do
 

6565
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:11,030
what you need to do
and it may be that there's um a marital

6566
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:11,040
and it may be that there's um a marital

02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:40,080
an infinite range of things but let's
 

6595
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,070
an infinite range of things but let's
figure out make a diagnosis first the

if that happened
but

something
with the patient in front of them

6788
02:06:18,629 --> 02:06:18,639
with the patient in front of them

6793
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:25,589
and they probably there are not many
weirdos like me who

6794
02:06:25,589 --> 02:06:25,599
weirdos like me who
 

6795
