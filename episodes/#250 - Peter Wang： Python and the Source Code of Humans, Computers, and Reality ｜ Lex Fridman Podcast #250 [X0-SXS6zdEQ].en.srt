so you're an engineer leader of

34
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
so you're an engineer leader of
 

35
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,790

started using it
 

61
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,390
started using it
was when i was a c plus computer

62
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
was when i was a c plus computer
 

63
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,870

um
 

71
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,190
um
and we kept trying to do more and more

72
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
and we kept trying to do more and more
 

73
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,109
and we kept trying to do more and more
uh like abstract and higher order

74
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
uh like abstract and higher order
 

75
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,429
uh like abstract and higher order
programming in c plus which at the time

76
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
programming in c plus which at the time
 

77
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,149
programming in c plus which at the time
was quite difficult with templates the

78
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
was quite difficult with templates the
 

79
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,469
was quite difficult with templates the
the compiler support wasn't great etc

80
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
the compiler support wasn't great etc
 

81
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,749
the compiler support wasn't great etc
so when i started playing around with

82
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
so when i started playing around with
 

83
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,590
so when i started playing around with
python that was my first time

84
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
python that was my first time
 

85
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,749
python that was my first time
encountering really first class support

86
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
encountering really first class support
 

87
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,910
encountering really first class support
for types for functions and things like

88
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
for types for functions and things like
 

89
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,990
for types for functions and things like
that and it felt so incredibly

90
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
that and it felt so incredibly
 

91
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,109
that and it felt so incredibly
expressive

92
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
expressive
 

93
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,789
expressive
so that was what kind of made me fall in

94
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
so that was what kind of made me fall in
 

95
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,710
so that was what kind of made me fall in
love with a little bit and also

96
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
love with a little bit and also
 

97
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,870
love with a little bit and also
once you spend a lot of time in a c plus

00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
once you spend a lot of time in a c plus
 

99
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,350
once you spend a lot of time in a c plus

101
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,950
dev environment the ability to just whip
something together that basically runs

102
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
something together that basically runs
 

103
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,630
something together that basically runs
and works the first time

104
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
and works the first time
 

105
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,469
and works the first time
is amazing so really productive

106
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
is amazing so really productive
 

107
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,870
is amazing so really productive

109
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,429
scripting language i mean i i knew pearl
i knew bash i was decent at both but

110
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
i knew bash i was decent at both but
 

111
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,590
i knew bash i was decent at both but
python just made everything it made the

python just made everything it made the
 

113
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,830
python just made everything it made the
whole world accessible right i could

114
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
whole world accessible right i could
 

115
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,109
whole world accessible right i could
script this and that and the other

116
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
script this and that and the other
 

117

network things
 

119
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,910
network things
you know little hard drive utilities i

120
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
you know little hard drive utilities i
 

121
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,270
you know little hard drive utilities i
could write all these things in the

122
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
could write all these things in the
 

123
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,789
could write all these things in the
space of an afternoon and that was

124
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
space of an afternoon and that was
 

125
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,990
space of an afternoon and that was
really really cool that's what made me

126
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
really really cool that's what made me
 

127

130
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
you could put your finger on
 

131
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,110
you could put your finger on
that you're not programming in perl

132
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
that you're not programming in perl
 

133
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,949
that you're not programming in perl
today like why python for scripting

134
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
today like why python for scripting
 

135
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,150
today like why python for scripting
i think

136
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
i think
 

137
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,070
i think
there's not a specific thing as much as

138
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
there's not a specific thing as much as
 

139
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,630
there's not a specific thing as much as
the design motif of both the the creator

140
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
the design motif of both the the creator
 

141
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,229
the design motif of both the the creator
of the language and the core

142
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
of the language and the core
 

143
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,589
of the language and the core
uh group of people that built the

144
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
uh group of people that built the
 

145
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,670
uh group of people that built the
standard library around him

146
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
standard library around him
 

147
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,790
standard library around him
um

148
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
um
 

149
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,470
um
there was definitely

150
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
there was definitely
 

151
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,470

155
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,910
jobs you know used that term you know in
somewhat of an arrogant way but i think

156
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
somewhat of an arrogant way but i think
 

157
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,070
somewhat of an arrogant way but i think
it's a real thing that it was designed

158
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
it's a real thing that it was designed
 

159
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,830
it's a real thing that it was designed
to fit a friend of mine actually

160

162
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
expressed this really well he said
 

163
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,790

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,790
and there's nothing better to to say
than that now now people might argue

168
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
than that now now people might argue
 

169
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,309

modern python there's a lot more

170
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
modern python there's a lot more
 

171
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,949
modern python there's a lot more
complexity but certainly as version 5

172
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
complexity but certainly as version 5

just kind of work is it uh something you
 

257

just kind of work is it uh something you
have to kind of write out on paper look

and say it's just right is it a taste
 

261
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,430
and say it's just right is it a taste
thing or is there a systematic process

what's your sense

264
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
what's your sense
 

265
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,430
what's your sense
i think it's more of a taste thing

266
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
i think it's more of a taste thing
 

267
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,590
i think it's more of a taste thing
but one one thing that should be said is

that
you have to pick your audience right so

272
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
you have to pick your audience right so
 

273
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,030
you have to pick your audience right so
the better defined the user audience is

274
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
the better defined the user audience is
 

275
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,430
the better defined the user audience is
or the users are the easier it is to

276
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
or the users are the easier it is to
 

277
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,749
or the users are the easier it is to
build something that fits in their minds

the harder that is yeah and so as python

290
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
the harder that is yeah and so as python
 

291
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,150
the harder that is yeah and so as python
has grown in popularity that's also

292
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
has grown in popularity that's also
 

293
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,150

naturally created more complexity as

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
naturally created more complexity as
 

295
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,670
naturally created more complexity as
people try to design any given thing

296
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
people try to design any given thing
 

297

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,510
that's the downside of popularity it's

something that works well for yourself

328
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
something that works well for yourself
 

329
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,510
something that works well for yourself
yeah it's very telling that when you

330
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
yeah it's very telling that when you
 

331
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,749
yeah it's very telling that when you
look at all of the impactful

332
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
look at all of the impactful
 

333
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,270
look at all of the impactful
big project well they're fundamental

334
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
big project well they're fundamental
 

335
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,430
big project well they're fundamental

but in the scientific computing areas

352
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
but in the scientific computing areas
 

353
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,150
but in the scientific computing areas
you know these are assistant professors

354
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
you know these are assistant professors
 

355
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,469
you know these are assistant professors
or electrical engineering grad students

356
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
or electrical engineering grad students
 

357
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,150
or electrical engineering grad students
they didn't have really a lot of

358
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
they didn't have really a lot of
 

359
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,590
they didn't have really a lot of
programming skills necessarily but

360
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
programming skills necessarily but
 

361
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,909
programming skills necessarily but
python was just good enough for them to

362
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
python was just good enough for them to
 

363
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,909
python was just good enough for them to
put something together that fit in their

364
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
put something together that fit in their
 

365
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,270
put something together that fit in their
domain right so it's almost like a it's

366
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
domain right so it's almost like a it's
 

367
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,830
domain right so it's almost like a it's
a necessity as a mother invention aspect

368
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
a necessity as a mother invention aspect
 

369
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,870
a necessity as a mother invention aspect
and also it was a really harsh filter

370
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
and also it was a really harsh filter
 

371
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,670
and also it was a really harsh filter
for

00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
utility and compactness and
 

375
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,909
utility and compactness and
expressiveness like it was too hard to

376
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
expressiveness like it was too hard to
 

377
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,189
expressiveness like it was too hard to
use then they wouldn't have built it

378
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
use then they wouldn't have built it
 

379
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,629
use then they wouldn't have built it
because it was just too much trouble

380
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
because it was just too much trouble
 

381
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,150
because it was just too much trouble
right it was a side project for them and

382
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
right it was a side project for them and
 

383
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,510
right it was a side project for them and
also necessity creates a kind of

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,550
in this vein
that's much more accessible to most

658
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
that's much more accessible to most
 

659
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,509
that's much more accessible to most
people

660
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
people
 

661
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,829
people
it's it's really that implicit state

662
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
it's it's really that implicit state
 

663
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,069
it's it's really that implicit state
that's so hard for people to track yeah

664
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
that's so hard for people to track yeah
 

665
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,590
that's so hard for people to track yeah
okay so that's modular stuff but there's

666
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
okay so that's modular stuff but there's
 

667
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,949
okay so that's modular stuff but there's
also an aspect where you're standing on

668
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
also an aspect where you're standing on
 

669
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,069
also an aspect where you're standing on
the shoulders of giants so you're

670
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
the shoulders of giants so you're
 

671
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,750
the shoulders of giants so you're
building like

672
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
building like
 

673
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,230
building like
higher and higher levels of abstraction

674
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
higher and higher levels of abstraction
 

675
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,150
higher and higher levels of abstraction
you do that a little bit with language

676
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
you do that a little bit with language
 

677
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,389
you do that a little bit with language
so with language you develop sort of

678
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
so with language you develop sort of
 

679
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,509
so with language you develop sort of
ideas philosophies from plato and so on

680
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
ideas philosophies from plato and so on
 

681
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,790
ideas philosophies from plato and so on
and then you kind of leverage those

682
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
and then you kind of leverage those
 

683
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,790
and then you kind of leverage those
philosophies as you try to have

684
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
philosophies as you try to have
 

685
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,949
philosophies as you try to have
deeper and deeper conversations but with

686
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
deeper and deeper conversations but with
 

687
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,190
deeper and deeper conversations but with
programming it seems like you can build

688
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
programming it seems like you can build
 

689
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,030
programming it seems like you can build
much more complicated systems like

690
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
much more complicated systems like
 

691
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,870
much more complicated systems like
without knowing how everything works you

692
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
without knowing how everything works you
 

693
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,190
without knowing how everything works you
can build on top of the work of others

694
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
can build on top of the work of others
 

695
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,949
can build on top of the work of others
and it seems like you're developing more

696
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
and it seems like you're developing more
 

697
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,790
and it seems like you're developing more
and more sophisticated

698
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
and more sophisticated
 

699
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,150
and more sophisticated
uh

700
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
uh
 

701
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,829
uh
expressions

702
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
expressions
 

703
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,069
expressions
ability to express ideas

704
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
ability to express ideas
 

705
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,470
ability to express ideas
in a computational space i think

706
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
in a computational space i think
 

707
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,590
in a computational space i think
it's worth

708
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
it's worth
 

709
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,350
it's worth
pondering the difference here between

710
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
pondering the difference here between
 

711
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,590
pondering the difference here between
complexity and

712
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
complexity and
 

713
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,430
complexity and
complication

714
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
complication
 

715
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,310
complication
uh sure okay right back to excel well

716
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
uh sure okay right back to excel well
 

717
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,150
uh sure okay right back to excel well
not quite back to excel but but the the

718
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
not quite back to excel but but the the
 

719
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,870
not quite back to excel but but the the
idea is um you know when we have a human

720
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
idea is um you know when we have a human
 

721
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,190
idea is um you know when we have a human
conversation all languages

722
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
conversation all languages
 

723
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,230
conversation all languages
uh for humans emerged to support um

724
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
uh for humans emerged to support um
 

725
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,430
uh for humans emerged to support um
human uh relational communications

726
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
human uh relational communications
 

727
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,710
human uh relational communications
which is that the person we're

728
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
which is that the person we're
 

729
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,870
which is that the person we're
communicating with is a person

730
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
communicating with is a person
 

731
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,110
communicating with is a person
and they would communicate back to us

732
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
and they would communicate back to us
 

733
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,710
and they would communicate back to us
and so

734
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
and so
 

735
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,269
and so
we sort of um hit a residence point

736
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
we sort of um hit a residence point
 

737
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,870
we sort of um hit a residence point
right when we actually agree on some

738
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
right when we actually agree on some
 

739
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,710
right when we actually agree on some
concepts so there's a messiness to it

740
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
concepts so there's a messiness to it
 

741
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,310
concepts so there's a messiness to it
and there's a fluidity to it with

742
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
and there's a fluidity to it with
 

743
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,230
and there's a fluidity to it with
computing systems when we express

744
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
computing systems when we express
 

745
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,069
computing systems when we express
something to the computer and it's wrong

746
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
something to the computer and it's wrong
 

747
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,990
something to the computer and it's wrong
we just try again so we can basically

748
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
we just try again so we can basically
 

749
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,829
we just try again so we can basically
live many virtual worlds of having

750
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
live many virtual worlds of having
 

751
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,430
live many virtual worlds of having
failed at expressing ourselves to the

752
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
failed at expressing ourselves to the
 

753
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,509
failed at expressing ourselves to the
computer until the one time we expressed

754
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
computer until the one time we expressed
 

755
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,430
computer until the one time we expressed
ourselves right then we kind of put in

756
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
ourselves right then we kind of put in
 

757
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,629
ourselves right then we kind of put in
production and then discover that it's

758
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
production and then discover that it's
 

759
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,389
production and then discover that it's
still wrong you know a few days down the

760
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
still wrong you know a few days down the
 

761
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,190
still wrong you know a few days down the
road so i think the

762
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
road so i think the
 

763
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,629
road so i think the
the sophistication of things that we

764
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
the sophistication of things that we
 

765
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,470
the sophistication of things that we
build with computing

766
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
build with computing
 

767
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,230
build with computing
one has to

768
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
one has to
 

769
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,430
one has to
really pay attention to the difference

770
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
really pay attention to the difference
 

771
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,269
really pay attention to the difference
between when an end user is expressing

772
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
between when an end user is expressing
 

773
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,829
between when an end user is expressing
something onto a system that exists

774
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
something onto a system that exists
 

775
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,389
something onto a system that exists
versus when they're extending the system

776
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
versus when they're extending the system
 

777
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,030
versus when they're extending the system
to to increase the system's capability

778
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
to to increase the system's capability
 

779
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,710
to to increase the system's capability
um for someone else to then interface

780
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
um for someone else to then interface
 

781
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,550
um for someone else to then interface
with we happen to use the same language

782
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
with we happen to use the same language
 

783
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,310
with we happen to use the same language
for both of those things and usu in most

784
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
for both of those things and usu in most
 

785
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,069
for both of those things and usu in most
cases but it doesn't have to be that and

786
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
cases but it doesn't have to be that and
 

787
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,590
cases but it doesn't have to be that and
excel is actually a great example of

788
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
excel is actually a great example of
 

789
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,389
excel is actually a great example of
this

790
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
this
 

791
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,150
this
of kind of a counterpoint to that

792
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
of kind of a counterpoint to that
 

793
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,190
of kind of a counterpoint to that
okay so what about the idea of

794
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
okay so what about the idea of
 

795
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,350
okay so what about the idea of
you said messiness

796
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
you said messiness
 

797
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,430
you said messiness
wouldn't you put

798
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
wouldn't you put
 

799
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,710
wouldn't you put
the software 2.0 idea this idea of

800
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
the software 2.0 idea this idea of
 

801
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,710
the software 2.0 idea this idea of
machine learning

802
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
machine learning
 

803
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,470
machine learning
into the

804
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
into the
 

805
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,190
into the
further and further steps into the world

806
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
further and further steps into the world
 

807
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,470
further and further steps into the world
of messiness

808
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
of messiness
 

809
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,069
of messiness
the same kind of beautiful messages of

810
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
the same kind of beautiful messages of
 

811
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,069
the same kind of beautiful messages of
human communication isn't that what

812
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
human communication isn't that what
 

813
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,190
human communication isn't that what
machine learning is is uh building

814
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
machine learning is is uh building
 

815
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,069
machine learning is is uh building
on levels of abstraction that don't have

816
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
on levels of abstraction that don't have
 

817
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,430
on levels of abstraction that don't have
messiness in them

818
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
messiness in them
 

819
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,269
messiness in them
that uh at the operating system level

820
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
that uh at the operating system level
 

821
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,790
that uh at the operating system level
then there's python the programming

822
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
then there's python the programming
 

823
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,710
then there's python the programming
languages that have more and more power

824
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
languages that have more and more power
 

825
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,470
languages that have more and more power
but then finally

826
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,480
but then finally
 

827
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,670
but then finally
there's a neural networks that

828
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
there's a neural networks that
 

829
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,470
there's a neural networks that
ultimately work with data and so the

830
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
ultimately work with data and so the
 

831
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,829
ultimately work with data and so the
programming is almost in the space of

832
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
programming is almost in the space of
 

833
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,389
programming is almost in the space of
data and the data is allowed to be messy

834
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:42,399
data and the data is allowed to be messy
 

835
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,230
data and the data is allowed to be messy
isn't that a kind of program so the idea

836
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
isn't that a kind of program so the idea
 

837
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,710
isn't that a kind of program so the idea
of software 2.0 is a lot of the

838
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
of software 2.0 is a lot of the
 

839
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,710
of software 2.0 is a lot of the
programming happens

840
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
programming happens
 

841
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,790
programming happens
in the space of data

842
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
in the space of data
 

843
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,230
in the space of data
so back to excel

845
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,150

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,870
here okay and the reason i bring this up
is because i believe there's no free

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,110
sort of write the correct code that is
at a certain level of performance so

946
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
at a certain level of performance so
 

947
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,350
at a certain level of performance so
it'll sort of select right with the

we want the performance boundary and sla
to

to
 

955
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,949
to
look like

956
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
look like

that training process itself is
 

965
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,069
that training process itself is
intrinsically sensitive to the kinds of

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,389
intrinsically sensitive to the kinds of

969
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,430

quite sensitive to the boundary

970
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
quite sensitive to the boundary

conditions we put around the performance
 

973
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,189

so i think even as we move to using

974
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
so i think even as we move to using
 

975
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,629
so i think even as we move to using

altogether now it's a full on cybernetic
 

1147
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,710
altogether now it's a full on cybernetic
system it's a next generation

1148
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
system it's a next generation
 

1149
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,390
system it's a next generation
information system that is not like

1150
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
information system that is not like
 

1151
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,310
information system that is not like
traditional software systems can you

1152
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
traditional software systems can you
 

1153
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,390
traditional software systems can you
maybe describe what is a cybernetic

1154
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
maybe describe what is a cybernetic
 

1155
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,470
maybe describe what is a cybernetic
system do you include humans in that

1156
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
system do you include humans in that
 

1157
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,710
system do you include humans in that
picture so is it as a human in the loop

1158
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
picture so is it as a human in the loop
 

1159
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,590
picture so is it as a human in the loop
kind of complex mess of the whole kind

1160
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
kind of complex mess of the whole kind
 

1161
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,590
kind of complex mess of the whole kind
of interactivity of software with the

1162
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
of interactivity of software with the
 

1163
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,909
of interactivity of software with the
real world or is it something more

1164
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
real world or is it something more
 

1165
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,750
real world or is it something more
concrete well when i say cybernetic i

1166
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
concrete well when i say cybernetic i
 

1167
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,590
concrete well when i say cybernetic i
really do mean that the software itself

1168
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
really do mean that the software itself
 

1169
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,990
really do mean that the software itself
is closing the observe orient decide act

1170
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
is closing the observe orient decide act
 

1171
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,549
is closing the observe orient decide act
loop by itself so humans being out of

1172
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
loop by itself so humans being out of
 

1173
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,190
loop by itself so humans being out of
the loop is is the fact what

1174
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
the loop is is the fact what
 

1175
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,310
the loop is is the fact what
for me uh makes it a cybernetic system

1176
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
for me uh makes it a cybernetic system
 

1177
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,950
for me uh makes it a cybernetic system
and humans are out of that loop when

1178
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
and humans are out of that loop when
 

1179
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,150
and humans are out of that loop when
humans are out of the loop when the

1180
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
humans are out of the loop when the
 

1181
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,150
humans are out of the loop when the

1183
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,150

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
its own what it should do next to get
 

1185
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,590

more information

1186
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
more information
 

1187
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,669
more information
that makes it a cybernetic system so

1188
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
that makes it a cybernetic system so
 

1189
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,350
that makes it a cybernetic system so
we're just at the dawn of this right i

1190
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
we're just at the dawn of this right i
 

1191
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,150
we're just at the dawn of this right i
think everyone talking about mlai it's

1192
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
think everyone talking about mlai it's
 

1193
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,070
think everyone talking about mlai it's
it's it's great but really the thing we

1194
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
it's it's great but really the thing we
 

1195
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,070
it's it's great but really the thing we
should be talking about is when we

1196
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
should be talking about is when we
 

1197
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,230
should be talking about is when we
really enter the cybernetic era

1198
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
really enter the cybernetic era
 

1199
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,830
really enter the cybernetic era
and all of the questions of ethics and

1200
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
and all of the questions of ethics and
 

1201
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,590
and all of the questions of ethics and
governance and all correctness and all

1202
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
governance and all correctness and all
 

1203

these things

1204
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
these things
 

1205
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,310
these things
they really are the most important

1206
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
they really are the most important
 

1207
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,230
they really are the most important
questions okay can we just linger on

1208
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
questions okay can we just linger on
 

1209
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,669
questions okay can we just linger on
this what does it mean for the human to

1210
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
this what does it mean for the human to
 

1211
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,270
this what does it mean for the human to
be out of the loop in a cybernetic

1212
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
be out of the loop in a cybernetic
 

1213
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,110
be out of the loop in a cybernetic
system because isn't the cybernetic

1214
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
system because isn't the cybernetic
 

1215
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,110
system because isn't the cybernetic
system that's

1216

system that's
 

1217
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,789
system that's
ultimately accomplished in some kind of

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
ultimately accomplished in some kind of
 

1219
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,590
ultimately accomplished in some kind of

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
purpose that at the at the bottom
 

1221
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,350
purpose that at the at the bottom
you know the the turtles all the way

1222
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
you know the the turtles all the way
 

1223
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,070
you know the the turtles all the way
down at the bottom turtle is a human

1224
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
down at the bottom turtle is a human
 

1225
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,270
down at the bottom turtle is a human
well the human may have set some

1226
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
well the human may have set some
 

1227
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,350
well the human may have set some
criteria but the human wasn't precise so

1228
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
criteria but the human wasn't precise so
 

1229
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,190
criteria but the human wasn't precise so
for instance i just read the other day

1230
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
for instance i just read the other day
 

1231
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,430
for instance i just read the other day
that um earlier this year or maybe it

1232
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
that um earlier this year or maybe it
 

1233
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,350
that um earlier this year or maybe it
was last year at some point the um

1234
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
was last year at some point the um
 

1235
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,590
was last year at some point the um
libyan army i think um sent out some

1236
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
libyan army i think um sent out some
 

1237
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,990
libyan army i think um sent out some
automated killer drones with explosives

1238
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
automated killer drones with explosives
 

1239
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,510
automated killer drones with explosives
um and there was no human in the loop at

1240
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,520
um and there was no human in the loop at
 

1241
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,950
um and there was no human in the loop at
that point they basically put them in a

1242
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
that point they basically put them in a
 

1243
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,870
that point they basically put them in a
geofenced area said find any moving

1244
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880

target like a truck or vehicle it looks

1246
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
target like a truck or vehicle it looks
 

1247
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,590
target like a truck or vehicle it looks
like this and boom um that's not a human

1248
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
like this and boom um that's not a human
 

1249
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,190
like this and boom um that's not a human
in the loop right

1250
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
in the loop right
 

1251
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,070
in the loop right
so increasingly the less human there is

1252
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
so increasingly the less human there is
 

1253
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,750
so increasingly the less human there is
in the loop the more concerned you are

1254
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
in the loop the more concerned you are
 

1255
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,470
in the loop the more concerned you are
about these kinds of systems because uh

1256
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:16,480
about these kinds of systems because uh
 

1257
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,470
about these kinds of systems because uh
there's unintended consequences like

1258
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
there's unintended consequences like
 

1259
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,350
there's unintended consequences like
less

1260
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360

without humans in the loop that are
 

1275
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,110
without humans in the loop that are
quite complex and that's like the

we we are that's what i mean by we're at
 

1305
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,710
we we are that's what i mean by we're at
the dawn of the cybernetic era and the

1306
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
the dawn of the cybernetic era and the
 

1307
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,750
the dawn of the cybernetic era and the
end of the era of just pure software

1308
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
end of the era of just pure software
 

1309
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,830
end of the era of just pure software
are you more concerned

1310
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
are you more concerned
 

1311
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,270
are you more concerned
if you're thinking about cybernetic

1312
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
if you're thinking about cybernetic
 

1313
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,510
if you're thinking about cybernetic
systems or even like self-replicating

1314
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
systems or even like self-replicating
 

1315
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,230
systems or even like self-replicating
systems so systems that aren't just

1316
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
systems so systems that aren't just
 

1317
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,990
systems so systems that aren't just
doing a particular task but are able to

1318
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
doing a particular task but are able to
 

1319
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,990
doing a particular task but are able to
sort of multiply and scale in some

1320
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
sort of multiply and scale in some
 

1321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,190
sort of multiply and scale in some
dimension

1322
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
dimension
 

1323
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,870
dimension
in the digital or

1324
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
in the digital or
 

1325
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,630
in the digital or
even the physical world are you more

1326
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
even the physical world are you more
 

1327
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,630
even the physical world are you more
concerned about uh

1328
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
concerned about uh
 

1329
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,190
concerned about uh
like the lobster being boiled so a

1330
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
like the lobster being boiled so a
 

1331
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,029
like the lobster being boiled so a
gradual with us not noticing

1332
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
gradual with us not noticing
 

1333
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,830
gradual with us not noticing
collapse of civilization or

1334
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
collapse of civilization or
 

1335
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,510
collapse of civilization or
a big explosion

1336
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
a big explosion
 

1337
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,390
a big explosion
uh it's like oops

1338
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
uh it's like oops
 

1339
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,990
uh it's like oops
kind of a big thing where everyone

1340
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
kind of a big thing where everyone
 

1341
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,990
kind of a big thing where everyone
notices but it's too late

1342
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
notices but it's too late
 

1343
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,990
notices but it's too late
i think that

1344
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
i think that
 

1345
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,070
i think that
it will be a different experience for

1346
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
it will be a different experience for
 

1347
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,830
it will be a different experience for
different people

1348
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
different people
 

1349
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,430
different people
um i do i do um share a common point of

1350
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
um i do i do um share a common point of
 

1351
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,830
um i do i do um share a common point of
view with some of the climate um

1352
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
view with some of the climate um
 

1353
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,870
view with some of the climate um
you know people who are concerned about

1354
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
you know people who are concerned about
 

1355
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,430
you know people who are concerned about
climate change and and just the

1356
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
climate change and and just the
 

1357
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,270
climate change and and just the
uh this uh

1358
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
uh this uh
 

1359
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,789
uh this uh
the the big existential risks that we

1360
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
the the big existential risks that we
 

1361
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,350
the the big existential risks that we
have but unlike a lot of people who are

1362
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
have but unlike a lot of people who are
 

1363
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,789
have but unlike a lot of people who are
who share my level of concern i think

1364
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
who share my level of concern i think
 

1365
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,870
who share my level of concern i think
the collapse will not be

1366
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
the collapse will not be
 

1367
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,430
the collapse will not be
quite so dramatic as some of them think

1368
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
quite so dramatic as some of them think
 

1369
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,990
quite so dramatic as some of them think
and what i mean is that i think that for

1370
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
and what i mean is that i think that for
 

1371
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,830
and what i mean is that i think that for
certain tiers of let's say economic

1372
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
certain tiers of let's say economic
 

1373
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,549
certain tiers of let's say economic
class or certain locations in the world

1374
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
class or certain locations in the world
 

1375
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,789
class or certain locations in the world
people will experience dramatic collapse

1376
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
people will experience dramatic collapse
 

1377
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,549
people will experience dramatic collapse
scenarios but for a lot of people

1378
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
scenarios but for a lot of people
 

1379
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,430
scenarios but for a lot of people
especially in the developed world the

1380
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
especially in the developed world the
 

1381
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,830
especially in the developed world the
realities of collapse will be managed

1382
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
realities of collapse will be managed
 

1383
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,590
realities of collapse will be managed
there will be narrative management

1384
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
there will be narrative management
 

1385
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,510
there will be narrative management
around it so that

1386
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
around it so that
 

1387
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,350
around it so that
they essentially insulate the middle

1388
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
they essentially insulate the middle
 

1389
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,789
they essentially insulate the middle
class will be used to insulate the upper

1390
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
class will be used to insulate the upper
 

1391
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,149
class will be used to insulate the upper
class from

1392
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
class from
 

1393
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,630
class from
the pitch forks and the and the um

1394
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640
the pitch forks and the and the um
 

1395
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,909
the pitch forks and the and the um
flaming torches and everything it's

1396
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
flaming torches and everything it's
 

1397
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,830
flaming torches and everything it's
interesting because uh so my specific

1398
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
interesting because uh so my specific
 

1399
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,669
interesting because uh so my specific
question wasn't is

1400
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
question wasn't is
 

1401
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,029
question wasn't is
my question was more about cybernetic

1402
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
my question was more about cybernetic
 

1403
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,750
my question was more about cybernetic
systems the software okay uh it's

1404
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
systems the software okay uh it's
 

1405
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,270
systems the software okay uh it's
interesting but it would nevertheless

1406
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
interesting but it would nevertheless
 

1407
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,669
interesting but it would nevertheless
perhaps be about class so the effect of

1408
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
perhaps be about class so the effect of
 

1409
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,350
perhaps be about class so the effect of
algorithms might affect certain classes

1410
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
algorithms might affect certain classes
 

1411
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,669
algorithms might affect certain classes
more than others absolutely i was more

1412
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
more than others absolutely i was more
 

1413
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,669
more than others absolutely i was more
thinking about whether it's social media

1414
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
thinking about whether it's social media
 

1415
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,190
thinking about whether it's social media
algorithms or actual robots

1416
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
algorithms or actual robots
 

1417
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,669
algorithms or actual robots
is there going to be a gradual effect on

1418
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
is there going to be a gradual effect on
 

1419
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,909
is there going to be a gradual effect on
us where we wake up

1420
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
us where we wake up
 

1421
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,909
us where we wake up
one day and don't recognize the humans

1422
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:03,919
one day and don't recognize the humans
 

1423
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,110
one day and don't recognize the humans
we are

1424
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
we are
 

1425
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,430
we are
or or is it something truly dramatic

1426
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
or or is it something truly dramatic
 

1427
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,510
or or is it something truly dramatic
where there's you know like

1428
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
where there's you know like
 

1429
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,830
where there's you know like
a meltdown of a nuclear reactor kind of

1430
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
a meltdown of a nuclear reactor kind of
 

1431
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,149
a meltdown of a nuclear reactor kind of
thing chernobyl like uh catastrophic

1432
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
thing chernobyl like uh catastrophic
 

1433
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,110

events

1434
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
events
 

1435
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,029
events
that um

1436
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
that um
 

1437
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,750
that um
are almost bugs in a program that scaled

1438
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
are almost bugs in a program that scaled
 

1439
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,310
are almost bugs in a program that scaled
itself too quickly yeah i'm not as

1440
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
itself too quickly yeah i'm not as
 

1441
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,149
itself too quickly yeah i'm not as
concerned about the visible stuff

1442
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
concerned about the visible stuff
 

1443
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,909
concerned about the visible stuff
and the reason is because the big

1444
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
and the reason is because the big
 

1445
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,750
and the reason is because the big
visible explosions i mean this is

1446
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
visible explosions i mean this is
 

1447
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,190
visible explosions i mean this is
something i said about social media is

1448
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200
something i said about social media is
 

1449
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,549
something i said about social media is
that you know at least with nuclear

1450
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
that you know at least with nuclear
 

1451
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,549
that you know at least with nuclear
weapons when a newt goes off you can see

1452
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
weapons when a newt goes off you can see
 

1453
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,230
weapons when a newt goes off you can see
it and you're like well that's really

1454
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
it and you're like well that's really
 

1455
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,149
it and you're like well that's really
wow that's kind of bad right i mean

1456
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
wow that's kind of bad right i mean
 

1457
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,310
wow that's kind of bad right i mean
oppenheimer was reciting the baha'i gita

1458
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
oppenheimer was reciting the baha'i gita
 

1459
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,510
oppenheimer was reciting the baha'i gita
right when he saw one of those things go

1460
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
right when he saw one of those things go
 

1461
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,950
right when he saw one of those things go
off so

1462
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
off so
 

1463
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,430
off so
we can see nukes are really bad he's not

1464
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
we can see nukes are really bad he's not
 

1465
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,830
we can see nukes are really bad he's not
reciting anything about twitter

1466
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
reciting anything about twitter
 

1467
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,230
reciting anything about twitter
well but right but then when when you

1468
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
well but right but then when when you
 

1469
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,549
well but right but then when when you
have social media when you have um all

1470
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
have social media when you have um all
 

1471
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,549
have social media when you have um all
these different things that conspire to

1472
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
these different things that conspire to
 

1473
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,630
these different things that conspire to
create a layer of virtual experience for

1474
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
create a layer of virtual experience for
 

1475
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,350
create a layer of virtual experience for
people that alienates them from you know

1476
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
people that alienates them from you know
 

1477
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,950
people that alienates them from you know
reality and from each other

1478
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
reality and from each other
 

1479
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,870
reality and from each other
that's very pernicious it's impossible

1480
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
that's very pernicious it's impossible
 

1481
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,350
that's very pernicious it's impossible
to see right and it kind of slowly gets

1482
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
to see right and it kind of slowly gets
 

1483
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,029
to see right and it kind of slowly gets
in there so

1484
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,039
in there so
 

1485
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,470
in there so
you've written about this idea of

1486
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
you've written about this idea of
 

1487
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,950
you've written about this idea of
virtuality on this topic which you

1488
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960
virtuality on this topic which you
 

1489
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,230
virtuality on this topic which you
define as the subjective phenomenon of

1490
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
define as the subjective phenomenon of
 

1491
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,149
define as the subjective phenomenon of
knowingly engaging with virtual

1492
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:16,159
knowingly engaging with virtual
 

1493
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,390
knowingly engaging with virtual
sensation and perception and suspending

1494
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
sensation and perception and suspending
 

1495
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,630
sensation and perception and suspending
or forgetting the context that it's uh

1496
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
or forgetting the context that it's uh
 

1497
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,909
or forgetting the context that it's uh
somalicum

1498
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
somalicum
 

1499
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,750
somalicum
so let me ask

1500
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
so let me ask
 

1501
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,789
so let me ask
uh

1502
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
uh
 

1503
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,310
uh
what is real

1504
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
what is real
 

1505
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,110
what is real
is there a hard line between reality and

1506
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
is there a hard line between reality and
 

1507
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,669
is there a hard line between reality and
virtuality like perception drifts from

1508
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
virtuality like perception drifts from
 

1509
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,590
virtuality like perception drifts from
some kind of physical reality we have to

1510
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
some kind of physical reality we have to
 

1511
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,909
some kind of physical reality we have to
kind of have a sense of what is the line

1512
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
kind of have a sense of what is the line
 

1513
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,630
kind of have a sense of what is the line
that's to we've gone too far right right

1514
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
that's to we've gone too far right right
 

1515
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,029
that's to we've gone too far right right
for me it's not about any hard line

1516
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
for me it's not about any hard line
 

1517
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,990
for me it's not about any hard line
about physical reality as much as

1518
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
about physical reality as much as
 

1519
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,390
about physical reality as much as
um a simple question of

1520
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400
um a simple question of
 

1521
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,190
um a simple question of
um

1522
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
um
 

1523
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,669
um
does the particular technology

1524
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
does the particular technology
 

1525
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,230
does the particular technology
help people connect in a more integral

1526
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
help people connect in a more integral
 

1527
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,029
help people connect in a more integral
way with other people with their

1528
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
way with other people with their
 

1529
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,870
way with other people with their
environment with all of the full

1530
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
environment with all of the full
 

1531
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,789
environment with all of the full
spectrum of things around them so it's

1532
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
spectrum of things around them so it's
 

1533
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,710
spectrum of things around them so it's
less about oh this is a virtual thing

1534
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
less about oh this is a virtual thing
 

1535
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,430
less about oh this is a virtual thing
and this is a hard real thing more about

1536
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
and this is a hard real thing more about
 

1537
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,590
and this is a hard real thing more about
when we create virtual representations

1538
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
when we create virtual representations
 

1539
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,909
when we create virtual representations
of the real things um

1540
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
of the real things um
 

1541
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,669
of the real things um
always some things are lost in

1542
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
always some things are lost in
 

1543
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,470
always some things are lost in
translation usually many many dimensions

1544
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
translation usually many many dimensions
 

1545
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,549
translation usually many many dimensions
are lost in translation right we're now

1546
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
are lost in translation right we're now
 

1547
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,669
are lost in translation right we're now
coming to

1548
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
coming to
 

1549
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,269
coming to
almost two years of covet people on zoom

1550
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
almost two years of covet people on zoom
 

1551
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,470
almost two years of covet people on zoom
all the time you know it's different

1552
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
all the time you know it's different
 

1553
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,750
all the time you know it's different
when you meet somebody in person than

1554
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
when you meet somebody in person than
 

1555
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,950
when you meet somebody in person than
when you see them i've seen you on

1556
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
when you see them i've seen you on
 

1557
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,310
when you see them i've seen you on
youtube lots right

1558
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
youtube lots right
 

1559
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,070
youtube lots right
but the senior person is very different

1560
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
but the senior person is very different
 

1561
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,269
but the senior person is very different
and so

1562
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:25,279
and so
 

1563
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,310
and so
i think when we engage in virtual

1564
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
i think when we engage in virtual
 

1565
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,669
i think when we engage in virtual
experiences

1566
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
experiences
 

1567
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,909
experiences
all the time and we only do that there

1568
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
all the time and we only do that there
 

1569
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,149
all the time and we only do that there
is absolutely a level of embodiment

1570
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
is absolutely a level of embodiment
 

1571
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,310
is absolutely a level of embodiment
there's a level of embodied experience

1572
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
there's a level of embodied experience
 

1573
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,630
there's a level of embodied experience
some participatory interaction that is

1574
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
some participatory interaction that is
 

1575
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,149
some participatory interaction that is
lost

1576
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
lost
 

1577
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,590
lost
and it's very hard to put your finger on

1578
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,600
and it's very hard to put your finger on
 

1579
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,269
and it's very hard to put your finger on
exactly what it is it's hard to say oh

1580
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:43,279
exactly what it is it's hard to say oh
 

1581
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,149
exactly what it is it's hard to say oh
we're gonna spend a hundred million

1582
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
we're gonna spend a hundred million
 

1583
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,230
we're gonna spend a hundred million
dollars building a new system that

1584
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
dollars building a new system that
 

1585
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,789
dollars building a new system that
captures this five to five five percent

1586
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:48,799
captures this five to five five percent
 

1587
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,029
captures this five to five five percent
better higher fidelity human expression

1588
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
better higher fidelity human expression
 

1589
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,950
better higher fidelity human expression
no one's gonna pay for that right so

1590
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:52,960
no one's gonna pay for that right so
 

1591
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,430
no one's gonna pay for that right so
when we rush madly into

1592
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:55,440
when we rush madly into
 

1593
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,029
when we rush madly into
a world of simulacrum and and virtuality

1594
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
a world of simulacrum and and virtuality
 

1595
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,149
a world of simulacrum and and virtuality
um

1596
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
um
 

1597
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,630
um
you know the things that are lost are

1598
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
you know the things that are lost are
 

1599
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,149
you know the things that are lost are
it's difficult

1600
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
it's difficult
 

1601
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,750
it's difficult
once everyone moves there it can be hard

1602
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
once everyone moves there it can be hard
 

1603
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,350
once everyone moves there it can be hard
to look back and see what we've what

1604
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
to look back and see what we've what
 

1605
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,230
to look back and see what we've what
we've lost so is it irrecoverably lost

1606
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240
we've lost so is it irrecoverably lost
 

1607
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,950
we've lost so is it irrecoverably lost
or rather when you put it all on the

1608
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
or rather when you put it all on the
 

1609
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,070
or rather when you put it all on the
table

1610
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
table
 

1611
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,830
table
is it possible for more to be gained

1612
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
is it possible for more to be gained
 

1613
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,470
is it possible for more to be gained
than is lost if you look at video games

1614
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
than is lost if you look at video games
 

1615
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,830
than is lost if you look at video games
they create

1616
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
they create
 

1617
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,549
they create
virtual experiences that are surreal

1618
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
virtual experiences that are surreal
 

1619
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,470
virtual experiences that are surreal
and can bring joy to a lot of people can

1620
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
and can bring joy to a lot of people can
 

1621
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,230
and can bring joy to a lot of people can
connect a lot of people

1622
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
connect a lot of people
 

1623
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,230
connect a lot of people
uh and can get people to talk a lot of

1624
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
uh and can get people to talk a lot of
 

1625
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,750
uh and can get people to talk a lot of
trash uh

1626
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
trash uh
 

1627
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,350
trash uh
so they can bring out the best and the

1628
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
so they can bring out the best and the
 

1629
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,750
so they can bring out the best and the
worst in people so is it possible to

1630
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
worst in people so is it possible to
 

1631
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,590
worst in people so is it possible to
have a future world

1632
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
have a future world
 

1633
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,470
have a future world
where the pros outweigh the cons

1634
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
where the pros outweigh the cons
 

1635
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,990
where the pros outweigh the cons
it is i mean it's possible to have that

1636
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,000
it is i mean it's possible to have that
 

1637
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,390
it is i mean it's possible to have that
in the in the current world but

1638
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400
in the in the current world but
 

1639
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,630
in the in the current world but
um when

1640
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
um when
 

1641
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,830
um when
literally trillions of dollars of

1642
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
literally trillions of dollars of
 

1643
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,870
literally trillions of dollars of
capital are tied to using those things

1644
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:48,880
capital are tied to using those things
 

1645
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,909
capital are tied to using those things
to

1646
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
to
 

1647
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,789
to
groom the worst of our inclinations

1648
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
groom the worst of our inclinations
 

1649
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,870
groom the worst of our inclinations
and to attack our weaknesses in the

1650
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
and to attack our weaknesses in the
 

1651
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,710
and to attack our weaknesses in the
limbic system to create these things

1652
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:56,720
limbic system to create these things
 

1653
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,149
limbic system to create these things
into id machines versus connection

1654
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
into id machines versus connection
 

1655
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,110
into id machines versus connection
machines

1656
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120
machines
 

1657
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,070
machines
then um then the those good things don't

1658
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080
then um then the those good things don't
 

1659
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,750
then um then the those good things don't
stand a chance can you make a lot of

1660
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760
stand a chance can you make a lot of
 

1661
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,950
stand a chance can you make a lot of
money by building connection machines is

1662
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
money by building connection machines is
 

1663
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,110
money by building connection machines is
it possible do you think

1664
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
it possible do you think
 

1665
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,110
it possible do you think
to bring out the best in human nature to

1666
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
to bring out the best in human nature to
 

1667
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,950
to bring out the best in human nature to
uh create fulfilling connections and

1668
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:12,960
uh create fulfilling connections and
 

1669
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,269
uh create fulfilling connections and
relationships in the digital world and

1670
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
relationships in the digital world and
 

1671
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,909
relationships in the digital world and
make a ton of money

1672
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919
make a ton of money
 

1673
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,870
make a ton of money
um if i it out i'll let you know

1674
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
um if i it out i'll let you know
 

1675
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,470
um if i it out i'll let you know
but what's your intuition without

1676
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
but what's your intuition without
 

1677
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,470
but what's your intuition without
concretely knowing what's

1678
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
concretely knowing what's
 

1679
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,310
concretely knowing what's
my intuition is that a lot of our

1680
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320
my intuition is that a lot of our
 

1681
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,789
my intuition is that a lot of our
digital technologies give us the ability

1682
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
digital technologies give us the ability
 

1683
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,190
digital technologies give us the ability
to have synthetic connections or to

1684
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,200
to have synthetic connections or to
 

1685
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,029
to have synthetic connections or to
experience virtuality

1686
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
experience virtuality
 

1687
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,830
experience virtuality
they have co-evolved

1688
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
they have co-evolved
 

1689
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,110
they have co-evolved
with

1690
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
with
 

1691
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,190
with
sort of the human expectations it's sort

1692
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
sort of the human expectations it's sort
 

1693
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,269
sort of the human expectations it's sort
of like sugary drinks as people have

1694
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
of like sugary drinks as people have
 

1695
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,870
of like sugary drinks as people have
more sugary drinks they get they need

1696
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
more sugary drinks they get they need
 

1697
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,190
more sugary drinks they get they need
more sugary drinks to get that same hit

1698
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
more sugary drinks to get that same hit
 

1699
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,669
more sugary drinks to get that same hit
right so with these virtual things

1700
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
right so with these virtual things
 

1701
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,269
right so with these virtual things
and with tv

1702
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:49,279
and with tv
 

1703
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,350
and with tv
and fast cuts and you know tick tocks

1704
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,360
and fast cuts and you know tick tocks
 

1705
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,630
and fast cuts and you know tick tocks
and all these different kinds of things

1706
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:52,640
and all these different kinds of things
 

1707
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,950
and all these different kinds of things
we're co-creating essentially humanity

1708
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
we're co-creating essentially humanity
 

1709
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,669
we're co-creating essentially humanity
that

1710
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
that
 

1711
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,269
that
sort of asks and needs those things and

1712
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279
sort of asks and needs those things and
 

1713
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,350
sort of asks and needs those things and
now becomes very difficult to get people

1714
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
now becomes very difficult to get people
 

1715
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,269
now becomes very difficult to get people
to slow down it gets difficult for

1716
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:01,279
to slow down it gets difficult for
 

1717
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,350
to slow down it gets difficult for
people to hold their attention

1718
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,360
people to hold their attention
 

1719
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,750
people to hold their attention
on on slow things and actually feel that

1720
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
on on slow things and actually feel that
 

1721
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,830
on on slow things and actually feel that
embodied experience right so mindfulness

1722
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:07,840
embodied experience right so mindfulness
 

1723
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,389
embodied experience right so mindfulness
now more than ever is so important in

1724
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:10,399
now more than ever is so important in
 

1725
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,950
now more than ever is so important in
schools and um as a therapy technique

1726
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960
schools and um as a therapy technique
 

1727
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,710
schools and um as a therapy technique
for people because our environment has

1728
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
for people because our environment has
 

1729
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,470
for people because our environment has
been accelerated and mcluhan actually

1730
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
been accelerated and mcluhan actually
 

1731
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,750
been accelerated and mcluhan actually
talks about this in the electric

1732
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
talks about this in the electric
 

1733
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,510
talks about this in the electric
environment of the television and that

1734
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,520
environment of the television and that
 

1735
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,029
environment of the television and that
was before tick-tock and before

1736
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
was before tick-tock and before
 

1737
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,110
was before tick-tock and before
front-facing cameras so

1738
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
front-facing cameras so
 

1739
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,190
front-facing cameras so
i think for me the the concern is that

1740
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,200
i think for me the the concern is that
 

1741
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,029
i think for me the the concern is that
it's not like we can ever switch to

1742
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:27,039
it's not like we can ever switch to
 

1743
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,190
it's not like we can ever switch to
doing something better but more of

1744
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,200
doing something better but more of
 

1745
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,909
doing something better but more of
the humans and technology

1746
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:31,919
the humans and technology
 

1747
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,590
the humans and technology
they're not independent of each other

1748
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:33,600
they're not independent of each other
 

1749
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,830
they're not independent of each other
the technology that we use

1750
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
the technology that we use
 

1751
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,990
the technology that we use
kind of molds what we need for the next

1752
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,000
kind of molds what we need for the next
 

1753
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,830
kind of molds what we need for the next
generation of technology yeah but humans

1754
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
generation of technology yeah but humans
 

1755
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,070
generation of technology yeah but humans
are intelligent and they're uh

1756
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
are intelligent and they're uh
 

1757
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,230
are intelligent and they're uh
introspective and they can reflect on

1758
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
introspective and they can reflect on
 

1759
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,990
introspective and they can reflect on
the experiences of their life so for

1760
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
the experiences of their life so for
 

1761
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,510
the experiences of their life so for
example there's been many years in my

1762
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
example there's been many years in my
 

1763
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,750
example there's been many years in my
life where i i ate an excessive amount

1764
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
life where i i ate an excessive amount
 

1765
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,830
life where i i ate an excessive amount
of sugar and then a certain moment i

1766
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
of sugar and then a certain moment i
 

1767
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,870
of sugar and then a certain moment i
woke up

1768
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:52,880
woke up
 

1769
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,630
woke up
and said uh

1770
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:54,640
and said uh
 

1771
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,230
and said uh
why do i keep doing this this doesn't

1772
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,240
why do i keep doing this this doesn't
 

1773
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,590
why do i keep doing this this doesn't
feel good

1774
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
feel good
 

1775
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,990
feel good
like long term and i think

1776
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
like long term and i think
 

1777
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,669
like long term and i think
uh so going through the tick tock

1778
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
uh so going through the tick tock
 

1779
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,510
uh so going through the tick tock
process of realizing

1780
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,520
process of realizing
 

1781
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,230
process of realizing
okay when i shorten my attention span

1782
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
okay when i shorten my attention span
 

1783
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,870
okay when i shorten my attention span
actually that does not make me feel good

1784
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
actually that does not make me feel good
 

1785
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,149
actually that does not make me feel good
longer term

going to do and so one of the things

1966
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
going to do and so one of the things
 

1967
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,310
going to do and so one of the things
that we have to reason about here is the

1968
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
that we have to reason about here is the
 

1969
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,389
that we have to reason about here is the
social media systems or you know social

1970
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:10,399
social media systems or you know social
 

1971
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,230
social media systems or you know social
media i think is a

1972

media i think is a
 

1973
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,509
media i think is a
first

1974
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
first
 

1975
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,990
first
our first encounter with

1976
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,000
our first encounter with
 

1977
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,549
our first encounter with
a technological system

1978
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
a technological system
 

1979
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,669
a technological system
that runs a bit of a loop around

1980
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:21,679
that runs a bit of a loop around
 

1981
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,070
that runs a bit of a loop around
our own cognition and attention

1982
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
our own cognition and attention
 

1983
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,750
our own cognition and attention
it's not the last

1984
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
it's not the last
 

1985
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,470
it's not the last
it's it's far from the last and it gets

1986
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
it's it's far from the last and it gets
 

1987
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,990
it's it's far from the last and it gets
to the heart of some of the

1988
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,000
to the heart of some of the
 

1989
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,630
to the heart of some of the
philosophical achilles heel of the

1990
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
philosophical achilles heel of the
 

1991
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,470
philosophical achilles heel of the
western philosophical system which is

1992
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,480
western philosophical system which is
 

1993
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,590
western philosophical system which is
each person gets to make their own

1994
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,600
each person gets to make their own
 

1995
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,590
each person gets to make their own
determination each person is an

1996
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:37,600
determination each person is an
 

1997
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,669
determination each person is an
individual that's you know sacrosanct in

1998
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:39,679
individual that's you know sacrosanct in
 

1999
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,110
individual that's you know sacrosanct in
their agency and their sovereignty and

2000
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,120
their agency and their sovereignty and
 

2001
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,110
their agency and their sovereignty and
all these things the problem with these

2002
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,120
all these things the problem with these
 

2003
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,350
all these things the problem with these
systems is they come down and they are

2004
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,360
systems is they come down and they are
 

2005
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,750
systems is they come down and they are
able to manage everyone on mass

2006
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
able to manage everyone on mass
 

2007
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,190
able to manage everyone on mass
and so every person is making their own

2008
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,200
and so every person is making their own
 

2009
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,909
and so every person is making their own
decision but together the the bigger

2010
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
decision but together the the bigger
 

2011
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,230
decision but together the the bigger
system is causing them to act with a

2012
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
system is causing them to act with a
 

2013
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,190
system is causing them to act with a
group

2014
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,200
group
 

2015
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,590
group
um dynamic that's very profitable for

2016
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
um dynamic that's very profitable for
 

2017
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,470
um dynamic that's very profitable for
people

2018
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,480
people
 

2019
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,870
people
so this is the issue that we have is

2020
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
so this is the issue that we have is
 

2021
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,950
so this is the issue that we have is
that our philosophies are actually not

2022
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
that our philosophies are actually not
 

2023
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,870
that our philosophies are actually not
geared to understand

2024
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
geared to understand
 

2025
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,350
geared to understand
what is it for a person to be to have an

2026
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
what is it for a person to be to have an
 

2027
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,149
what is it for a person to be to have an
uh

2028
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:08,159
uh
 

2029
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,710
uh
high trust connection uh as part of a

2030
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
high trust connection uh as part of a
 

2031
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,310
high trust connection uh as part of a
collective and for that collective to

2032
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
collective and for that collective to
 

2033
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,149
collective and for that collective to
have its right to coherency and agency

2034
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
have its right to coherency and agency
 

2035
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,549
have its right to coherency and agency
that's something like when when a social

2036
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
that's something like when when a social
 

2037
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,430
that's something like when when a social
media app causes a family to break apart

2038
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
media app causes a family to break apart
 

2039
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,870
media app causes a family to break apart
it's done harm to more than just

2040
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
it's done harm to more than just
 

2041
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,990
it's done harm to more than just
individuals right so that concept is not

2042
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
individuals right so that concept is not
 

2043
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,269
individuals right so that concept is not
something we really talk about or think

2044
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:27,279
something we really talk about or think
 

2045
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,509
something we really talk about or think
about very much but that's actually the

2046
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:29,519
about very much but that's actually the
 

2047
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,190
about very much but that's actually the
problem is that we're vaporizing

2048
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,200
problem is that we're vaporizing
 

2049
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,190
problem is that we're vaporizing
molecules into atomic units and then

2050
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
molecules into atomic units and then
 

2051
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,630
molecules into atomic units and then
we're hitting all the atoms with certain

2052
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
we're hitting all the atoms with certain
 

2053
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,389
we're hitting all the atoms with certain
things that's like yeah well that person

2054
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
things that's like yeah well that person
 

2055
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,789
things that's like yeah well that person
chose to look at my app so our

2056
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:38,799
chose to look at my app so our
 

2057
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,190
chose to look at my app so our
understanding of human nature is at the

2058
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
understanding of human nature is at the
 

2059
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,190
understanding of human nature is at the
individual level it emphasizes the

2060
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
individual level it emphasizes the
 

2061
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,350
individual level it emphasizes the
individual too much because ultimately

2062
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
individual too much because ultimately
 

2063
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,269
individual too much because ultimately
society operates at the collective level

2064
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:47,279
society operates at the collective level
 

2065
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,269
society operates at the collective level
and these apps do as well and the apps

2066
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:49,279
and these apps do as well and the apps
 

2067
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,830
and these apps do as well and the apps
do as well so for us to understand the

2068
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:51,840
do as well so for us to understand the
 

2069
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,990
do as well so for us to understand the
progression the development of this

2070
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
progression the development of this
 

2071
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,909
progression the development of this
organism we call human civilization we

2072
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
organism we call human civilization we
 

2073
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,350
organism we call human civilization we
have to think of the collective level

2074
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
have to think of the collective level
 

2075
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,110
have to think of the collective level
too i would say multi-tiered

2076
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
too i would say multi-tiered
 

2077
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,430
too i would say multi-tiered
multi-tiered multi-so individual as well

2078
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
multi-tiered multi-so individual as well
 

2079
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,350
multi-tiered multi-so individual as well
individuals family units social

collectives
 

2083
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,190
collectives
um and and on the way up okay two so

2084
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
um and and on the way up okay two so
 

2085
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,349
um and and on the way up okay two so
you've said that individual humans are

2086
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:09,359
you've said that individual humans are
 

2087
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,669
you've said that individual humans are
multi-layered susceptible to signals and

2088
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
multi-layered susceptible to signals and
 

2089
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,069
multi-layered susceptible to signals and
waves and multiple strata the physical

2090
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:14,079

intellectual so

2094
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:17,679
intellectual so
 

2095
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,510
intellectual so
sort of going along these lines can you

2096
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
sort of going along these lines can you
 

2097
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,109
sort of going along these lines can you
describe

2098
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
describe
 

2099
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,669
describe
the layers of the cake that that is a

2100
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:23,679
the layers of the cake that that is a
 

2101
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,190

is that just merely the matter that's in
 

2139
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,230
is that just merely the matter that's in
your brain or is there something kind of

your brain or is there something kind of

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,829

more beyond that and they would say yes

00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
more beyond that and they would say yes

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,390
more beyond that and they would say yes
there's a soul sort of ineffable

body right and then and i'm not one of

2148
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
body right and then and i'm not one of
 

2149
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,630
body right and then and i'm not one of
those people right i think that we don't

2150
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:12,640
those people right i think that we don't

are things only this or only that

structures and patterns that are just as

2158
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
structures and patterns that are just as
 

2159
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,550
structures and patterns that are just as
real as the underlying pieces but you

2160
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,560
real as the underlying pieces but you
 

2161
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,310
real as the underlying pieces but you
know they're transcendent but they're

2162
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
know they're transcendent but they're
 

2163
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,470
know they're transcendent but they're
still of the underlying pieces

2164
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,480
still of the underlying pieces
 

2165
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,790
still of the underlying pieces
so your body is this way i mean we just

2166
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
so your body is this way i mean we just
 

2167
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,430
so your body is this way i mean we just
know physically you consist of atoms and

2168
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,440
know physically you consist of atoms and
 

2169
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,430
know physically you consist of atoms and
uh and and whatnot and then the atoms

2170
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,440
uh and and whatnot and then the atoms
 

2171
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,790
uh and and whatnot and then the atoms
are arranged into molecules which then

2172
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:34,800
are arranged into molecules which then
 

2173
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,950
are arranged into molecules which then
arrange into certain kinds of structures

2174
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
arrange into certain kinds of structures
 

2175
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,349
arrange into certain kinds of structures
that seem to have a homeostasis to them

2176
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
that seem to have a homeostasis to them
 

2177
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,589
that seem to have a homeostasis to them
we call them cells and those cells form

2178
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:41,599
we call them cells and those cells form
 

2179
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,390
we call them cells and those cells form
you know sort of biological structures

2180
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
you know sort of biological structures
 

2181
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,829
you know sort of biological structures
those biological structures give your

2182
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
those biological structures give your
 

2183
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:46,710
those biological structures give your
body

2184
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:46,720
body
 

2185
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,630
body
its physical ability and biological

2186
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
its physical ability and biological
 

2187
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,150
its physical ability and biological
ability to consume energy and to

2188
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,160
ability to consume energy and to
 

2189
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,030
ability to consume energy and to
maintain homeostasis but humans are

2190
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,040
maintain homeostasis but humans are
 

2191
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,030
maintain homeostasis but humans are
social animals and a human by themselves

2192
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
social animals and a human by themselves
 

2193
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,829
social animals and a human by themselves
is is not very long for the world so we

2194
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:57,839
is is not very long for the world so we
 

2195
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,069
is is not very long for the world so we
also part of our biology is wire to

2196
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:00,079
also part of our biology is wire to
 

2197
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,230
also part of our biology is wire to
connect to other people to you know from

2198
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
connect to other people to you know from
 

2199
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,390
connect to other people to you know from
the mirror neurons to our language uh

2200
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:04,400
the mirror neurons to our language uh
 

2201
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,150
the mirror neurons to our language uh
centers and all these other things

2202
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
centers and all these other things
 

2203
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,870
centers and all these other things
so

2204
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:06,880
so
 

2205
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,030
so
we are intrinsically there's a layer

2206
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,040
we are intrinsically there's a layer
 

2207
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,109
we are intrinsically there's a layer
there's a part of us that wants to be

2208
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:11,119
there's a part of us that wants to be
 

2209
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,030
there's a part of us that wants to be
part of a thing if we're around other

2210
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,040
part of a thing if we're around other
 

2211
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,790
part of a thing if we're around other
people not saying a word but they're

2212
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:14,800
people not saying a word but they're
 

2213
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,310
people not saying a word but they're
just up and down jumping and dancing

2214
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,320
just up and down jumping and dancing
 

2215
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,470
just up and down jumping and dancing
laughing we're gonna feel better right

2216
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
laughing we're gonna feel better right
 

2217
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,390
laughing we're gonna feel better right
and they didn't there was no exchange of

2218
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
and they didn't there was no exchange of
 

2219
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,150
and they didn't there was no exchange of
physical anything they didn't give us

2220
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
physical anything they didn't give us
 

2221
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,870
physical anything they didn't give us
like five atoms of happiness right but

2222
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
like five atoms of happiness right but
 

2223
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,030
like five atoms of happiness right but
there's an induction in our own sense of

2224
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,040
there's an induction in our own sense of
 

2225
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,510
there's an induction in our own sense of
self that is at that social level

2226
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
self that is at that social level
 

2227
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,069
self that is at that social level
and then beyond that um

2228
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:32,079
and then beyond that um
 

2229
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,750
and then beyond that um
person puts the intellectual level kind

2230
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:33,760
person puts the intellectual level kind
 

2231
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,109
person puts the intellectual level kind
of one level higher than social i think

2232
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,119
of one level higher than social i think
 

2233
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,710
of one level higher than social i think
they're actually more intertwined than

2234
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:36,720
they're actually more intertwined than
 

2235
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,109
they're actually more intertwined than
that but the intellectual level is

2236
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
that but the intellectual level is
 

2237
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,430
that but the intellectual level is
the the level of pure ideas that you are

2238
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
the the level of pure ideas that you are
 

2239
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,589
the the level of pure ideas that you are
a vessel for memes you're a vessel for

2240
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:43,599
a vessel for memes you're a vessel for
 

2241
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,950
a vessel for memes you're a vessel for
philosophies

2242
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
philosophies
 

2243
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,230

you will conduct yourself in a

2244
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,240
you will conduct yourself in a
 

2245
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,589
you will conduct yourself in a
particular way

2246
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
particular way
 

2247
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,950
particular way
i mean i think part of this is if we

2248
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
i mean i think part of this is if we
 

2249
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,910
i mean i think part of this is if we
think about it from a physics

2250
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,920
think about it from a physics
 

2251
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,230
think about it from a physics
perspective you're not you know there's

2252
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,240
perspective you're not you know there's
 

2253
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,150
perspective you're not you know there's
a joke that physicists like to um

2254
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
a joke that physicists like to um
 

2255
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,829
a joke that physicists like to um
approximate things and we'll say well

2256
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:55,839
approximate things and we'll say well
 

2257
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,270
approximate things and we'll say well
approximate a spherical cowl right

2258
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280
approximate a spherical cowl right
 

2259
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,390
approximate a spherical cowl right
you're not a spherical cow you're not a

we can't even um say what the dynamics

we can't even um say what the dynamics

we can't even um say what the dynamics

00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
analyze all four of these layers
 

2269
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,390
analyze all four of these layers
right

2270
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400

going to be on the ground kneeling and

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,630
going to be on the ground kneeling and
praying right and that has nothing to do

00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
praying right and that has nothing to do
 

2279
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,230

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,390

four layered stack
 

2291
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,710
four layered stack
is is all about it's that a person is

2292
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:28,720
is is all about it's that a person is
 

2293
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,470
is is all about it's that a person is
not only one of these things they're all

2294
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
not only one of these things they're all
 

2295
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,750
not only one of these things they're all
of these things at the same time it's a

2296
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
of these things at the same time it's a
 

2297
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,190
of these things at the same time it's a
superposition

2298
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,200
superposition
 

2299
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,589
superposition
of dynamics that run through us that

2300
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:35,599
of dynamics that run through us that
 

2301
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,190
of dynamics that run through us that
make us who we are

2302
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,200
make us who we are
 

2303
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,829
make us who we are
so no layers is special

2304
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:39,839
so no layers is special
 

2305
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,750
so no layers is special
um not so much nowhere especially each

2306
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
um not so much nowhere especially each
 

2307
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,510
um not so much nowhere especially each
layer is just different

2308
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
layer is just different
 

2309
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,670
layer is just different
um but we are

2310
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:45,680
um but we are
 

2311
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,190
um but we are
each layer against the participation

2312
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,200
each layer against the participation
 

2313
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,150
each layer against the participation

yeah each layer is a part of what you

2316
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,000
yeah each layer is a part of what you
 

2317
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,510
yeah each layer is a part of what you
are you are a layer cake right of all

2318
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,520
are you are a layer cake right of all
 

2319
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,069
are you are a layer cake right of all
these things and if we try to deny

2320
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
these things and if we try to deny
 

2321
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,510
these things and if we try to deny
right so many philosophies do try to

2322
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
right so many philosophies do try to
 

2323
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,470
right so many philosophies do try to
deny

2324
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,480
deny
 

2325
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,550
deny
the reality of some of these things

the reality of some of these things
 

2327
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,310
the reality of some of these things
right some people say well we're only

2328
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
right some people say well we're only
 

2329
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,470
right some people say well we're only
atoms well we're not only atoms because

2330
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:02,480
atoms well we're not only atoms because
 

2331
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,349
atoms well we're not only atoms because
there's a lot of other things that are

2332
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
there's a lot of other things that are
 

2333
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,750
there's a lot of other things that are
only atoms i can reduce a human being to

2334
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
only atoms i can reduce a human being to
 

2335
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,829
only atoms i can reduce a human being to
a bunch of soup and it's not they're not

2336
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:07,839
a bunch of soup and it's not they're not
 

2337
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,950
a bunch of soup and it's not they're not
the same thing even though it's the same

2338
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:08,960
the same thing even though it's the same
 

2339
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,589
the same thing even though it's the same
atoms so i think the the order and the

00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:11,599
atoms so i think the the order and the
 

2341
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,230
atoms so i think the the order and the

2349
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,470
generation philosophy would look like
that would allow us to reason about

00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,480
that would allow us to reason about
 

2351
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,710
that would allow us to reason about
extending humans into the digital realm

extending humans into the digital realm
 

2353

we can make

structures um this gets kind of into

2422
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:31,680
structures um this gets kind of into
 

2423
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,109
structures um this gets kind of into
weird mathematical territories you start

2424
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:33,119
weird mathematical territories you start
 

2425
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,550
weird mathematical territories you start
thinking about penrose and game of life

2426
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:34,560
thinking about penrose and game of life
 

2427
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,190
thinking about penrose and game of life
stuff uh about the generativity of math

2428
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,200
stuff uh about the generativity of math
 

2429
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,790
stuff uh about the generativity of math
itself like the hyper real numbers

2430
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
itself like the hyper real numbers
 

2431
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,950

things like that but um without going

2432
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:40,960
things like that but um without going
 

2433
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,710
things like that but um without going
down that rabbit hole i would say that

2434
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
down that rabbit hole i would say that
 

2435
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,430
down that rabbit hole i would say that
there seems to be a tendency

2436
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,440
there seems to be a tendency
 

2437
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,829
there seems to be a tendency
in the world that when there is

2438
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
in the world that when there is
 

2439
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,390
in the world that when there is
excess energy things will structure and

2440
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,400
excess energy things will structure and
 

2441
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,670
excess energy things will structure and
pattern themselves and they will then

2442
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,680
pattern themselves and they will then
 

2443
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,750
pattern themselves and they will then
actually furthermore try to create an

2444
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:53,760
actually furthermore try to create an
 

2445
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,990
actually furthermore try to create an
environment that furthers their

2446
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,000

so

2454
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
so
 

2455
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,349
so
um this is ultimately what leads to

00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,359
um this is ultimately what leads to
 

2457
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,069
um this is ultimately what leads to

that we think are random are actually
not that random we're simply not

2584
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:13,839
not that random we're simply not
 

2585
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,390
not that random we're simply not
integrating at a final f level across a

2586
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
integrating at a final f level across a
 

2587
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,309
integrating at a final f level across a
broad enough time horizon

2588
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
broad enough time horizon
 

2589
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,829
broad enough time horizon
um and this is again i said we go down

2590
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:19,839
um and this is again i said we go down
 

2591
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,270
um and this is again i said we go down
the rabbit holes and the penrose stuff

2592
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
the rabbit holes and the penrose stuff
 

2593
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,030
the rabbit holes and the penrose stuff
or like wolf runs explorations on these

2594
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
or like wolf runs explorations on these
 

2595
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,870
or like wolf runs explorations on these
things um

2596
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:24,880
things um
 

2597
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,190
things um
there is something deep and beautiful in

2598
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
there is something deep and beautiful in
 

2599
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,030
there is something deep and beautiful in
the mathematics of all this that is

2600
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
the mathematics of all this that is
 

2601
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,230
the mathematics of all this that is
hopefully one day i'll have enough money

2602
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
hopefully one day i'll have enough money
 

2603
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,550
hopefully one day i'll have enough money
to work and retire and just ponder those

2604
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:32,560
to work and retire and just ponder those
 

2605
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,910
to work and retire and just ponder those
those questions but there's something

2606
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:33,920
those questions but there's something
 

2607
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,270
those questions but there's something
there but you're saying there's a

2608
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
there but you're saying there's a
 

2609
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,950
there but you're saying there's a
ceiling to when you have enough money

2610
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
ceiling to when you have enough money
 

2611
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,550
ceiling to when you have enough money
and you retire and you ponder it there's

2612
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560
and you retire and you ponder it there's
 

2613
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,230
and you retire and you ponder it there's
a ceiling to how much you can truly

2614
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,240
a ceiling to how much you can truly
 

2615
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,670
a ceiling to how much you can truly
ponder because there's cognitive

2616
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,680
ponder because there's cognitive
 

2617
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,950
ponder because there's cognitive
limitations

2618
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960
limitations
 

2619
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,630
limitations
in what you're able to

2620
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,640
in what you're able to
 

2621
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,309
in what you're able to
perceive as a pattern

2622
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
perceive as a pattern
 

2623
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,349
perceive as a pattern
yeah so and maybe mathematics extends

2624
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
yeah so and maybe mathematics extends
 

2625
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,230
yeah so and maybe mathematics extends
your

2626
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240
your
 

2627
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,309
your
perception capabilities but it's still

2628
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:52,319
perception capabilities but it's still
 

2629
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,349
perception capabilities but it's still
it's still finite it's just like

2630
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:55,359
it's still finite it's just like
 

2631
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,030
it's still finite it's just like
yeah the mathematics we use is the

2632
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,040
yeah the mathematics we use is the
 

2633
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,870
yeah the mathematics we use is the
mathematics that can fit in our head

2634
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
mathematics that can fit in our head
 

2635
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,470
mathematics that can fit in our head
yeah

2636
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
yeah
 

2637
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,589
yeah
you know did god really create the

2638
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:01,599
you know did god really create the
 

2639
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,670
you know did god really create the
integers or did god create all of it and

2640
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:03,680
integers or did god create all of it and
 

2641
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,270
integers or did god create all of it and
we just happen at this point in time to

2642
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,280
we just happen at this point in time to
 

2643
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,030
we just happen at this point in time to
be able to perceive integers

2644
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,040
be able to perceive integers
 

2645
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,630
be able to perceive integers
well she just did the the positive

2646
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
well she just did the the positive
 

2647
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,190
well she just did the the positive
energy

2648
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200

 

2649
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,790

and then we

2650
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
and then we
 

2651
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,069
and then we
um

2652
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:14,079
um
 

2653
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,670
um
she just graded the natural numbers and

2654
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,680
she just graded the natural numbers and
 

2655
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,030
she just graded the natural numbers and
then we screwed all up with zero and

2656
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040
then we screwed all up with zero and
 

2657
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,390
then we screwed all up with zero and
then i guess okay

2658
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
then i guess okay
 

2659
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,470
then i guess okay
but we did we created mathematical uh

2660
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
but we did we created mathematical uh
 

2661
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,589
but we did we created mathematical uh
operations so we can have iterated steps

2662
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:23,599
operations so we can have iterated steps
 

2663
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,589
operations so we can have iterated steps
to approach bigger problems

2664
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:25,599
to approach bigger problems
 

2665
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,430
to approach bigger problems
right i mean the entire the entire point

2666
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:27,440
right i mean the entire the entire point
 

2667
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,589
right i mean the entire the entire point
of the arabic numeral system and it's a

2668
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
of the arabic numeral system and it's a
 

2669
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,990
of the arabic numeral system and it's a
rubric for mapping a certain set of

2670
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
rubric for mapping a certain set of
 

2671
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,349
rubric for mapping a certain set of
operations and folding them into a

2672
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
operations and folding them into a
 

2673
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,190
operations and folding them into a
simple little expression

2674
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,200
simple little expression
 

2675
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,109
simple little expression
but that's just the operations that we

2676
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
but that's just the operations that we
 

2677
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,630
but that's just the operations that we
can fit in our heads

2678
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:38,640
can fit in our heads
 

2679
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,150
can fit in our heads
there are many other operations besides

2680
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
there are many other operations besides
 

2681
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,030
there are many other operations besides
right

2682
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,040
right
 

2683
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,589
right
the thing that worries me the most about

2684
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:43,599
the thing that worries me the most about
 

2685
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,910
the thing that worries me the most about
aliens and humans

2686
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920
aliens and humans
 

2687
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,870
aliens and humans
is that their aliens are all around us

2688
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:48,880
is that their aliens are all around us
 

2689
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,710
is that their aliens are all around us
and we're too dumb

2690
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
and we're too dumb
 

2691
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,589
and we're too dumb
yeah see them oh certainly yeah or life

2692
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:53,599
yeah see them oh certainly yeah or life
 

2693
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,150
yeah see them oh certainly yeah or life
let's say just life life of all kinds of

2694
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
let's say just life life of all kinds of
 

2695
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,790
let's say just life life of all kinds of
forms or organisms you know what just

2696
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:58,800
forms or organisms you know what just
 

2697
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,910
forms or organisms you know what just
even the intelligence of organisms

2698
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
even the intelligence of organisms
 

2699
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,470
even the intelligence of organisms
is uh imperceptible to us because we're

2700
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,480
is uh imperceptible to us because we're
 

2701
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,030
is uh imperceptible to us because we're
too dumb and

2702
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,040
too dumb and
 

2703
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,589
too dumb and
we're looking self-centered

2704
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:07,599
we're looking self-centered
 

2705
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,150
we're looking self-centered
a particular kind of thing yeah

2706
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,160
a particular kind of thing yeah
 

2707
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,829
a particular kind of thing yeah
when i was at cornell i had a lovely

2708
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
when i was at cornell i had a lovely
 

2709
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,309
when i was at cornell i had a lovely
professor of asian religions jamerry law

2710
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
professor of asian religions jamerry law
 

2711
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,630
professor of asian religions jamerry law
and she would tell this um story about a

2712
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:16,640
and she would tell this um story about a
 

2713
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,950
and she would tell this um story about a
musical a musician a western musician

2714
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
musical a musician a western musician
 

2715
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,030
musical a musician a western musician
who went to japan and he taught you know

2716
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,040
who went to japan and he taught you know
 

2717
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,390
who went to japan and he taught you know
classical music and

2718
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:22,400
classical music and
 

2719
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,510
classical music and
could play you know all sorts of

2720
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
could play you know all sorts of
 

2721
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,910
could play you know all sorts of
instruments he went to japan um and he

2722
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
instruments he went to japan um and he
 

2723
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,510
instruments he went to japan um and he
would ask people you know he would

2724
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
would ask people you know he would
 

2725
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,950
would ask people you know he would
basically be looking for things in the

2726
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:28,960
basically be looking for things in the
 

2727
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,630
basically be looking for things in the
style of

2728
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
style of
 

2729
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,109
style of
western you know chromatic scale and

2730
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:33,119
western you know chromatic scale and
 

2731
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,870
western you know chromatic scale and
these kinds of things and then finding

2732
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
these kinds of things and then finding
 

2733
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,829
these kinds of things and then finding
none of it he would say well there's

2734
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:35,839
none of it he would say well there's
 

2735
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,670
none of it he would say well there's
really no music in japan but they're

2736
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
really no music in japan but they're
 

2737
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,030
really no music in japan but they're
using a different scale they're playing

2738
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,040
using a different scale they're playing
 

2739
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,470
using a different scale they're playing
different kinds of instruments right the

2740
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:40,480
different kinds of instruments right the
 

2741
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,069
different kinds of instruments right the
same thing she was using as sort of a

2742
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
same thing she was using as sort of a
 

2743
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,829
same thing she was using as sort of a

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,670
metaphor for religion as well in the
west we center a lot of religion

2746
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:45,680
west we center a lot of religion
 

2747
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,829
west we center a lot of religion
certainly the the religions of abraham

2748
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:47,839
certainly the the religions of abraham
 

2749
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,230
certainly the the religions of abraham
we center them around belief and in the

we center them around belief and in the
 

2751
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,309
we center them around belief and in the
east it's more about practice right

2752
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:52,319
east it's more about practice right
 

2753
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,750
east it's more about practice right
spirituality and practice rather than

spirituality and practice rather than
 

2755
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,910
spirituality and practice rather than
belief so anyway the point is here to

00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:55,920
belief so anyway the point is here to
 

2757
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,270
belief so anyway the point is here to
your point um life we i think so many

2758
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
your point um life we i think so many
 

2759
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,510
your point um life we i think so many
people are so fixated on certain aspects

00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:01,520
people are so fixated on certain aspects

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,190
people are so fixated on certain aspects
of self-replication

thing there are some organisms on earth

2780
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
thing there are some organisms on earth
 

2781
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,270

that are thousands of years old
 

2783
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,870
that are thousands of years old
and it's not like they're incredibly

2784
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:24,880
and it's not like they're incredibly

death was invented you know somewhere

along the eukaryotic scale i mean even

the protists right there's death

2796
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,040
the protists right there's death
 

2797
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,510
the protists right there's death
and why is that along with the

and why is that along with the
 

2799
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,670
and why is that along with the
sexual reproduction right there is

2800
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680
sexual reproduction right there is
 

2801
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,750
sexual reproduction right there is
something about

2802
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:43,760
something about
 

2803
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,430
something about
the renewal process something about the

2804
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:45,440
the renewal process something about the
 

2805
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,950

very beginning yeah well we didn't
 

2831
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,390
very beginning yeah well we didn't
invent them right

2832

uh you particular homo sapien did not
 

2839
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,670
uh you particular homo sapien did not
invent them but uh we together it's a

2840
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
invent them but uh we together it's a
 

2841
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,750
invent them but uh we together it's a
team project just like you're saying i

2842
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:21,760
team project just like you're saying i
 

2843
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,589
team project just like you're saying i
think the greatest homo sapien

2844
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:23,599
think the greatest homo sapien

have you heard of this no it's a really

2866
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:47,440
have you heard of this no it's a really
 

2867
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,230
have you heard of this no it's a really
fascinating thesis which is that

2868
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:50,240
fascinating thesis which is that
 

2869
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,030
fascinating thesis which is that
humans are the only conspecific

the
the only species that can kill other

the only species that can kill other
 

2875

members of the species from range
 

2877
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,829
members of the species from range
and maybe there's a few exceptions but

2878
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
and maybe there's a few exceptions but
 

2879
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,190
and maybe there's a few exceptions but
if you look in the animal world you see

2880
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
if you look in the animal world you see
 

2881
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,950
if you look in the animal world you see
like pronghorns butting heads right you

2882
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
like pronghorns butting heads right you
 

2883
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,470
like pronghorns butting heads right you
see the alpha

2884
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:04,480
see the alpha
 

2885
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,069
see the alpha
lion and the beta lion and they take

2886
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:06,079
lion and the beta lion and they take
 

2887
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,230
lion and the beta lion and they take
each other down humans we develop the

2888
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
each other down humans we develop the
 

2889
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,910
each other down humans we develop the
ability to chuck rocks at each other and

2890
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:09,920
ability to chuck rocks at each other and
 

2891
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,069
ability to chuck rocks at each other and
while at prey but also at each other and

2892
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:12,079
while at prey but also at each other and
 

2893
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,069
while at prey but also at each other and
that means the beta male can chunk a

2894
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
that means the beta male can chunk a
 

2895
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,230
that means the beta male can chunk a
rock at the alpha male and take them

2896
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:16,240
rock at the alpha male and take them
 

2897
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,270
rock at the alpha male and take them
down

2898
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
down
 

2899
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,190
down
and with very he can throw a lot of

2900
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:19,200
and with very he can throw a lot of
 

2901
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,710
and with very he can throw a lot of
rocks actually miss a bunch of times so

2902
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:20,720
rocks actually miss a bunch of times so
 

2903
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,589
rocks actually miss a bunch of times so

destruction where we had to evolve

2914
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
destruction where we had to evolve
 

2915
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,190
destruction where we had to evolve
cooperation if we didn't

2916
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
cooperation if we didn't
 

2917
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,190
cooperation if we didn't
then if we just continue to try to do

2918
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:37,200
then if we just continue to try to do
 

2919
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,270
then if we just continue to try to do
like i'm the biggest monkey in the tribe

2920
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,280
like i'm the biggest monkey in the tribe
 

2921
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,950
like i'm the biggest monkey in the tribe
and i'm gonna you know

2922
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:40,960
and i'm gonna you know

own this tribe and you have to go

2924
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:43,119
own this tribe and you have to go
 

2925
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,430
own this tribe and you have to go
if we do it that way then those tribes

2926
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:45,440
if we do it that way then those tribes
 

2927
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,349
if we do it that way then those tribes
basically failed and the tribes that's

2928
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
basically failed and the tribes that's
 

2929
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,349
basically failed and the tribes that's
that persisted and that have now given

rise to the modern homo sapiens are the

2932
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:51,599
rise to the modern homo sapiens are the
 

2933
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,910
rise to the modern homo sapiens are the
ones where respecting the fact that we

2934
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:53,920
ones where respecting the fact that we
 

2935
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,829
ones where respecting the fact that we
can kill each other from range

2936
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:55,839
can kill each other from range
 

2937
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,109
can kill each other from range
uh without heart like there's an

2938
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:57,119
uh without heart like there's an
 

2939
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,510
uh without heart like there's an
asymmetric ability to to snipe the

2940
00:47:59,510 --> 00:47:59,520
asymmetric ability to to snipe the
 

2941
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,829
asymmetric ability to to snipe the
leader from range that

2942
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:01,839
leader from range that
 

2943
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,829
leader from range that
meant that we sort of had to learn how

2944
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839
meant that we sort of had to learn how
 

2945
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,349
meant that we sort of had to learn how
to cooperate with each other right come

2946
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:05,359
to cooperate with each other right come
 

2947
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,470
to cooperate with each other right come
back here don't throw that rock at me

2948
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,480
back here don't throw that rock at me
 

2949

let's talk our witnesses out so violence

2950
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:08,559
let's talk our witnesses out so violence
 

2951
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,390
let's talk our witnesses out so violence
is also part of collaboration the threat

2952
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,400
is also part of collaboration the threat
 

2953
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,150
is also part of collaboration the threat
of violence let's say

2954
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,160
of violence let's say
 

2955
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,549
of violence let's say
well the recognition i was maybe the

2956
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:14,559
well the recognition i was maybe the
 

2957
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,549
well the recognition i was maybe the
better way to put it is the recognition

2958
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
better way to put it is the recognition
 

2959
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,750
better way to put it is the recognition
that we have more to gain by working

2960
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,760
that we have more to gain by working
 

2961
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,950
that we have more to gain by working
together

2962
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
together
 

2963
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,670

than the prisoner's dilemma of both of

00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:21,680
than the prisoner's dilemma of both of
 

2965
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,430
than the prisoner's dilemma of both of
us defecting

so uh mutually assured destruction in

2968
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
so uh mutually assured destruction in
 

2969
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,430
so uh mutually assured destruction in
all his forms is part of this idea of

all his forms is part of this idea of
 

2971
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,510

talks about our nuclear piece right i
 

2975
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,790
talks about our nuclear piece right i
mean it kind of sucks with thousands of

you know we only fought proxy wars right

2984
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:39,680
you know we only fought proxy wars right
 

2985
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,270

you know giant you know guided missiles
 

2993
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,230
you know giant you know guided missiles
so the original nuclear weapon is a rock

2994
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:50,240
so the original nuclear weapon is a rock
 

2995
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,150
so the original nuclear weapon is a rock
that we learned how to throw essentially

2996
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,160
that we learned how to throw essentially

modeling certain aspects of economics he
was doing this and that's how he kind of

3064
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
was doing this and that's how he kind of
 

3065
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,309
was doing this and that's how he kind of
got in touch with us and so

3066
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
got in touch with us and so
 

3067

3131
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,589
weinstein for the first time as well
yeah i knew him before he got all famous

3132
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:11,599
yeah i knew him before he got all famous
 

3133
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,230
yeah i knew him before he got all famous
for unfortunate reasons i guess but uh

3134
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:14,240
for unfortunate reasons i guess but uh
 

3135
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,309
for unfortunate reasons i guess but uh
but but anyway we um

3136
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,319
but but anyway we um
 

3137
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,910
but but anyway we um
so we met then and kind of had a

3138
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:17,920
so we met then and kind of had a
 

3139
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,390
so we met then and kind of had a
friendship um you know throughout

3140
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400
friendship um you know throughout
 

3141
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,990
friendship um you know throughout
since then you have a depth of thinking

3142
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
since then you have a depth of thinking
 

3143
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,589
since then you have a depth of thinking
that uh kind of

3144
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:25,599
that uh kind of
 

3145
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,589
that uh kind of
runs with eric in terms of just thinking

3146
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:27,599
runs with eric in terms of just thinking
 

3147
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,190
runs with eric in terms of just thinking
about the world deeply and thinking

3148
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
about the world deeply and thinking
 

3149
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,670
about the world deeply and thinking
philosophically and then there's eric's

3150
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:31,680
philosophically and then there's eric's
 

3151
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,829
philosophically and then there's eric's
interest in programming i actually never

3152
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:34,839
interest in programming i actually never
 

3153
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,910
interest in programming i actually never
um you know he'll bring up programming

3154
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
um you know he'll bring up programming
 

3155
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,990
um you know he'll bring up programming
to me quite a bit as a metaphor for

3156
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:40,000
to me quite a bit as a metaphor for
 

3157
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,309
to me quite a bit as a metaphor for
stuff right but i never kind of pushed

3158
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:42,319
stuff right but i never kind of pushed
 

3159
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,309
stuff right but i never kind of pushed
the point of like

3160
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:44,319
the point of like
 

3161
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,750
the point of like
what's the nature of your interest in

3162
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:45,760
what's the nature of your interest in
 

3163
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,829
what's the nature of your interest in
programming i think you saw it probably

3164
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:47,839
programming i think you saw it probably
 

3165
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,150
programming i think you saw it probably
as a tool yeah absolutely the to

3166
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,160
as a tool yeah absolutely the to
 

3167
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,150
as a tool yeah absolutely the to
visualize to explore mathematics and

3168
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
visualize to explore mathematics and
 

3169
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,630
visualize to explore mathematics and
explore physics but and i was wondering

3170
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
explore physics but and i was wondering
 

3171
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,990
explore physics but and i was wondering
like what's the

3172
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
like what's the
 

3173
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,589
like what's the
his uh depth of interest and also his

3174
00:51:59,589 --> 00:51:59,599
his uh depth of interest and also his
 

3175
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,630
his uh depth of interest and also his
uh

3176
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:00,640

00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,280
vision for what programming
 

3179
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,829
vision for what programming
would look like in the future have you

3180
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:05,839
would look like in the future have you
 

3181
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,430
would look like in the future have you
have you had interaction with him like

3182
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
have you had interaction with him like
 

3183
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,109
have you had interaction with him like
discussion in the space of python no

discussion in the space of python no
 

3185
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,030
discussion in the space of python no
programming well um in the sense of

3186
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,040
programming well um in the sense of
 

3187
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,470
programming well um in the sense of
sometimes he asked me why is this stuff

3188
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
sometimes he asked me why is this stuff
 

3189
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,349
sometimes he asked me why is this stuff
still so hard

3190
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:15,359
still so hard
 

3191
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,390
still so hard
um

3192
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:16,400
um
 

3193
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,150
um
uh yeah you know everybody's a critic

3194
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,160
uh yeah you know everybody's a critic
 

3195
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,630
uh yeah you know everybody's a critic
but uh but actually no eric programming

3196
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
but uh but actually no eric programming
 

3197
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,870
but uh but actually no eric programming
i mean like yes yes well not programming

3198
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
i mean like yes yes well not programming
 

3199
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,069
i mean like yes yes well not programming
in general but certain things in the

3200
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:24,079
in general but certain things in the
 

3201
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,309
in general but certain things in the
python ecosystem

3202
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:26,319
python ecosystem
 

3203
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,549
python ecosystem
but he uh but he actually i think what i

3204
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:28,559
but he uh but he actually i think what i
 

3205
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,069
but he uh but he actually i think what i
find in listening some of his stuff is

3206
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
find in listening some of his stuff is
 

3207
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,190
find in listening some of his stuff is
that he does

3208
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
that he does
 

3209
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,109
that he does
use programming metaphors a lot right

3210
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
use programming metaphors a lot right
 

3211
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,270
use programming metaphors a lot right
he'll talk about apis or object oriented

3212
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:35,280
he'll talk about apis or object oriented
 

3213
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,870
he'll talk about apis or object oriented
and things like that so i think that's a

3214
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:36,880
and things like that so i think that's a
 

3215
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,150
and things like that so i think that's a
useful

3216
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,160
useful
 

3217
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,870
useful

again my cat i think can do a better job

3414
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160

of my two and they're both pretty clever

3416
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319
of my two and they're both pretty clever
 

3417
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,030
of my two and they're both pretty clever
so

3418
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,040
so
 

3419
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,710
so
i do think though back to my kind of

3420
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:58,720
i do think though back to my kind of
 

3421
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,870
i do think though back to my kind of
original point i think that it's not for

3422
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:00,880
original point i think that it's not for
 

3423
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,510
original point i think that it's not for
me it's not question at all that we will

3424
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520
me it's not question at all that we will
 

3425
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,910
me it's not question at all that we will
be able to create synthetic systems that

3426
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
be able to create synthetic systems that
 

3427
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,589
be able to create synthetic systems that
are able to do this

3428
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599
are able to do this
 

3429
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,589
are able to do this
um better than the human at an equal

3430
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
um better than the human at an equal
 

3431
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,829
um better than the human at an equal
level or better than the human mind it's

3432
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:11,839
level or better than the human mind it's
 

3433
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,510
level or better than the human mind it's
also for me

3434
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:13,520
also for me
 

3435
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,789
also for me
not a question

3436
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:14,799
not a question
 

3437
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,829
not a question
that we will be able to

3438
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:17,839
that we will be able to
 

3439
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,870
that we will be able to
put them alongside humans so that they

3440
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:20,880
put them alongside humans so that they
 

3441
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,430
put them alongside humans so that they
capture the full broad spectrum of what

3442
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:23,440
capture the full broad spectrum of what
 

3443
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,270
capture the full broad spectrum of what
we are seeing as well

3444
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:25,280
we are seeing as well
 

3445
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,829
we are seeing as well
and also looking at our responses

3446
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:27,839
and also looking at our responses
 

3447
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,190
and also looking at our responses
listening to our responses even maybe

3448
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
listening to our responses even maybe
 

3449
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,910
listening to our responses even maybe
measuring certain vital signs about us

3450
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:31,920
measuring certain vital signs about us
 

3451
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,390
measuring certain vital signs about us
so in this kind of sidecar mode a

3452
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:34,400
so in this kind of sidecar mode a
 

3453
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,670
so in this kind of sidecar mode a
greater intelligence could use us and

3454
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:37,680
greater intelligence could use us and
 

3455
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,870
greater intelligence could use us and
our whatever 80 years of life to train

3456
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:40,880
our whatever 80 years of life to train
 

3457
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,950
our whatever 80 years of life to train
itself up and then be a very good

3458
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
itself up and then be a very good
 

3459
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,750
itself up and then be a very good
simulacrum of us moving forward right

3460
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
simulacrum of us moving forward right
 

3461
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,630
simulacrum of us moving forward right
so

3462
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:46,640
so
 

3463
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,270
so
who is in the sidecar in that picture of

3464
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
who is in the sidecar in that picture of
 

3465
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,030
who is in the sidecar in that picture of
the future exactly is the

3466
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
the future exactly is the
 

3467
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,870
the future exactly is the
the baby version of our immortal selves

3468
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:52,880
the baby version of our immortal selves
 

3469
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,309
the baby version of our immortal selves
okay so

3470
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:54,319
okay so
 

3471
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,870
okay so
once the baby grows up is there any use

3472
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880
once the baby grows up is there any use
 

3473
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,910
once the baby grows up is there any use
for humans i think so

3474
00:56:59,910 --> 00:56:59,920
for humans i think so
 

3475
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,309
for humans i think so
i think that out of out of epistemic

3476
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:02,319
i think that out of out of epistemic
 

3477
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,069
i think that out of out of epistemic
humility we need to keep humans around

3478
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
humility we need to keep humans around
 

3479
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,430
humility we need to keep humans around
for a long time

3480
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
for a long time
 

3481
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,950
for a long time
and i would hope that anyone making

3482
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:06,960
and i would hope that anyone making
 

3483
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,950
and i would hope that anyone making
those systems would believe that to be

3484
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960
those systems would believe that to be
 

3485
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,829
those systems would believe that to be
true

3486
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:09,839
true
 

3487
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,990
true
out of epistemic humility what's the

3488
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,000
out of epistemic humility what's the
 

3489
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,910
out of epistemic humility what's the
nature of the humility that that we

3490
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:13,920
nature of the humility that that we
 

3491
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,309
nature of the humility that that we
don't know what we don't know

3492
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:16,319
don't know what we don't know
 

3493
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,870
don't know what we don't know
so we don't

3494
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:18,880

 

3495
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,470

right so we don't first i mean first we

3496
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:20,480
right so we don't first i mean first we
 

3497
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,630
right so we don't first i mean first we
have to build systems that that help us

3498
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640
have to build systems that that help us
 

3499
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,390
have to build systems that that help us
do the things that we do know about that

3500
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:24,400
do the things that we do know about that
 

3501
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,990
do the things that we do know about that
can then probe the unknowns that we know

3502
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,000
can then probe the unknowns that we know
 

3503
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,069
can then probe the unknowns that we know
about but the unknown unknowns we don't

3504
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:28,079
about but the unknown unknowns we don't
 

3505
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,069
about but the unknown unknowns we don't
know we could always know

3506
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079
know we could always know
 

3507
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,270
know we could always know
nature is the one thing that is

3508
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,280
nature is the one thing that is
 

3509
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,309
nature is the one thing that is
infinitely

3510
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:32,319
infinitely
 

3511
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,750
infinitely
able to surprise us

3512
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
able to surprise us
 

3513
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,510
able to surprise us
so we should keep biological humans

3514
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:35,520
so we should keep biological humans
 

3515
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,510
so we should keep biological humans
around for a very very very long time

3516
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,520
around for a very very very long time
 

3517
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,750
around for a very very very long time
even after our immortal selves have

3518
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:39,760
even after our immortal selves have
 

3519
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,069
even after our immortal selves have
transcended have gone off to explore

3520
00:57:42,069 --> 00:57:42,079
transcended have gone off to explore
 

3521
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,829
transcended have gone off to explore
other worlds gone to go communicate with

3522
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:43,839
other worlds gone to go communicate with
 

3523
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,109
other worlds gone to go communicate with
the life forms living in the sun or

3524
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:45,119
the life forms living in the sun or
 

3525
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,510
the life forms living in the sun or
whatever else so yeah um you know i

3526
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
whatever else so yeah um you know i
 

3527
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,470
whatever else so yeah um you know i
think that's

3528
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:48,480
think that's
 

3529
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,470
think that's
that's for me these are

3530
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:50,480
that's for me these are
 

3531
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,309
that's for me these are
these seem like things that are going to

3532
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:52,319
these seem like things that are going to
 

3533
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,230
these seem like things that are going to
happen like i don't really question that

3534
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,240

actually a sense of that generativity
 

3633
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,030
actually a sense of that generativity
when we can look at another person and

3634
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
when we can look at another person and
 

3635
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,030
when we can look at another person and
see that they can be something more

than
than they are and more than just what we

3640
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:39,280
than they are and more than just what we
 

3641
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,069
than they are and more than just what we
you know

3642
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079
you know
 

3643
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,069
you know
a pigeonhole we might stick them in we

3644
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:42,079
a pigeonhole we might stick them in we
 

3645

um voiced some concept of this that you

3650
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:47,680
um voiced some concept of this that you
 

3651
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,510
um voiced some concept of this that you
should see the grace of god in the other

3652
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:49,520
should see the grace of god in the other
 

3653

should see the grace of god in the other
person right they're they're made in the

3654
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:52,079
person right they're they're made in the
 

3655
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,630
person right they're they're made in the
spirit of of what you know the love that

3656
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:54,640
spirit of of what you know the love that
 

3657
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,390
spirit of of what you know the love that
god feels for his creation or her

3658
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:56,400
god feels for his creation or her
 

3659
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,870
god feels for his creation or her
creation and so i think this thing is

3660
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:58,880
creation and so i think this thing is
 

3661
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,870
creation and so i think this thing is
actually the root of it so i would say

3662
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:00,880
actually the root of it so i would say
 

3663
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,109
actually the root of it so i would say
before i don't think i don't think

know problem set
 

3699
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,750
know problem set
and i logged in and i saw that and i

3700
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:39,760
and i logged in and i saw that and i
 

3701

and i logged in and i saw that and i
just said son of a you know i just

the quad like
 

3709
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,630
the quad like
you know

3710
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,640
you know
 

3711
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,950
you know
it's not wrong and yet wtf right

3712

um so when you look at it that way it's
 

3715
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,750
um so when you look at it that way it's
like yeah okay non-equilibrium physics

3716
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:57,760
like yeah okay non-equilibrium physics
 

3717
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,950
like yeah okay non-equilibrium physics
is a thing

3718
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:58,960
is a thing
 

3719
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,870

3723
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,470

i would say that in the modern day human

3724
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:06,480
i would say that in the modern day human
 

3725
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,069
i would say that in the modern day human
condition

3726
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:08,079
condition
 

3727
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,109
condition
there's a lot of talk about freedom and

these things
 

3733
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:15,670
these things
but

3734
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:15,680
but
 

3735
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,190
but
that's a and that's very hegelian it's

3736
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,200
that's a and that's very hegelian it's
 

3737

of of the the individual as sacrosanct
but

3744
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:23,520
but
 

3745
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,510
but
it's not really couched i think the the

3746
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:25,520
it's not really couched i think the the
 

3747
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,349
it's not really couched i think the the
right way because it should be how do we

3748
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:27,359
right way because it should be how do we
 

3749
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:30,150
right way because it should be how do we
maximize people's ability to love each

3750
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
maximize people's ability to love each
 

3751
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,230
maximize people's ability to love each
other to love themselves first to love

3752
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,240
other to love themselves first to love
 

3753
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,190
other to love themselves first to love
each other their responsibilities to the

3754
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:35,200
each other their responsibilities to the
 

3755
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,470
each other their responsibilities to the
previous generation to the future

3756
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,480
previous generation to the future
 

3757
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,750
previous generation to the future
generations

3758
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
generations
 

3759
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,829
generations
those are the kinds of things that

3760
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:39,839
those are the kinds of things that
 

3761
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,589
those are the kinds of things that
should be our design criteria right

3762
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:41,599
should be our design criteria right
 

3763
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,950
should be our design criteria right
those should be

3764
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
those should be
 

3765
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,990
those should be
what we start with to then come up with

3766
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000
what we start with to then come up with
 

3767
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,069
what we start with to then come up with
the philosophies of self and of rights

3768
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:48,079
the philosophies of self and of rights
 

3769
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,870
the philosophies of self and of rights
and responsibilities um but that that

3770
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,880
and responsibilities um but that that
 

3771
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,309
and responsibilities um but that that
love being at the center of it i think

3772
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
love being at the center of it i think
 

3773
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,829
love being at the center of it i think
when we design systems for cognition

3774
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:55,839
when we design systems for cognition
 

3775
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,150
when we design systems for cognition
um it it should absolutely be built that

3776
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,160
um it it should absolutely be built that
 

3777
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,990
um it it should absolutely be built that
way i think if we simply focus on

3778
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
way i think if we simply focus on
 

3779
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,270
way i think if we simply focus on
efficiency

3780
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
efficiency
 

3781
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,430
efficiency
and productivity these kind of very uh

3782
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:03,440
and productivity these kind of very uh
 

3783
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,430
and productivity these kind of very uh
industrial era

3784
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,440
industrial era
 

3785
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,950
industrial era
you know all the things that marx had

3786
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:06,960
you know all the things that marx had
 

3787
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,349
you know all the things that marx had
issues with right those that's that's a

3788
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
issues with right those that's that's a
 

3789
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,670
issues with right those that's that's a
way to go and and really i think go off

3790
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:11,680
way to go and and really i think go off
 

3791
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,150
way to go and and really i think go off
the deep end in the wrong way so one of

3792
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:14,160
the deep end in the wrong way so one of
 

3793
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,349
the deep end in the wrong way so one of
the interesting consequences of

3794
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:17,359
the interesting consequences of
 

3795
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,990
the interesting consequences of
thinking of life in this hierarchical

3796
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
thinking of life in this hierarchical
 

3797
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,870
thinking of life in this hierarchical
way

3798
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:20,880
way
 

3799
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,870
way
of an individual human and then there's

3800
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:22,880
of an individual human and then there's
 

3801
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,950
of an individual human and then there's
groups in their societies

3802
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
groups in their societies
 

3803
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,309
groups in their societies
is uh

3804
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:26,319
is uh
 

3805
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,150
is uh
i believe that

3806
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,160
i believe that
 

3807
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,510
i believe that
you believe that corporations are people

3808
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:31,520
you believe that corporations are people
 

3809
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,510
you believe that corporations are people
so this is a this is a kind of a

3810
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:33,520
so this is a this is a kind of a
 

3811
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,029
so this is a this is a kind of a
politically

3812
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:35,039
politically
 

3813
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,270
politically
dense idea and all those kinds of things

3814
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:37,280
dense idea and all those kinds of things
 

3815
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,190
dense idea and all those kinds of things
if we just throw politics aside if we

3816
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,200
if we just throw politics aside if we
 

3817
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,109
if we just throw politics aside if we
throw all of that aside

3818
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,119
throw all of that aside
 

3819
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,190
throw all of that aside
in which sense do you believe that

3820
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
in which sense do you believe that
 

3821
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,390
in which sense do you believe that
corporations are people so um and how

3822
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
corporations are people so um and how
 

3823
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,549
corporations are people so um and how
does love connect to that right so the

3824
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:48,559
does love connect to that right so the
 

3825
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,990
does love connect to that right so the
belief is that groups of people

3826
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
belief is that groups of people
 

3827
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,549
belief is that groups of people
have some kind of higher level i would

3828
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:54,559
have some kind of higher level i would
 

3829
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,109
have some kind of higher level i would
say mesoscopic claim to agency i you

3830
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:57,119
say mesoscopic claim to agency i you
 

3831
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,510
say mesoscopic claim to agency i you
know so so where do i you know

3832

know so so where do i you know
 

3833
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,190
know so so where do i you know
let's let's start with this most people

01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:01,200
let's let's start with this most people
 

3835
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,510

large large scale nations have
 

3843
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,109
large large scale nations have
rights to sovereignty and agency like

3844
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:13,119
rights to sovereignty and agency like
 

3845
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,029
rights to sovereignty and agency like
everyone plays the game of modernity as

groups of people

3854
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
groups of people
 

3855
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,990
groups of people
at a smaller level than that

3856
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,000
at a smaller level than that
 

3857
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,950
at a smaller level than that
um

3858
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
um
 

3859
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,789
um
like a family unit is the thing well in

3860
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
like a family unit is the thing well in
 

3861
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,710
like a family unit is the thing well in
our law in our laws we actually do

3862
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
our law in our laws we actually do
 

3863
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,470
our law in our laws we actually do
encode this concept

3864
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:30,480
encode this concept
 

3865
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,750
encode this concept
i believe that

3866
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
i believe that
 

3867
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,670
i believe that
in a relationship in a marriage right

3868
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:33,680
in a relationship in a marriage right
 

3869
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,829
in a relationship in a marriage right
one partner can sue

3870
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:35,839
one partner can sue
 

3871
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,910
one partner can sue
for loss of consortium right if someone

3872
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
for loss of consortium right if someone
 

3873
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,990
for loss of consortium right if someone
breaks up the marriage or whatever so

3874
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:40,000
breaks up the marriage or whatever so
 

3875
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,510
breaks up the marriage or whatever so
these are concepts that even in law we

3876
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
these are concepts that even in law we
 

3877
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,750
these are concepts that even in law we
do respect there is something about the

3878
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:43,760
do respect there is something about the
 

3879
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,109
do respect there is something about the
union and about the family so for me i

3880
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:47,119
union and about the family so for me i
 

3881
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,710
union and about the family so for me i
don't think it's so weird to think that

3882
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:48,720
don't think it's so weird to think that
 

3883
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,390
don't think it's so weird to think that
groups of people have

3884
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:50,400
groups of people have
 

3885
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,750
groups of people have
a right to

3886
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:51,760
a right to
 

3887
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,829
a right to
a claim to rights and sovereignty of

3888
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:53,839
a claim to rights and sovereignty of
 

3889
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,470
a claim to rights and sovereignty of
some degree i mean we and we

3890
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:56,480
some degree i mean we and we
 

3891
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,870
some degree i mean we and we
uh look at our clubs we look at churches

3892
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:58,880
uh look at our clubs we look at churches
 

3893
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,630
uh look at our clubs we look at churches
these are we we talk about these

3894
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:00,640
these are we we talk about these
 

3895
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,950
these are we we talk about these
collectives of people as if they have a

3896
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
collectives of people as if they have a
 

3897
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,990
collectives of people as if they have a
real agency to them and then they do but

3898
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
real agency to them and then they do but
 

3899
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,230
real agency to them and then they do but
i think if we take that one step further

3900
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,240
i think if we take that one step further
 

3901
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,150
i think if we take that one step further
and say okay they can accrue resources

3902
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:10,160
and say okay they can accrue resources
 

3903
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,950
and say okay they can accrue resources
well yes check you know by law they can

3904
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:12,960
well yes check you know by law they can
 

3905
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,829
well yes check you know by law they can
um they can own land they can

3906
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:15,839
um they can own land they can
 

3907
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,349
um they can own land they can
engage in contracts they can do all

3908
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:17,359
engage in contracts they can do all
 

3909
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,230
engage in contracts they can do all
these different kinds of things so we in

3910
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:20,240
these different kinds of things so we in
 

3911
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,549
these different kinds of things so we in
legal terms uh support this idea that

3912
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:22,559
legal terms uh support this idea that
 

3913
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,069
legal terms uh support this idea that
groups of people have rights

3914
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:26,079
groups of people have rights
 

3915
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,950
groups of people have rights
where we go wrong on this stuff is that

3916
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:28,960
where we go wrong on this stuff is that
 

3917
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,670
where we go wrong on this stuff is that
the most popular version of this is the

3918
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:31,680
the most popular version of this is the
 

3919
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,270
the most popular version of this is the
for-profit absentee owner corporation

3920
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:35,280
for-profit absentee owner corporation
 

3921
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,270
for-profit absentee owner corporation
that then is able to amass larger

3922
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:37,280
that then is able to amass larger
 

3923
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,430
that then is able to amass larger
resources than anyone else in the

3924
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:39,440
resources than anyone else in the
 

3925
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,430
resources than anyone else in the
landscape anything else any other entity

3926
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:41,440
landscape anything else any other entity
 

3927
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,950
landscape anything else any other entity
of equivalent size

3928
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
of equivalent size
 

3929
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,390
of equivalent size
and they're able to essentially bully

3930
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:44,400
and they're able to essentially bully
 

3931
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,150
and they're able to essentially bully
around individuals whether it's laborers

3932
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160
around individuals whether it's laborers
 

3933
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,589
around individuals whether it's laborers
whether it's people whose resources they

3934
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:47,599
whether it's people whose resources they
 

3935
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:48,789
whether it's people whose resources they
want to capture

3936
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:48,799
want to capture
 

3937
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,470
want to capture
they're also able to bully around our

3938
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:50,480
they're also able to bully around our
 

3939
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,190
they're also able to bully around our
system of representation which is still

3940
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,200
system of representation which is still
 

3941
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,510
system of representation which is still
tied to individuals right

3942
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:55,520
tied to individuals right
 

3943
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,549
tied to individuals right
so

3944
01:04:56,549 --> 01:04:56,559
so
 

3945
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,470
so
um i don't believe that's correct i

3946
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:58,480
um i don't believe that's correct i
 

3947
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,029
um i don't believe that's correct i
don't think it's good that they you know

3948
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:01,039
don't think it's good that they you know
 

3949
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,230
don't think it's good that they you know
they're people but they're i

3950
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,240
they're people but they're i
 

3951
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,510
they're people but they're i
don't think that corporations as people

3952
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:03,520
don't think that corporations as people
 

3953
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,510
don't think that corporations as people
acting like is a good thing but

3954
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,520
acting like is a good thing but
 

3955
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,789
acting like is a good thing but
the idea that collectives and

3956
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:06,799
the idea that collectives and
 

3957
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,390
the idea that collectives and
collections of people

3958
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
collections of people
 

3959
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,190
collections of people
that we should treat them

3960
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:09,200
that we should treat them
 

3961
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,349
that we should treat them
philosophically as having

3962
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:11,359
philosophically as having
 

3963
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,150
philosophically as having
some

3964
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
some
 

3965
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,270
some
agency some agency and some some mass

3966
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:15,280
agency some agency and some some mass
 

3967
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,270
agency some agency and some some mass
at a mesoscopic level i think that's an

3968
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:17,280
at a mesoscopic level i think that's an
 

3969
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,870
at a mesoscopic level i think that's an
important thing because one one thing i

3970
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:18,880
important thing because one one thing i
 

3971
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,990
important thing because one one thing i
do

3972
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,000
do
 

3973
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,710
do
think

3974
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:20,720
think
 

3975
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,109
think
we under-appreciate sometimes is

3976
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,119
we under-appreciate sometimes is
 

3977
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,789
we under-appreciate sometimes is
the fact that relationships have

3978
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
the fact that relationships have
 

3979
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,549
the fact that relationships have
relationships so it's not just

3980
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:26,559
relationships so it's not just
 

3981
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:27,910
relationships so it's not just
individuals having relationships with

3982
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:27,920
individuals having relationships with
 

3983
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,950
individuals having relationships with
each other

3984
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:28,960
each other
 

3985
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,789
each other
but if you have eight people seated

3986
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:30,799
but if you have eight people seated
 

3987
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,630
but if you have eight people seated
around a table right each person has a

3988
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
around a table right each person has a
 

3989
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,069
around a table right each person has a
relationship with each of the others and

3990
01:05:34,069 --> 01:05:34,079
relationship with each of the others and
 

3991
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,789
relationship with each of the others and
that's obvious but then if it's four

3992
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
that's obvious but then if it's four
 

3993
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,029
that's obvious but then if it's four
couples each couple also has a

3994
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:39,039
couples each couple also has a
 

3995
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,230
couples each couple also has a
relationship with each of the other

3996
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,240
relationship with each of the other
 

3997
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,349
relationship with each of the other
couples

3998
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:41,359
couples
 

3999
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,670
couples
right the dyads do and if it's couples

4000
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:43,680
right the dyads do and if it's couples
 

4001
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,829
right the dyads do and if it's couples
but one is the the you know father

4002
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
but one is the the you know father
 

4003
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,309
but one is the the you know father
mother older and then you know one of

4004
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
mother older and then you know one of
 

4005
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,270
mother older and then you know one of
their children and their spouse

4006
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
their children and their spouse
 

4007
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,349
their children and their spouse
that that family unit of four has a

4008
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:53,359
that that family unit of four has a
 

4009
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,789
that that family unit of four has a
relationship with the other family unit

4010
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:54,799
relationship with the other family unit
 

4011
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,870
relationship with the other family unit
of four so the idea that relationships

4012
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:56,880
of four so the idea that relationships
 

4013
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,390
of four so the idea that relationships
have relationships is something that we

4014
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,400

01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,110
here the less present you are the more
of them you can do but then the less

4335
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,070
without having to spend 10 years you
know figuring all this stuff out

4336
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:20,080
know figuring all this stuff out
 

4337
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,669

together we just read each other's thing

4338
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:21,679
together we just read each other's thing
 

4339
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,830
together we just read each other's thing
and be like oh yeah this guy's exactly

4340
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
and be like oh yeah this guy's exactly
 

4341

in my wheelhouse and vice versa and we

4342
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:26,320
in my wheelhouse and vice versa and we
 

4343
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,229
in my wheelhouse and vice versa and we
can then um

4344
01:11:28,229 --> 01:11:28,239
can then um
 

4345
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,310
can then um
you know connect just a few times a year

4346
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:30,320
you know connect just a few times a year
 

4347
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,070
you know connect just a few times a year
and maintain a high trust

4348
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
and maintain a high trust
 

4349
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,149
and maintain a high trust
relationship it can expand a little bit

4350
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,159
relationship it can expand a little bit
 

4351
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,070
relationship it can expand a little bit
but it also requires these things are

4352
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:36,080
but it also requires these things are
 

4353
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,590
but it also requires these things are
not all technological nature it requires

4354
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
not all technological nature it requires
 

4355
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,910
not all technological nature it requires
the individual themselves to have a

4356

01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,390
certain level of capacity
to have a certain lack of neuroticism

4360
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:44,400
to have a certain lack of neuroticism
 

4361
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,229
to have a certain lack of neuroticism
right if you want to use like the ocean

4362
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:46,239
right if you want to use like the ocean
 

4363

right if you want to use like the ocean
big five sort of model

4364
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:47,920
big five sort of model
 

4365
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,669
big five sort of model
people have been pretty centered the

4366
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:49,679
people have been pretty centered the
 

4367
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,950
people have been pretty centered the
less centered you are the fewer

4368
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:50,960
less centered you are the fewer
 

4369
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,229
less centered you are the fewer
authentic connections you can really

4370
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:52,239
authentic connections you can really
 

4371
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,630
authentic connections you can really
build for a particular unit of time

4372
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
build for a particular unit of time
 

4373
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,070
build for a particular unit of time
it just takes more time other people

4374
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:56,080
it just takes more time other people
 

4375
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,189
it just takes more time other people
have to put up with your crap like

4376
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:57,199
have to put up with your crap like
 

4377
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,310
have to put up with your crap like
there's a lot of the stuff that you have

4378
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
there's a lot of the stuff that you have
 

4379
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,110
there's a lot of the stuff that you have
to deal with if you are not so well

4380
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:01,120
to deal with if you are not so well
 

4381
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,149
to deal with if you are not so well
balanced right so yes we can help people

4382
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:04,159
balanced right so yes we can help people
 

4383
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,350
balanced right so yes we can help people
get better to where they can develop

4384
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360
get better to where they can develop
 

4385
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,110
get better to where they can develop
more relationships faster and then you

4386
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:07,120
more relationships faster and then you
 

4387
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,870
more relationships faster and then you
can maybe expand dunbar number by quite

4388
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:08,880
can maybe expand dunbar number by quite
 

4389
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,550
can maybe expand dunbar number by quite
a bit but you're not going to do it i

4390
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:10,560
a bit but you're not going to do it i
 

4391
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,709
a bit but you're not going to do it i
think it's be hard to get it beyond 10x

4392
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:12,719
think it's be hard to get it beyond 10x
 

4393
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,030
think it's be hard to get it beyond 10x
kind of the rough swag of what it is

4394
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:15,040
kind of the rough swag of what it is
 

4395
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,149
kind of the rough swag of what it is
you know

4396
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:16,159
you know
 

4397
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:16,950
you know
well

4398
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:16,960
well
 

4399
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,709
well
don't you think

4400
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:18,719
don't you think
 

4401
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,110
don't you think
that ai systems could be an addition to

4402
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,120
that ai systems could be an addition to
 

4403
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,470
that ai systems could be an addition to
dunbar's number

4404
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,480
dunbar's number
 

4405
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,310
dunbar's number
so like why do you count as one system

4406
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:24,320
so like why do you count as one system
 

4407
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,070
so like why do you count as one system
or multiple ai systems multiple ai

4408
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
or multiple ai systems multiple ai
 

4409
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,709
or multiple ai systems multiple ai
systems so i do believe that ai systems

4410
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:28,719
systems so i do believe that ai systems
 

4411
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,470
systems so i do believe that ai systems
for them to integrate into human society

4412
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
for them to integrate into human society
 

4413
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,070
for them to integrate into human society
as it is now have to have a sense of

4414
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,080
as it is now have to have a sense of
 

4415
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,990
as it is now have to have a sense of
agency so there has to be a

4416
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,000
agency so there has to be a
 

4417
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,110
agency so there has to be a
individual

4418
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:35,120
individual
 

4419
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,870
individual
because otherwise we wouldn't relate to

01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:39,520
them we could engage certain kinds of
 

4423
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,510
them we could engage certain kinds of
individuals to make sense of them for us

4424
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
individuals to make sense of them for us
 

4425
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,430
individuals to make sense of them for us
and be almost like did you ever watch uh

making first contact with the super
 

4493
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,590
making first contact with the super
intelligence we're already there we do

4494
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
intelligence we're already there we do
 

4495
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,189
intelligence we're already there we do
it pretty poorly and if you look at the

4496
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:45,199
it pretty poorly and if you look at the
 

4497
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,669
it pretty poorly and if you look at the
gradient of power and money what happens

4498
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
gradient of power and money what happens
 

4499
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:48,790
gradient of power and money what happens
is the people closest to it will

4500
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:48,800
is the people closest to it will
 

4501
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,870
is the people closest to it will
absolutely exploit their distance

4502
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:50,880
absolutely exploit their distance
 

4503
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,550
absolutely exploit their distance
for

4504
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
for
 

4505
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,229
for
personal financial gain

4506
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
personal financial gain
 

4507
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,149
personal financial gain
so we should look at that and be like oh

4508
01:13:56,149 --> 01:13:56,159
so we should look at that and be like oh
 

4509
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:57,110
so we should look at that and be like oh
well that's probably what the future

4510
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
well that's probably what the future
 

4511
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,110
well that's probably what the future
will look like as well

4512
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,120
will look like as well
 

4513
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,390
will look like as well
um but nonetheless i mean we're already

4514
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
um but nonetheless i mean we're already
 

4515
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,510
um but nonetheless i mean we're already
doing this kind of thing so in the

4516
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:01,520
doing this kind of thing so in the
 

4517
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,149
doing this kind of thing so in the
future we can have ai systems but you're

4518
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159
future we can have ai systems but you're
 

4519
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,750
future we can have ai systems but you're
still gonna have to trust people to

4520
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
still gonna have to trust people to
 

4521
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,229
still gonna have to trust people to
bridge the sense making gap to them

4522
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:08,239
bridge the sense making gap to them
 

4523
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,310
bridge the sense making gap to them
see i don't i just feel like there could

4524
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
see i don't i just feel like there could
 

4525
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,110
see i don't i just feel like there could
be of like millions of ai systems that

4526
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
be of like millions of ai systems that
 

4527
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,270
be of like millions of ai systems that
have

4528
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:15,280
have
 

4529
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,910
have
have agencies you have when you say one

4530
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:17,920
have agencies you have when you say one
 

4531
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,229

4539
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,470

but there's some aspect of human-like

4540
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,480
but there's some aspect of human-like
 

4541
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,070
but there's some aspect of human-like

more referring to things that you

4552
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:42,320
more referring to things that you
 

4553
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,390
more referring to things that you
interact with on the intellectual level

4554

interact with on the intellectual level
 

4555
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,350

yeah and that i think requires there has

4556
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
yeah and that i think requires there has
 

4557
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,270
yeah and that i think requires there has
to be a backstory there has to be a

4558
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,280
to be a backstory there has to be a
 

4559
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,270
to be a backstory there has to be a
personality i believe it has to fear its

4560
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:51,280
personality i believe it has to fear its
 

4561
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,669
personality i believe it has to fear its
own mortality in a genuine way like

4562
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:53,679
own mortality in a genuine way like
 

4563
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:55,669
own mortality in a genuine way like
there has to be

4564
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:55,679
there has to be
 

4565
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:56,470
there has to be
all

4566
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,480
all
 

4567
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,470
all
many of the elements that we humans

4568
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480
many of the elements that we humans
 

4569
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,550
many of the elements that we humans
experience that are fundamental to the

4570
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:00,560
experience that are fundamental to the
 

4571
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,630
experience that are fundamental to the
human condition because otherwise we

4572
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:02,640
human condition because otherwise we
 

4573
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,669
human condition because otherwise we
would not have a deep connection with it

4574
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:05,679
would not have a deep connection with it
 

4575
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:06,630
would not have a deep connection with it
but i don't think having a deep

4576
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:06,640
but i don't think having a deep
 

4577
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,790
but i don't think having a deep
connection with it is necessarily going

4578
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:08,800
connection with it is necessarily going
 

4579
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,550
connection with it is necessarily going
to stop us from building a thing that

4580
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,560
to stop us from building a thing that
 

4581
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,149
to stop us from building a thing that
has quite an alien intelligence aspect

4582
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
has quite an alien intelligence aspect
 

4583
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:12,950
has quite an alien intelligence aspect
sure

4584
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:12,960
sure
 

4585
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,110
sure
um so another now the other kind of

4586
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
um so another now the other kind of
 

4587
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,709
um so another now the other kind of
alien intelligence on this planet is

4588
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:16,719
alien intelligence on this planet is
 

4589
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,790
alien intelligence on this planet is
octopuses or octopates or whatever you

4590
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:18,800
octopuses or octopates or whatever you
 

4591
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,070
octopuses or octopates or whatever you
want to call them

4592
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:20,080
want to call them
 

4593
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,669
want to call them
octopi yeah there's a there's a little

4594
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:21,679
octopi yeah there's a there's a little
 

4595
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,350
octopi yeah there's a there's a little
controversy as to what the plural is i

4596
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
controversy as to what the plural is i
 

4597
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,830
controversy as to what the plural is i
guess but

4598
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840

 

4599
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,110

an octopus

4600
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
an octopus
 

4601
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:29,910
an octopus
um

4602
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:29,920
um
 

4603
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,510
um
you know it really acts as a collective

4604
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:31,520
you know it really acts as a collective
 

4605
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,830
you know it really acts as a collective
intelligence of eight intelligent arms

4606
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
intelligence of eight intelligent arms
 

4607
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,270
intelligence of eight intelligent arms
right its arms have a tremendous amount

4608
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
right its arms have a tremendous amount
 

4609
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,870
right its arms have a tremendous amount
of neural density to them

4610
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:36,880
of neural density to them
 

4611
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,750
of neural density to them
and

4612
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:37,760
and
 

4613
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,270
and
i see

4614
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
i see
 

4615
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,950
i see
if we can build i mean just let's let's

4616
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:40,960
if we can build i mean just let's let's
 

4617
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,950
if we can build i mean just let's let's
go with what you're saying if we build a

4618
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:42,960
go with what you're saying if we build a
 

4619
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,430
go with what you're saying if we build a
singular intelligence that interfaces

4620
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
singular intelligence that interfaces
 

4621
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,910
singular intelligence that interfaces
with humans that has a sense of agency

4622
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:47,920
with humans that has a sense of agency
 

4623
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,669
with humans that has a sense of agency
so it can run the cybernetic loop and

4624
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:49,679
so it can run the cybernetic loop and
 

4625
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,110
so it can run the cybernetic loop and
develop its own theory of mind as well

4626
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:51,120
develop its own theory of mind as well
 

4627
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,110
develop its own theory of mind as well
as it's a theory of action all these

4628
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:53,120
as it's a theory of action all these
 

4629
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,030
as it's a theory of action all these
things i agree with you that that's

4630
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:55,040
things i agree with you that that's
 

4631
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,709
things i agree with you that that's
the necessary components to build a real

4632
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:56,719
the necessary components to build a real
 

4633
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,990
the necessary components to build a real
intelligence right there's got to be

4634
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,000
intelligence right there's got to be
 

4635
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,110
intelligence right there's got to be
something at stake it's got to make a

4636
01:15:59,110 --> 01:15:59,120
something at stake it's got to make a
 

4637
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,870
something at stake it's got to make a
decision it's got to then run the ooda

4638
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:00,880
decision it's got to then run the ooda
 

4639
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,870
decision it's got to then run the ooda
loop okay so we build one of those well

4640
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:02,880
loop okay so we build one of those well
 

4641
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,830
loop okay so we build one of those well
if we can build one of those we'll

4642
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:03,840
if we can build one of those we'll
 

4643
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,590
if we can build one of those we'll
probably build 5 million of them so

4644
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:05,600
probably build 5 million of them so
 

4645
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,270
probably build 5 million of them so
build five million of them

4646
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:07,280
build five million of them
 

4647
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,790
build five million of them
and if their cognitive systems are

4648
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,800
and if their cognitive systems are
 

4649
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,189
and if their cognitive systems are
already digitized and already kind of

4650
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:11,199
already digitized and already kind of
 

4651
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,110
already digitized and already kind of

01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,120
uh dynamics that we can't see in the
 

4673
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,470
uh dynamics that we can't see in the
same way that a phased array radar right

4674
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:32,480
same way that a phased array radar right
 

4675
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,590
same way that a phased array radar right
you think about how phase phase-to-radar

4676
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:33,600
you think about how phase phase-to-radar
 

4677
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,149
you think about how phase phase-to-radar
works it's just sensitivity

4678
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
works it's just sensitivity
 

4679
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,149
works it's just sensitivity
it's just radars and then it's

4680
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:38,159
it's just radars and then it's
 

4681
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:39,910
it's just radars and then it's
hypersensitivity and really great timing

4682
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:39,920
hypersensitivity and really great timing
 

4683
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,830
hypersensitivity and really great timing

between all of them and with a flat
 

4685
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,590

array it's as good as a curved radar

4686
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:43,600
array it's as good as a curved radar
 

4687
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,590
array it's as good as a curved radar
dish right so with these things it's a

4688
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:45,600
dish right so with these things it's a
 

4689
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,590

high school we can implant those
 

4737
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,270
high school we can implant those
memories if that's really needed but no

4738
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:33,280
memories if that's really needed but no
 

4739
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,110

no no but the central agency like i

4740
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:35,120
no no but the central agency like i

intelligence to be born you have to have
 

4745
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,669
intelligence to be born you have to have
uh a decentralization

4746
01:17:43,669 --> 01:17:43,679
uh a decentralization
 

4747
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:47,189
uh a decentralization
like each one has to struggle and reach

4748
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:47,199
like each one has to struggle and reach
 

4749
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,790
like each one has to struggle and reach
so each one

4750
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:48,800
so each one
 

4751
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,950
so each one
in excess of energy has to reach for

4752
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:50,960
in excess of energy has to reach for
 

4753
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,590
in excess of energy has to reach for
order as opposed to a central place

order as opposed to a central place
doing so have you ever read like some

4756
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
doing so have you ever read like some
 

4757
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:58,149
doing so have you ever read like some
sci-fi where um there's like hive minds

4758
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
sci-fi where um there's like hive minds
 

4759
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,630
sci-fi where um there's like hive minds
uh like the vern revenge i think has one

4760
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:00,640
uh like the vern revenge i think has one
 

4761
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,390
uh like the vern revenge i think has one
of these and then um some of the stuff

4762
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:02,400
of these and then um some of the stuff
 

4763
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,590
of these and then um some of the stuff
from um

4764
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
from um
 

4765
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,510
from um
yes on the commonwealth saga the idea

4766
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:05,520
yes on the commonwealth saga the idea
 

4767
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,189
yes on the commonwealth saga the idea
that uh you're an individual but you're

4768
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:07,199
that uh you're an individual but you're
 

4769
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:08,709
that uh you're an individual but you're
connected with like a few other

4770
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
connected with like a few other
 

4771
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,390
connected with like a few other
individuals telepathically as well and

4772
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:10,400
individuals telepathically as well and
 

4773
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,470
individuals telepathically as well and
together you form a swarm

4774
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:12,480
together you form a swarm
 

4775
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,030
together you form a swarm
so if you are i'd ask you what do you

4776
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:15,040
so if you are i'd ask you what do you
 

4777
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,750
so if you are i'd ask you what do you
think it is the experience of if you are

4778
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
think it is the experience of if you are
 

4779
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,910
think it is the experience of if you are
like well a borg right if you are

4780
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:19,920
like well a borg right if you are
 

4781
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,550
like well a borg right if you are
one if you're part of this hive mind

4782
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:22,560
one if you're part of this hive mind
 

4783
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,990
one if you're part of this hive mind

internally what is your experience like

01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:28,159
internally what is your experience like
 

4789
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,430
internally what is your experience like
because i have a theory as to what that

4790
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:29,440
because i have a theory as to what that
 

4791
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,550
because i have a theory as to what that
looks like

4792
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,560
looks like
 

4793
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,350
looks like
the

4794
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:31,360
the
 

4795
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,030
the
one question i have for you about that

4796
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:33,040
one question i have for you about that
 

4797
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,229
one question i have for you about that
experience is

4798
01:18:34,229 --> 01:18:34,239
experience is
 

4799
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,950
experience is
how much is there a feeling of freedom

4800
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:36,960
how much is there a feeling of freedom
 

4801
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,350
how much is there a feeling of freedom
of free will because i obviously as a

4802
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:41,360
of free will because i obviously as a
 

4803
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,189
of free will because i obviously as a
human very biased

4804
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:43,199
human very biased
 

4805
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,110
human very biased
but also somebody who values freedom and

4806
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:45,120
but also somebody who values freedom and
 

4807
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,310
but also somebody who values freedom and
biased it feels like the experience of

4808
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:48,320
biased it feels like the experience of
 

4809
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,709
biased it feels like the experience of
freedom is essential for

4810
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:50,719
freedom is essential for
 

4811
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,709
freedom is essential for
um

4812
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:52,719
um

um
trying stuff out to being to being

4814
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,280
trying stuff out to being to being
 

4815
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,350
trying stuff out to being to being
creative and doing something truly novel

4816
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,360
creative and doing something truly novel
 

4817
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,110
creative and doing something truly novel
which is at the core of

4818
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
which is at the core of
 

4819
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,390
which is at the core of
yeah well i don't think you have to lose

4820
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
yeah well i don't think you have to lose
 

4821
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,910
yeah well i don't think you have to lose
any freedom when you're in that mode

4822
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:01,920
any freedom when you're in that mode
 

4823
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,470
any freedom when you're in that mode
because i think what happens is we think

4824
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,480
because i think what happens is we think
 

4825
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,910
because i think what happens is we think
we still think and i mean you're still

4826
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:05,920
we still think and i mean you're still
 

4827
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,590
we still think and i mean you're still
thinking about this in a sense of a

4828
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:07,600
thinking about this in a sense of a
 

4829
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,590
thinking about this in a sense of a
top-down command and control hierarchy

4830
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:09,600
top-down command and control hierarchy
 

4831
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,149
top-down command and control hierarchy
which is not what it has to be at all

4832
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:12,159
which is not what it has to be at all
 

4833
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,149
which is not what it has to be at all
i think the experience so i'll just you

4834
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:14,159
i think the experience so i'll just you
 

4835
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,189
i think the experience so i'll just you
know

4836
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:15,199
know
 

4837
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,550
know
show my cards here i think the

4838
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:16,560
show my cards here i think the
 

4839
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,149
show my cards here i think the
experience of being a robot in that

4840
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:18,159
experience of being a robot in that
 

4841
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,510
experience of being a robot in that
robot swarm

4842
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,520
robot swarm
 

4843
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,750
robot swarm
a robot who has agency over their own

4844
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
a robot who has agency over their own
 

4845
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,430
a robot who has agency over their own
local environment that's doing sense

mind
 

4851
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,310
mind
um i think that robot's experience would

4852
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,320
um i think that robot's experience would
 

4853
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,110
um i think that robot's experience would
be

4854
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120
be
 

4855
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,030
be
one of when the hive mind is working

4856
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:31,040
one of when the hive mind is working
 

4857
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:31,830
one of when the hive mind is working
well

4858
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:31,840
well
 

4859
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,830
well
it would be an experience of like

4860
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:33,840
it would be an experience of like
 

4861
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,669
it would be an experience of like

feeling of serendipity i feel like um

4924
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
feeling of serendipity i feel like um
 

4925
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,950
feeling of serendipity i feel like um
this is a bit of a flight of fancy but

4926
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:32,960
this is a bit of a flight of fancy but
 

4927
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,030
this is a bit of a flight of fancy but
every cell in your body

4928
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,040
every cell in your body
 

4929
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,550
every cell in your body
must have like what does it feel like to

4930
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,560
must have like what does it feel like to
 

4931
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,629
must have like what does it feel like to
be a cell in your body when it needs

4932
01:20:38,629 --> 01:20:38,639
be a cell in your body when it needs
 

4933
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:40,870
be a cell in your body when it needs
sugar there's sugar when it is oxygen

4934
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:40,880
sugar there's sugar when it is oxygen
 

4935
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,709
sugar there's sugar when it is oxygen
there's just oxygen now when it needs to

4936
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:42,719
there's just oxygen now when it needs to
 

4937
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:45,030
there's just oxygen now when it needs to
go and do its work and pull like as one

4938
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,040
go and do its work and pull like as one
 

4939
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,629
go and do its work and pull like as one
of your muscle fibers right

4940
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:46,639
of your muscle fibers right
 

4941
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:47,990
of your muscle fibers right
it does its work

4942
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,000
it does its work
 

4943
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,350
it does its work
and it's great it contributes to the

4944
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:49,360
and it's great it contributes to the
 

4945
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,430
and it's great it contributes to the
cause right so this is all again a

4946
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:51,440
cause right so this is all again a
 

4947
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,590
cause right so this is all again a
flight of fancy but i think as we

4948
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,600
flight of fancy but i think as we
 

4949
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,270
flight of fancy but i think as we
extrapolate up what does it feel like to

4950
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:55,280
extrapolate up what does it feel like to
 

4951
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,430
extrapolate up what does it feel like to
be an independent individual with some

be an independent individual with some
bounded sense of freedom all sense of

01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,120
bounded sense of freedom all sense of
 

4955
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,390
bounded sense of freedom all sense of
freedom is actually bounded but it with

4956
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:00,400
freedom is actually bounded but it with
 

4957
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,229
freedom is actually bounded but it with
about a sense of freedom that still

4958
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:02,239
about a sense of freedom that still
 

4959
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,629
about a sense of freedom that still
lives within a network that has order to

01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:04,639
lives within a network that has order to
 

4961
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:05,910
lives within a network that has order to

it and i feel like it has to be a
 

4963
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,310
it and i feel like it has to be a
feeling of serendipity so the cell

4964
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:08,320
feeling of serendipity so the cell
 

4965
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,149
feeling of serendipity so the cell
there's a feeling of serendipity even

4966
01:21:10,149 --> 01:21:10,159
there's a feeling of serendipity even
 

4967
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:11,110
there's a feeling of serendipity even
though

4968
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:11,120
though
 

4969
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,550
though
it has no way of explaining why it's

4970
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:12,560

you're doing this you are actually i
guess where the the the demo of this is

5050
01:22:32,629 --> 01:22:32,639
guess where the the the demo of this is
 

5051
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:33,510
guess where the the the demo of this is
that

5052
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:33,520
that
 

5053
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,750
that
we are already intelligent agents

we are already intelligent agents
 

5055
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,550
we are already intelligent agents
in such a system right in that one of

online collaborative environment and
 

5089
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,750
online collaborative environment and
collaborative sense making system it's

5090
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:05,760
collaborative sense making system it's
 

5091
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,470
collaborative sense making system it's
not very good yet it's got the overhangs

5092
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,480
not very good yet it's got the overhangs
 

5093
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,030
not very good yet it's got the overhangs
of zombie sense-making institutions all

5094
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,040
of zombie sense-making institutions all
 

5095
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,510

01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:13,520
over it but as that washes away and as
 

5097
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,430
over it but as that washes away and as
we get better at this

5098
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:15,440
we get better at this
 

5099
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,550
we get better at this
we are going to see humanity improving

5100
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:18,560
we are going to see humanity improving
 

5101
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,510
we are going to see humanity improving
at speeds that um are unthinkable in the

01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
at speeds that um are unthinkable in the
 

5103
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,790
at speeds that um are unthinkable in the

01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,510
freedoms were limited in fact the open
source when we started this with open

5108
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:25,520
source when we started this with open
 

5109
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,669
source when we started this with open
source software right the collaboration

5110
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
source software right the collaboration
 

5111
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,590
source software right the collaboration
what the internet surfaced was the

5112
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:29,600
what the internet surfaced was the
 

5113
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,350
what the internet surfaced was the
ability for people all over the world to

5114
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,360
ability for people all over the world to
 

5115
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,950
ability for people all over the world to
collaborate and produce some of the most

5116
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:32,960
collaborate and produce some of the most
 

5117
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,950
collaborate and produce some of the most
foundational software that's in use

5118
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:34,960
foundational software that's in use
 

5119
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,790
foundational software that's in use
today right that entire ecosystem was

5120
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:36,800
today right that entire ecosystem was
 

5121
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,910
today right that entire ecosystem was
created by collaborators all over the

5122
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:37,920
created by collaborators all over the
 

5123
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,870
created by collaborators all over the
place

5124
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
place
 

5125
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,830
place
so

5126
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:39,840
so
 

5127
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,390
so
these online kind of swarm kind of

5128
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:42,400
these online kind of swarm kind of
 

5129
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,910
these online kind of swarm kind of
things are not

you have no reason not to build multiple
if you build multiple there's no reason

if you build multiple there's no reason

01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,199
can you disconnect
 

5165
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:22,390
can you disconnect
from the hive mind

so to be ineffective
 

5171
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,950
so to be ineffective
to be intelligent you have access to way

5172
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:28,960
to be intelligent you have access to way
 

5173
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,390
to be intelligent you have access to way
more intelligence capability if you're

more intelligence capability if you're

so like there's a word control that

5180
01:24:36,629 --> 01:24:36,639
so like there's a word control that
 

5181
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,149
so like there's a word control that
comes to mind

comes to mind
 

5183
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,910
comes to mind
so it doesn't it it doesn't feel like

5184
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:39,920
so it doesn't it it doesn't feel like
 

5185
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,110
so it doesn't it it doesn't feel like
control like over over uh overbearing

5186
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,120
control like over over uh overbearing
 

5187
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,990
control like over over uh overbearing
control it's it's just i think systems

5188
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,000
control it's it's just i think systems
 

5189

control it's it's just i think systems
now this is your point i mean look at

5190
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:47,520
now this is your point i mean look at
 

5191
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,030
now this is your point i mean look at
look at how much how uncomfortable you

5192
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,040
look at how much how uncomfortable you
 

5193
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,870
look at how much how uncomfortable you
are with this concept right i think

5194
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:50,880
are with this concept right i think
 

5195
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,390
are with this concept right i think
systems that feel like overbearing

5196
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,400
systems that feel like overbearing
 

5197
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,750
systems that feel like overbearing
control will not evolutionarily win out

5198
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:55,760
control will not evolutionarily win out
 

5199
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,950
control will not evolutionarily win out
i think systems that give their

5200
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:56,960
i think systems that give their
 

5201
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,870
i think systems that give their
individual elements the feeling of

5202
01:24:58,870 --> 01:24:58,880
individual elements the feeling of
 

5203
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,350
individual elements the feeling of
serendipity and the feeling of agency

5204
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:01,360
serendipity and the feeling of agency
 

5205
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,910
serendipity and the feeling of agency
that that will

5206
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:03,920
that that will
 

5207
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,510
that that will
those systems will win but that's not to

5208
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:05,520
those systems will win but that's not to
 

5209
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,790
those systems will win but that's not to
say that there will not be emergent

5210
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
say that there will not be emergent

higher level order on top of it
 

5213
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:10,870
higher level order on top of it
and that's the thing that's the

5214
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:10,880
and that's the thing that's the
 

5215
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,709
and that's the thing that's the
philosophical breakdown that we're

5216
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:12,719
philosophical breakdown that we're
 

5217
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,030
philosophical breakdown that we're
staring right at which is in the western

staring right at which is in the western
 

5219
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,790
staring right at which is in the western
mind i think there's a very sharp

mind i think there's a very sharp
 

5221
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,070

now cartesian like what is the vector

01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:23,840
now cartesian like what is the vector

and
 

5233
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,350
and
kind of this idea that things emerge

5234
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:31,360
kind of this idea that things emerge
 

5235
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,790

so you have spoken about a kind of

5244
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:42,560
so you have spoken about a kind of
 

5245
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,830
so you have spoken about a kind of
meaning crisis that we're going through

5246
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:45,840
meaning crisis that we're going through
 

5247
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,229
meaning crisis that we're going through
but it feels like

5248
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:48,239
but it feels like
 

5249
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:52,390
but it feels like
since uh since we invented sex and death

5250
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:52,400
since uh since we invented sex and death
 

5251
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,790

we broadly speaking we've been searching

we broadly speaking we've been searching
 

5253
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,110
we broadly speaking we've been searching
for a kind of meaning so it feels like

5254
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,120
for a kind of meaning so it feels like
 

5255
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,709
for a kind of meaning so it feels like
uh human civilization has been going

5256
01:25:58,709 --> 01:25:58,719
uh human civilization has been going
 

5257
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:00,149
uh human civilization has been going
through a meaning crisis of different

through a meaning crisis of different
 

5259
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:03,750
through a meaning crisis of different
flavors throughout its history why is

5260
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:03,760

5261
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,870

how is

5262
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:04,880
how is
 

5263
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,350
how is
this particular meaning crisis different

5264
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,360
this particular meaning crisis different
 

5265
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,510
this particular meaning crisis different
or is it really a crisis and it wasn't

5266
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:09,520
or is it really a crisis and it wasn't
 

5267
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,830
or is it really a crisis and it wasn't
previously what's your sense a lot of

5268
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:11,840
previously what's your sense a lot of
 

5269
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,910
previously what's your sense a lot of
human history there wasn't so much a

5270
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:13,920
human history there wasn't so much a
 

5271
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,430
human history there wasn't so much a
meaning crisis there was just a like

5272
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:15,440
meaning crisis there was just a like
 

5273
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,189
meaning crisis there was just a like
food and not getting eaten by bears

5274
01:26:17,189 --> 01:26:17,199
food and not getting eaten by bears
 

5275
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,550
food and not getting eaten by bears
crisis right

5276
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560
crisis right
 

5277
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,750
crisis right
once you get to a point where you can

5278
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:19,760
once you get to a point where you can
 

5279
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,430
once you get to a point where you can
make food there was the like not getting

5280
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:21,440
make food there was the like not getting
 

5281
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,470
make food there was the like not getting
killed by other humans crisis so sitting

5282
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:24,480
killed by other humans crisis so sitting
 

5283
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,390
killed by other humans crisis so sitting
around wondering what is all about is

um
 

5289
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,830
um
and the and to some extent the meaning

01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,590
and the and to some extent the meaning
crisis coming out of that is precisely

5292
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
crisis coming out of that is precisely
 

5293
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,950
crisis coming out of that is precisely
because

5294
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960
because
 

5295
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,950
because
well not precisely because i i believe

5296
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960
well not precisely because i i believe
 

5297
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,470
well not precisely because i i believe
that meaning is the consequence of um

5298
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:40,480
that meaning is the consequence of um
 

5299
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,189
that meaning is the consequence of um
when we make consequential decisions

5300
01:26:43,189 --> 01:26:43,199
when we make consequential decisions
 

5301
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,870
when we make consequential decisions
it's tied to agency

5302
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:44,880
it's tied to agency
 

5303
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,790
it's tied to agency
right when we make consequential

5304
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:46,800
right when we make consequential
 

5305
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,910
right when we make consequential
decisions

5306
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:47,920
decisions
 

5307
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,669
decisions
that generates meaning

5308
01:26:49,669 --> 01:26:49,679
that generates meaning
 

5309
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,430
that generates meaning
so if we make a lot of decisions but we

5310
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:51,440
so if we make a lot of decisions but we
 

5311
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,350
so if we make a lot of decisions but we
don't see the consequences of them then

5312
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:53,360
don't see the consequences of them then
 

5313
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,950
don't see the consequences of them then
it feels like what was the point

5314
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:54,960
it feels like what was the point
 

5315
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,550
it feels like what was the point
right but if there's all these big

5316
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:56,560
right but if there's all these big
 

5317
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,590
right but if there's all these big
things happening but we're just along

5318
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
things happening but we're just along
 

5319
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,189
things happening but we're just along
for the ride then it also does not feel

5320
01:26:59,189 --> 01:26:59,199
for the ride then it also does not feel
 

5321
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,709
for the ride then it also does not feel
very meaningful

5322
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
very meaningful
 

5323
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,310

has meaning so we produce all of these
 

5407
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,590
has meaning so we produce all of these
different things that are

different things that are
 

5409
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,470
different things that are
as if meaning right but really making a

decision that has no consequences for us
 

5413
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,950

those have not been challenged in a very

5612
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:43,600
those have not been challenged in a very
 

5613
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,510
those have not been challenged in a very
long time

5614
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:45,520
long time
 

5615
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,110
long time
so you know we went off the gold

5616
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,120
so you know we went off the gold
 

5617
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,350
so you know we went off the gold
standard most money is not connected to

5618
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:49,360
standard most money is not connected to
 

5619
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,669
standard most money is not connected to
physical resources

5620
01:31:51,669 --> 01:31:51,679
physical resources
 

5621
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,669
physical resources
it's an idea

5622
01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:53,679
it's an idea
 

5623
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:54,629
it's an idea
and that

5624
01:31:54,629 --> 01:31:54,639
and that
 

5625
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:55,750
and that
idea is

5626
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:55,760
idea is
 

5627
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,790
idea is
very closely connected to status

5628
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:58,800
very closely connected to status
 

5629
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,669
very closely connected to status
um so why but it's also tied to like

5630
01:32:01,669 --> 01:32:01,679
um so why but it's also tied to like
 

5631
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:03,590
um so why but it's also tied to like
it's actually tied to law it is tied to

5632
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:03,600
it's actually tied to law it is tied to
 

5633
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,110
it's actually tied to law it is tied to
some physical hard things so you have to

5634
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,120
some physical hard things so you have to
 

5635
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,750
some physical hard things so you have to
pay your taxes yes so it's always at the

5636
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:07,760
pay your taxes yes so it's always at the
 

5637
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,629
pay your taxes yes so it's always at the
end

5638
01:32:08,629 --> 01:32:08,639
end
 

5639
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,790
end
going to be connected to the the

5640
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:10,800
going to be connected to the the
 

5641
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,510
going to be connected to the the
blockchain of physical reality so in the

5642
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:13,520
blockchain of physical reality so in the
 

5643
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,149
blockchain of physical reality so in the
case of law and taxes it's connected to

5644
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:16,159
case of law and taxes it's connected to
 

5645
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,270
case of law and taxes it's connected to
government

government
 

5647
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,390

5661
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,910
isn't ultimately of course it'll be
connected to physical reality but just

5662
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:33,920
connected to physical reality but just
 

5663
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,270
connected to physical reality but just
because people control the physical

money than the owners of the teams
 

5671
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,550
money than the owners of the teams
in theory and to me that's a virtual

5672
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:44,560
in theory and to me that's a virtual
 

5673
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,350
in theory and to me that's a virtual
idea so somebody else constructed a game

5674
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:47,360
idea so somebody else constructed a game
 

5675
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,629
idea so somebody else constructed a game
and now you're playing in the space of

5676
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:48,639
and now you're playing in the space of
 

5677
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:51,189
and now you're playing in the space of
virtual uh in the virtual space of the

5678
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:51,199
virtual uh in the virtual space of the
 

5679
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:53,430
virtual uh in the virtual space of the
game so it just feels like there could

5680
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:53,440
game so it just feels like there could
 

5681
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:57,430
game so it just feels like there could
be games where status we build realities

5682
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:57,440
be games where status we build realities
 

5683
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,270
be games where status we build realities
that give us meaning in the virtual

5684
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,280
that give us meaning in the virtual
 

5685
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,910
that give us meaning in the virtual
space like i can imagine such things

5686
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,920
space like i can imagine such things
 

5687
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,149
space like i can imagine such things
being possible oh yeah okay so i see

not that those kinds of games can't lead
 

5721
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,350
not that those kinds of games can't lead
to real consequences

5722
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:35,360
to real consequences
 

5723
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,830
to real consequences
it's that for the vast majority of

5724
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:37,840
it's that for the vast majority of
 

5725
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,110
it's that for the vast majority of
people in consumer culture

5726
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:41,120
people in consumer culture
 

5727
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:44,470
people in consumer culture
they are incented by the

01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:44,480
they are incented by the
 

5729
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,830
they are incented by the
i would say mostly i'm thinking about

01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:45,840
i would say mostly i'm thinking about
 

5731
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,669
i would say mostly i'm thinking about
middle class consumers

5732
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:47,679
middle class consumers
 

5733
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,510
middle class consumers
they're incented by advertisements

the

01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:54,000
the
 

5741
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,990
the
purchasing of certain things the need to

5742
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
purchasing of certain things the need to
 

5743
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,590
purchasing of certain things the need to
buy the latest model whatever that need

5744
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:57,600
buy the latest model whatever that need
 

5745
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,990
buy the latest model whatever that need
to appear however the need to pursue

5746
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,000
to appear however the need to pursue
 

5747
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,430

status games

5748
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:01,440
status games
 

5749
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,669
status games
as a driver of meaning

5750
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
as a driver of meaning
 

5751
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,270
as a driver of meaning
and my point would be that it's a very

5752
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,280
and my point would be that it's a very
 

5753
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,110
and my point would be that it's a very
hollow driver of meaning

5754
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:07,120
hollow driver of meaning
 

5755
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,790
hollow driver of meaning
and that is what creates a meaning

5756
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:08,800
and that is what creates a meaning
 

5757
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,189
and that is what creates a meaning
crisis because at the end of the day

5758
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:11,199
crisis because at the end of the day
 

5759
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,030
crisis because at the end of the day
it's like eating a lot of empty calories

5760
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,040
it's like eating a lot of empty calories
 

5761
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,550
it's like eating a lot of empty calories
right yeah it tasted good going down a

5762
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:14,560
right yeah it tasted good going down a
 

5763
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,229
right yeah it tasted good going down a
lot of sugar but man it did not it was

5764
01:34:16,229 --> 01:34:16,239
lot of sugar but man it did not it was
 

5765
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:17,510
lot of sugar but man it did not it was
not enough protein to help build your

5766
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:17,520
not enough protein to help build your
 

5767
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,350
not enough protein to help build your
muscles and you kind of feel that in

5768
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,360
muscles and you kind of feel that in
 

5769
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,390
muscles and you kind of feel that in
your gut

5770
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:20,400

01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:24,400
discussion on currency which i hope we
 

5777
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,910
discussion on currency which i hope we
get back get back to you

5778
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
get back get back to you
 

5779
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,830
get back get back to you
that's what i mean about the meaning

5780
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:27,840
that's what i mean about the meaning
 

5781
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,990
that's what i mean about the meaning
crisis part of it being created by the

5782
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:30,000
crisis part of it being created by the
 

5783
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,830
crisis part of it being created by the
fact that we don't um we're not

5784
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840
fact that we don't um we're not
 

5785
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,430
fact that we don't um we're not
encouraged to have more and more direct

01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:35,440
encouraged to have more and more direct
 

5787
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,470

5789
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,750

from relating to even even our family

from relating to even even our family
 

5791
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,830
from relating to even even our family
members sometimes right we're we're

01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,990
encouraged to relate to these kinds of
things that then tell us

5798
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,000
things that then tell us
 

5799
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,470
things that then tell us
to um do things that are really of low

5800
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:52,480
to um do things that are really of low
 

5801

consequence
 

5803
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:54,870
consequence
and that's where the meaning crisis

5804
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,880
and that's where the meaning crisis
 

5805
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,950
and that's where the meaning crisis
comes from so the role of technology in

5806
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
comes from so the role of technology in
 

5807
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,470
comes from so the role of technology in
this so there's somebody you mentioned

5808
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,480
this so there's somebody you mentioned
 

5809
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,750
this so there's somebody you mentioned
who's jacques

he warns about the towering piles of
technique which i guess is a broad idea

5818
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
technique which i guess is a broad idea
 

5819
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,750
technique which i guess is a broad idea
of technology yes so i think correct me

5820
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:11,760
of technology yes so i think correct me
 

5821
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,310
of technology yes so i think correct me
if i'm wrong for him technology is a is

5822
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:14,320
if i'm wrong for him technology is a is
 

5823
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,030
if i'm wrong for him technology is a is
a is bad moving away from human nature

5824
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,040
a is bad moving away from human nature
 

5825
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,350
a is bad moving away from human nature
and it's ultimately destructive

5826
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,360
and it's ultimately destructive
 

5827
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,629
and it's ultimately destructive
my question broadly speaking this

5828
01:35:20,629 --> 01:35:20,639
my question broadly speaking this
 

5829
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,550
my question broadly speaking this
meaning crisis can technology what are

5830
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:22,560
meaning crisis can technology what are
 

5831
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,470
meaning crisis can technology what are
the pros and cons of technology can it

5832
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:24,480
the pros and cons of technology can it
 

5833
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,950
the pros and cons of technology can it
be good yeah i think it can be i

5834
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:26,960
be good yeah i think it can be i
 

5835
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,790
be good yeah i think it can be i
certainly draw on some of the lowell's

5836
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:28,800
certainly draw on some of the lowell's
 

5837
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,030
certainly draw on some of the lowell's
ideas and i think some of them are are

5838
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,040
ideas and i think some of them are are
 

5839
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,430
ideas and i think some of them are are
pretty good um but the way he defines

01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:33,440
pretty good um but the way he defines
 

5841
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,350
pretty good um but the way he defines
technique is

01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:35,360
technique is
 

5843
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,830
technique is

that drives a lot of the economic stuff
not the need but the need to consume and

so we have homogenized when we

5934
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:11,440
so we have homogenized when we
 

5935
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,189
so we have homogenized when we
discovered i think this is uh this is

01:37:13,189 --> 01:37:13,199
discovered i think this is uh this is

the early 20th century we discovered we
 

5941
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:17,750
the early 20th century we discovered we
can create

5942

can create
 

5943
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,750

we can create demand we can create

01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:19,760
we can create demand we can create
 

5945
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,790
we can create demand we can create
desire

desire
 

5947
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,229
desire
in a way that

01:37:22,229 --> 01:37:22,239
in a way that
 

5949
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:23,750
in a way that
was not possible before because of

and one not only do we create desire we
 

5955
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,350
and one not only do we create desire we
don't create a desire for each person to

have you heard this have you seen this
 

5971
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,149
have you heard this have you seen this
movie right so creating homogenized

5972
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:42,159

demand
 

5975
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,030
demand
makes it really cheap to create

5976
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:45,040
makes it really cheap to create
 

5977
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,109
makes it really cheap to create
homogenized product and now you have

5978
01:37:47,109 --> 01:37:47,119
homogenized product and now you have
 

5979
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,390
homogenized product and now you have
economics of scale

5980
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,400

growth only happens the margins so you
 

6003
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,830
growth only happens the margins so you
have to squeeze more and more demand out

question of where do we go in the future
 

6095
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,550

is this still the same rocket we need to
 

6099
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,669
is this still the same rocket we need to
ride to get to the next point we'll even

6100
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:43,679
ride to get to the next point we'll even
 

6101
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:44,870

get us to the next point well how does

6102
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:44,880
get us to the next point well how does
 

6103
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,310
get us to the next point well how does
this so you're predicting the future how

6207
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,950
all of it i don't know well i mean if
you look at our systems when you do a

6208
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:34,960
you look at our systems when you do a
 

6209
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,310
you look at our systems when you do a
google search right now some of that

6210
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:36,320
google search right now some of that
 

6211
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,229

they're using some aspect of these kinds

6222
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:46,880
they're using some aspect of these kinds
 

6223
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,109
they're using some aspect of these kinds
of tools so i would say that

6224
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:49,119
of tools so i would say that
 

6225
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,109
of tools so i would say that
these create billions of dollars of

6226
01:41:51,109 --> 01:41:51,119
these create billions of dollars of
 

6227
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:53,270
these create billions of dollars of
value you mean like direct use of tools

6228
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:53,280
value you mean like direct use of tools
 

6229
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,109
value you mean like direct use of tools
that leverage direct yeah yeah even

6230
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:55,119
that leverage direct yeah yeah even
 

6231
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:57,109
that leverage direct yeah yeah even
that's billions a day yeah yeah right

6232
01:41:57,109 --> 01:41:57,119
that's billions a day yeah yeah right
 

6233
01:41:57,119 --> 01:41:59,109
that's billions a day yeah yeah right
easily i think like the things they

6234
01:41:59,109 --> 01:41:59,119
easily i think like the things they
 

6235
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,229
easily i think like the things they
could not do if they didn't have these

6236
01:42:00,229 --> 01:42:00,239
could not do if they didn't have these
 

6237
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:02,790
could not do if they didn't have these
tools right yes so

6238
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:02,800
tools right yes so
 

6239
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,790
tools right yes so
that's billions of dollars a day great i

6240
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:04,800
that's billions of dollars a day great i
 

6241
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,709
that's billions of dollars a day great i
think that's about right now if we take

6242
01:42:06,709 --> 01:42:06,719
think that's about right now if we take
 

6243
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:09,590
think that's about right now if we take
how many people did it take to make that

6244
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
how many people did it take to make that
 

6245
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,109
how many people did it take to make that
right and there was a point in time not

6246
01:42:11,109 --> 01:42:11,119
right and there was a point in time not
 

6247
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:12,229
right and there was a point in time not
anymore but there was a point in time

6248
01:42:12,229 --> 01:42:12,239
anymore but there was a point in time
 

6249
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:13,590
anymore but there was a point in time
when they could fit in a van i could

6250
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:13,600
when they could fit in a van i could
 

6251
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,350

right so if treating software
in this way created this much value so

worked on
 

6679
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:12,310
worked on
um some open source stuff i mean it was

6680
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:12,320
um some open source stuff i mean it was
 

6681
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,310
um some open source stuff i mean it was
just a really it was a good a good time

6682
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
just a really it was a good a good time
 

6683
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:17,189
just a really it was a good a good time
there and then it was primarily python

6684
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:17,199
there and then it was primarily python
 

6685
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:19,350
there and then it was primarily python
related oh yeah it was all python numpy

6686
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:19,360
related oh yeah it was all python numpy
 

6687
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,189

consulting kind of stuff um towards the

6688
01:49:21,189 --> 01:49:21,199
consulting kind of stuff um towards the
 

6689
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:22,629
consulting kind of stuff um towards the
end of that time

6690
01:49:22,629 --> 01:49:22,639
end of that time
 

6691
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,790
end of that time
uh we started getting called into more

6692
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:24,800
uh we started getting called into more
 

6693
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,189
uh we started getting called into more
and more finance shops

6694
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:27,199
and more finance shops
 

6695
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:28,790
and more finance shops
um they were adopting python pretty

6696
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:28,800
um they were adopting python pretty
 

6697
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,270
um they were adopting python pretty
heavily i did some work on like a high

6698
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:31,280
heavily i did some work on like a high
 

6699
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,589
heavily i did some work on like a high
frequency trading shop um working some

6700
01:49:33,589 --> 01:49:33,599
frequency trading shop um working some
 

6701
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,270
frequency trading shop um working some
stuff and then we worked together on

6702
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:35,280
stuff and then we worked together on
 

6703
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:38,310
stuff and then we worked together on
some um at a couple investment banks in

6704
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:38,320
some um at a couple investment banks in
 

6705
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,750
some um at a couple investment banks in
in manhattan

6706
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,760
in manhattan
 

6707
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:40,709
in manhattan
and so

6708
01:49:40,709 --> 01:49:40,719
and so
 

6709
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:41,990
and so
we started seeing that there was a

6710
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:42,000
we started seeing that there was a
 

6711
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,990
we started seeing that there was a
potential to take python in the

6712
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,000
potential to take python in the
 

6713
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,750
potential to take python in the
direction of business computing more

6714
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:45,760
direction of business computing more
 

6715
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,350
direction of business computing more
than just being this niche like matlab

6716
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:47,360
than just being this niche like matlab
 

6717
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:50,390
than just being this niche like matlab
replacement for big vector computing

6718
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:50,400
replacement for big vector computing
 

6719
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,830
replacement for big vector computing
what we were seeing was oh yeah you

6720
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:51,840
what we were seeing was oh yeah you
 

6721
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,189
what we were seeing was oh yeah you
could actually use python as a swiss

6722
01:49:53,189 --> 01:49:53,199
could actually use python as a swiss
 

6723
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:55,350
could actually use python as a swiss
army knife to do a lot of shadow data

6724
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:55,360
army knife to do a lot of shadow data
 

6725
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,589
army knife to do a lot of shadow data
transformation kind of stuff so that's

6726
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:57,599
transformation kind of stuff so that's
 

6727
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:58,790
transformation kind of stuff so that's
when we

6728
01:49:58,790 --> 01:49:58,800
when we
 

6729
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,470
when we
realize the potential is much greater

6730
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:00,480
realize the potential is much greater
 

6731
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:01,750
realize the potential is much greater
and so

6732
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:01,760
and so
 

6733
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,669
and so
we started anaconda i mean it was called

6734
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:03,679
we started anaconda i mean it was called
 

6735
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,270
we started anaconda i mean it was called
continuum analytics at the time but we

6736
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:05,280
continuum analytics at the time but we
 

6737
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,149
continuum analytics at the time but we
started in january of 2012 with a vision

6738
01:50:08,149 --> 01:50:08,159
started in january of 2012 with a vision
 

6739
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:09,030
started in january of 2012 with a vision
of

6740
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,040
of
 

6741
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,790
of
shoring up the parts of python that

6742
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:10,800
shoring up the parts of python that
 

6743
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,270
shoring up the parts of python that
needed to get expanded to handle data at

6744
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:13,280
needed to get expanded to handle data at
 

6745
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:14,790
needed to get expanded to handle data at
scale to do web visualization

6746
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:14,800
scale to do web visualization
 

6747
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,030
scale to do web visualization
application development et cetera

6748
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:17,040
application development et cetera
 

6749
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,510
application development et cetera
and that was that yeah so he was ceo and

6750
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:19,520
and that was that yeah so he was ceo and

01:50:58,229 --> 01:50:58,239
other technology that we built in the
 

6795
01:50:58,239 --> 01:51:01,030
other technology that we built in the
open source and travis was really trying

6796
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:01,040
open source and travis was really trying
 

6797
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,589

the
 

6811
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,229
the
you know that's kind of the direction

6812

come from very different backgrounds

6854
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:53,280
come from very different backgrounds
 

6855
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,109

and then be on a conversation and be eye
to eye on like 90 of things and so he's

6870
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
to eye on like 90 of things and so he's
 

6871
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,709
to eye on like 90 of things and so he's
someone who i believe no matter how much

6877
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:14,950
ship are pointed sort of in the same
direction of the same star wow so that's

6878
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:14,960
direction of the same star wow so that's
 

6879
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,030
direction of the same star wow so that's
a beautiful way to phrase it no matter

6880
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:17,040
a beautiful way to phrase it no matter
 

6881
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,430
a beautiful way to phrase it no matter
how much fog there is appointed the same

6882
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:19,440
how much fog there is appointed the same
 

6883
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,310
how much fog there is appointed the same
star

6884
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:20,320
star
 

6885
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:21,830
star
yeah and i hope he feels the same way i

6886
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:21,840
yeah and i hope he feels the same way i
 

6887
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,030
yeah and i hope he feels the same way i
mean i hope he knows that over the years

6888
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
mean i hope he knows that over the years
 

6889
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,270
mean i hope he knows that over the years

a similar kind of alignment i care a lot
 

6917
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:53,030
a similar kind of alignment i care a lot
about the tech i really do

6918
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:53,040
about the tech i really do
 

6919
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,790
about the tech i really do
but for me

6920
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:54,800
but for me
 

6921
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,589

it's an early version we should look at

6930
01:53:03,189 --> 01:53:03,199
it's an early version we should look at
 

6931
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:04,629
it's an early version we should look at
it and say how do we replicate this for

6932
01:53:04,629 --> 01:53:04,639
it and say how do we replicate this for
 

6933
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:06,550
it and say how do we replicate this for
humanity at scale what this open source

that as a civilizational kind of dynamic
 

6943
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,350
that as a civilizational kind of dynamic
like can we seize this moment to do that

6944
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:17,360
like can we seize this moment to do that
 

6945
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,629
like can we seize this moment to do that
because like a lot of the other open

6946
01:53:18,629 --> 01:53:18,639
because like a lot of the other open
 

6947
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,709

source movements it's all nerds nerding
 

6949
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:22,709
source movements it's all nerds nerding
out on code for nerds you know

6950
01:53:22,709 --> 01:53:22,719
out on code for nerds you know
 

6951
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:23,510
out on code for nerds you know
um

6952

um
 

6953
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,750
um
and the this because it's scientists

6954
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:25,760
and the this because it's scientists
 

6955
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,510
and the this because it's scientists
because it's people working on data that

6956
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:27,520
because it's people working on data that
 

6957
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,709
because it's people working on data that
all of it faces real human problems

6958
01:53:30,709 --> 01:53:30,719
all of it faces real human problems
 

6959
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,709
all of it faces real human problems
um i think we have an opportunity to

6960
01:53:32,709 --> 01:53:32,719
um i think we have an opportunity to
 

6961
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:34,310
um i think we have an opportunity to
actually make a bigger impact

6962
01:53:34,310 --> 01:53:34,320
actually make a bigger impact
 

6963
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,629
actually make a bigger impact
is there a way for this kind of open

6964
01:53:36,629 --> 01:53:36,639
is there a way for this kind of open
 

6965
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:39,030
is there a way for this kind of open
source vision to make money

6966

source vision to make money
 

6967
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,589
source vision to make money
absolutely to fund the people involved

6968
01:53:41,589 --> 01:53:41,599
absolutely to fund the people involved
 

6969
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:44,229
absolutely to fund the people involved
is that yes it's hard it's hard

6970
01:53:44,229 --> 01:53:44,239
is that yes it's hard it's hard
 

6971
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:45,910
is that yes it's hard it's hard
but but we're trying to do that in our

6972
01:53:45,910 --> 01:53:45,920
but but we're trying to do that in our
 

6973
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:48,790
but but we're trying to do that in our
own way um at anaconda uh because we

6974
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:48,800
own way um at anaconda uh because we
 

6975
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,229
own way um at anaconda uh because we
know that business users as they use

6976
01:53:50,229 --> 01:53:50,239
know that business users as they use
 

6977
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:51,910
know that business users as they use
more of the stuff they have needs that

6978
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:51,920
more of the stuff they have needs that
 

6979
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,109
more of the stuff they have needs that
like business specific needs around

6980
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:53,119
like business specific needs around
 

6981
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:56,070
like business specific needs around
security provenance um you know they

6982
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:56,080
security provenance um you know they
 

6983
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,189
security provenance um you know they
really can't

6984
01:53:57,189 --> 01:53:57,199
really can't
 

6985
01:53:57,199 --> 01:53:57,990
really can't
tell

6986
01:53:57,990 --> 01:53:58,000
tell
 

6987
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,470
tell
their vps and their investors hey we're

6988
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
their vps and their investors hey we're
 

6989
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:01,990
their vps and their investors hey we're
having you know our data scientists are

6990
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:02,000
having you know our data scientists are
 

6991
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,669
having you know our data scientists are
installing random packages from who

6992
01:54:03,669 --> 01:54:03,679
installing random packages from who
 

6993
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:05,510
installing random packages from who
knows where and running on customer data

6994
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:05,520
knows where and running on customer data
 

6995
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,709
knows where and running on customer data
so they have to have someone to talk to

6996
01:54:06,709 --> 01:54:06,719
so they have to have someone to talk to
 

6997
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,589
so they have to have someone to talk to
and that's what anaconda does so we are

6998
01:54:09,589 --> 01:54:09,599
and that's what anaconda does so we are
 

6999
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:11,030
and that's what anaconda does so we are
you know a governed source of packages

7000
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:11,040
you know a governed source of packages
 

7001
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,149
you know a governed source of packages
for them and that's great that makes

7002
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:12,159
for them and that's great that makes
 

7003
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:14,550
for them and that's great that makes
some money we take some of that and we

7004
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:14,560
some money we take some of that and we
 

7005
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,189
some money we take some of that and we
just uh take that as a dividend we take

7006
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:17,199
just uh take that as a dividend we take
 

7007
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:18,470
just uh take that as a dividend we take
a percentage of revenues and write that

7008
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:18,480
a percentage of revenues and write that
 

7009
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,070
a percentage of revenues and write that
as a dividend for the open source

7010
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:20,080
as a dividend for the open source
 

7011
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:22,550
as a dividend for the open source
community but beyond that

7012
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:22,560
community but beyond that
 

7013
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,550
community but beyond that
i really see the development of a

with that

7026
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:37,920
with that
 

7027
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,589
with that
can you speak about this problem that

7028
01:54:39,589 --> 01:54:39,599
can you speak about this problem that
 

7029
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:42,390
can you speak about this problem that
you stumbled into of package management

7030
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:42,400
you stumbled into of package management
 

7031
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:46,709
you stumbled into of package management
python package management what is that

7032
01:54:46,709 --> 01:54:46,719

 

7033
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:48,390

a lot of people speak very highly of

7034
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:48,400
a lot of people speak very highly of
 

7035
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,470
a lot of people speak very highly of
conda which is part of anaconda which is

the package manager there's a ton of

7038
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:52,000
the package manager there's a ton of
 

7039
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,030
the package manager there's a ton of
packages

7040
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,040
packages
 

7041
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,189
packages
so first what are package managers and

7042
01:54:55,189 --> 01:54:55,199
so first what are package managers and
 

7043
01:54:55,199 --> 01:54:58,550
so first what are package managers and
second what was there before what is pip

7044
01:54:58,550 --> 01:54:58,560
second what was there before what is pip
 

7045
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,430
second what was there before what is pip
and

7046

and
 

7047
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,310
and
why is condom more awesome the package

7048
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:02,320
why is condom more awesome the package
 

7049
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,550
why is condom more awesome the package
problem is this which is that in order

7050
01:55:04,550 --> 01:55:04,560

01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,149
problem is this which is that in order
to do

7052
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:06,159
to do
 

7053
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:08,070
to do
um

7054
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:08,080
um
 

7055
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,990
um
numerical computing efficiently with

7056
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:10,000
numerical computing efficiently with
 

7057
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,589
numerical computing efficiently with
python

python
 

7059
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:14,390
python
there are a lot of low-level libraries

7060
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:14,400
there are a lot of low-level libraries
 

7061
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:16,629
there are a lot of low-level libraries
that need to be compiled compiled with a

7062
01:55:16,629 --> 01:55:16,639
that need to be compiled compiled with a
 

7063
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:18,470
that need to be compiled compiled with a
c compiler or c plus plus compiler for

7064
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:18,480
c compiler or c plus plus compiler for
 

7065
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:19,669
c compiler or c plus plus compiler for
trend compiler

7066
01:55:19,669 --> 01:55:19,679
trend compiler
 

7067
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,030
trend compiler
they need to not just be compiled but

7068
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:21,040
they need to not just be compiled but
 

7069
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,229
they need to not just be compiled but
they need to be compiled with all of the

7070
01:55:22,229 --> 01:55:22,239
they need to be compiled with all of the
 

7071
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,589
they need to be compiled with all of the
right settings

7072
01:55:23,589 --> 01:55:23,599
right settings
 

7073
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,030
right settings
and oftentimes those settings are tuned

7074
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:25,040
and oftentimes those settings are tuned
 

7075
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,270
and oftentimes those settings are tuned
for specific chip architectures

7076
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:27,280
for specific chip architectures
 

7077
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,189
for specific chip architectures
and and when you add gpus to the mix

7078
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:29,199
and and when you add gpus to the mix
 

7079
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:31,430
and and when you add gpus to the mix
when you look at different operating

01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:31,440
when you look at different operating
 

7081
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,750
when you look at different operating
systems you may be on the same chip but

7082
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:33,760
systems you may be on the same chip but
 

7083
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,390
systems you may be on the same chip but
if you're running mac versus linux

01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:36,400
if you're running mac versus linux
 

7085
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,390
if you're running mac versus linux
versus windows on the same x86 chip you

7086
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:38,400
versus windows on the same x86 chip you
 

7087
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,910
versus windows on the same x86 chip you
compile link differently

7088
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:39,920
compile link differently
 

7089
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,750
compile link differently
all of this complexity

7090
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:41,760
all of this complexity
 

7091
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,350
all of this complexity
is

7092
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:43,360
is
 

7093
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,350
is
beyond the capability of most data

7094
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:45,360
beyond the capability of most data
 

7095
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:47,270
beyond the capability of most data
scientists to reason about and it's also

01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:48,320
beyond

01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:50,310
beyond
what most of the package developers want

7100
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:50,320
what most of the package developers want
 

7101
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,070
what most of the package developers want
to deal with too yes because your

7102
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:52,080
to deal with too yes because your
 

7103
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,510
to deal with too yes because your
package developer you're like i code on

7105
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,990
package developer you're like i code on
linux this works for me i'm good it is

7106
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:56,000
linux this works for me i'm good it is
 

7107
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,109
linux this works for me i'm good it is
not my problem to figure out how to

7108
01:55:57,109 --> 01:55:57,119
not my problem to figure out how to
 

7109
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:58,870
not my problem to figure out how to
build this on an ancient version of

7110
01:55:58,870 --> 01:55:58,880
build this on an ancient version of
 

7111
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,790
build this on an ancient version of
windows right that's just simply not my

7112
01:56:00,790 --> 01:56:00,800
windows right that's just simply not my
 

7113
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:01,910
windows right that's just simply not my
problem

7114
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:01,920
problem
 

7115
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,070
problem
so what we end up with is we have a

7116
01:56:04,070 --> 01:56:04,080
so what we end up with is we have a
 

7117
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,870
so what we end up with is we have a
creator econ or create a a very creative

7118
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:06,880
creator econ or create a a very creative
 

7119
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:08,470
creator econ or create a a very creative
crowdsourced environment

7120
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:08,480
crowdsourced environment
 

7121
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:09,910
crowdsourced environment
where people want to use this stuff but

7122
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:09,920
where people want to use this stuff but
 

7123
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,270
where people want to use this stuff but
they can't

7124
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
they can't
 

7125
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,750
they can't
and so we ended up creating

7126
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:13,760
and so we ended up creating
 

7127
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:16,149
and so we ended up creating
a new set of technologies like a build

7128
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:16,159
a new set of technologies like a build
 

7129
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:18,550
a new set of technologies like a build
recipe system a build system and an

7130
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:18,560
recipe system a build system and an
 

7131
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,910
recipe system a build system and an
installer system that is able to

7132
01:56:21,910 --> 01:56:21,920
installer system that is able to
 

7133
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,750
installer system that is able to
um well

7134
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:23,760
um well
 

7135
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,669
um well
to put it simply it's able to build

7136
01:56:25,669 --> 01:56:25,679
to put it simply it's able to build
 

7137
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,589
to put it simply it's able to build
these packages correctly

7138
01:56:27,589 --> 01:56:27,599
these packages correctly
 

7139
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:28,790
these packages correctly
on each of these different kinds of

7140
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800
on each of these different kinds of
 

7141
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,470
on each of these different kinds of
platforms and operating systems and make

7142
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:30,480
platforms and operating systems and make
 

7143
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:31,910
platforms and operating systems and make
it so when people want to install

7144
01:56:31,910 --> 01:56:31,920
it so when people want to install
 

7145
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:32,870
it so when people want to install
something

7146
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:32,880
something
 

7147
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,310
something
they can it's just one command they

7148
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:34,320
they can it's just one command they
 

7149
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,189
they can it's just one command they
don't have to

7150
01:56:35,189 --> 01:56:35,199
don't have to
 

7151
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:36,790
don't have to
you know set up a big compiler system

7152
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:36,800
you know set up a big compiler system
 

7153
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,149
you know set up a big compiler system
and do all these things

7154
01:56:38,149 --> 01:56:38,159
and do all these things
 

7155
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:40,229
and do all these things
so when it works well it works great

7156
01:56:40,229 --> 01:56:40,239
so when it works well it works great
 

7157
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,470
so when it works well it works great
now the difficulty is

7158
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:42,480
now the difficulty is
 

7159
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,149
now the difficulty is
we have literally thousands of people

7160
01:56:44,149 --> 01:56:44,159
we have literally thousands of people
 

7161
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:46,390
we have literally thousands of people
writing code in the ecosystem building

7162
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:46,400
writing code in the ecosystem building
 

7163
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:47,669
writing code in the ecosystem building
all sorts of stuff and each person

7164
01:56:47,669 --> 01:56:47,679
all sorts of stuff and each person
 

7165
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,430
all sorts of stuff and each person
writing code they may take a dependence

7166
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,440
writing code they may take a dependence
 

7167
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,149
writing code they may take a dependence
on something else and so all this web

7168
01:56:52,149 --> 01:56:52,159
on something else and so all this web
 

7169
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:54,709
on something else and so all this web
incredibly complex web of dependencies

7170
01:56:54,709 --> 01:56:54,719
incredibly complex web of dependencies
 

7171
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:57,589
incredibly complex web of dependencies
so installing the correct package

7172
01:56:57,589 --> 01:56:57,599
so installing the correct package
 

7173
01:56:57,599 --> 01:56:59,030
so installing the correct package
for any given

7174
01:56:59,030 --> 01:56:59,040
for any given
 

7175
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,870
for any given
set of packages you want getting that

7176
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:00,880
set of packages you want getting that
 

7177
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,189
set of packages you want getting that
right sub graph is an incredibly hard

7178
01:57:03,189 --> 01:57:03,199
right sub graph is an incredibly hard
 

7179
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:04,550
right sub graph is an incredibly hard
problem

7180
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:04,560
problem
 

7181
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:05,830
problem
and again most data scientists don't

7182
01:57:05,830 --> 01:57:05,840
and again most data scientists don't
 

7183
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:06,870
and again most data scientists don't
want to think about this they're like i

7184
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:06,880
want to think about this they're like i
 

7185
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:09,350
want to think about this they're like i
want to install numpy and pandas i want

7186
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:09,360
want to install numpy and pandas i want
 

7187
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:11,109
want to install numpy and pandas i want
this version of some like geospatial

7188
01:57:11,109 --> 01:57:11,119
this version of some like geospatial
 

7189
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:13,270
this version of some like geospatial
library i want this other thing like why

7190
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:13,280
library i want this other thing like why
 

7191
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,510
library i want this other thing like why
is this hard these exist right

7192
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:15,520
is this hard these exist right
 

7193
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,589
is this hard these exist right
yes and it is hard because it's well

7194
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:17,599
yes and it is hard because it's well
 

7195
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,430
yes and it is hard because it's well
you're installing this on a version of

7196
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:19,440
you're installing this on a version of
 

7197
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,350
you're installing this on a version of
windows right and half of these

7198
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:21,360
windows right and half of these
 

7199
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,270
windows right and half of these
libraries are not built for windows

7200
01:57:23,270 --> 01:57:23,280
libraries are not built for windows
 

7201
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,950
libraries are not built for windows
or the latest version isn't available

7202
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:24,960
or the latest version isn't available
 

7203
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,550
or the latest version isn't available
but the old version was if you go to the

7204
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:26,560
but the old version was if you go to the
 

7205
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,669
but the old version was if you go to the
old version of this library that means

7206
01:57:27,669 --> 01:57:27,679
old version of this library that means
 

7207
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:28,550
old version of this library that means
you need to go to a different version of

7208
01:57:28,550 --> 01:57:28,560
you need to go to a different version of
 

7209
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:29,910
you need to go to a different version of
that library

7210
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:29,920
that library
 

7211
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,109
that library
and so

7212
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:31,119
and so
 

7213
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:33,510
and so
the python ecosystem by by virtue of

7214
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:33,520
the python ecosystem by by virtue of
 

7215
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:35,589
the python ecosystem by by virtue of
being crowdsourced we were able to fill

7216
01:57:35,589 --> 01:57:35,599
being crowdsourced we were able to fill
 

7217
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:37,990
being crowdsourced we were able to fill
a hundred thousand different niches but

7218
01:57:37,990 --> 01:57:38,000
a hundred thousand different niches but
 

7219
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,470
a hundred thousand different niches but
then we also suffer this problem that

7220
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:40,480
then we also suffer this problem that
 

7221
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,950
then we also suffer this problem that
because it's crowdsourced and no one

7222
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:42,960
because it's crowdsourced and no one
 

7223
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,550
because it's crowdsourced and no one
it's like a tragedy the commons right no

7224
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:44,560
it's like a tragedy the commons right no
 

7225
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,189
it's like a tragedy the commons right no
one really needs wants to support their

7226
01:57:47,189 --> 01:57:47,199
one really needs wants to support their
 

7227
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:49,109
one really needs wants to support their
thousands of other dependencies

7228
01:57:49,109 --> 01:57:49,119
thousands of other dependencies
 

7229
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:51,669
thousands of other dependencies
so we end up sort of having to do a lot

7230
01:57:51,669 --> 01:57:51,679
so we end up sort of having to do a lot
 

7231
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:53,030
so we end up sort of having to do a lot
of this and of course the condo forge

7232
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,040
of this and of course the condo forge
 

7233
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,390
of this and of course the condo forge
community also steps up as an open

7234
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:54,400
community also steps up as an open
 

7235
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,149
community also steps up as an open
source community that you know maintains

7236
01:57:56,149 --> 01:57:56,159
source community that you know maintains
 

7237
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:58,229
source community that you know maintains
some of these recipes that's what conda

7238
01:57:58,229 --> 01:57:58,239
some of these recipes that's what conda
 

7239
01:57:58,239 --> 01:57:59,750
some of these recipes that's what conda
does now pip

7240
01:57:59,750 --> 01:57:59,760
does now pip
 

7241
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,830
does now pip
is a tool that came along after conda to

7242
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:01,840
is a tool that came along after conda to
 

7243
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:04,149
is a tool that came along after conda to
some extent it came along as an easier

7244
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:04,159
some extent it came along as an easier
 

7245
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:07,430
some extent it came along as an easier
way for the um for the python developers

7246
01:58:07,430 --> 01:58:07,440
way for the um for the python developers
 

7247
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,709
way for the um for the python developers
writing

7248
01:58:08,709 --> 01:58:08,719
writing
 

7249
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:10,629
writing
python code that didn't have as much

7250
01:58:10,629 --> 01:58:10,639
python code that didn't have as much
 

7251
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:13,430
python code that didn't have as much
compiled you know stuff they could then

7252
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:13,440
compiled you know stuff they could then
 

7253
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,270
compiled you know stuff they could then
install different packages

7254
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:15,280
install different packages
 

7255
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:15,990
install different packages
and

7256
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:16,000
and
 

7257
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,109
and
what ended up happening in the python

7258
01:58:17,109 --> 01:58:17,119
what ended up happening in the python
 

7259
01:58:17,119 --> 01:58:19,030
what ended up happening in the python
ecosystem was that a lot of the core

7260
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:19,040
ecosystem was that a lot of the core
 

7261
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:20,790
ecosystem was that a lot of the core
python and web python developers they

7262
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:20,800
python and web python developers they
 

7263
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,950
python and web python developers they
never ran into any of this compilation

7264
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:22,960
never ran into any of this compilation
 

7265
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,070
never ran into any of this compilation
stuff at all

7266
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:24,080
stuff at all
 

7267
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:26,950
stuff at all
so even we have you know uh uh on video

7268
01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:26,960
so even we have you know uh uh on video
 

7269
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,870
so even we have you know uh uh on video
we have uh guido and guido van rossum

7270
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:28,880
we have uh guido and guido van rossum
 

7271
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,229
we have uh guido and guido van rossum
saying you know what the scientific

7272
01:58:30,229 --> 01:58:30,239
saying you know what the scientific

community's packaging problems are just

7274
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:31,760
community's packaging problems are just
 

7275
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:33,350
community's packaging problems are just
too exotic and different i mean talking

7276
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:33,360
too exotic and different i mean talking
 

7277
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:35,990
too exotic and different i mean talking
about fortran compilers right um like

7278
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:36,000
about fortran compilers right um like
 

7279
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,109
about fortran compilers right um like
you guys just need to build your own

7280
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:37,119
you guys just need to build your own
 

7281
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:38,950
you guys just need to build your own
solution perhaps right

7282
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:38,960
solution perhaps right
 

7283
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:41,589
solution perhaps right
so the python core python community went

7284
01:58:41,589 --> 01:58:41,599
so the python core python community went
 

7285
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:43,990
so the python core python community went
and built its own sort of packaging

7286
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,000
and built its own sort of packaging
 

7287
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,270
and built its own sort of packaging
technologies

7288
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:45,280
technologies
 

7289
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,669
technologies
not really contemplating the complexity

7290
01:58:47,669 --> 01:58:47,679
not really contemplating the complexity
 

7291
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:49,270
not really contemplating the complexity
of the stuff over here

7292
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:49,280
of the stuff over here
 

7293
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,430
of the stuff over here
and so now we have the challenge where

7294
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:51,440
and so now we have the challenge where
 

7295
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:53,109
and so now we have the challenge where
you can pip install some things in some

7296
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:53,119
you can pip install some things in some
 

7297
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:54,149
you can pip install some things in some
libraries if you just want to get

7298
01:58:54,149 --> 01:58:54,159
libraries if you just want to get
 

7299
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:55,270
libraries if you just want to get
started with them

7300
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:55,280
started with them
 

7301
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:56,550
started with them
you can pimp and sell tensorflow and

7302
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:56,560
you can pimp and sell tensorflow and
 

7303
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,550
you can pimp and sell tensorflow and
that works great the instant you want to

7304
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:58,560
that works great the instant you want to
 

7305
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,149
that works great the instant you want to
also install some other packages that

7306
01:59:00,149 --> 01:59:00,159
also install some other packages that
 

7307
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:02,950
also install some other packages that
use different versions of numpy or some

7308
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:02,960
use different versions of numpy or some
 

7309
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,189
use different versions of numpy or some
like graphics library or some opencv

7310
01:59:05,189 --> 01:59:05,199
like graphics library or some opencv
 

7311
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:07,189
like graphics library or some opencv
thing or some other thing you now run

7312
01:59:07,189 --> 01:59:07,199
thing or some other thing you now run
 

7313
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:08,709
thing or some other thing you now run
into dependency hell

7314
01:59:08,709 --> 01:59:08,719
into dependency hell
 

7315
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:10,470
into dependency hell
because you cannot you know opencv can

7316
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:10,480
because you cannot you know opencv can
 

7317
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,070
because you cannot you know opencv can
have a different version of jpeg over

7318
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:12,080
have a different version of jpeg over
 

7319
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:14,470
have a different version of jpeg over
here than pytorch over here like they

7320
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:14,480
here than pytorch over here like they
 

7321
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:15,750
here than pytorch over here like they
actually they all have to use that if

7322
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:15,760
actually they all have to use that if
 

7323
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,350
actually they all have to use that if
you want to use gpu acceleration they

7324
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:17,360
you want to use gpu acceleration they
 

7325
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,390
you want to use gpu acceleration they
have to all use the same underlying

7326
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:18,400
have to all use the same underlying
 

7327
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,030
have to all use the same underlying
drivers and same gpu cuda things so it's

7328
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:21,040
drivers and same gpu cuda things so it's
 

7329
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:23,270
drivers and same gpu cuda things so it's
it gets to be very gnarly and it's a

7330
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:23,280
it gets to be very gnarly and it's a
 

7331
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,270
it gets to be very gnarly and it's a
level of technology that both the makers

7332
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:25,280
level of technology that both the makers
 

7333
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:26,870
level of technology that both the makers
and the users don't really want to think

7334
01:59:26,870 --> 01:59:26,880
and the users don't really want to think
 

7335
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,390
and the users don't really want to think
too much about

too much about

01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:29,990
too much about

01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,000
and that's where you step in and try to

01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:02,070
little bit of dynamic around this but
again it is a volunteer community

7372
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,080
again it is a volunteer community
 

7373
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,589
again it is a volunteer community
um you know

7374
02:00:03,589 --> 02:00:03,599
um you know
 

7375
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:04,470
um you know
people working on these different

7376
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:04,480
people working on these different
 

7377
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:05,910
people working on these different
projects have their own timelines and

7378
02:00:05,910 --> 02:00:05,920
projects have their own timelines and
 

7379
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,510
projects have their own timelines and
their own things they're trying to meet

7380
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:07,520
their own things they're trying to meet
 

7381
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,350
their own things they're trying to meet
so we end up

7382
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:09,360
so we end up
 

7383
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:11,350
so we end up
trying to pull these things together and

7384
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:11,360
trying to pull these things together and
 

7385
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:13,030
trying to pull these things together and
then it's it's just incredibly and i

7386
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:13,040
then it's it's just incredibly and i
 

7387
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,189
then it's it's just incredibly and i
would recommend just as a business tip

7388
02:00:15,189 --> 02:00:15,199
would recommend just as a business tip
 

7389
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:17,270
would recommend just as a business tip
don't ever go into business where when

7390
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,280
don't ever go into business where when
 

7391
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,350
don't ever go into business where when
your hard work works you're invisible

7392
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:19,360
your hard work works you're invisible
 

7393
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,790
your hard work works you're invisible
and when it breaks because of someone

7394
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:20,800
and when it breaks because of someone
 

7395
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,470
and when it breaks because of someone
else's problem you get

7396
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:22,480
else's problem you get
 

7397
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:23,830
else's problem you get
flack for it because that's that's for

7398
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:23,840
flack for it because that's that's for
 

7399
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,589
flack for it because that's that's for
our in our situation right when

7400
02:00:25,589 --> 02:00:25,599
our in our situation right when
 

7401
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:27,109
our in our situation right when
something doesn't install properly

7402
02:00:27,109 --> 02:00:27,119
something doesn't install properly
 

7403
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:29,109
something doesn't install properly
usually it's some upstream issue but it

7404
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:29,119
usually it's some upstream issue but it
 

7405
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:30,629
usually it's some upstream issue but it
looks like condo's broken it looks like

7406
02:00:30,629 --> 02:00:30,639
looks like condo's broken it looks like
 

7407
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:32,470
looks like condo's broken it looks like
you know anaconda screwed something up

7408
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:32,480
you know anaconda screwed something up
 

7409
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,990
you know anaconda screwed something up
when things do work though it's like oh

7410
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:34,000
when things do work though it's like oh
 

7411
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,750
when things do work though it's like oh
yeah cool it's worked assuming naturally

7412
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:35,760
yeah cool it's worked assuming naturally
 

7413
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:36,950
yeah cool it's worked assuming naturally
of course that's very easy to make that

7414
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:36,960
of course that's very easy to make that
 

7415
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:39,830
of course that's very easy to make that
work right so we end up in this kind of

7416
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:39,840
work right so we end up in this kind of
 

7417
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,030
work right so we end up in this kind of
um problematic scenario but uh but it's

7418
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:43,040
um problematic scenario but uh but it's
 

7419
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,030
um problematic scenario but uh but it's
okay because i think we're still um you

7420
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:45,040
okay because i think we're still um you
 

7421
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:46,790
okay because i think we're still um you
know our hearts in the right place we're

7422
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:46,800
know our hearts in the right place we're
 

7423
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,149
know our hearts in the right place we're
trying to move this forward as a

7424
02:00:48,149 --> 02:00:48,159
trying to move this forward as a
 

7425
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:49,669
trying to move this forward as a
community sort of affair i think most of

7426
02:00:49,669 --> 02:00:49,679
community sort of affair i think most of
 

7427
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:50,709
community sort of affair i think most of
the people in the community also

7428
02:00:50,709 --> 02:00:50,719
the people in the community also
 

7429
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:52,070
the people in the community also
appreciate the work we've done over the

7430
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:52,080
appreciate the work we've done over the
 

7431
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,830
appreciate the work we've done over the
years to try to move these things

7432
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:53,840
years to try to move these things
 

7433
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:56,310
years to try to move these things
forward in a in a collaborative fashion

7434
02:00:56,310 --> 02:00:56,320
forward in a in a collaborative fashion
 

7435
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,270
forward in a in a collaborative fashion
so

7436
02:00:57,270 --> 02:00:57,280
so
 

7437
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:58,950
so
one of the

7438
02:00:58,950 --> 02:00:58,960
one of the
 

7439
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,070
one of the
sub-graphs of dependencies that

7440
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:02,080
sub-graphs of dependencies that
 

7441
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,910
sub-graphs of dependencies that
became super complicated is the move

7442
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:03,920
became super complicated is the move
 

7443
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,990
became super complicated is the move
from python 2 to python 3. so there's

7444
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:06,000
from python 2 to python 3. so there's
 

7445
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,990
from python 2 to python 3. so there's
all these ways to mess with these kinds

7446
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:08,000
all these ways to mess with these kinds
 

7447
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,189
all these ways to mess with these kinds
of

7448
02:01:09,189 --> 02:01:09,199
of
 

7449
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,510
of
ecosystems of packages and so on so i

7450
02:01:11,510 --> 02:01:11,520
ecosystems of packages and so on so i
 

7451
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:12,550
ecosystems of packages and so on so i
just want to ask you about that

7452
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:12,560
just want to ask you about that
 

7453
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,950
just want to ask you about that
particular one what do you think about

7454
02:01:14,950 --> 02:01:14,960
particular one what do you think about
 

7455
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:17,750
particular one what do you think about
the move from python 2 to 3

7456
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:17,760
the move from python 2 to 3
 

7457
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:19,669
the move from python 2 to 3
now why did it take so long what were

7458
02:01:19,669 --> 02:01:19,679
now why did it take so long what were
 

7459
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:22,229
now why did it take so long what were
from your perspective just seeing the

7460
02:01:22,229 --> 02:01:22,239
from your perspective just seeing the
 

7461
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:24,310
from your perspective just seeing the
packages all struggle in the community

7462
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:24,320
packages all struggle in the community
 

7463
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,149
packages all struggle in the community
all struggle through this process

7464
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:26,159
all struggle through this process
 

7465
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:27,669
all struggle through this process
what lessons do you take away from it

7466
02:01:27,669 --> 02:01:27,679
what lessons do you take away from it
 

7467
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:29,350
what lessons do you take away from it
why did it take so long

7468
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:29,360
why did it take so long
 

7469
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,550
why did it take so long
looking back

7470
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:30,560
looking back
 

7471
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:33,350
looking back
some people perhaps underestimated

7472
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:33,360
some people perhaps underestimated
 

7473
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,550
some people perhaps underestimated
how much

7474
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,560
how much
 

7475
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,910
how much
adoption python 2 had

7476
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:37,920
adoption python 2 had
 

7477
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,270
adoption python 2 had
i think

7478
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:39,280
i think
 

7479
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:41,589
i think
some people also underestimated how much

7480
02:01:41,589 --> 02:01:41,599
some people also underestimated how much
 

7481
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:44,310
some people also underestimated how much
or they overestimated how much value

7482
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:44,320
or they overestimated how much value
 

7483
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:45,990
or they overestimated how much value
some of the new features in python 3

7484
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:46,000
some of the new features in python 3
 

7485
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,149
some of the new features in python 3
really provided like the things they

7486
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:48,159
really provided like the things they
 

7487
02:01:48,159 --> 02:01:49,990
really provided like the things they
really loved about python 3 just didn't

7488
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
really loved about python 3 just didn't
 

7489
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,270
really loved about python 3 just didn't
matter to some of these people in python

7490
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:51,280
matter to some of these people in python
 

7491
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:52,470
matter to some of these people in python
2. yeah

7492
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:52,480
2. yeah
 

7493
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:54,629
2. yeah
because this change was happening as

7494
02:01:54,629 --> 02:01:54,639
because this change was happening as
 

7495
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:56,310
because this change was happening as
python scipy

7496
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:56,320
python scipy
 

7497
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:58,229
python scipy
was starting to take off really like

7498
02:01:58,229 --> 02:01:58,239
was starting to take off really like
 

7499
02:01:58,239 --> 02:01:59,910
was starting to take off really like
past like a hockey stick of adoption in

7500
02:01:59,910 --> 02:01:59,920
past like a hockey stick of adoption in
 

7501
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,589
past like a hockey stick of adoption in
the early data science era in the early

7502
02:02:01,589 --> 02:02:01,599
the early data science era in the early
 

7503
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:02,790
the early data science era in the early
2010s

7504
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:02,800
2010s
 

7505
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,070
2010s
a lot of people were learning and

7506
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:04,080
a lot of people were learning and
 

7507
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:06,229
a lot of people were learning and
onboarding in whatever just worked and

7508
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,239
onboarding in whatever just worked and
 

7509
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:08,390
onboarding in whatever just worked and
the teachers were like well yeah these

7510
02:02:08,390 --> 02:02:08,400
the teachers were like well yeah these
 

7511
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:09,510
the teachers were like well yeah these
libraries i need are not supported on

7512
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:09,520
libraries i need are not supported on
 

7513
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:10,790
libraries i need are not supported on
python 3 yet i'm going to teach you

7514
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800
python 3 yet i'm going to teach you
 

7515
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,350
python 3 yet i'm going to teach you
python 2. it took a lot of advocacy to

7516
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:13,360
python 2. it took a lot of advocacy to
 

7517
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,830
python 2. it took a lot of advocacy to
get people to move over to python 3. so

7518
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:15,840
get people to move over to python 3. so
 

7519
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:18,070
get people to move over to python 3. so
i think it wasn't any particular single

7520
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:18,080
i think it wasn't any particular single
 

7521
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,229
i think it wasn't any particular single
thing but it was one of those death by

7522
02:02:20,229 --> 02:02:20,239
thing but it was one of those death by
 

7523
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:21,750
thing but it was one of those death by
you know a dozen cuts

7524
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:21,760
you know a dozen cuts
 

7525
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,990
you know a dozen cuts
which just really made it hard to move

7526
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:24,000
which just really made it hard to move
 

7527
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,109
which just really made it hard to move
off of python 2 and also python 3 itself

7528
02:02:27,109 --> 02:02:27,119
off of python 2 and also python 3 itself
 

7529
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:28,790
off of python 2 and also python 3 itself
as they were kind of breaking things and

7530
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:28,800
as they were kind of breaking things and
 

7531
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,990
as they were kind of breaking things and
changing these around reorganize the

7532
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:30,000
changing these around reorganize the
 

7533
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,189
changing these around reorganize the
standard library there's a lot of stuff

7534
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:31,199
standard library there's a lot of stuff
 

7535
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:32,870
standard library there's a lot of stuff
that was happening there

7536
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:32,880
that was happening there
 

7537
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,310
that was happening there
that

7538
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:34,320
that
 

7539
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:35,830
that
kept giving people an excuse to say i'll

7540
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:35,840
kept giving people an excuse to say i'll
 

7541
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,589
kept giving people an excuse to say i'll
put off to the next version

7542
02:02:37,589 --> 02:02:37,599
put off to the next version
 

7543
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:38,950
put off to the next version
2 is working fine enough for me right

7544
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:38,960
2 is working fine enough for me right
 

7545
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,790
2 is working fine enough for me right
now so i think that's essentially what

7546
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:40,800
now so i think that's essentially what
 

7547
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,550
now so i think that's essentially what
happened there and i will say this

7548
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:42,560
happened there and i will say this
 

7549
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,669
happened there and i will say this
though

7550
02:02:43,669 --> 02:02:43,679
though
 

7551
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,270
though
the strength of the python data science

7552
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:47,280
the strength of the python data science
 

7553
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,550
the strength of the python data science
movement

7554
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:48,560
movement
 

7555
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:49,669
movement
i think

7556
02:02:49,669 --> 02:02:49,679
i think
 

7557
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,270
i think
is what kept python alive in that

7558
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:51,280
is what kept python alive in that
 

7559
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,510
is what kept python alive in that
transition because a lot of languages

7560
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:53,520
transition because a lot of languages
 

7561
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:54,870
transition because a lot of languages
have died in

7562
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:54,880

7565
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:58,790

there wasn't the use of python for data

7566
02:02:58,790 --> 02:02:58,800
there wasn't the use of python for data
 

7567
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:01,030
there wasn't the use of python for data
there's a good chunk of python users

02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:01,040
there's a good chunk of python users
 

7569
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,870
there's a good chunk of python users
that during that transition would have

7570
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:02,880
that during that transition would have
 

7571
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,950
that during that transition would have
just left for go and rust and stayed in

7572
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:04,960
just left for go and rust and stayed in
 

7573
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,709
just left for go and rust and stayed in
fact some people did they moved to go

7574
02:03:06,709 --> 02:03:06,719
fact some people did they moved to go
 

7575
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:08,709
fact some people did they moved to go
and rust and they just never looked back

02:03:11,109 --> 02:03:11,119
the fact that we were able to grow

that is what kept the momentum for

02:03:17,189 --> 02:03:17,199
that is what kept the momentum for
 

7585
02:03:17,199 --> 02:03:19,350
that is what kept the momentum for
python going and now the usage of python

7586
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,360
python going and now the usage of python
 

7587
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,669
python going and now the usage of python
for data is over 50

so i will put i will make i'm happy to
 

7593
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,390
so i will put i will make i'm happy to
debate that on stage somewhere icon with

someone if they really want to take
 

7597
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:30,709
someone if they really want to take
issue with that statement but from my

7598
02:03:30,709 --> 02:03:30,719
issue with that statement but from my
 

7599
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:32,709
issue with that statement but from my
where i sit i think that's true the

7600
02:03:32,709 --> 02:03:32,719
where i sit i think that's true the
 

7601
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:34,709
where i sit i think that's true the
statement there the idea is that the

7602
02:03:34,709 --> 02:03:34,719
statement there the idea is that the
 

7603
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:37,830
statement there the idea is that the
switch from python 2 to python 3

7604
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:37,840
switch from python 2 to python 3
 

7605
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:40,550
switch from python 2 to python 3
would have probably destroyed python if

7606
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:40,560
would have probably destroyed python if
 

7607
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,390
would have probably destroyed python if
it didn't also coincide

7608
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:42,400
it didn't also coincide
 

7609
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,550
it didn't also coincide
with python for whatever

reason
 

7613
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:47,430
reason
just

7614
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:47,440
just
 

7615
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,589
just
overtaking the data science community

7616
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:49,599
overtaking the data science community
 

7617
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:51,910
overtaking the data science community
anything that processes data yeah so

7618
02:03:51,910 --> 02:03:51,920
anything that processes data yeah so
 

7619
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:54,069
anything that processes data yeah so
like the timing was perfect

7620
02:03:54,069 --> 02:03:54,079
like the timing was perfect
 

7621
02:03:54,079 --> 02:03:55,270
like the timing was perfect
that this

7622
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:55,280
that this
 

7623
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,669
that this
maybe imperfect decision was coupled

7624
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
maybe imperfect decision was coupled
 

7625
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,149
maybe imperfect decision was coupled
with the great timing and on the value

7626
02:04:00,149 --> 02:04:00,159
with the great timing and on the value
 

7627
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:02,310
with the great timing and on the value
of data in in our world i would say the

7628
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:02,320
of data in in our world i would say the
 

7629
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:04,629
of data in in our world i would say the
troubled execution of a good decision

7630
02:04:04,629 --> 02:04:04,639
troubled execution of a good decision
 

7631
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:07,270
troubled execution of a good decision
it was a decision that was necessary

7632
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:07,280
it was a decision that was necessary
 

7633
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,629
it was a decision that was necessary
it's possible if we had more resources

7634
02:04:08,629 --> 02:04:08,639
it's possible if we had more resources
 

7635
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:09,910
it's possible if we had more resources
we could have done in a way that was a

7636
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:09,920
we could have done in a way that was a
 

7637
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:12,310
we could have done in a way that was a
little bit smoother but ultimately you

7638
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:12,320
little bit smoother but ultimately you
 

7639
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,030
little bit smoother but ultimately you
know the the the arguments for python 3

7640
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:15,040
know the the the arguments for python 3
 

7641
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,629
know the the the arguments for python 3
i bought them at the time and i buy them

7642
02:04:16,629 --> 02:04:16,639
i bought them at the time and i buy them
 

7643
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:19,109
i bought them at the time and i buy them
now right having great text handling is

7644
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:19,119
now right having great text handling is
 

7645
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:21,430
now right having great text handling is
like a non-negotiable table stakes thing

7646
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:21,440
like a non-negotiable table stakes thing
 

7647
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,430
like a non-negotiable table stakes thing
you need to have in a language

7648
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:23,440
you need to have in a language
 

7649
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:26,069
you need to have in a language
so um so that's great um

7650
02:04:26,069 --> 02:04:26,079
so um so that's great um
 

7651
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:27,270
so um so that's great um
but

7652
02:04:27,270 --> 02:04:27,280
but
 

7653
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:31,270
but
uh the execution you know python is the

7654
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:31,280
uh the execution you know python is the
 

7655
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,270
uh the execution you know python is the
um it's volunteer driven it's like the

7656
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:33,280
um it's volunteer driven it's like the
 

7657
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:34,390
um it's volunteer driven it's like the
now the most popular language on the

7658
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:34,400
now the most popular language on the
 

7659
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:37,030
now the most popular language on the
planet but it's all literally volunteers

7660
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:37,040
planet but it's all literally volunteers
 

7661
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,030
planet but it's all literally volunteers
so the lack of resources meant that they

7662
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:39,040
so the lack of resources meant that they
 

7663
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:41,510
so the lack of resources meant that they
had to really they had to do things in a

7664
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:41,520
had to really they had to do things in a
 

7665
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:43,430
had to really they had to do things in a
very uh hamstrung way

7666
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:43,440
very uh hamstrung way
 

7667
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,910
very uh hamstrung way
and i think to carry the python momentum

7668
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:45,920
and i think to carry the python momentum
 

7669
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:47,750
and i think to carry the python momentum
and the language through that time the

7670
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:47,760
and the language through that time the
 

7671
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:49,430
and the language through that time the
data movement was a critical part of

7672
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:49,440
data movement was a critical part of
 

7673
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,510
data movement was a critical part of
that so some of it was karen stick i

7674
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:51,520
that so some of it was karen stick i
 

7675
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:54,470
that so some of it was karen stick i
actually have to uh

7676
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:54,480
actually have to uh
 

7677
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,470
actually have to uh
shamefully admit that it took me a very

7678
02:04:56,470 --> 02:04:56,480
shamefully admit that it took me a very
 

7679
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:57,990
shamefully admit that it took me a very
long time to switch from python 2 and

7680
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:58,000
long time to switch from python 2 and
 

7681
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,830
long time to switch from python 2 and
python 3 because i'm a machine learning

7682
02:04:59,830 --> 02:04:59,840
python 3 because i'm a machine learning
 

7683
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,830
python 3 because i'm a machine learning
person it was just for the longest time

7684
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:01,840
person it was just for the longest time
 

7685
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,750
person it was just for the longest time
you could just do fine with python 2.

7686
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:03,760
you could just do fine with python 2.
 

7687
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,030
you could just do fine with python 2.
right

7688
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:05,040
right
 

7689
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:08,310
right
but i think the moment where i switched

7690
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:08,320
but i think the moment where i switched
 

7691
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:10,950
but i think the moment where i switched
uh everybody i worked with and switched

7692
02:05:10,950 --> 02:05:10,960
uh everybody i worked with and switched
 

7693
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:11,990
uh everybody i worked with and switched
myself

7694
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:12,000
myself
 

7695
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,910
myself
for small projects and big

7696
02:05:13,910 --> 02:05:13,920
for small projects and big
 

7697
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,350
for small projects and big
is when

7698
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:15,360
is when
 

7699
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:17,669
is when
finally when numpy announced that

7700
02:05:17,669 --> 02:05:17,679
finally when numpy announced that
 

7701
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:20,790
finally when numpy announced that
they're going to end support uh like in

7702
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:20,800
they're going to end support uh like in
 

7703
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,030
they're going to end support uh like in
2020 or something like that right

7704
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:23,040
2020 or something like that right
 

7705
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,750
2020 or something like that right
so like when i i realized oh this isn't

7706
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:25,760
so like when i i realized oh this isn't
 

7707
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:27,750
so like when i i realized oh this isn't
going this is going to end right so

7708
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:27,760
going this is going to end right so
 

7709
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:29,589
going this is going to end right so
that's the stick that's not a carrot

7710
02:05:29,589 --> 02:05:29,599
that's the stick that's not a carrot
 

7711
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:31,189
that's the stick that's not a carrot
that's not so for longest time was

7712
02:05:31,189 --> 02:05:31,199
that's not so for longest time was
 

7713
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:33,109
that's not so for longest time was
carrots it was like all of these

7714
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:33,119
carrots it was like all of these
 

7715
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:35,270
carrots it was like all of these
packages were saying okay we have python

7716
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,280
packages were saying okay we have python
 

7717
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,510
packages were saying okay we have python
3 support now come join us we have

7718
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:37,520
3 support now come join us we have
 

7719
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,149
3 support now come join us we have
python 2 and python 3 but one numpy one

7720
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:40,159
python 2 and python 3 but one numpy one
 

7721
02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:41,669
python 2 and python 3 but one numpy one
of the packages i

7722
02:05:41,669 --> 02:05:41,679
of the packages i
 

7723
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:43,830
of the packages i
sort of love and depend on

7724
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:43,840
sort of love and depend on
 

7725
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,030
sort of love and depend on
uh

7726
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:45,040
uh
 

7727
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,669
uh
said like nope it's over

7728
02:05:47,669 --> 02:05:47,679
said like nope it's over
 

7729
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:49,189
said like nope it's over
that's that's when i

7730
02:05:49,189 --> 02:05:49,199
that's that's when i
 

7731
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:51,189
that's that's when i
uh decided to switch i wonder if you

7732
02:05:51,189 --> 02:05:51,199
uh decided to switch i wonder if you
 

7733
02:05:51,199 --> 02:05:52,069
uh decided to switch i wonder if you
think

7734
02:05:52,069 --> 02:05:52,079
think
 

7735
02:05:52,079 --> 02:05:53,990
think
it was possible much earlier for

7736
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:54,000
it was possible much earlier for
 

7737
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,350
it was possible much earlier for
somebody like uh like numpy or some

7738
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:57,360
somebody like uh like numpy or some
 

7739
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:59,430
somebody like uh like numpy or some
major package to

7740
02:05:59,430 --> 02:05:59,440
major package to
 

7741
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:01,669
major package to
step into the cold

7742
02:06:01,669 --> 02:06:01,679
step into the cold
 

7743
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:03,830
step into the cold
well it's like it's a chicken and egg

7744
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:03,840
well it's like it's a chicken and egg
 

7745
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,990
well it's like it's a chicken and egg
problem too right you don't want to cut

7746
02:06:05,990 --> 02:06:06,000
problem too right you don't want to cut
 

7747
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,990
problem too right you don't want to cut
off a lot of users unless you see the

7748
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:08,000
off a lot of users unless you see the
 

7749
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,550
off a lot of users unless you see the
user momentum going too so the decisions

7750
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,560
user momentum going too so the decisions
 

7751
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,189
user momentum going too so the decisions
for the scientific community for each of

7752
02:06:13,189 --> 02:06:13,199
for the scientific community for each of
 

7753
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:14,229
for the scientific community for each of
the different projects you know there's

7754
02:06:14,229 --> 02:06:14,239
the different projects you know there's
 

7755
02:06:14,239 --> 02:06:15,990
the different projects you know there's
not a monolith some projects are like

7756
02:06:15,990 --> 02:06:16,000
not a monolith some projects are like
 

7757
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,589
not a monolith some projects are like
we'll only be releasing new features on

7758
02:06:17,589 --> 02:06:17,599
we'll only be releasing new features on
 

7759
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:19,830
we'll only be releasing new features on
python three yeah and that was more of a

7760
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:19,840
python three yeah and that was more of a
 

7761
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:22,310
python three yeah and that was more of a
sticky carrot or yeah a firm carrot if

7762
02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:22,320
sticky carrot or yeah a firm carrot if
 

7763
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:26,149
sticky carrot or yeah a firm carrot if
you will a firm carrot um

7764
02:06:26,149 --> 02:06:26,159

 

7765
02:06:26,159 --> 02:06:28,550

a stick shaped carrot yeah but then for

7766
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:28,560
a stick shaped carrot yeah but then for
 

7767
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,709
a stick shaped carrot yeah but then for
others yeah numpy in particular because

7768
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
others yeah numpy in particular because
 

7769
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:32,550
others yeah numpy in particular because
it's at the base of the dependency stack

7770
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:32,560
it's at the base of the dependency stack
 

7771
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,229
it's at the base of the dependency stack
for so many things

7772
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:34,239
for so many things
 

7773
02:06:34,239 --> 02:06:36,310
for so many things
um that was the final stick that was a

7774
02:06:36,310 --> 02:06:36,320
um that was the final stick that was a
 

7775
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,990
um that was the final stick that was a
stick shaped stick people were saying

7776
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:38,000
stick shaped stick people were saying
 

7777
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,069
stick shaped stick people were saying
look if i have to keep maintaining my

7778
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:40,079
look if i have to keep maintaining my
 

7779
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:42,149
look if i have to keep maintaining my
releases for python 2 that's that much

7780
02:06:42,149 --> 02:06:42,159
releases for python 2 that's that much
 

7781
02:06:42,159 --> 02:06:43,430
releases for python 2 that's that much
less energy

7782
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:43,440
less energy
 

7783
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,510
less energy
that i can put into making things better

7784
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:45,520
that i can put into making things better
 

7785
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:47,750
that i can put into making things better
for the python 3 folks or in my new

7786
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:47,760
for the python 3 folks or in my new
 

7787
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:48,950
for the python 3 folks or in my new
version which is of course going to be

7788
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:48,960
version which is of course going to be
 

7789
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,350
version which is of course going to be
python 3. so people were also getting

7790
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:51,360
python 3. so people were also getting
 

7791
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,830
python 3. so people were also getting
kind of pulled by this tension so the

7792
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:53,840
kind of pulled by this tension so the
 

7793
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,750
kind of pulled by this tension so the
overall community sort of had a lot of

7794
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:55,760
overall community sort of had a lot of
 

7795
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:57,990
overall community sort of had a lot of
input into when the numpy core folks

7796
02:06:57,990 --> 02:06:58,000
input into when the numpy core folks
 

7797
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,229
input into when the numpy core folks
decided they would end of life

7798
02:07:00,229 --> 02:07:00,239
decided they would end of life
 

7799
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:03,030
decided they would end of life
on python 2. so as this these numbers

7800
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:03,040
on python 2. so as this these numbers
 

7801
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:04,629
on python 2. so as this these numbers
are a little bit loose but there are

7802
02:07:04,629 --> 02:07:04,639
are a little bit loose but there are
 

7803
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:06,790
are a little bit loose but there are
about 10 million python programmers in

7804
02:07:06,790 --> 02:07:06,800
about 10 million python programmers in
 

7805
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:08,229
about 10 million python programmers in
the world you could argue that number

7806
02:07:08,229 --> 02:07:08,239
the world you could argue that number
 

7807
02:07:08,239 --> 02:07:10,390
the world you could argue that number
but let's say 10 million uh that's

7808
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:10,400
but let's say 10 million uh that's
 

7809
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,350
but let's say 10 million uh that's
actually

7810
02:07:11,350 --> 02:07:11,360
actually
 

7811
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:14,390
actually
where i was looking to 27 million total

7812
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:14,400
where i was looking to 27 million total
 

7813
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:17,109
where i was looking to 27 million total
programmers developers in the world

7814
02:07:17,109 --> 02:07:17,119
programmers developers in the world
 

7815
02:07:17,119 --> 02:07:19,270
programmers developers in the world
you mentioned in the talk that uh

7816
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:19,280
you mentioned in the talk that uh
 

7817
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:21,430
you mentioned in the talk that uh
changes need to be made for there to be

7818
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,440
changes need to be made for there to be
 

7819
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,950
changes need to be made for there to be
100 million

7820
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:22,960
100 million
 

7821
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:25,510
100 million
programmers so first of all do you see a

7822
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:25,520
programmers so first of all do you see a
 

7823
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:27,109
programmers so first of all do you see a
future where there's a hundred million

7824
02:07:27,109 --> 02:07:27,119
future where there's a hundred million
 

7825
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:29,270
future where there's a hundred million
python programmers and second what kind

7826
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,280
python programmers and second what kind
 

7827
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,189
python programmers and second what kind
of changes need to be made

7828
02:07:31,189 --> 02:07:31,199
of changes need to be made
 

7829
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:33,030
of changes need to be made
so anaconda minicon to get downloaded

7830
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:33,040
so anaconda minicon to get downloaded
 

7831
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:34,870
so anaconda minicon to get downloaded
about a million times a week

7832
02:07:34,870 --> 02:07:34,880
about a million times a week
 

7833
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,510
about a million times a week
so i think the idea that there's only

7834
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:37,520
so i think the idea that there's only
 

7835
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,950
so i think the idea that there's only
10 million python programmers in the

7836
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:38,960
10 million python programmers in the
 

7837
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:41,830
10 million python programmers in the
world is a little bit under counting

7838
02:07:41,830 --> 02:07:41,840
world is a little bit under counting
 

7839
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,510
world is a little bit under counting
there are a lot of people who escape

7840
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:43,520
there are a lot of people who escape
 

7841
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:44,870
there are a lot of people who escape
traditional accounting

7842
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:44,880
traditional accounting
 

7843
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:47,350
traditional accounting
that are using python and data in their

7844
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:47,360
that are using python and data in their
 

7845
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,310
that are using python and data in their

i do believe that the future world for

7848
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:51,360
i do believe that the future world for

i do believe that the future world for
it to well the world i would like to see

7850
02:07:53,189 --> 02:07:53,199
it to well the world i would like to see
 

7851
02:07:53,199 --> 02:07:54,629
it to well the world i would like to see
is one where people

7852
02:07:54,629 --> 02:07:54,639
is one where people
 

7853
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:57,189
is one where people
are data literate so they are able to

7854
02:07:57,189 --> 02:07:57,199
are data literate so they are able to
 

7855
02:07:57,199 --> 02:07:59,669
are data literate so they are able to
use tools that let them express their

7856
02:07:59,669 --> 02:07:59,679
use tools that let them express their
 

7857
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:01,109
use tools that let them express their
questions and ideas

7858
02:08:01,109 --> 02:08:01,119
questions and ideas
 

7859
02:08:01,119 --> 02:08:02,390
questions and ideas
fluidly

7860
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:02,400
fluidly
 

7861
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:05,030
fluidly
um and the data variety and data

7862
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:05,040
um and the data variety and data
 

7863
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:06,709
um and the data variety and data
complexity will not go down it will only

7864
02:08:06,709 --> 02:08:06,719
complexity will not go down it will only
 

7865
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:10,790
complexity will not go down it will only
keep increasing so i think some level of

7866
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:10,800
keep increasing so i think some level of
 

7867
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,109
keep increasing so i think some level of
code or code like things will continue

7868
02:08:13,109 --> 02:08:13,119
code or code like things will continue
 

7869
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:14,069
code or code like things will continue
to

7870
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:14,079
to
 

7871
02:08:14,079 --> 02:08:15,430
to
be relevant

7872
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:15,440
be relevant
 

7873
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,030
be relevant
and so

7874
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:17,040
and so
 

7875
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,669
and so
my my hope is that we can build systems

7876
02:08:19,669 --> 02:08:19,679
my my hope is that we can build systems
 

7877
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:21,750
my my hope is that we can build systems
that allow people to more seamlessly

7878
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:21,760
that allow people to more seamlessly
 

7879
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:24,790
that allow people to more seamlessly
integrate python kinds of expressitivity

7880
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:24,800
integrate python kinds of expressitivity
 

7881
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,510
integrate python kinds of expressitivity
with data systems and operationalization

7882
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:27,520
with data systems and operationalization
 

7883
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:30,950
with data systems and operationalization
methods that are much more seamless

7884
02:08:30,950 --> 02:08:30,960
methods that are much more seamless
 

7885
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,229
methods that are much more seamless
and what i mean by that is you know

7886
02:08:32,229 --> 02:08:32,239
and what i mean by that is you know
 

7887
02:08:32,239 --> 02:08:33,990
and what i mean by that is you know
right now you can't punch python code

7888
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:34,000
right now you can't punch python code
 

7889
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,990
right now you can't punch python code
into an excel cell i mean there's some

7890
02:08:35,990 --> 02:08:36,000
into an excel cell i mean there's some
 

7891
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,750
into an excel cell i mean there's some
tools you can do to kind of do this

7892
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:37,760
tools you can do to kind of do this
 

7893
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:38,950
tools you can do to kind of do this
we didn't built a thing for doing this

7894
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:38,960
we didn't built a thing for doing this
 

7895
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:41,030
we didn't built a thing for doing this
back in the day but

7896
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:41,040
back in the day but
 

7897
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,430
back in the day but
but i feel like the total addressable

7898
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:43,440
but i feel like the total addressable
 

7899
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,830
but i feel like the total addressable
market for python users if we do the

7900
02:08:45,830 --> 02:08:45,840
market for python users if we do the
 

7901
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:48,069
market for python users if we do the
things right is on the order of the

7902
02:08:48,069 --> 02:08:48,079
things right is on the order of the
 

7903
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:49,830
things right is on the order of the
excel users which is you know a few

7904
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:49,840
excel users which is you know a few
 

7905
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:51,189
excel users which is you know a few
hundred million

7906
02:08:51,189 --> 02:08:51,199
hundred million
 

7907
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:52,790
hundred million
so um

7908
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:52,800
so um
 

7909
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,270
so um
i think python has to get better at

7910
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,280
i think python has to get better at
 

7911
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,189
i think python has to get better at
being embedded

7912
02:08:57,189 --> 02:08:57,199
being embedded
 

7913
02:08:57,199 --> 02:08:58,950
being embedded
you know being a smaller thing that

7914
02:08:58,950 --> 02:08:58,960
you know being a smaller thing that
 

7915
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:00,709
you know being a smaller thing that
pulls in just the right parts of the

7916
02:09:00,709 --> 02:09:00,719
pulls in just the right parts of the
 

7917
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:03,030
pulls in just the right parts of the
ecosystem to

7918
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:03,040
ecosystem to
 

7919
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,430
ecosystem to
run numerix and do data exploration

7920
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:05,440
run numerix and do data exploration
 

7921
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:07,750
run numerix and do data exploration
meeting people where they're already at

7922
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:07,760
meeting people where they're already at
 

7923
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,669
meeting people where they're already at
with their data and their data tools and

7924
02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
with their data and their data tools and
 

7925
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:11,830
with their data and their data tools and
then i think also

7926
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:11,840
then i think also
 

7927
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:13,189
then i think also
it has to be easier to take some of

7928
02:09:13,189 --> 02:09:13,199
it has to be easier to take some of
 

7929
02:09:13,199 --> 02:09:14,629
it has to be easier to take some of
those things they've written

7930
02:09:14,629 --> 02:09:14,639
those things they've written
 

7931
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:16,950
those things they've written
and flow those back into deployed

7932
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:16,960
and flow those back into deployed
 

7933
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:19,350
and flow those back into deployed
systems or apps or visualizations i

7934
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:19,360
systems or apps or visualizations i
 

7935
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,709
systems or apps or visualizations i
think if we don't do those things then

7936
02:09:20,709 --> 02:09:20,719
think if we don't do those things then
 

7937
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,149
think if we don't do those things then
we will always be

7938
02:09:22,149 --> 02:09:22,159
we will always be
 

7939
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:24,149
we will always be
kept in the silo as sort of a

7940
02:09:24,149 --> 02:09:24,159
kept in the silo as sort of a
 

7941
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:26,229
kept in the silo as sort of a
you know expert users tool and not a

7942
02:09:26,229 --> 02:09:26,239
you know expert users tool and not a
 

7943
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:28,069
you know expert users tool and not a
tool for the masses you know i work with

7944
02:09:28,069 --> 02:09:28,079
tool for the masses you know i work with
 

7945
02:09:28,079 --> 02:09:29,750
tool for the masses you know i work with
a bunch of folks in the

7946
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:29,760
a bunch of folks in the
 

7947
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,270
a bunch of folks in the
adobe

7948
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:31,280

creative suite and i'm kind of forcing

7950
02:09:34,229 --> 02:09:34,239
creative suite and i'm kind of forcing
 

7951
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:36,709
creative suite and i'm kind of forcing
them or inspired them to learn python uh

7952
02:09:36,709 --> 02:09:36,719
them or inspired them to learn python uh
 

7953
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:38,390
them or inspired them to learn python uh
to do a bunch of stuff that helps them

7954
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:38,400
to do a bunch of stuff that helps them
 

7955
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:39,430
to do a bunch of stuff that helps them
and it's interesting because they

7956
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:39,440
and it's interesting because they
 

7957
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:40,709
and it's interesting because they
probably wouldn't call themselves a

7958
02:09:40,709 --> 02:09:40,719
probably wouldn't call themselves a
 

7959
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:42,470
probably wouldn't call themselves a
python programmers but right while using

02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:42,480
python programmers but right while using
 

7961
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:43,669

i would love it if the tools like
 

7965
02:09:45,119 --> 02:09:46,790
i would love it if the tools like
photoshop and premiere and all those

7966
02:09:46,790 --> 02:09:46,800
photoshop and premiere and all those
 

7967
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:48,950
photoshop and premiere and all those
kinds of tools that are targeted towards

7968
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:48,960
kinds of tools that are targeted towards
 

7969
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,550
kinds of tools that are targeted towards
creative people i guess that's where

7970
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:50,560
creative people i guess that's where
 

7971
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:51,990
creative people i guess that's where

excel is targeted towards a certain kind
of audience that works for data

7976
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:55,440
of audience that works for data
 

7977

to generating programs to
 

8001
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:27,750
to generating programs to
something formal and then they can

02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:27,760
something formal and then they can
 

8003
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:30,550

a neural network does when it's doing

8012
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:37,280
a neural network does when it's doing

code generation uh is is actually

8014
02:10:40,229 --> 02:10:40,239
code generation uh is is actually
 

8015
02:10:40,239 --> 02:10:42,870
code generation uh is is actually
generating code and allowing a human to

8016
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:42,880
generating code and allowing a human to
 

8017
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,709
generating code and allowing a human to
communicate with multiple programs and

8018
02:10:44,709 --> 02:10:44,719
communicate with multiple programs and
 

8019
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:46,390
communicate with multiple programs and
then maybe even programs to communicate

8020
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:46,400
then maybe even programs to communicate
 

8021
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,709
then maybe even programs to communicate
with each other via python right so that

8022
02:10:48,709 --> 02:10:48,719
with each other via python right so that
 

8023
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:50,390
with each other via python right so that
that to me is a really exciting

8024
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:50,400
that to me is a really exciting
 

8025
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:53,910
that to me is a really exciting
possibility because i think there's a

8026
02:10:53,910 --> 02:10:53,920
possibility because i think there's a
 

8027
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:56,069
possibility because i think there's a
there's a friction to kind of like how

8028
02:10:56,069 --> 02:10:56,079
there's a friction to kind of like how
 

8029
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:58,709
there's a friction to kind of like how
do i learn how to use python in my life

8030
02:10:58,709 --> 02:10:58,719
do i learn how to use python in my life
 

8031
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:00,149
do i learn how to use python in my life
there's a

8032
02:11:00,149 --> 02:11:00,159
there's a
 

8033
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:02,470
there's a
oftentimes you kind of what start a

8034
02:11:02,470 --> 02:11:02,480
oftentimes you kind of what start a
 

8035
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:05,510
oftentimes you kind of what start a
class you start learning about types yes

8036
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:05,520
class you start learning about types yes
 

8037
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:06,950
class you start learning about types yes
i don't know functions

8038
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:06,960
i don't know functions
 

8039
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:08,709
i don't know functions
like this is you know python is the

8040
02:11:08,709 --> 02:11:08,719
like this is you know python is the
 

8041
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:10,390
like this is you know python is the
first language with which you start to

8042
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:10,400
first language with which you start to
 

8043
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:11,910
first language with which you start to
learn to program

8044
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:11,920
learn to program
 

8045
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:13,510
learn to program
but

8046
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:13,520
but
 

8047
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,830
but
i feel like that's going to take

8048
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
i feel like that's going to take
 

8049
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,510
i feel like that's going to take
a long time for you to understand why

8050
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:17,520
a long time for you to understand why
 

8051
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,270
a long time for you to understand why
it's useful you almost want to start

8052
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:19,280
it's useful you almost want to start
 

8053
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:22,069
it's useful you almost want to start
with a script well you you do in fact i

8054
02:11:22,069 --> 02:11:22,079
with a script well you you do in fact i
 

8055
02:11:22,079 --> 02:11:23,669
with a script well you you do in fact i
i think starting with the theory theory

8056
02:11:23,669 --> 02:11:23,679
i think starting with the theory theory
 

8057
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:25,109
i think starting with the theory theory
behind programming languages and types

8058
02:11:25,109 --> 02:11:25,119
behind programming languages and types
 

8059
02:11:25,119 --> 02:11:27,750
behind programming languages and types
and i mean types are there to make the

8060
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:27,760
and i mean types are there to make the
 

8061
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,310
and i mean types are there to make the
compiler writer's jobs easier types are

8062
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:30,320
compiler writer's jobs easier types are
 

8063
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,669
compiler writer's jobs easier types are
not i mean

8064
02:11:31,669 --> 02:11:31,679
not i mean
 

8065
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:32,950
not i mean
heck do you have an ontology of types

8066
02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:32,960
heck do you have an ontology of types
 

8067
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:35,430
heck do you have an ontology of types
for just the objects in this table no

8068
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:35,440
for just the objects in this table no
 

8069
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:38,229
for just the objects in this table no
so types are there because compiler

8070
02:11:38,229 --> 02:11:38,239
so types are there because compiler
 

8071
02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:39,669
so types are there because compiler
writers are human and they're limited in

8072
02:11:39,669 --> 02:11:39,679
writers are human and they're limited in
 

8073
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:41,510
writers are human and they're limited in
what they can do but

8074
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:41,520
what they can do but
 

8075
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:44,950
what they can do but
um i think that the beauty of scripting

8076
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:44,960
um i think that the beauty of scripting
 

8077
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,629
um i think that the beauty of scripting
like there's a there's a python book

8078
02:11:46,629 --> 02:11:46,639
like there's a there's a python book
 

8079
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:48,229
like there's a there's a python book
that's uh called automate the boring

8080
02:11:48,229 --> 02:11:48,239
that's uh called automate the boring
 

8081
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:49,109
that's uh called automate the boring
stuff

8082
02:11:49,109 --> 02:11:49,119
stuff
 

8083
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:52,149
stuff
which is exactly the right mentality um

8084
02:11:52,149 --> 02:11:52,159
which is exactly the right mentality um
 

8085
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:54,550
which is exactly the right mentality um
i grew up with computers in a time when

i grew up with computers in a time when
 

8087
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:55,830
i grew up with computers in a time when
i could

8099
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,189

write some code you could write basic
 

8103
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:07,669
write some code you could write basic
you could write some stuff to do some

8104
02:12:07,669 --> 02:12:07,679
you could write some stuff to do some
 

8105
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:08,870
you could write some stuff to do some
things

8106
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:08,880
things
 

8107
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,750
things
and that feeling of a computer as the

8108
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:11,760
and that feeling of a computer as the
 

8109
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,669
and that feeling of a computer as the
thing that we can use to extend

02:12:13,669 --> 02:12:13,679
thing that we can use to extend

02:12:40,069 --> 02:12:40,079
you talk about scripting the adobe suite
 

8139
02:12:40,079 --> 02:12:41,350
you talk about scripting the adobe suite
with python

8140

02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:46,790

02:12:49,109 --> 02:12:49,119
graphics suites use and i think that's
 

8147
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:50,229
graphics suites use and i think that's
great we should better support those

02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:11,109
backed with open ai with whatever so you
just say siri make this do this and

8170
02:13:11,109 --> 02:13:11,119
just say siri make this do this and
 

8171
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:12,870
just say siri make this do this and
every other friday right

8172
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:12,880
every other friday right
 

8173
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:14,229
every other friday right
we probably will get there somewhere and

8174
02:13:14,229 --> 02:13:14,239
we probably will get there somewhere and
 

8175
02:13:14,239 --> 02:13:15,750
we probably will get there somewhere and
apple's always had these ideas you know

8176
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:15,760
apple's always had these ideas you know
 

8177
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:17,669
apple's always had these ideas you know
there's the apple script in the menu

8178
02:13:17,669 --> 02:13:17,679
there's the apple script in the menu
 

8179
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:20,470
there's the apple script in the menu
that no one ever uses but um you can do

8180
02:13:20,470 --> 02:13:20,480
that no one ever uses but um you can do
 

8181
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:22,149
that no one ever uses but um you can do
these kinds of things but when you start

8182
02:13:22,149 --> 02:13:22,159
these kinds of things but when you start
 

8183
02:13:22,159 --> 02:13:23,750
these kinds of things but when you start
doing that kind of scripting the

8184
02:13:23,750 --> 02:13:23,760
doing that kind of scripting the
 

8185
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:25,750
doing that kind of scripting the
challenge isn't learning the type system

8186
02:13:25,750 --> 02:13:25,760
challenge isn't learning the type system
 

8187
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:27,189
challenge isn't learning the type system
or even the syntax of the language the

8188
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:27,199
or even the syntax of the language the
 

8189
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:28,229
or even the syntax of the language the
challenge is

8190
02:13:28,229 --> 02:13:28,239
challenge is
 

8191
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:29,510
challenge is
all of the dictionaries on all the

8192
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:29,520
all of the dictionaries on all the
 

8193
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:31,109
all of the dictionaries on all the
objects of all their properties and

8194
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:31,119
objects of all their properties and
 

8195
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:32,709
objects of all their properties and
attributes and parameters

8196
02:13:32,709 --> 02:13:32,719
attributes and parameters
 

8197
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:34,229
attributes and parameters
like who's got time to learn all that

8198
02:13:34,229 --> 02:13:34,239
like who's got time to learn all that
 

8199
02:13:34,239 --> 02:13:35,350
like who's got time to learn all that
stuff right

8200
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:35,360
stuff right
 

8201
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,750
stuff right
so that's when then programming by

8202
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:37,760
so that's when then programming by
 

8203
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:40,390
so that's when then programming by
prototype or by example becomes the

8204
02:13:40,390 --> 02:13:40,400
prototype or by example becomes the
 

8205
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:42,229
prototype or by example becomes the
right way to get the user to express

8206
02:13:42,229 --> 02:13:42,239
right way to get the user to express
 

8207
02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:43,589
right way to get the user to express
their desire

8208
02:13:43,589 --> 02:13:43,599
their desire
 

8209
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:44,550
their desire
so there's a lot of these these

8210
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:44,560
so there's a lot of these these
 

8211
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:45,589
so there's a lot of these these
different ways that we can approach

8212
02:13:45,589 --> 02:13:45,599
different ways that we can approach
 

8213
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,270
different ways that we can approach
programming but i do think

8214
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:47,280
programming but i do think
 

8215
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:48,790
programming but i do think
when as you were talking about the the

8216
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:48,800
when as you were talking about the the
 

8217
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:49,990
when as you were talking about the the
adobe scripting thing i was thinking

8218
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:50,000
adobe scripting thing i was thinking
 

8219
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,270
adobe scripting thing i was thinking
about you know

8220
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:51,280
about you know
 

8221
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,830
about you know
when we do use something like numpy when

8222
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:53,840
when we do use something like numpy when
 

8223
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:55,669
when we do use something like numpy when
we use things in the python data and

8224
02:13:55,669 --> 02:13:55,679
we use things in the python data and
 

8225
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:57,510
we use things in the python data and
scientific

8226
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:57,520
scientific
 

8227
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:00,069
scientific
let's say expression system

8228
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:00,079
let's say expression system
 

8229
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:01,510
let's say expression system
there's a reason we use that which is

8230
02:14:01,510 --> 02:14:01,520
there's a reason we use that which is
 

8231
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:04,310
there's a reason we use that which is
that it gives us mathematical precision

8232
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:04,320
that it gives us mathematical precision
 

8233
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:06,069
that it gives us mathematical precision
it gives us actually quite a lot of

8234
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:06,079
it gives us actually quite a lot of
 

8235
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:08,229
it gives us actually quite a lot of
precision over precisely what we mean

8236
02:14:08,229 --> 02:14:08,239
precision over precisely what we mean
 

8237
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:11,030
precision over precisely what we mean
about this data set that data set and

8238
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
about this data set that data set and
 

8239
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,390
about this data set that data set and
it's the fact that we can have that

8240
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:12,400
it's the fact that we can have that
 

8241
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:15,270
it's the fact that we can have that
precision that lets python be powerful

8242
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:15,280
precision that lets python be powerful
 

8243
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:16,229
precision that lets python be powerful
over

8244
02:14:16,229 --> 02:14:16,239
over

8248
02:14:21,109 --> 02:14:21,119
you know you give me a tsv or a csv
 

8249
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:23,430
you know you give me a tsv or a csv
and you if you give me some massively

02:14:28,470 --> 02:14:28,480
able to solve your problem but if you
 

8257
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,470
able to solve your problem but if you
give me a python prompt

8258
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480
give me a python prompt
 

8259
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,069
give me a python prompt
you can throw whatever data you want at

8260
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:32,079
you can throw whatever data you want at
 

8261
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:34,310
you can throw whatever data you want at
me i will be able to mash it into shape

8262

you know billions of neurons yes so how
 

8427
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,910
you know billions of neurons yes so how
can you have a swarm of people

8428
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:15,920
can you have a swarm of people
 

8429

will do this and most importantly we're
 

8435
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:23,750
will do this and most importantly we're
not going to do these things

8436
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:23,760
not going to do these things
 

8437

to do that kind of and then dissolve it
 

8445
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:35,910
to do that kind of and then dissolve it
so people can still do the swarm thing

8446
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:35,920
so people can still do the swarm thing
 

8447
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:37,270
so people can still do the swarm thing
that's a problem there's a question so

02:20:57,680 --> 02:20:58,870
works well in the programming world
would you say

8650
02:20:58,870 --> 02:20:58,880
would you say
 

8651
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:01,190
would you say
it really depends on the people what

8652
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:01,200
it really depends on the people what
 

8653
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:03,110
it really depends on the people what
style leadership is best and it depends

8654
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:03,120
style leadership is best and it depends
 

8655
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:04,389
style leadership is best and it depends
on the programming community i think for

8656
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:04,399
on the programming community i think for
 

8657
02:21:04,399 --> 02:21:06,550
on the programming community i think for
the python community um servant

8658
02:21:06,550 --> 02:21:06,560
the python community um servant
 

8659
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:08,469
the python community um servant
leadership is one of the values like at

8660
02:21:08,469 --> 02:21:08,479
leadership is one of the values like at
 

8661
02:21:08,479 --> 02:21:10,309
leadership is one of the values like at
the end of the day the leader has to

8662
02:21:10,309 --> 02:21:10,319
the end of the day the leader has to
 

8663
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:14,950
the end of the day the leader has to
also be um the high priest of values

8664
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:14,960
also be um the high priest of values
 

8665
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:16,950
also be um the high priest of values
right so any kind of

8666
02:21:16,950 --> 02:21:16,960
right so any kind of
 

8667
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:18,550
right so any kind of
any collection of people has values of

8668
02:21:18,550 --> 02:21:18,560
any collection of people has values of
 

8669
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:19,830
any collection of people has values of
their living

8670
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:19,840
their living
 

8671
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:22,230
their living
and if you want to

8672
02:21:22,230 --> 02:21:22,240
and if you want to
 

8673
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:23,510
and if you want to
maintain

8674
02:21:23,510 --> 02:21:23,520
maintain
 

8675
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:25,349
maintain
uh certain values and those values help

8676
02:21:25,349 --> 02:21:25,359
uh certain values and those values help
 

8677
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:27,429
uh certain values and those values help
you as an organization become more

8678
02:21:27,429 --> 02:21:27,439
you as an organization become more
 

8679
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:29,349
you as an organization become more
powerful then the leader has to live

8680
02:21:29,349 --> 02:21:29,359
powerful then the leader has to live
 

8681
02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:32,309
powerful then the leader has to live
those values unequivocally and has to

8682
02:21:32,309 --> 02:21:32,319
those values unequivocally and has to
 

8683
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:34,389
those values unequivocally and has to
you know has to hold the values

8684
02:21:34,389 --> 02:21:34,399
you know has to hold the values
 

8685
02:21:34,399 --> 02:21:36,950
you know has to hold the values
so in our case in this collaborative

8686
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:36,960
so in our case in this collaborative
 

8687
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:39,110
so in our case in this collaborative
community around python

8688
02:21:39,110 --> 02:21:39,120
community around python
 

8689
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:40,550
community around python
i think

8690
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:40,560
i think
 

8691
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,790
i think
that the humility is one of those values

8692
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:42,800
that the humility is one of those values
 

8693
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:44,230
that the humility is one of those values
servant leadership you actually have to

8694
02:21:44,230 --> 02:21:44,240
servant leadership you actually have to
 

8695
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:45,990
servant leadership you actually have to
kind of do the stuff you have to walk

8696
02:21:45,990 --> 02:21:46,000
kind of do the stuff you have to walk
 

8697
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,870
kind of do the stuff you have to walk
the walk not just talk the talk

8698
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:48,880
the walk not just talk the talk
 

8699
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:51,030
the walk not just talk the talk
i don't feel like the python community

8700
02:21:51,030 --> 02:21:51,040
i don't feel like the python community
 

8701
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:52,790
i don't feel like the python community
really demands that much from a vision

8702
02:21:52,790 --> 02:21:52,800
really demands that much from a vision
 

8703
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:55,030
really demands that much from a vision
standpoint and they should and i think

8704
02:21:55,030 --> 02:21:55,040
standpoint and they should and i think
 

8705
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:57,030
standpoint and they should and i think
they should

8706
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:57,040
they should
 

8707
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,950
they should
this is the interesting thing is

8708
02:21:58,950 --> 02:21:58,960
this is the interesting thing is
 

8709
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:00,150
this is the interesting thing is
like so

8710
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:00,160
like so
 

8711
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:03,270
like so
many people use python from where comes

8712
02:22:03,270 --> 02:22:03,280
many people use python from where comes
 

8713
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:04,550
many people use python from where comes
the vision

8714
02:22:04,550 --> 02:22:04,560
the vision
 

8715
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:07,110
the vision
you know like you have a elon musk type

8716
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:07,120
you know like you have a elon musk type
 

8717
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:10,790
you know like you have a elon musk type
character who has makes bold statements

8718
02:22:10,790 --> 02:22:10,800
character who has makes bold statements
 

8719
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,710
character who has makes bold statements
about the vision for particular

8720
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:12,720
about the vision for particular
 

8721
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:14,550
about the vision for particular
companies he's involved with

8722
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:14,560
companies he's involved with
 

8723
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:16,309
companies he's involved with
and it's like

8724
02:22:16,309 --> 02:22:16,319
and it's like
 

8725
02:22:16,319 --> 02:22:18,710
and it's like
i think a lot of people that work at

8726
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:18,720
i think a lot of people that work at
 

8727
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:21,110
i think a lot of people that work at
those companies

8728
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:21,120
those companies
 

8729
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:23,110
those companies
kind of can only last if they believe

8730
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:23,120
kind of can only last if they believe
 

8731
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:24,230
kind of can only last if they believe
that vision

8732
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:24,240
that vision
 

8733
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:26,790
that vision
because and some of it is super bold so

8734
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:26,800
because and some of it is super bold so
 

8735
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,790
because and some of it is super bold so
my question is and by the way those

8736
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:28,800
my question is and by the way those
 

8737
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:31,429
my question is and by the way those
companies often use python uh

8738
02:22:31,429 --> 02:22:31,439
companies often use python uh
 

8739
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:33,349
companies often use python uh
what you know how do you establish a

8740
02:22:33,349 --> 02:22:33,359
what you know how do you establish a
 

8741
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:35,910
what you know how do you establish a
vision like get to 100 million users

8742
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:35,920
vision like get to 100 million users
 

8743
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:37,270
vision like get to 100 million users
right

8744
02:22:37,270 --> 02:22:37,280
right
 

8745
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:39,349
right
get to where

8746
02:22:39,349 --> 02:22:39,359
get to where
 

8747
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:42,150
get to where
you know the python is at the center

8748
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:42,160
you know the python is at the center
 

8749
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:43,270
you know the python is at the center
of

8750
02:22:43,270 --> 02:22:43,280
of
 

8751
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:45,750
of
the machine learning and

8752
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:45,760
the machine learning and
 

8753
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:47,270
the machine learning and
was it data science machine learning

8754
02:22:47,270 --> 02:22:47,280
was it data science machine learning
 

8755
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:49,830
was it data science machine learning
deep learning artificial intelligence

8756
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:49,840
deep learning artificial intelligence
 

8757
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:51,110
deep learning artificial intelligence
revolution

8758
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:51,120
revolution
 

8759
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:52,550
revolution
right like

8760
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:52,560
right like
 

8761
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,469
right like
in many ways perhaps the python

8762
02:22:54,469 --> 02:22:54,479
in many ways perhaps the python
 

8763
02:22:54,479 --> 02:22:55,750
in many ways perhaps the python
community is not thinking of it that way

8764
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:55,760
community is not thinking of it that way
 

8765
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:58,070
community is not thinking of it that way
but it's leading the way on this

8766
02:22:58,070 --> 02:22:58,080
but it's leading the way on this
 

8767
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:01,110
but it's leading the way on this
like the the tooling is like essential

8768
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:01,120
like the the tooling is like essential
 

8769
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:03,990
like the the tooling is like essential
right well you know for a while um pycon

8770
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:04,000
right well you know for a while um pycon
 

8771
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,830
right well you know for a while um pycon
people in the scientific python and the

8772
02:23:05,830 --> 02:23:05,840
people in the scientific python and the
 

8773
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:07,349
people in the scientific python and the
pi data community

8774
02:23:07,349 --> 02:23:07,359
pi data community
 

8775
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:09,670
pi data community
um they would submit talks those early

8776
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:09,680
um they would submit talks those early
 

8777
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:12,230
um they would submit talks those early
to early 2010s mid-2010s they would

8778
02:23:12,230 --> 02:23:12,240
to early 2010s mid-2010s they would
 

8779
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:13,990
to early 2010s mid-2010s they would
submit talks for pycon

8780
02:23:13,990 --> 02:23:14,000
submit talks for pycon
 

8781
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,670
submit talks for pycon
and the talks would all be rejected

8782
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:15,680
and the talks would all be rejected
 

8783
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:17,429
and the talks would all be rejected
because there was the separate sort of

8784
02:23:17,429 --> 02:23:17,439
because there was the separate sort of
 

8785
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:19,270
because there was the separate sort of
pi data conferences and like well these

8786
02:23:19,270 --> 02:23:19,280
pi data conferences and like well these
 

8787
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:21,190
pi data conferences and like well these
these probably belong more to pi data

8788
02:23:21,190 --> 02:23:21,200
these probably belong more to pi data
 

8789
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:22,630
these probably belong more to pi data
and instead there'd be yet another talk

8790
02:23:22,630 --> 02:23:22,640
and instead there'd be yet another talk
 

8791
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,469
and instead there'd be yet another talk
about you know threads and

8792
02:23:24,469 --> 02:23:24,479
about you know threads and
 

8793
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:26,469
about you know threads and
you know whatever some web framework and

8794
02:23:26,469 --> 02:23:26,479
you know whatever some web framework and
 

8795
02:23:26,479 --> 02:23:28,469
you know whatever some web framework and
it's like um that was an interesting

8796
02:23:28,469 --> 02:23:28,479
it's like um that was an interesting
 

8797
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:29,830
it's like um that was an interesting
dynamic to see

8798
02:23:29,830 --> 02:23:29,840
dynamic to see
 

8799
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:31,830
dynamic to see
that there was i mean at the time it was

8800
02:23:31,830 --> 02:23:31,840
that there was i mean at the time it was
 

8801
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:33,270
that there was i mean at the time it was
a little annoying because we want to try

8802
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:33,280
a little annoying because we want to try
 

8803
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:34,790
a little annoying because we want to try
to get more users and get more people

8804
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:34,800
to get more users and get more people
 

8805
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:36,230
to get more users and get more people
talking about these things and pycon is

8806
02:23:36,230 --> 02:23:36,240
talking about these things and pycon is
 

8807
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:37,990
talking about these things and pycon is
a huge venue right it's

8808
02:23:37,990 --> 02:23:38,000
a huge venue right it's
 

8809
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,550
a huge venue right it's
thousands of python programmers but then

8810
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:40,560

stratified and classist society there's
 

9401
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:16,389
stratified and classist society there's
some mobility but but it's really quite

9402
02:33:16,389 --> 02:33:16,399
some mobility but but it's really quite

you are headed into very choppy waters
so it is really really good to think and

02:33:26,309 --> 02:33:26,319
so it is really really good to think and
 

9411
02:33:26,319 --> 02:33:28,389
so it is really really good to think and
understand the fundamentals of what you

understand the fundamentals of what you
 

9413
02:33:28,399 --> 02:33:31,349
understand the fundamentals of what you
need to build a meaningful life

9414

um
and almost all of the technology being

02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:39,429
and almost all of the technology being
created that's consumer facing

9422

is designed to own people

9424
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:41,680
is designed to own people
 

9425
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:44,469
is designed to own people
to take the four stack you know of

9426
02:33:44,469 --> 02:33:44,479
to take the four stack you know of
 

9427
02:33:44,479 --> 02:33:48,150
to take the four stack you know of
people to delaminate them and to own

9428
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:48,160
people to delaminate them and to own
 

9429
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:50,150
people to delaminate them and to own
certain portions of that stack

9430
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,160
certain portions of that stack
 

9431
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:51,429
certain portions of that stack
and so if you want to be an integral

9432
02:33:51,429 --> 02:33:51,439
and so if you want to be an integral
 

9433
02:33:51,439 --> 02:33:53,750
and so if you want to be an integral
human being if you want to have your

find your own way in the world you know

9438
02:33:57,510 --> 02:33:57,520
find your own way in the world you know
 

9439
02:33:57,520 --> 02:33:59,590
find your own way in the world you know
when you're young would be a great time

more and more technology
 

9461
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:19,830
more and more technology
there's a gradient technology and a

02:34:19,830 --> 02:34:19,840
there's a gradient technology and a
 

9463
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:21,270
there's a gradient technology and a
gradient technology always leads to

gradient of power and this is

9466
02:34:23,030 --> 02:34:23,040
gradient of power and this is
 

9467
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:24,389

so avoiding those kinds of things

9510
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:06,560
so avoiding those kinds of things

kinds of things that are getting
um in the supply chain disruptions

9734
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:36,720
um in the supply chain disruptions
 

9735
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:38,309
um in the supply chain disruptions
getting more people to think about how

9736

getting more people to think about how
 

9737

but the concern is that
 

9743
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:47,429
but the concern is that
it's still going to take a while for

9744
02:38:47,429 --> 02:38:47,439
it's still going to take a while for

maybe when you see something beautiful
 

9873
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:54,710
maybe when you see something beautiful
or maybe you have created something

9874
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:54,720
or maybe you have created something
 

9875

it feels like
it all makes sense

9880
02:41:02,469 --> 02:41:02,479
it all makes sense
 

9881
02:41:02,479 --> 02:41:03,910
it all makes sense
so some of that is just chemicals coming

9882
02:41:03,910 --> 02:41:03,920
so some of that is just chemicals coming
 

9883
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:05,510
so some of that is just chemicals coming
together in your mind and all kinds of

9884
02:41:05,510 --> 02:41:05,520
together in your mind and all kinds of
 

9885

9887
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:07,269
things
but

9888
02:41:07,269 --> 02:41:07,279
but
 

9889
02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:08,790
but
it seems like we're building a

9890
02:41:08,790 --> 02:41:08,800
it seems like we're building a
 

9891

it seems like we're building a

sophisticated
 

9893
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:12,790
sophisticated
uh collective intelligence that's

9894
02:41:12,790 --> 02:41:12,800
uh collective intelligence that's
 

9895
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:15,349
uh collective intelligence that's
providing meaning in all kinds of ways

9896
02:41:15,349 --> 02:41:15,359
providing meaning in all kinds of ways
 

9897
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:17,030
providing meaning in all kinds of ways
it's it's members

9898
02:41:17,030 --> 02:41:17,040
it's it's members
 

9899
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:17,830
it's it's members
and

9900
02:41:17,830 --> 02:41:17,840
and
 

9901
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:18,550
and
it

9902
02:41:18,550 --> 02:41:18,560
it
 

9903
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:20,950
it
there's a theme to that meaning so for

i think technology in the modern era is
 

9917
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:35,030
i think technology in the modern era is
kind of serving a little bit of a source

9918
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:35,040
kind of serving a little bit of a source
 

9919
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:36,790
kind of serving a little bit of a source
of meaning for people like innovation of

02:41:36,790 --> 02:41:36,800
of meaning for people like innovation of
 

9921
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:39,590
of meaning for people like innovation of
different kinds

9922

i think the old school

9924
02:41:41,349 --> 02:41:41,359
i think the old school
 

9925
02:41:41,359 --> 02:41:43,349
i think the old school
things of love

9926
02:41:43,349 --> 02:41:43,359
things of love
 

9927
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:45,750
things of love
and the basics of just being good at

9928
02:41:45,750 --> 02:41:45,760
and the basics of just being good at
 

9929
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:47,510
and the basics of just being good at
stuff

9930
02:41:47,510 --> 02:41:47,520
stuff
 

9931
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,550
stuff
but

9932
02:41:48,550 --> 02:41:48,560
but
 

9933
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:50,150
but
you were a physicist

9934
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:50,160
you were a physicist
 

9935
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:52,790
you were a physicist
so there's a desire to say okay yeah but

9936
02:41:52,790 --> 02:41:52,800
so there's a desire to say okay yeah but
 

9937
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:54,389
so there's a desire to say okay yeah but
these seem to be like symptoms of

9938
02:41:54,389 --> 02:41:54,399
these seem to be like symptoms of
 

9939
02:41:54,399 --> 02:41:56,230
these seem to be like symptoms of
something deeper

9940
02:41:56,230 --> 02:41:56,240
something deeper
 

9941
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:58,230
something deeper
right like why little meaning what's

9942
02:41:58,230 --> 02:41:58,240
right like why little meaning what's
 

9943
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:00,070
right like why little meaning what's
capital m yeah what's capital i'm

9944
02:42:00,070 --> 02:42:00,080
capital m yeah what's capital i'm
 

9945
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:02,950
capital m yeah what's capital i'm
meaning why are we reaching for order

9946
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:02,960
meaning why are we reaching for order
 

9947
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:06,790
meaning why are we reaching for order
when there is excess of energy

9948
02:42:06,790 --> 02:42:06,800
when there is excess of energy
 

9949
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:09,190
when there is excess of energy
i don't know if i can answer the why

9950
02:42:09,190 --> 02:42:09,200
i don't know if i can answer the why
 

9951
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:10,710
i don't know if i can answer the why
any y that i come up with i think is

9952
02:42:10,710 --> 02:42:10,720
any y that i come up with i think is
 

9953
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:13,510
any y that i come up with i think is
gonna be um

9954
02:42:13,510 --> 02:42:13,520
gonna be um
 

9955
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:15,110
gonna be um
i i'd have to think about that a little

9956
02:42:15,110 --> 02:42:15,120
i i'd have to think about that a little
 

9957
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:16,870
i i'd have to think about that a little
more maybe maybe get back to you on that

9958
02:42:16,870 --> 02:42:16,880
more maybe maybe get back to you on that
 

9959
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:19,190
more maybe maybe get back to you on that
but i will say this

9960
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:19,200
but i will say this
 

9961
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:21,429
but i will say this
we do look at the world through

9962
02:42:21,429 --> 02:42:21,439
we do look at the world through
 

9963
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:23,030
we do look at the world through
a traditional i think most people look

9964
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:23,040
a traditional i think most people look
 

9965
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:24,870
a traditional i think most people look
at the world through what i would say is

9966
02:42:24,870 --> 02:42:24,880
at the world through what i would say is
 

9967
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:26,790
at the world through what i would say is
a subject object kind of a metaphysical

9968
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:26,800
a subject object kind of a metaphysical
 

9969
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:29,510
a subject object kind of a metaphysical
lens that we have our own subjectivity

9970
02:42:29,510 --> 02:42:29,520
lens that we have our own subjectivity
 

9971
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:31,190
lens that we have our own subjectivity
and then there's

9972
02:42:31,190 --> 02:42:31,200
and then there's
 

9973
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:32,469
and then there's
there's all of these

9974
02:42:32,469 --> 02:42:32,479
there's all of these
 

9975
02:42:32,479 --> 02:42:34,710
there's all of these
object things that are not us so i'm i'm

9976
02:42:34,710 --> 02:42:34,720
object things that are not us so i'm i'm
 

9977
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:36,630
object things that are not us so i'm i'm
me and this is these things are not me

9978
02:42:36,630 --> 02:42:36,640
me and this is these things are not me
 

9979
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:38,070
me and this is these things are not me
right and i'm interacting with them i'm

9980
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:38,080
right and i'm interacting with them i'm
 

9981
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:40,469
right and i'm interacting with them i'm
doing things to them but a different

9982
02:42:40,469 --> 02:42:40,479
doing things to them but a different
 

9983
02:42:40,479 --> 02:42:42,389
doing things to them but a different
view of the world that looks at it as

9984
02:42:42,389 --> 02:42:42,399
view of the world that looks at it as
 

9985
02:42:42,399 --> 02:42:44,150
view of the world that looks at it as
much more connected

9986
02:42:44,150 --> 02:42:44,160
much more connected
 

9987
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:46,950
much more connected
that realizes oh i'm

9988
02:42:46,950 --> 02:42:46,960
that realizes oh i'm
 

9989
02:42:46,960 --> 02:42:48,150
that realizes oh i'm
i'm really

9990
02:42:48,150 --> 02:42:48,160
i'm really
 

9991
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:50,469
i'm really
quite embedded in a soup of other things

9992
02:42:50,469 --> 02:42:50,479
quite embedded in a soup of other things
 

9993
02:42:50,479 --> 02:42:51,910
quite embedded in a soup of other things
and i'm simply

9994
02:42:51,910 --> 02:42:51,920
and i'm simply
 

9995
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:53,910
and i'm simply
um almost like a standing wave pattern

9996
02:42:53,910 --> 02:42:53,920
um almost like a standing wave pattern
 

9997
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:55,670
um almost like a standing wave pattern
of different things right

9998
02:42:55,670 --> 02:42:55,680
of different things right
 

9999
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:56,469
of different things right
um

10000
02:42:56,469 --> 02:42:56,479
um
 

10001
02:42:56,479 --> 02:42:58,070
um
so when you look at the world in that

10002
02:42:58,070 --> 02:42:58,080
so when you look at the world in that
 

10003
02:42:58,080 --> 02:42:59,670
so when you look at the world in that
kind of connected sense i

10004
02:42:59,670 --> 02:42:59,680
kind of connected sense i
 

10005
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:02,150
kind of connected sense i
i i've recently taken

10006
02:43:02,150 --> 02:43:02,160
i i've recently taken
 

10007
02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:03,910
i i've recently taken
a shine to this particular thought

10008
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:03,920
a shine to this particular thought
 

10009
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:05,590
a shine to this particular thought
experiment which is

10010
02:43:05,590 --> 02:43:05,600
experiment which is
 

10011
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:08,550
experiment which is
what if it was the case

10012
02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:08,560
what if it was the case
 

10013
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:09,910
what if it was the case
that

10014
02:43:09,910 --> 02:43:09,920
that
 

10015
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,230
that
everything that we touch with our hands

10016
02:43:12,230 --> 02:43:12,240
everything that we touch with our hands
 

10017
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:14,070
everything that we touch with our hands
that we pay attention to that we

10018
02:43:14,070 --> 02:43:14,080
that we pay attention to that we
 

10019
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,230
that we pay attention to that we
actually give intimacy to

10020
02:43:16,230 --> 02:43:16,240
actually give intimacy to
 

10021
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:18,469
actually give intimacy to
what if there's actually

10022
02:43:18,469 --> 02:43:18,479
what if there's actually
 

10023
02:43:18,479 --> 02:43:22,070
what if there's actually
you know all the mumbo-jumbo like you

10024
02:43:22,070 --> 02:43:22,080
you know all the mumbo-jumbo like you
 

10025
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:22,710
you know all the mumbo-jumbo like you
know

10026
02:43:22,710 --> 02:43:22,720
know
 

10027
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:24,389
know
people with the magnetic healing

10028
02:43:24,389 --> 02:43:24,399
people with the magnetic healing
 

10029
02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:25,670
people with the magnetic healing
crystals and all this other kind of

10030
02:43:25,670 --> 02:43:25,680
crystals and all this other kind of
 

10031
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:28,150
crystals and all this other kind of
stuff and quantum energy stuff

10032
02:43:28,150 --> 02:43:28,160
stuff and quantum energy stuff
 

10033
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:30,150
stuff and quantum energy stuff
what if that was a thing

10034
02:43:30,150 --> 02:43:30,160
what if that was a thing
 

10035
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:32,230
what if that was a thing
what if when you literally when your

10036
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:32,240
what if when you literally when your
 

10037
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:34,550
what if when you literally when your
hand touches an object when you really

10038
02:43:34,550 --> 02:43:34,560
hand touches an object when you really
 

10039
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:35,990
hand touches an object when you really
look at something and you concentrate

10040
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:36,000
look at something and you concentrate
 

10041
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,429
look at something and you concentrate
and you focus on it and you really give

10042
02:43:37,429 --> 02:43:37,439
and you focus on it and you really give
 

10043
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:38,870
and you focus on it and you really give
it attention

10044
02:43:38,870 --> 02:43:38,880
it attention
 

10045
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:41,349
it attention
you actually give it there is some

10046
02:43:41,349 --> 02:43:41,359
you actually give it there is some
 

10047
02:43:41,359 --> 02:43:43,269
you actually give it there is some
physical residue

10048
02:43:43,269 --> 02:43:43,279
physical residue
 

10049
02:43:43,279 --> 02:43:45,510
physical residue
of something a part of you

10050
02:43:45,510 --> 02:43:45,520
of something a part of you
 

10051
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:47,590
of something a part of you
a bit of your life force that goes into

10052
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:47,600
a bit of your life force that goes into
 

10053
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:48,389
a bit of your life force that goes into
it

10054
02:43:48,389 --> 02:43:48,399
it
 

10055
02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:50,469
it
okay now this is of course completely

10056
02:43:50,469 --> 02:43:50,479
okay now this is of course completely
 

10057
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:51,990
okay now this is of course completely
mumbo jumbo stuff this is not like i

10058
02:43:51,990 --> 02:43:52,000
mumbo jumbo stuff this is not like i
 

10059
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,150
mumbo jumbo stuff this is not like i
don't actually think this is real but

10060
02:43:54,150 --> 02:43:54,160
don't actually think this is real but
 

10061
02:43:54,160 --> 02:43:55,990
don't actually think this is real but
let's do the thought experiment what if

10062
02:43:55,990 --> 02:43:56,000
let's do the thought experiment what if
 

10063
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,510
let's do the thought experiment what if
it was

10064
02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:57,520
it was
 

10065
02:43:57,520 --> 02:43:59,429
it was
what if there actually was

10066
02:43:59,429 --> 02:43:59,439
what if there actually was
 

10067
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:01,830
what if there actually was
some the quantum magnetic crystal and

10068
02:44:01,830 --> 02:44:01,840
some the quantum magnetic crystal and
 

10069
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:04,309
some the quantum magnetic crystal and
you know energy field thing that just by

10070
02:44:04,309 --> 02:44:04,319
you know energy field thing that just by
 

10071
02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:07,030
you know energy field thing that just by
touching this can this can has

10072
02:44:07,030 --> 02:44:07,040
touching this can this can has
 

10073
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:08,870
touching this can this can has
changed a little bit somehow

10074
02:44:08,870 --> 02:44:08,880
changed a little bit somehow
 

10075
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:10,389
changed a little bit somehow
and it's not much

10076
02:44:10,389 --> 02:44:10,399
and it's not much
 

10077
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:11,990
and it's not much
unless you put a lot into it and you

10078
02:44:11,990 --> 02:44:12,000
unless you put a lot into it and you
 

10079
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,150
unless you put a lot into it and you
touch it all the time like your phone

10080
02:44:14,150 --> 02:44:14,160
touch it all the time like your phone
 

10081
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:14,870
touch it all the time like your phone
right

10082
02:44:14,870 --> 02:44:14,880
right
 

10083
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:16,790
right
these things gained they gave meaning to

10084
02:44:16,790 --> 02:44:16,800
these things gained they gave meaning to
 

10085
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:18,710
these things gained they gave meaning to
you a little bit

10086
02:44:18,710 --> 02:44:18,720
you a little bit
 

10087
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:19,510
you a little bit
um

10088
02:44:19,510 --> 02:44:19,520
um
 

10089
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:21,750
um
but what if there's something

10090
02:44:21,750 --> 02:44:21,760
but what if there's something
 

10091
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:23,349
but what if there's something
that

10092
02:44:23,349 --> 02:44:23,359
that
 

10093
02:44:23,359 --> 02:44:24,469
that
technical objects the phone is a

10094
02:44:24,469 --> 02:44:24,479
technical objects the phone is a
 

10095
02:44:24,479 --> 02:44:26,389
technical objects the phone is a
technical object it does not really

10096
02:44:26,389 --> 02:44:26,399
technical object it does not really
 

10097
02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:27,590
technical object it does not really
receive

10098
02:44:27,590 --> 02:44:27,600
receive
 

10099
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:29,590
receive
attention or intimacy and then allow

10100
02:44:29,590 --> 02:44:29,600
attention or intimacy and then allow
 

10101
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:32,070
attention or intimacy and then allow
itself to be transformed by it but if

10102
02:44:32,070 --> 02:44:32,080
itself to be transformed by it but if
 

10103
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:33,990
itself to be transformed by it but if
it's a piece of wood if it's the handle

10104
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:34,000
it's a piece of wood if it's the handle
 

10105
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,670
it's a piece of wood if it's the handle
of a knife that your mother used for 20

10106
02:44:37,670 --> 02:44:37,680
of a knife that your mother used for 20
 

10107
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:40,309
of a knife that your mother used for 20
years to make dinner for you right

10108
02:44:40,309 --> 02:44:40,319
years to make dinner for you right
 

10109
02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:41,670
years to make dinner for you right
what if it's

10110
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:41,680
what if it's
 

10111
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:43,990
what if it's
a keyboard that you banged out your

10112
02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:44,000
a keyboard that you banged out your
 

10113
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,550
a keyboard that you banged out your
world transforming software library on

10114
02:44:46,550 --> 02:44:46,560
world transforming software library on
 

10115
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:47,910
world transforming software library on
these are technical objects and these

10116
02:44:47,910 --> 02:44:47,920
these are technical objects and these
 

10117
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:49,429
these are technical objects and these
are physical objects but

10118
02:44:49,429 --> 02:44:49,439
are physical objects but
 

10119
02:44:49,439 --> 02:44:51,510
are physical objects but
somehow there's something to them we

10120
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:51,520
somehow there's something to them we
 

10121
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:53,510
somehow there's something to them we
feel an attraction to these objects as

10122
02:44:53,510 --> 02:44:53,520
feel an attraction to these objects as
 

10123
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:55,910
feel an attraction to these objects as
if we have imbued them with life energy

10124
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:55,920
if we have imbued them with life energy
 

10125
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,990
if we have imbued them with life energy
yeah right so if you walk that thought

10126
02:44:57,990 --> 02:44:58,000
yeah right so if you walk that thought
 

10127
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:59,269
yeah right so if you walk that thought
experiment through what happens when we

10128
02:44:59,269 --> 02:44:59,279
experiment through what happens when we
 

10129
02:44:59,279 --> 02:45:00,870
experiment through what happens when we
touch another person when we hug them

10130
02:45:00,870 --> 02:45:00,880
touch another person when we hug them
 

10131
02:45:00,880 --> 02:45:03,030
touch another person when we hug them
when we hold them

10132
02:45:03,030 --> 02:45:03,040
when we hold them
 

10133
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:04,550
when we hold them
and it

10134
02:45:04,550 --> 02:45:04,560
and it
 

10135
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:06,950
and it
the the reason this ties into my answer

10136
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:06,960
the the reason this ties into my answer
 

10137
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:11,269
the the reason this ties into my answer
for your question is that um

10138
02:45:11,269 --> 02:45:11,279

 

10139
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:12,230

there's

10140
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:12,240
there's
 

10141
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:14,070
there's
if there is such a thing if we were to

10142
02:45:14,070 --> 02:45:14,080
if there is such a thing if we were to
 

10143
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:15,910
if there is such a thing if we were to
hypothesize uh you know hypothetically

10144
02:45:15,910 --> 02:45:15,920
hypothesize uh you know hypothetically
 

10145
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:17,349
hypothesize uh you know hypothetically
it's such a thing

10146
02:45:17,349 --> 02:45:17,359
it's such a thing
 

10147
02:45:17,359 --> 02:45:18,389
it's such a thing
um

10148
02:45:18,389 --> 02:45:18,399
um
 

10149
02:45:18,399 --> 02:45:19,750
um
it could be

10150
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:19,760
it could be
 

10151
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:20,870
it could be
that

10152
02:45:20,870 --> 02:45:20,880
that
 

10153
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:23,349
that
the purpose of our lives

10154
02:45:23,349 --> 02:45:23,359
the purpose of our lives
 

10155
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:26,309
the purpose of our lives
is to imbue as many things with that

10156
02:45:26,309 --> 02:45:26,319
is to imbue as many things with that
 

10157
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:30,550
is to imbue as many things with that
love as possible
