00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
nerding out about
 

173
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,670
nerding out about
yeah interesting i think a lot of us

174
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
yeah interesting i think a lot of us
 

175
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,550
yeah interesting i think a lot of us
have been inspired by robots in movies

176
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
have been inspired by robots in movies
 

177
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,589
have been inspired by robots in movies
the one that i really like is uh

178
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
the one that i really like is uh
 

179
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,270
the one that i really like is uh
there's a movie called robot and frank

180
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
there's a movie called robot and frank
 

181
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,390
there's a movie called robot and frank
which i think is really interesting

182
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
which i think is really interesting
 

183
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,309
which i think is really interesting
because it's very near-term

184
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
because it's very near-term
 

185
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,190
because it's very near-term
future where uh robots are being

186
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
future where uh robots are being
 

187
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,229
future where uh robots are being
deployed as

188
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
deployed as
 

189
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,110
deployed as
uh helpers in people's homes and it was

190
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
uh helpers in people's homes and it was
 

191
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,990
uh helpers in people's homes and it was
it was

192
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
it was
 

193
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,350
it was
and we don't know how to make robots

194
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
and we don't know how to make robots
 

195
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,949
and we don't know how to make robots
like that at this point but it seemed

196
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
like that at this point but it seemed
 

197
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,430
like that at this point but it seemed
very plausible it seemed very

198
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
very plausible it seemed very
 

199
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,830
very plausible it seemed very
realistic or imaginable and i thought

200
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
realistic or imaginable and i thought
 

201
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,190
realistic or imaginable and i thought
that was really cool because

202
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
that was really cool because
 

203
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,949
that was really cool because
they did they're awkward they do funny

204
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
they did they're awkward they do funny
 

205
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,550
they did they're awkward they do funny
things it raised some interesting issues

206
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
things it raised some interesting issues
 

207
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:28,869
things it raised some interesting issues
but

208
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
but
 

209
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,229
but
it seemed like something that would

210
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
it seemed like something that would
 

211
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,830
it seemed like something that would
ultimately be helpful and good if we

212
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
ultimately be helpful and good if we
 

213
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,869
ultimately be helpful and good if we
could do it right

214
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
could do it right
 

215
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,630
could do it right
yeah he was an older cranky gentleman

216
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
yeah he was an older cranky gentleman
 

217
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,910
yeah he was an older cranky gentleman
right he was an older cranky

218
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
right he was an older cranky
 

219
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,710
right he was an older cranky
uh jewel thief yeah it's kind of funny

220
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
uh jewel thief yeah it's kind of funny
 

221
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,270
uh jewel thief yeah it's kind of funny
little

222
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
little
 

223
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,270
little
thing which is you know he's a dual

224
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
thing which is you know he's a dual
 

225
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,390
thing which is you know he's a dual
thief and so he

226
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
thief and so he
 

227
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,509
thief and so he
pulls the robot into his life which is

228
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
pulls the robot into his life which is
 

229
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,869
pulls the robot into his life which is
like which is something you could

230
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
like which is something you could
 

231
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,990
like which is something you could
imagine

232
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
imagine
 

233
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,350
imagine
taking a home robotics thing

234
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
taking a home robotics thing
 

235
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,390
taking a home robotics thing
and pulling into whatever quirky thing

236
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
and pulling into whatever quirky thing
 

237
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,070
and pulling into whatever quirky thing
that's involved in your this is

238
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
that's involved in your this is
 

239
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,309
that's involved in your this is
meaningful to you exactly so yeah and i

240
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
meaningful to you exactly so yeah and i
 

241
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,830
meaningful to you exactly so yeah and i
think i think from that perspective i

242
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
think i think from that perspective i
 

243
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,270
think i think from that perspective i
mean not all of us are jewel thieves and

244
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
mean not all of us are jewel thieves and
 

245
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,710
mean not all of us are jewel thieves and
so when we bring our robots into

246
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
so when we bring our robots into
 

247
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,070
so when we bring our robots into
it for yourself uh explains a lot about

248
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
it for yourself uh explains a lot about
 

249
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,670
it for yourself uh explains a lot about
this apartment actually

250
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
this apartment actually
 

251
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,990
this apartment actually
but no the idea that that people should

252
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
but no the idea that that people should
 

253
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,429
but no the idea that that people should
have the ability to

254
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
have the ability to
 

255
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,910
have the ability to
you know make this technology their own

256
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
you know make this technology their own
 

257
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,670
you know make this technology their own
that that it becomes part of their lives

258
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
that that it becomes part of their lives
 

259
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,349
that that it becomes part of their lives
and and i think that's

260
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
and and i think that's
 

261
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,349
and and i think that's
it's hard for us as technologists to

262
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
it's hard for us as technologists to
 

263
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,949
it's hard for us as technologists to
make that kind of technology it's easier

264
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
make that kind of technology it's easier
 

265
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,950
make that kind of technology it's easier
to mold people into what we need them to

266
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
to mold people into what we need them to
 

267
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,590
to mold people into what we need them to
be

268
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
be
 

269
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,830
be
and um just that opposite vision i think

270
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
and um just that opposite vision i think
 

271
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,950
and um just that opposite vision i think
is really inspiring

272
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
is really inspiring
 

273
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,430
is really inspiring
and then there's a anthropomorphization

274
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
and then there's a anthropomorphization
 

275
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,390
and then there's a anthropomorphization
where we project

276
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
where we project
 

277
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,070
where we project
certain things on them because i think

278
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
certain things on them because i think
 

279
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,670
certain things on them because i think
the robot was kind of dumb

280
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
the robot was kind of dumb
 

281
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,110
the robot was kind of dumb
but i have a bunch of roombas that play

282
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
but i have a bunch of roombas that play
 

283
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,670
but i have a bunch of roombas that play
with and they you immediately project

284
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
with and they you immediately project
 

285
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,670
with and they you immediately project
stuff onto them much greater level of

286
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
stuff onto them much greater level of
 

287
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,189
stuff onto them much greater level of
intelligence we'll probably do that with

288
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
intelligence we'll probably do that with
 

289
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,150
intelligence we'll probably do that with
each other too

290
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
each other too
 

291
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,790
each other too
much much greater degree of compass

292
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
much much greater degree of compass
 

293
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,749
much much greater degree of compass
that's right one of the things we're

294
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
that's right one of the things we're
 

295
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,189
that's right one of the things we're
learning from ai is

296
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
learning from ai is
 

297
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,870
learning from ai is
where we are smart and where we are not

298
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
where we are smart and where we are not
 

299
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,950
where we are smart and where we are not
smart yeah

300
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
smart yeah
 

301
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,950
smart yeah
you also enjoy as people can see

302
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
you also enjoy as people can see
 

303
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,749
you also enjoy as people can see
and i enjoyed myself uh watching you

304
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
and i enjoyed myself uh watching you
 

305
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,550
and i enjoyed myself uh watching you
sing

306
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
sing
 

307
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,150
sing
and even dance a little bit a little bit

308
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
and even dance a little bit a little bit
 

309
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,230
and even dance a little bit a little bit
a little bit a little bit of dancing

310
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
a little bit a little bit of dancing
 

311
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,670
a little bit a little bit of dancing
a little bit of dancing that's not quite

312
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
a little bit of dancing that's not quite
 

313
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,710
a little bit of dancing that's not quite
my thing as a as a method of education

314
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
my thing as a as a method of education
 

315
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,230
my thing as a as a method of education
or just in life you know in general

316
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
or just in life you know in general
 

317
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,590
or just in life you know in general
so easy question what's the

318
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
so easy question what's the
 

319
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,230
so easy question what's the
definitive objectively speaking top

320
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
definitive objectively speaking top
 

321
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,670
definitive objectively speaking top
three songs of all time

322
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
three songs of all time
 

323
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,710
three songs of all time
maybe something that you know uh

324
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
maybe something that you know uh
 

325
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,790
maybe something that you know uh
to walk that back a little bit maybe

326
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
to walk that back a little bit maybe
 

327
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,830
to walk that back a little bit maybe
something that

328
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
something that
 

329
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,469
something that
others might be surprised by the three

330
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
others might be surprised by the three
 

331
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,469
others might be surprised by the three
three songs that you kind of enjoy

332
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
three songs that you kind of enjoy
 

333
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,469
three songs that you kind of enjoy
that is a great question that i cannot

334
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
that is a great question that i cannot
 

335
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,150
that is a great question that i cannot

a little blurb about each one and why i
 

607
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,670
a little blurb about each one and why i
thought

608
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680

songs i did
 

1021
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,590
songs i did
is is about the halting problem in

1022
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
is is about the halting problem in
 

1023
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,670
is is about the halting problem in
computer science the the fact that

1024
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
computer science the the fact that
 

1025
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,110
computer science the the fact that
you can't create a program that can tell

1026
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
you can't create a program that can tell
 

1027
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,189
you can't create a program that can tell
for any other arbitrary program whether

1028
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
for any other arbitrary program whether
 

1029
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,310
for any other arbitrary program whether
it actually going to get stuck in

1030
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
it actually going to get stuck in
 

1031
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,590
it actually going to get stuck in
infinite loop or whether it's going to

1032
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
infinite loop or whether it's going to
 

1033
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,350
infinite loop or whether it's going to
eventually stop

1034
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
eventually stop
 

1035
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,389
eventually stop
and so i i did it to an 80s song

because first of all it rhymes uh not

1052
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
because first of all it rhymes uh not
 

1053

because first of all it rhymes uh not
all songs rhyme i did i've done

rolling stone songs which turn out to

1056
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
rolling stone songs which turn out to
 

1057
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,750
rolling stone songs which turn out to
have no rhyme scheme whatsoever they're

1058
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
have no rhyme scheme whatsoever they're
 

1059
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,150
have no rhyme scheme whatsoever they're
just

1060
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
just
 

1061
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,309
just
sort of yelling and having a good time

1062
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
sort of yelling and having a good time
 

1063
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,069
sort of yelling and having a good time
which makes it not fun from a parody

1064
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
which makes it not fun from a parody
 

1065
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,189
which makes it not fun from a parody
perspective because like you can say

1066
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
perspective because like you can say
 

1067
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:15,590
perspective because like you can say
anything

1068
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
anything
 

1069
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,029
anything
but this you know the lines rhymed and

1070
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
but this you know the lines rhymed and
 

1071
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,470
but this you know the lines rhymed and
there was a lot of internal rhymes as

1072
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
there was a lot of internal rhymes as
 

1073
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:18,949

internal rhymes
 

1079
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,470
internal rhymes
a proof of the halting problem was

1080
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
a proof of the halting problem was
 

1081
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,829
a proof of the halting problem was
really challenging and

1082
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
really challenging and
 

1083
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,069
really challenging and
it was i really enjoyed that process

you think maybe an artificial
intelligence machine learning

1170
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
intelligence machine learning
 

1171
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,310
intelligence machine learning
maybe in life that you believe is true

1172

cal do you know okay so calvin's dad is
 

1189
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,750
cal do you know okay so calvin's dad is
always kind of a bit of a foil and he

always kind of a bit of a foil and he
 

1191
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,510
always kind of a bit of a foil and he

from another perspective and calvin like

1198
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
from another perspective and calvin like
 

1199
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,710
from another perspective and calvin like

it's it becomes like a cubist cartoon
 

1207
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,990
it's it becomes like a cubist cartoon
where there is no front and back

1208
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
where there is no front and back
 

1209
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,430
where there is no front and back
everything's just exposed

1210
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
everything's just exposed

and it really freaks him out and finally
he settles back down it's like oh good

1214
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
he settles back down it's like oh good

i've formed opinions about that i
 

1227
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,669
i've formed opinions about that i
would be harder i think to disavow me of

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
would be harder i think to disavow me of
 

1229
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,789
would be harder i think to disavow me of
one is um the super intelligence

1230
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:56,799
one is um the super intelligence
 

1231
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,310
one is um the super intelligence
argument and the existential

1232
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
argument and the existential

confident
 

1237
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,149
confident
in my feeling about that one like i'm

1238
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
in my feeling about that one like i'm
 

1239
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,310
in my feeling about that one like i'm
willing to hear other arguments but like

1240
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
willing to hear other arguments but like
 

1241
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,110
willing to hear other arguments but like
i am not particularly moved by the idea

1242
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
that
 

1245
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,430
that
if we're not careful we will

1246
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
if we're not careful we will
 

1247
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,669
if we're not careful we will
accidentally create a super intelligence

1248
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
accidentally create a super intelligence
 

1249
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,710
accidentally create a super intelligence
that will destroy

1250
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
that will destroy
 

1251
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,310
that will destroy
human life let's talk about that let's

1252

human life let's talk about that let's
get you in trouble and record your video

1254
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
get you in trouble and record your video
 

1255
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,909

it's like bill gates uh i think he said

1256
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
it's like bill gates uh i think he said
 

1257
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,230
it's like bill gates uh i think he said
like

1258
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
like
 

1259
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,909
like
some quote about the internet that

1260
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
some quote about the internet that
 

1261
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,070
some quote about the internet that
that's just gonna be a small thing it's

1262
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
that's just gonna be a small thing it's
 

1263
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,669
that's just gonna be a small thing it's
not gonna really go anywhere

1264
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
not gonna really go anywhere
 

1265
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,710
not gonna really go anywhere
and i think uh steve ballmer said uh

1266
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
and i think uh steve ballmer said uh
 

1267
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,669
and i think uh steve ballmer said uh
i don't know why i'm sticking on

1268
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
i don't know why i'm sticking on
 

1269

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
that like smartphones are useless
 

1273
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,710
that like smartphones are useless
there's no reason why microsoft should

1274
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
there's no reason why microsoft should
 

1275
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,470
there's no reason why microsoft should
get into smartphones that kind of

1276
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
get into smartphones that kind of
 

1277
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,270

so let's get let's talk about agi as agi

1278
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
so let's get let's talk about agi as agi
 

1279
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,950
so let's get let's talk about agi as agi
is destroying the world we'll look back

1280
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
is destroying the world we'll look back
 

1281
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,230
is destroying the world we'll look back
at this video and see

1282
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
at this video and see
 

1283
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,909
at this video and see
no uh i think it's really interesting to

1284
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
no uh i think it's really interesting to
 

1285
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,350
no uh i think it's really interesting to
actually talk about because nobody

1286
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
actually talk about because nobody
 

1287
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,990
actually talk about because nobody
really

1288
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
really
 

1289
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,350
really
knows the future so you have to use your

1290
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
knows the future so you have to use your
 

1291
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,110
knows the future so you have to use your
best intuition it's very

1292
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
best intuition it's very
 

1293
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,710
best intuition it's very
difficult to predict it but you have

1294
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
difficult to predict it but you have
 

1295
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,350
difficult to predict it but you have
spoken about agi

1296
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
spoken about agi
 

1297
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,310
spoken about agi

can you maybe uh unpack that a little

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,750
can you maybe uh unpack that a little
bit yeah sure so

1312
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
bit yeah sure so
 

1313
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,870
bit yeah sure so
so as as i understand it that

1314
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
so as as i understand it that
 

1315
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,909
so as as i understand it that
uh for example i read boston's book and

1316
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
uh for example i read boston's book and
 

1317

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
and if you're a deep believer in the
 

1459
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,789
and if you're a deep believer in the
power of ideas

1460
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
power of ideas
 

1461
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,789
power of ideas
then it's really natural to believe that

1462
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
then it's really natural to believe that
 

1463
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,390
then it's really natural to believe that
those ideas could

1464
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
those ideas could
 

1465
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,750
those ideas could
be taken to the extreme and kill us

1466
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
be taken to the extreme and kill us
 

1467
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,590
be taken to the extreme and kill us
so i think you know his strength is also

1468
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
so i think you know his strength is also
 

1469
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,269
so i think you know his strength is also
his undoing because

1470
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,279
his undoing because
 

1471
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,029
his undoing because
that doesn't mean it's true like it

1472
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
that doesn't mean it's true like it
 

1473
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,710
that doesn't mean it's true like it
doesn't mean that that has to happen

1474
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
doesn't mean that that has to happen
 

1475
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,789
doesn't mean that that has to happen
but it's natural for him to think that

1476
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
but it's natural for him to think that
 

1477
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,750
but it's natural for him to think that
so

1478
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
so
 

1479
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,669
so
another way to phrase the way he thinks

1480
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
another way to phrase the way he thinks
 

1481
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,950
another way to phrase the way he thinks
and

1482
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
and
 

1483
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,669
and
i find it very difficult to argue with

1484
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
i find it very difficult to argue with
 

1485
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:03,990
i find it very difficult to argue with
that

1486
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
that
 

1487
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,630
that
line of thinking uh so sam harris is

1488
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
line of thinking uh so sam harris is
 

1489
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,430
line of thinking uh so sam harris is
another person

1490
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
another person
 

1491
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,789
another person
from neuroscience perspective that

1492
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
from neuroscience perspective that
 

1493
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,269
from neuroscience perspective that
things like that is

1494
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279
things like that is
 

1495
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,590
things like that is
saying well is there something

1496
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
saying well is there something
 

1497
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,350
saying well is there something
fundamental

1498
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
fundamental
 

1499
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,269
fundamental
in the physics of the universe that

1500
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:17,279
in the physics of the universe that
 

1501
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,070
in the physics of the universe that
prevents this from eventually happening

1502
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,080
prevents this from eventually happening
 

1503
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,070
prevents this from eventually happening
and this nebosh from things in the same

1504
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
and this nebosh from things in the same
 

1505
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,070
and this nebosh from things in the same
way they're kind of zooming out

1506
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,080
way they're kind of zooming out
 

1507
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,750
way they're kind of zooming out
yeah okay we humans now uh are existing

1508
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
yeah okay we humans now uh are existing
 

1509
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,470
yeah okay we humans now uh are existing
in this

1510
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
in this
 

1511
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,190
in this
like time scale of minutes and days and

1512
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
like time scale of minutes and days and
 

1513
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,750
like time scale of minutes and days and
so our

1514
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760
so our
 

1515
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,070
so our
intuition is in this time scale of

1516
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
intuition is in this time scale of
 

1517
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,750
intuition is in this time scale of
minutes hours and days

1518
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
minutes hours and days
 

1519
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,909
minutes hours and days
but if you look at the span of human

1520
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
but if you look at the span of human
 

1521
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,190
but if you look at the span of human
history

1522
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
history
 

1523
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,230
history
is there any reason we you

1524
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
is there any reason we you
 

1525
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,269
is there any reason we you
can't see this in in 100 years and

1526
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
can't see this in in 100 years and
 

1527
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,029
can't see this in in 100 years and
like is there is there something

1528
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
like is there is there something
 

1529
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,549
like is there is there something
fundamental about the laws of physics

1530
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
fundamental about the laws of physics
 

1531
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,430
fundamental about the laws of physics
that prevent this

1532
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
that prevent this
 

1533
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,350
that prevent this
and if it doesn't then it eventually

1534
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
and if it doesn't then it eventually
 

1535
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,029
and if it doesn't then it eventually
will happen or will

1536
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
will happen or will
 

1537
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,710
will happen or will
we will destroy ourselves in some other

1538
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
we will destroy ourselves in some other
 

1539
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,710
we will destroy ourselves in some other
way it's very difficult

1540
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
way it's very difficult
 

1541
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,430
way it's very difficult
i find to actually argue against that

1542
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
i find to actually argue against that
 

1543
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,950
i find to actually argue against that
yeah

1544
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
yeah
 

1545
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,950
yeah
me too and not sound like

1546
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
me too and not sound like
 

1547
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,950
me too and not sound like
not sound like you're just like rolling

1548
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
not sound like you're just like rolling
 

1549
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,789
not sound like you're just like rolling
your eyes uh i'm like i have

1550
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799
your eyes uh i'm like i have
 

1551
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,390
your eyes uh i'm like i have
like science fiction we don't have to

1552
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,400
like science fiction we don't have to
 

1553
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,990
like science fiction we don't have to
think about it but even even

1554
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
think about it but even even
 

1555
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,590
think about it but even even
worse than that which is like i don't

1556
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
worse than that which is like i don't
 

1557
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,510
worse than that which is like i don't
know kids but like i gotta pick up my

1558
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
know kids but like i gotta pick up my
 

1559
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,350
know kids but like i gotta pick up my
kids now like this okay i see there's

1560
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
kids now like this okay i see there's
 

1561
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,710
kids now like this okay i see there's
more pressing shortcuts yeah there's

1562
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:20,720
more pressing shortcuts yeah there's
 

1563
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,390
more pressing shortcuts yeah there's
more pressing short-term things that

1564
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
more pressing short-term things that
 

1565
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,110
more pressing short-term things that
like

1566
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
like
 

1567
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,950
like
uh stop over this existential crisis

1568
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
uh stop over this existential crisis
 

1569
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,870
uh stop over this existential crisis
where much much shorter things like

1570
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
where much much shorter things like
 

1571
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,870
where much much shorter things like
now especially this year there's cova so

1572
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
now especially this year there's cova so
 

1573
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,350
now especially this year there's cova so
like any kind of discussion like that is

1574
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
like any kind of discussion like that is
 

1575
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,510
like any kind of discussion like that is
like there's there's p you know there's

1576
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
like there's there's p you know there's
 

1577
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,549
like there's there's p you know there's
pressing things

1578
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
pressing things
 

1579
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,590
pressing things
uh today it's it's and then so the sam

1580
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,600
uh today it's it's and then so the sam
 

1581
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,110
uh today it's it's and then so the sam
harris argument well like

1582
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
harris argument well like
 

1583
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,710
harris argument well like
any day the exponential singularity

1584
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
any day the exponential singularity
 

1585
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,190
any day the exponential singularity
can can occur it's very difficult to

1586
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
can can occur it's very difficult to
 

1587
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,789
can can occur it's very difficult to
argue against i mean i don't know but

1588
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
argue against i mean i don't know but
 

1589
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,789
argue against i mean i don't know but
part of his story is also

1590
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:48,799
part of his story is also
 

1591
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,470
part of his story is also
he's he's not going to put a date on it

1592
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
he's he's not going to put a date on it
 

1593
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,830
he's he's not going to put a date on it
it could be in a thousand years it could

1594
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
it could be in a thousand years it could
 

1595
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,510
it could be in a thousand years it could
be in 100 years it could be in two years

1596
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
be in 100 years it could be in two years
 

1597
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,350
be in 100 years it could be in two years
it's just that as long as we keep making

1598
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,360
it's just that as long as we keep making
 

1599
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,390
it's just that as long as we keep making
this kind of progress

1600
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
this kind of progress
 

1601
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,669
this kind of progress
it's ultimately has to become a concern

1602
00:25:59,669 --> 00:25:59,679
it's ultimately has to become a concern
 

1603
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,350
it's ultimately has to become a concern
i i kind of am on board with that but

1604
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
i i kind of am on board with that but
 

1605
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,029
i i kind of am on board with that but
the thing that the the piece that i feel

1606
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
the thing that the the piece that i feel
 

1607
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,549
the thing that the the piece that i feel
like is missing from that

1608
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
like is missing from that
 

1609
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,390
like is missing from that
that way of extrapolating from the

1610
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,400
that way of extrapolating from the
 

1611
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,230
that way of extrapolating from the
moment that we're in

1612
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
moment that we're in
 

1613
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,230
moment that we're in
is that i believe that in the process of

1614
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240
is that i believe that in the process of
 

1615
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,390
is that i believe that in the process of
actually developing technology that can

1616
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
actually developing technology that can
 

1617
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,830
actually developing technology that can
really get around in the world and

1618
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
really get around in the world and
 

1619
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,510
really get around in the world and
really process and and

1620
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,520
really process and and
 

1621
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,710
really process and and
and do things in the world in a

1622
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
and do things in the world in a
 

1623
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,789
and do things in the world in a
sophisticated way we're going to learn a

1624
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:18,799
sophisticated way we're going to learn a
 

1625
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,990
sophisticated way we're going to learn a
lot about

1626
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
lot about
 

1627
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,909
lot about
what that means which that we don't know

1628
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:21,919
what that means which that we don't know
 

1629
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,190
what that means which that we don't know
now because we don't know how to do this

1630
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
now because we don't know how to do this
 

1631
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,310
now because we don't know how to do this
right now

1632
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
right now
 

1633
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,909
right now
if you believe that you can just turn on

1634
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
if you believe that you can just turn on
 

1635
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,750
if you believe that you can just turn on
a deep learning network and eventually

1636
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
a deep learning network and eventually
 

1637
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,789
a deep learning network and eventually
give it enough compute and it'll

1638
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
give it enough compute and it'll
 

1639
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,470
give it enough compute and it'll
eventually get there well sure that

1640
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
eventually get there well sure that
 

1641
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,070
eventually get there well sure that
seems really scary because we won't we

1642
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
seems really scary because we won't we
 

1643
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,830
seems really scary because we won't we
won't be in the loop at all we want we

1644
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
won't be in the loop at all we want we
 

1645
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,190
won't be in the loop at all we want we
won't be helping to design or or target

1646
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
won't be helping to design or or target
 

1647
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,430
won't be helping to design or or target
these kinds of systems but i don't i

1648
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440
these kinds of systems but i don't i
 

1649
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,230
these kinds of systems but i don't i
don't see

1650
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,240
don't see
 

1651
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,269
don't see
that that feels like it is against the

1652
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,279
that that feels like it is against the
 

1653
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,630
that that feels like it is against the
laws of physics because these systems

1654
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
laws of physics because these systems
 

1655
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,830
laws of physics because these systems
need help right they need

1656
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
need help right they need
 

1657
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,029
need help right they need
they need to surpass the the

1658
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
they need to surpass the the
 

1659
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,029
they need to surpass the the
the difficulty the wall of complexity

1660
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:51,039
the difficulty the wall of complexity
 

1661
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,789
the difficulty the wall of complexity
that happens in arranging something in

1662
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
that happens in arranging something in
 

1663
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,909
that happens in arranging something in
the form that

1664
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
the form that
 

1665
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,789
the form that
that will happen in yeah like i believe

1666
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
that will happen in yeah like i believe
 

1667
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,470
that will happen in yeah like i believe
in evolution like i believe that the

1668
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
in evolution like i believe that the
 

1669
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,870
in evolution like i believe that the
that that there's an argument right so

1670
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:00,880
that that there's an argument right so
 

1671
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,310
that that there's an argument right so
there's another argument just to look at

1672
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
there's another argument just to look at
 

1673
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,029
there's another argument just to look at
it from a different

1674
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
it from a different
 

1675
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,789
it from a different
perspective that people say well i don't

1676
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:04,799
perspective that people say well i don't
 

1677
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,190
perspective that people say well i don't
believe in evolution how could evolution

1678
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
believe in evolution how could evolution
 

1679
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,990
believe in evolution how could evolution
it's it's sort of like a random set of

1680
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
it's it's sort of like a random set of
 

1681
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,029
it's it's sort of like a random set of
parts

1682
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
parts
 

1683
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,190
parts
assemble themselves into a 747 and that

1684
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
assemble themselves into a 747 and that
 

1685
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,230
assemble themselves into a 747 and that
could just never happen

1686
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
could just never happen
 

1687
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,630
could just never happen
yeah so it's like okay that's maybe hard

1688
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
yeah so it's like okay that's maybe hard
 

1689
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,470
yeah so it's like okay that's maybe hard
to argue against but clearly

1690
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
to argue against but clearly
 

1691
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,470
to argue against but clearly
747s do get assembled they get assembled

1692
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
747s do get assembled they get assembled
 

1693
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,750
747s do get assembled they get assembled
by us basically the idea being that

1694
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
by us basically the idea being that
 

1695
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,430
by us basically the idea being that
there's a process by which we will get

1696
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
there's a process by which we will get
 

1697
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,029
there's a process by which we will get
to the par the point of making

1698
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
to the par the point of making
 

1699
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,710
to the par the point of making
technology that has that kind of

1700
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
technology that has that kind of
 

1701
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,149
technology that has that kind of
awareness and

1702
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
awareness and
 

1703
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,590
awareness and
in that process we're going to learn a

1704
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600
in that process we're going to learn a
 

1705
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,669
in that process we're going to learn a
lot about that process and we'll have

1706
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:33,679
lot about that process and we'll have
 

1707
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,389
lot about that process and we'll have
more

1708
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
more
 

1709
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,230
more
ability to control it or to shape it or

1710
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,240
ability to control it or to shape it or
 

1711
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,029
ability to control it or to shape it or
to build it in our own image

1712
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
to build it in our own image
 

1713
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,310
to build it in our own image
it's not something that is going to

1714
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
it's not something that is going to
 

1715
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,190
it's not something that is going to
spring into existence like that 747

1716
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
spring into existence like that 747
 

1717
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,630
spring into existence like that 747
and we're just gonna have to contend

1718
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
and we're just gonna have to contend
 

1719
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,110
and we're just gonna have to contend
with it completely unprepared

1720
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
with it completely unprepared
 

1721
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,549
with it completely unprepared
it's very possible that in the context

1722
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:50,559
it's very possible that in the context
 

1723
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,029
it's very possible that in the context
of the long arc of human history it will

1724
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
of the long arc of human history it will
 

1725
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,269
of the long arc of human history it will
in fact spring into existence

1726
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
in fact spring into existence
 

1727
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,389
in fact spring into existence
but that springing might take like if

1728
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
but that springing might take like if
 

1729
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,230
but that springing might take like if
you look at nuclear weapons

1730
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
you look at nuclear weapons
 

1731
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,350
you look at nuclear weapons
like even 20 years is a springing

1732
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,360
like even 20 years is a springing
 

1733
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,830
like even 20 years is a springing
in in the context of human history and

1734
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
in in the context of human history and
 

1735
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,510
in in the context of human history and
it's very possible just like with

1736
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
it's very possible just like with
 

1737
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,590
it's very possible just like with
nuclear weapons that we could have

1738
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
nuclear weapons that we could have
 

1739
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,950
nuclear weapons that we could have
i don't know what percentage you want to

1740
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:10,960
i don't know what percentage you want to
 

1741
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,430
i don't know what percentage you want to
put at it but the the possibility

1742
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440
put at it but the the possibility
 

1743
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,870
put at it but the the possibility
could have knocked ourselves out yeah

1744
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:14,880
could have knocked ourselves out yeah
 

1745
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,789
could have knocked ourselves out yeah
the possibility of human beings

1746
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
the possibility of human beings
 

1747
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,149
the possibility of human beings
destroying themselves in the 20th

1748
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
destroying themselves in the 20th
 

1749
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,669
destroying themselves in the 20th
century

1750
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:19,679
century
 

1751
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,350
century
with nuclear weapons i don't know you

1752
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
with nuclear weapons i don't know you
 

1753
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,510
with nuclear weapons i don't know you
can if you really think through it

1754
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,520
can if you really think through it
 

1755
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,029
can if you really think through it
you could really put it close to like i

1756
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039
you could really put it close to like i
 

1757
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,950
you could really put it close to like i
don't know 30 40 percent

1758
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
don't know 30 40 percent
 

1759
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,430
don't know 30 40 percent
given like the certain moments of crisis

1760
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
given like the certain moments of crisis
 

1761
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,389
given like the certain moments of crisis
that happen

1762
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
that happen
 

1763
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,950
that happen
so like i think one

1764
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
so like i think one
 

1765
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,190
so like i think one
like fear in the shadows that's not

1766
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
like fear in the shadows that's not
 

1767
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,789
like fear in the shadows that's not
being acknowledged

1768
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:38,799
being acknowledged
 

1769
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,750
being acknowledged
is it's not so much the ai will run away

1770
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:41,760
is it's not so much the ai will run away
 

1771
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,149
is it's not so much the ai will run away
is

1772
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
is
 

1773
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,830
is
is that as it's running away we won't

1774
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
is that as it's running away we won't
 

1775
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,630
is that as it's running away we won't
have enough time to uh think through how

1776
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,640
have enough time to uh think through how
 

1777
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,669
have enough time to uh think through how
to stop it

1778
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:49,679
to stop it
 

1779
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,950
to stop it
right fast takeoff or foom yeah i mean

1780
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
right fast takeoff or foom yeah i mean
 

1781
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,590
right fast takeoff or foom yeah i mean
my

1782
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600
my
 

1783
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,350
my
much bigger concern i wonder what you

1784
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
much bigger concern i wonder what you
 

1785
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,669
much bigger concern i wonder what you
think about it which is

1786
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679
think about it which is
 

1787
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,350
think about it which is
we won't know it's happening

1788
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,360
we won't know it's happening
 

1789
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,070
we won't know it's happening
so i kind of that argument i think that

1790
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
so i kind of that argument i think that
 

1791
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,029
so i kind of that argument i think that
there is an

1792
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
there is an
 

1793
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,669
there is an
agi situation already happening with

1794
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
agi situation already happening with
 

1795
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,110
agi situation already happening with
social media

1796
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
social media
 

1797
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,430
social media
that our minds our collective

1798
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
that our minds our collective
 

1799
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,269
that our minds our collective
intelligence of human civilization is

1800
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
intelligence of human civilization is
 

1801
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,909
intelligence of human civilization is
already being controlled by an algorithm

1802
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:15,919
already being controlled by an algorithm
 

1803
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,110
already being controlled by an algorithm
and like we're we're already super

1804
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
and like we're we're already super
 

1805
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,350
and like we're we're already super
like the the level of a collective

1806
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,360
like the the level of a collective
 

1807
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,110
like the the level of a collective
intelligence thanks to wikipedia people

1808
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,120
intelligence thanks to wikipedia people
 

1809
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,630
intelligence thanks to wikipedia people
should donate to wikipedia

1810
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640
should donate to wikipedia
 

1811
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,630
should donate to wikipedia
to feed the agi man if we had a super

1812
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
to feed the agi man if we had a super
 

1813
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,669
to feed the agi man if we had a super
intelligence that

1814
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,679
intelligence that
 

1815
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,909
intelligence that
that was in line with wikipedia's values

1816
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
that was in line with wikipedia's values
 

1817
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,510
that was in line with wikipedia's values
that it's a lot better than a lot of

1818
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
that it's a lot better than a lot of
 

1819
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,190
that it's a lot better than a lot of
other things i can imagine i've i trust

1820
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
other things i can imagine i've i trust
 

1821
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,190
other things i can imagine i've i trust
wikipedia more than i trust facebook or

1822
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
wikipedia more than i trust facebook or
 

1823
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,669
wikipedia more than i trust facebook or
youtube

1824
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:37,679
youtube
 

1825
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,149
youtube
as far as trying to do the right thing

1826
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
as far as trying to do the right thing
 

1827
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,510
as far as trying to do the right thing
from a rational perspective

1828
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,520
from a rational perspective
 

1829
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,789
from a rational perspective
yeah now that's not where you were going

1830
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:42,799
yeah now that's not where you were going
 

1831
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,549
yeah now that's not where you were going
i understand that but it it it does

1832
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
i understand that but it it it does
 

1833
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,230
i understand that but it it it does
strike me that there's sort of

1834
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
strike me that there's sort of
 

1835
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,029
strike me that there's sort of
smarter and less smart ways of of

1836
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
smarter and less smart ways of of
 

1837
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,630
smarter and less smart ways of of
exposing ourselves to each other on the

1838
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
exposing ourselves to each other on the
 

1839
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,230
exposing ourselves to each other on the
internet yeah the interesting thing is

1840
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
internet yeah the interesting thing is
 

1841
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,430
internet yeah the interesting thing is
that wikipedia

1842
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
that wikipedia
 

1843
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,789
that wikipedia
and social media have very different

1844
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
and social media have very different
 

1845
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,190
and social media have very different
forces you're right i mean wikipedia if

1846
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,200
forces you're right i mean wikipedia if
 

1847
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,750
forces you're right i mean wikipedia if
if agi was wikipedia it'd be just like

1848
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
if agi was wikipedia it'd be just like
 

1849
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,630
if agi was wikipedia it'd be just like
this

1850
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
this
 

1851
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,669
this
cranky overly competent editor

1852
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
cranky overly competent editor
 

1853
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,470
cranky overly competent editor
of uh articles uh you know there's

1854
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
of uh articles uh you know there's
 

1855
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,470
of uh articles uh you know there's
there's something to that but the social

1856
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
there's something to that but the social
 

1857
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,750
there's something to that but the social
media aspect is is is not

1858
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
media aspect is is is not
 

1859
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,389
media aspect is is is not
so the vision of agis is as a separate

1860
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
so the vision of agis is as a separate
 

1861
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,110
so the vision of agis is as a separate
system

1862
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120
system
 

1863
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,669
system
that's super intelligent that's super

1864
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
that's super intelligent that's super
 

1865
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,350
that's super intelligent that's super
intelligent that's one key little thing

1866
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,360
intelligent that's one key little thing
 

1867
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,950
intelligent that's one key little thing
i mean there's the paper clip argument

1868
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:20,960
i mean there's the paper clip argument
 

1869
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,070
i mean there's the paper clip argument
that's super dumb

1870
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
that's super dumb
 

1871
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,950
that's super dumb
but super powerful systems but with

1872
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
but super powerful systems but with
 

1873
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,230
but super powerful systems but with
social media you have

1874
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:26,240
social media you have
 

1875
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,789
social media you have
a relatively like algorithms we may talk

1876
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
a relatively like algorithms we may talk
 

1877
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,830
a relatively like algorithms we may talk
about today

1878
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
about today
 

1879
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,269
about today
very simple algorithms that when

1880
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
very simple algorithms that when
 

1881
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,510
very simple algorithms that when
uh something charles talks a lot about

1882
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
uh something charles talks a lot about
 

1883
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,510
uh something charles talks a lot about
which is interactive ai when they start

1884
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
which is interactive ai when they start
 

1885
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,070
which is interactive ai when they start
like

1886
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,080
like
 

1887
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,630
like
having at scale like tiny little

1888
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640
having at scale like tiny little
 

1889
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,310
having at scale like tiny little
interactions with human beings

1890
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,320
interactions with human beings
 

1891
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,230
interactions with human beings
they can start controlling these human

1892
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
they can start controlling these human
 

1893
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,230
they can start controlling these human
beings so a single algorithm

1894
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
beings so a single algorithm
 

1895
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,149
beings so a single algorithm
can control the minds of human beings

1896
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
can control the minds of human beings
 

1897
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,230
can control the minds of human beings
slowly to what we might not

1898
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,240
slowly to what we might not
 

1899
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,230
slowly to what we might not
realize it could start wars it could

1900
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
realize it could start wars it could
 

1901
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,110
realize it could start wars it could
start it can change the way we

1902
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,120
start it can change the way we
 

1903
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,149
start it can change the way we
think about things it feels like in the

1904
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,159
think about things it feels like in the
 

1905
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,669
think about things it feels like in the
long arc of history

1906
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
long arc of history
 

1907
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,149
long arc of history
if i were to sort of zoom out from all

1908
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
if i were to sort of zoom out from all
 

1909
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,909
if i were to sort of zoom out from all
the outrage and all the tension on

1910
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:03,919
the outrage and all the tension on
 

1911
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:04,950
the outrage and all the tension on
social media

1912
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
social media
 

1913
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,909
social media
that it's progressing us towards uh

1914
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:07,919
that it's progressing us towards uh
 

1915
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,310
that it's progressing us towards uh
better and better things

1916
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
better and better things
 

1917
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,549
better and better things
it feels like chaos and toxic and all

1918
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:12,559
it feels like chaos and toxic and all
 

1919
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,149
it feels like chaos and toxic and all
that kind of stuff but it's chaos and

1920
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
that kind of stuff but it's chaos and
 

1921
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:14,710
that kind of stuff but it's chaos and
toxic

1922
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,720
toxic
 

1923
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,350
toxic
yeah but it feels like actually the

1924
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
yeah but it feels like actually the
 

1925
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,190
yeah but it feels like actually the
chaos and toxic is similar to the kind

1926
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
chaos and toxic is similar to the kind
 

1927
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,630
chaos and toxic is similar to the kind
of debates we had

1928
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
of debates we had
 

1929
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,070
of debates we had
from the founding of this country you

1930
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
from the founding of this country you
 

1931
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,389
from the founding of this country you
know there was a civil war that happened

1932
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
know there was a civil war that happened
 

1933
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,230
know there was a civil war that happened
over that over that period and

1934
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,240
over that over that period and
 

1935
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,070
over that over that period and
ultimately it was all about

1936
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
ultimately it was all about
 

1937
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,230
ultimately it was all about
this tension of like something doesn't

1938
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
this tension of like something doesn't
 

1939
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,190
this tension of like something doesn't
feel right about

1940
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
feel right about
 

1941
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,350
feel right about
our implementation of the core values we

1942
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,360
our implementation of the core values we
 

1943
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,110
our implementation of the core values we
hold as human beings and they're

1944
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
hold as human beings and they're
 

1945
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,630
hold as human beings and they're
constantly struggling with this

1946
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
constantly struggling with this
 

1947
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,269
constantly struggling with this
and that results in people calling each

1948
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
and that results in people calling each
 

1949
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:39,909
and that results in people calling each
other

1950
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
other
 

1951
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,750
other
uh like just just being shitty to each

1952
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
uh like just just being shitty to each
 

1953
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,870
uh like just just being shitty to each
other on twitter

1954
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
other on twitter
 

1955
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,669
other on twitter
but i ultimately the algorithm is

1956
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
but i ultimately the algorithm is
 

1957
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,509
but i ultimately the algorithm is
managing all that and it feels like

1958
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
managing all that and it feels like
 

1959
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,190
managing all that and it feels like
there's a possible future in which that

1960
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
there's a possible future in which that
 

1961
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,110
there's a possible future in which that
algorithm

1962
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
algorithm
 

1963
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,389
algorithm
controls us to into the direction of

1964
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
controls us to into the direction of
 

1965
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,750
controls us to into the direction of
self-destruction

1966
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
self-destruction
 

1967
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,230
self-destruction
whatever that looks like yeah so so all

1968
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,240
whatever that looks like yeah so so all
 

1969
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,669
whatever that looks like yeah so so all
right i do believe in the power of

1970
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
right i do believe in the power of
 

1971
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,190
right i do believe in the power of
social media to

1972
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
social media to
 

1973
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,509
social media to
screw us up royally i do believe in the

1974
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
screw us up royally i do believe in the
 

1975
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,750
screw us up royally i do believe in the
power of social media to benefit us too

1976
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:07,760
power of social media to benefit us too
 

1977
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,269
power of social media to benefit us too
i do think that we're in a

1978
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
i do think that we're in a
 

1979
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,110
i do think that we're in a
yeah it's sort of almost got dropped on

1980
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
yeah it's sort of almost got dropped on
 

1981
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,710
yeah it's sort of almost got dropped on
top of us and now we're trying to as a

1982
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
top of us and now we're trying to as a
 

1983
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,310
top of us and now we're trying to as a
culture figure out how to cope with it

1984
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,320
culture figure out how to cope with it
 

1985
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,389
culture figure out how to cope with it
there's a sense in which i don't know

1986
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
there's a sense in which i don't know
 

1987
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,830
there's a sense in which i don't know
there's there's some arguments that say

1988
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:21,840
there's there's some arguments that say
 

1989
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,669
there's there's some arguments that say
that for example

1990
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
that for example
 

1991
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,350
that for example
i guess college-age students now late

1992
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
i guess college-age students now late
 

1993
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,789
i guess college-age students now late
college-age students now people who are

1994
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
college-age students now people who are
 

1995
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,029
college-age students now people who are
in middle school when when social media

1996
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:29,039
in middle school when when social media
 

1997
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,950
in middle school when when social media
started to really take off

1998
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
started to really take off
 

1999
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,070
started to really take off
maybe maybe really damaged like me this

2000
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
maybe maybe really damaged like me this
 

2001
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,350
maybe maybe really damaged like me this
may have really hurt their development

2002
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,360
may have really hurt their development
 

2003
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,630
may have really hurt their development
in a way that we don't

2004
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
in a way that we don't
 

2005
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,870
in a way that we don't
have all the implications of quite yet

2006
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
have all the implications of quite yet
 

2007
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,710
have all the implications of quite yet
that's the generation who

2008
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:40,720
that's the generation who
 

2009
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,870
that's the generation who
if and i hate to make it somebody else's

2010
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:44,880
if and i hate to make it somebody else's
 

2011
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,789
if and i hate to make it somebody else's
responsibility but like they're the ones

2012
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
responsibility but like they're the ones
 

2013
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,630
responsibility but like they're the ones
who can fix it they're the ones who can

2014
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:48,640
who can fix it they're the ones who can
 

2015
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,149
who can fix it they're the ones who can
who can figure out

2016
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:50,159
who can figure out
 

2017
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,710
who can figure out
how do we keep the good of this kind of

2018
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
how do we keep the good of this kind of
 

2019
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,230
how do we keep the good of this kind of
technology without

2020
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
technology without
 

2021
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,350
technology without
letting it eat us alive and

2022
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,360
letting it eat us alive and
 

2023
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,029
letting it eat us alive and
if they're successful we move on to the

2024
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,039
if they're successful we move on to the
 

2025
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,029
if they're successful we move on to the
next phase the next level of the game

2026
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:03,039
next phase the next level of the game
 

2027
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,789
next phase the next level of the game
if they're not successful then yeah then

2028
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:04,799
if they're not successful then yeah then
 

2029
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,070
if they're not successful then yeah then
we're going to wreck each other we're

2030
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080
we're going to wreck each other we're
 

2031
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,549
we're going to wreck each other we're
going to

2032
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:06,559
going to
 

2033
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,870
going to
destroy society so you're going to in

2034
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
destroy society so you're going to in
 

2035
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,870
destroy society so you're going to in
your old age sit on the porch and watch

2036
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:10,880
your old age sit on the porch and watch
 

2037
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,909
your old age sit on the porch and watch
the world burn

2038
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
the world burn
 

2039
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,950
the world burn
because the tick tock generation that uh

2040
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
because the tick tock generation that uh
 

2041
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,029
because the tick tock generation that uh
i believe well so my this is my kids age

2042
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
i believe well so my this is my kids age
 

2043
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,549
i believe well so my this is my kids age
right and that's certainly my daughter's

2044
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
right and that's certainly my daughter's
 

2045
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,389
right and that's certainly my daughter's
age and she's very tapped in

2046
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
age and she's very tapped in
 

2047
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,110
age and she's very tapped in
to social stuff but she's also she's

2048
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120
to social stuff but she's also she's
 

2049
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,630
to social stuff but she's also she's
trying to find that balance right of

2050
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
trying to find that balance right of
 

2051
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,230
trying to find that balance right of
participating in it and then getting the

2052
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,240
participating in it and then getting the
 

2053
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,070
participating in it and then getting the
positives of it but without letting it

2054
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
positives of it but without letting it
 

2055
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,750
positives of it but without letting it
eat her alive um and i think sometimes

2056
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
eat her alive um and i think sometimes
 

2057
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,470
eat her alive um and i think sometimes
she ventures

2058
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:32,480
she ventures
 

2059
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,669
she ventures
hopes just to watch this sometimes i

2060
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679
hopes just to watch this sometimes i
 

2061
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,269
hopes just to watch this sometimes i
think she ventures a little too far and

2062
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
think she ventures a little too far and
 

2063
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:37,509
think she ventures a little too far and
is

2064
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:37,519

she gets a little distance

2068
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360
she gets a little distance
 

2069
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,310
she gets a little distance
um and if you know if there's enough

2070
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,320
um and if you know if there's enough
 

2071

people like her out there they're gonna

but it's a skill to learn
 

2107
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,470
but it's a skill to learn
to not look at that like to moderate

to not look at that like to moderate
 

2109
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,829
to not look at that like to moderate
actually how much you look at that

2115
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,030
similar to uh it doesn't have to be
about trolls it could be about checking

2116
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
about trolls it could be about checking
 

2117
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,750
about trolls it could be about checking
email

2118
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
email
 

2119
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,790

runs a large institute at drexel
university and

2126
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:39,679
university and
 

2127
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,069
university and
there could be stressful like emails

2128
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
there could be stressful like emails
 

2129
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,510
there could be stressful like emails
you're waiting like there's drama of

2130
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,520
you're waiting like there's drama of
 

2131
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,550
you're waiting like there's drama of
some kind

some kind
 

2133
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,710
some kind
and so like there's a temptation to

2134
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:46,720
and so like there's a temptation to
 

2135
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,710
and so like there's a temptation to
check the email if you send an email you

2136
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
check the email if you send an email you
 

2137
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,270
check the email if you send an email you
cut it

2138
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,280
cut it
 

2139
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,829
cut it
and that pulls you in into it doesn't

2140
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
and that pulls you in into it doesn't
 

2141
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,190
and that pulls you in into it doesn't
feel good

and it's a skill that he actually
 

2145
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,349
and it's a skill that he actually
complains that he hasn't learned i mean

uh you know being bullied online all
 

2163
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,470
uh you know being bullied online all
those stories which are very

your bullies
these days when you're growing up but at

these days when you're growing up but at
 

2171
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,430
these days when you're growing up but at
the same time they're also learning that

2172
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
the same time they're also learning that
 

2173
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,950
the same time they're also learning that
skill of how to

2174
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
skill of how to
 

2175
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,390
skill of how to
be able to shut off uh the like

2176
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
be able to shut off uh the like
 

2177
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,470
be able to shut off uh the like
disconnect with it be able to laugh at

2178
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,480
disconnect with it be able to laugh at
 

2179
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,069
disconnect with it be able to laugh at
it not take it too seriously

2180
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079
it not take it too seriously
 

2181
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,589
it not take it too seriously
it's fascinating like we're all trying

2182
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
it's fascinating like we're all trying
 

2183
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,790
it's fascinating like we're all trying
to figure this out just like you said

2184
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800
to figure this out just like you said
 

2185
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,109
to figure this out just like you said
it's

2186
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,119
it's
 

2187
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,390
it's
been dropped on us and we're trying to

2188
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,400
been dropped on us and we're trying to
 

2189
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,230
been dropped on us and we're trying to
figure it out yeah i think that's really

2190
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
figure it out yeah i think that's really
 

2191
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,109
figure it out yeah i think that's really
interesting and i

2192
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:35,119
interesting and i
 

2193
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,069
interesting and i
i guess i've become a believer in the

2194
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
i guess i've become a believer in the
 

2195
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,430
i guess i've become a believer in the
human design

2196
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,440
human design
 

2197
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,430
human design
which i feel like i don't completely

2198
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,440
which i feel like i don't completely
 

2199
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,829
which i feel like i don't completely
understand like how do you make

2200
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:42,839
understand like how do you make
 

2201
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,589
understand like how do you make
something as robust as us like we're

2202
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
something as robust as us like we're
 

2203
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,069
something as robust as us like we're
so flawed in so many ways and yet and

2204
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079
so flawed in so many ways and yet and
 

2205
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,790
so flawed in so many ways and yet and
yet

2206
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
yet
 

2207
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,950
yet
you know we dominate the planet and we

2208
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:52,960
you know we dominate the planet and we
 

2209
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,870
you know we dominate the planet and we
do seem to manage to get ourselves out

2210
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:54,880
do seem to manage to get ourselves out
 

2211
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,069
do seem to manage to get ourselves out
of scrapes

2212
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:56,079
of scrapes
 

2213
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,790
of scrapes
eventually not necessarily the most

2214
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:58,800
eventually not necessarily the most
 

2215
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,630
eventually not necessarily the most
elegant possible way but somehow we get

2216
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,640
elegant possible way but somehow we get
 

2217
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,670
elegant possible way but somehow we get
we get to the next step and i don't know

2218
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,680
we get to the next step and i don't know
 

2219
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,550
we get to the next step and i don't know
how i'd make a

2220
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
how i'd make a
 

2221
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,589
how i'd make a
machine do that i i i

2222
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:07,599
machine do that i i i
 

2223
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,430
machine do that i i i
generally speaking like if i train one

2224
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440
generally speaking like if i train one
 

2225
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,870
generally speaking like if i train one
of my reinforcement learning agents to

2226
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
of my reinforcement learning agents to
 

2227
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,630
of my reinforcement learning agents to
play a video game and it works really

2228
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,640
play a video game and it works really
 

2229
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,230
play a video game and it works really
hard on that first stage over and over

2230
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240
hard on that first stage over and over
 

2231
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,430
hard on that first stage over and over
and over again and it makes it through

2232
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:15,440
and over again and it makes it through
 

2233
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,670
and over again and it makes it through
it succeeds on that first level

2234
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:17,680
it succeeds on that first level
 

2235
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,190
it succeeds on that first level
and then the new level comes and it's

2236
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,200
and then the new level comes and it's
 

2237
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,710
and then the new level comes and it's
just like okay i'm back to the drawing

2238
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,720
just like okay i'm back to the drawing
 

2239
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,470
just like okay i'm back to the drawing
board and somehow humanity we keep

2240
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:22,480
board and somehow humanity we keep
 

2241
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,190
board and somehow humanity we keep
leveling up

2242
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
leveling up
 

2243
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,270
leveling up
and then somehow managing to put

2244
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,280
and then somehow managing to put
 

2245
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,430
and then somehow managing to put
together the skills necessary to

2246
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
together the skills necessary to
 

2247
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,990
together the skills necessary to
achieve success some semblance of

2248
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,000
achieve success some semblance of
 

2249
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,390
achieve success some semblance of
success in that next level too

2250
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,400
success in that next level too
 

2251
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,670
success in that next level too
and you know i hope we can keep doing

2252
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:35,680
and you know i hope we can keep doing
 

2253
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,870
and you know i hope we can keep doing
that

2254
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
that
 

2255
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,870
that
you mentioned reinforcement learning so

2256
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,880
you mentioned reinforcement learning so
 

2257
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,470
you mentioned reinforcement learning so
you've have uh

2258
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,480
you've have uh
 

2259
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,510
you've have uh
a couple years in the field no quite

2260
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:43,520
a couple years in the field no quite
 

2261
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,150
a couple years in the field no quite
you know quite a few quite a long career

2262
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,160
you know quite a few quite a long career
 

2263
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,069
you know quite a few quite a long career
in artificial intelligence broadly but

2264
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:50,079
in artificial intelligence broadly but
 

2265
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,030
in artificial intelligence broadly but
reinforcement learning specifically

2266
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,040
reinforcement learning specifically
 

2267
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,750
reinforcement learning specifically
can you maybe give a hint about your

2268
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:55,760
can you maybe give a hint about your
 

2269
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,310
can you maybe give a hint about your
sense

2270
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,320
sense
 

2271
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,349

00:36:59,349 --> 00:36:59,359
of the history of the field and in some
 

2273
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,950

ways has changed with the

ways has changed with the
 

2275
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,430
ways has changed with the
advent of deep learning but has a long

advent of deep learning but has a long
roots like how is it

2278
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:05,359
roots like how is it
 

2279
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,349
roots like how is it
weaved in and out of your own life how

2280
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:07,359
weaved in and out of your own life how
 

2281
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,790
weaved in and out of your own life how
have you seen the community change or

2282
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:08,800
have you seen the community change or
 

2283
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,550
have you seen the community change or
maybe the ideas that it's playing with

2284
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560
maybe the ideas that it's playing with
 

2285
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,670
maybe the ideas that it's playing with

2293
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,150
of having almost a front row seat to a
lot of this stuff and it's been really

2294
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
lot of this stuff and it's been really
 

2295
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,790
lot of this stuff and it's been really
really fun and interesting so uh when i

2296
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
really fun and interesting so uh when i
 

2297
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,670
really fun and interesting so uh when i
was in college in the 80s

2298
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:23,680
was in college in the 80s
 

2299
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,349
was in college in the 80s
early 80s uh the neural net

2300
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
early 80s uh the neural net
 

2301
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,470
early 80s uh the neural net
thing was starting to happen and i was

2302
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
thing was starting to happen and i was
 

2303
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,069
thing was starting to happen and i was
taking a lot of psychology classes a lot

2304
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:32,079
taking a lot of psychology classes a lot
 

2305
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,510
taking a lot of psychology classes a lot
of computer science classes

2306
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
of computer science classes
 

2307
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,670
of computer science classes
as a college student and i thought you

2308
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680
as a college student and i thought you
 

2309
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,829
as a college student and i thought you
know something that can play tic-tac-toe

2310
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
know something that can play tic-tac-toe
 

2311
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,190
know something that can play tic-tac-toe
and just like learn to get better at it

2312
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,200
and just like learn to get better at it
 

2313
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,710
and just like learn to get better at it
that ought to be a really easy thing so

00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,000
like hacking on my home computer trying
 

2323
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,670
like hacking on my home computer trying
to teach it how to play tic-tac-toe and

is that when you first fell in love with
 

2335
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,710
is that when you first fell in love with
computer science just like programming

2336
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:58,720
computer science just like programming
 

2337
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,470
computer science just like programming
basic on that

2338
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
basic on that
 

2339
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,390
basic on that
uh what was the computer do you remember

2340
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
uh what was the computer do you remember
 

2341
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,710
uh what was the computer do you remember
i had i had a trs-80

2342
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,720
i had i had a trs-80

model one before they were called model
 

2345
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,069
model one before they were called model
ones because there was nothing else uh

2346
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:08,079
ones because there was nothing else uh
 

2347
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:15,349
ones because there was nothing else uh
i got my computer in 1979

2348
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:15,359
i got my computer in 1979
 

2349
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,829
i got my computer in 1979
uh instead so i was i was i would have

2350
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:17,839
uh instead so i was i was i would have
 

2351
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,950
uh instead so i was i was i would have
been bar mitzvahed

2352
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
been bar mitzvahed
 

2353
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,870
been bar mitzvahed
but instead of having a big party that

2354
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
but instead of having a big party that
 

2355
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,550
but instead of having a big party that
my parents threw on my behalf

my parents threw on my behalf
 

2357
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,670
my parents threw on my behalf
they just got me a computer because

2358
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:23,680
they just got me a computer because
 

2359
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,710
they just got me a computer because
that's what i really really really

2360
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
that's what i really really really
 

2361
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,310
that's what i really really really
wanted i saw him in the in the

2362
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
wanted i saw him in the in the
 

2363
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,670
wanted i saw him in the in the
in the mall in radio shack and i thought

2364
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
in the mall in radio shack and i thought
 

2365
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,349
in the mall in radio shack and i thought
what how are they doing that i would try

2366
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:31,359
what how are they doing that i would try
 

2367
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,710
what how are they doing that i would try
to stump them i would give them math

2368
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
to stump them i would give them math
 

2369
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,670
to stump them i would give them math
problems like

2370
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:33,680
problems like
 

2371
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,589
problems like
one plus and then in parentheses two

2372
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:35,599
one plus and then in parentheses two
 

2373
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,430
one plus and then in parentheses two
plus one yeah and i would always get it

2374
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:37,440
plus one yeah and i would always get it
 

2375
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,150
plus one yeah and i would always get it
right i'm like

2376
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
right i'm like
 

2377
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,390
right i'm like
how do you know so much message like

2378
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:40,400
how do you know so much message like
 

2379
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,310
how do you know so much message like
i've had to go to algebra class for the

2380
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:42,320
i've had to go to algebra class for the
 

2381
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,670
i've had to go to algebra class for the
last few years to learn this stuff and

2382
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
last few years to learn this stuff and
 

2383
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,270
last few years to learn this stuff and
you just seem to know

2384
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,280
you just seem to know
 

2385
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,310
you just seem to know
so i was i was i was smitten and i got a

so i was i was i was smitten and i got a
 

2387
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,670
so i was i was i was smitten and i got a
computer and i think ages

2388
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
computer and i think ages
 

2389
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,790
computer and i think ages
13 to 15

2390

13 to 15
 

2391

13 to 15
i have no memory of those years i think

2392
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
i have no memory of those years i think
 

2393
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,030
i have no memory of those years i think
i just was in my room with the computer

2394
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,040
i just was in my room with the computer
 

2395

that was the one album i had uh on vinyl

2402
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
that was the one album i had uh on vinyl
 

2403
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,190
that was the one album i had uh on vinyl
at that time

2404
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
at that time
 

2405
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,270
at that time
and um and then i got it on cassette

2406
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
and um and then i got it on cassette
 

2407
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,950
and um and then i got it on cassette
tape and that was really helpful

2408
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
tape and that was really helpful
 

2409
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,990
tape and that was really helpful
because then i could play it i didn't

2410
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,000
because then i could play it i didn't
 

2411
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,910
because then i could play it i didn't
have to go down to my parents wi-fi or

i'm ready to talk to people again like
 

2421
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,630
i'm ready to talk to people again like
i've learned what i need to learn here

2422
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,640
i've learned what i need to learn here
 

2423
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,630
i've learned what i need to learn here
and um so yeah so so that was that was

2424
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:24,640
and um so yeah so so that was that was
 

2425
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,990
and um so yeah so so that was that was
my home computer and so i went to

2426
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
my home computer and so i went to
 

2427
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,270
my home computer and so i went to
college and i was like oh i'm totally

2428
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,280
college and i was like oh i'm totally
 

2429
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,550
college and i was like oh i'm totally
going to study computer science

2430
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,560
going to study computer science
 

2431
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,030
going to study computer science
i opted the college i chose specifically

2432
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,040
i opted the college i chose specifically
 

2433
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,710
i opted the college i chose specifically
had a computer science major

2434
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
had a computer science major
 

2435
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,310
had a computer science major
the one that i really wanted the college

2436
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
the one that i really wanted the college
 

2437
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,550
the one that i really wanted the college
i really wanted to go to didn't so

2438
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,560
i really wanted to go to didn't so
 

2439
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,069
i really wanted to go to didn't so
bye-bye to them which college did you go

2440
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:38,079
bye-bye to them which college did you go
 

2441
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,910
bye-bye to them which college did you go
through so i went to yale

2442
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
through so i went to yale
 

2443
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,829
through so i went to yale
uh princeton would have been way more

2444
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839
uh princeton would have been way more
 

2445
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,589
uh princeton would have been way more
convenient and it was just beautiful

2446
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:43,599
convenient and it was just beautiful
 

2447
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,270
convenient and it was just beautiful
campus and it was close enough to home

2448
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,280
campus and it was close enough to home
 

2449
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,630
campus and it was close enough to home
and i was really excited about princeton

2450
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:46,640
and i was really excited about princeton
 

2451
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,510
and i was really excited about princeton
and i visited

2452
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:47,520
and i visited
 

2453
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,589
and i visited
i said so computer science major like

2454
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:49,599
i said so computer science major like
 

2455
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,510
i said so computer science major like
well we have computer engineering i'm

2456
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,520
well we have computer engineering i'm
 

2457
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,390
well we have computer engineering i'm
like oh i don't like that word

2458
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:52,400
like oh i don't like that word
 

2459
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,790
like oh i don't like that word
engineering

2460
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:54,800
engineering
 

2461
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,710
engineering
i like if you're science i really i want

2462
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
i like if you're science i really i want
 

2463
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,470
i like if you're science i really i want
to do like you're saying hardware and

2464
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,480
to do like you're saying hardware and
 

2465
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,750
to do like you're saying hardware and
software they're like yeah like i just

2466
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
software they're like yeah like i just
 

2467
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,710
software they're like yeah like i just
want to do software i

2468
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
want to do software i
 

2469
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,990
want to do software i
i couldn't care less about hardware you

2470
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,000
i couldn't care less about hardware you
 

2471
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,270
i couldn't care less about hardware you
grew up in philadelphia i grew up

2472
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,280
grew up in philadelphia i grew up
 

2473
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,030
grew up in philadelphia i grew up
outside philly yeah yeah okay

2474
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,040
outside philly yeah yeah okay
 

2475
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,349
outside philly yeah yeah okay
uh so the you know local schools were

2476
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:07,359
uh so the you know local schools were
 

2477
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,109
uh so the you know local schools were
like penn and drexel

2478
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
like penn and drexel
 

2479
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,750
like penn and drexel
and uh temple like everyone in my family

2480
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:11,760
and uh temple like everyone in my family
 

2481
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,270
and uh temple like everyone in my family
went to temple at least at one point in

2482
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,280
went to temple at least at one point in
 

2483
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,030
went to temple at least at one point in
their lives except for me

2484
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,040
their lives except for me
 

2485
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,829
their lives except for me
so yeah philly philly family yale had a

2486
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:17,839
so yeah philly philly family yale had a
 

2487
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,190
so yeah philly philly family yale had a
computer science department and that's

2488
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,200
computer science department and that's
 

2489
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,550
computer science department and that's
when you

2490
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,560
when you
 

2491
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,150
when you
it's kind of interesting you said 80s

2492
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
it's kind of interesting you said 80s
 

2493
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,349
it's kind of interesting you said 80s
and you're all that works that's when

2494
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
and you're all that works that's when
 

2495
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,109
and you're all that works that's when
you know that which is a hot new thing

2496
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:25,119
you know that which is a hot new thing
 

2497
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:25,750
you know that which is a hot new thing
or a hot

2498
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:25,760
or a hot
 

2499
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,309
or a hot
thing period uh so what is that in

2500
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:28,319
thing period uh so what is that in
 

2501
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,589
thing period uh so what is that in
college when you first learned about

2502
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
college when you first learned about
 

2503
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,710
college when you first learned about
neural networks yeah

2504
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
neural networks yeah
 

2505
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,309
neural networks yeah
yeah was she learned like it was in a

2506
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:32,319
yeah was she learned like it was in a
 

2507
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,470
yeah was she learned like it was in a
psychology class not in a cs wow

2508
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,480
psychology class not in a cs wow
 

2509
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,230
psychology class not in a cs wow
yeah was it psychology or cognitive

2510
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240
yeah was it psychology or cognitive
 

2511
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,990
yeah was it psychology or cognitive
science or like do you remember like

2512
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
science or like do you remember like
 

2513
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,870
science or like do you remember like
what context it was yeah yeah yeah so so

2514
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:40,880
what context it was yeah yeah yeah so so
 

2515
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,670
what context it was yeah yeah yeah so so
i was a

2516
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
i was a
 

2517
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,589
i was a
i've always been a bit of a cognitive

2518
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:43,599
i've always been a bit of a cognitive
 

2519
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,109
i've always been a bit of a cognitive
psychology groupie

2520
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
psychology groupie
 

2521
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,430
psychology groupie
so like i studied computer science but i

2522
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
so like i studied computer science but i
 

2523
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,790
so like i studied computer science but i
like i like to hang around where the

2524
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:48,800
like i like to hang around where the
 

2525
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,670
like i like to hang around where the
cognitive

2526
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
cognitive
 

2527
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,750
cognitive
scientists are because i don't know

2528
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:51,760
scientists are because i don't know
 

2529
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,750
scientists are because i don't know
brains man they're like

2530
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:53,760
brains man they're like
 

2531
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,670
brains man they're like
they're wacky cool and they have a

2532
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
they're wacky cool and they have a
 

2533
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,670
they're wacky cool and they have a
bigger picture view of things they're a

2534
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
bigger picture view of things they're a
 

2535
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,309
bigger picture view of things they're a
little less

2536
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:58,319
little less
 

2537
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,550
little less
engineery i would say they're more

2538
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,560
engineery i would say they're more
 

2539
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,069
engineery i would say they're more
they're more interested in the

2540
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
they're more interested in the
 

2541
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,829
they're more interested in the
nature of cognition and intelligence and

2542
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:03,839
nature of cognition and intelligence and
 

2543
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,430
nature of cognition and intelligence and
perception it's called like the vision

2544
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,440
perception it's called like the vision
 

2545
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,390
perception it's called like the vision
system work

2546
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
system work
 

2547
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,550
system work
they're asking always bigger questions

2548
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
they're asking always bigger questions
 

2549
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,430
they're asking always bigger questions
now with

2550
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440
now with
 

2551
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,790
now with
the deep learning community there i

2552
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:10,800
the deep learning community there i
 

2553
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,870
the deep learning community there i
think more there's a lot of

2554
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:12,880
think more there's a lot of
 

2555
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,190
think more there's a lot of
intersections but i do find in

2556
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,200
intersections but i do find in
 

2557
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,349
intersections but i do find in
that the neuroscience folks actually

2558
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:19,359
that the neuroscience folks actually
 

2559
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,910
that the neuroscience folks actually
and uh cognitive psychology cognitive

2560
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:21,920
and uh cognitive psychology cognitive
 

2561
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,190
and uh cognitive psychology cognitive
science folks

2562
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,200
science folks
 

2563
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,030
science folks
are starting to learn how to program how

2564
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
are starting to learn how to program how
 

2565
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,870
are starting to learn how to program how
to use your own artificial neural

2566
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:26,880
to use your own artificial neural
 

2567
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,750
to use your own artificial neural
networks

2568
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,760
networks
 

2569
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,109
networks
and they are actually approaching

2570
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:29,119
and they are actually approaching
 

2571
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,950
and they are actually approaching
problems in like totally new interesting

2572
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:30,960
problems in like totally new interesting
 

2573
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,430
problems in like totally new interesting
ways

2574
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
ways
 

2575
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,950
ways
it's fun to watch that grad students

2576
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
it's fun to watch that grad students
 

2577
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,550
it's fun to watch that grad students
from those departments

2578
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560
from those departments
 

2579
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,550
from those departments
like approach the problem of machine

2580
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560
like approach the problem of machine
 

2581
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,150
like approach the problem of machine
learning right they come in with a

2582
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
learning right they come in with a
 

2583
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,510
learning right they come in with a
different perspective yeah they don't

2584
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
different perspective yeah they don't
 

2585
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,630
different perspective yeah they don't
care about like your

2586
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
care about like your
 

2587
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,270
care about like your
imagine that data set or whatever they

2588
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:43,280
imagine that data set or whatever they
 

2589
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,430
imagine that data set or whatever they
they want like to understand the

2590
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,440
they want like to understand the
 

2591
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,030
they want like to understand the
the like the basic mechanisms

2592
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
the like the basic mechanisms
 

2593
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,270
the like the basic mechanisms
at the at the neuronal level and the

2594
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,280
at the at the neuronal level and the
 

2595
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,270
at the at the neuronal level and the
functional level of intelligence it's

2596
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
functional level of intelligence it's
 

2597
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,750
functional level of intelligence it's
kind of

2598
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
kind of
 

2599
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,150
kind of
it's kind of cool to see them work but

2600
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,160
it's kind of cool to see them work but
 

2601
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,109
it's kind of cool to see them work but
yeah okay so

2602
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
yeah okay so
 

2603
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,790
yeah okay so
you always you're always a group you

2604
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
you always you're always a group you
 

2605
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,030
you always you're always a group you
have cognitive psychology

2606
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
have cognitive psychology
 

2607
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,510
have cognitive psychology
yeah yeah and so uh so it was in a class

2608
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,520
yeah yeah and so uh so it was in a class
 

2609
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,349
yeah yeah and so uh so it was in a class
by richard garrick he was kind of my

2610
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,359
by richard garrick he was kind of my
 

2611
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,069
by richard garrick he was kind of my
my favorite uh psych professor in

2612
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
my favorite uh psych professor in
 

2613
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,670
my favorite uh psych professor in
college and i took uh like three

2614
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:09,680
college and i took uh like three
 

2615
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,589
college and i took uh like three
different classes with him

2616
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:11,599
different classes with him
 

2617
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,829
different classes with him
and yeah so that we they were talking

2618
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:13,839
and yeah so that we they were talking
 

2619
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,430
and yeah so that we they were talking
specifically the class i think was kind

2620
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:15,440
specifically the class i think was kind
 

2621
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,510
specifically the class i think was kind
of a

2622
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
of a
 

2623
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,109
of a
there was a big paper that was written

2624
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
there was a big paper that was written
 

2625
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,870
there was a big paper that was written
by stephen pinker and

2626
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
by stephen pinker and
 

2627
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,550
by stephen pinker and
uh prince i don't i'm blanking on

2628
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,560
uh prince i don't i'm blanking on
 

2629
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,750
uh prince i don't i'm blanking on
prince's first name but prince and

pinker and prince
 

2633
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,470
pinker and prince
they wrote kind of a they were at that

2634
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:28,480
they wrote kind of a they were at that
 

2635

they wrote kind of a they were at that
time

2636
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,520
time
 

2637
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,950
time
kind of like ah i'm blanking on the

2638

kind of like ah i'm blanking on the
 

2639
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,309
kind of like ah i'm blanking on the
names of the current people

2640
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319
names of the current people
 

2641
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,470
names of the current people
um the cognitive scientists who are

2642
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,480
um the cognitive scientists who are
 

2643
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,870
um the cognitive scientists who are
complaining a lot about deep networks

2644
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:38,880
complaining a lot about deep networks
 

2645
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,190
complaining a lot about deep networks
oh uh gary gary marcus sorry marcus

2646
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200
oh uh gary gary marcus sorry marcus
 

2647
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,589
oh uh gary gary marcus sorry marcus
and who else i mean there's a few but

2648
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
and who else i mean there's a few but

2652
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:48,960
sure gary's very feisty and with this
 

2653
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,630
sure gary's very feisty and with this
with his co-author they they you know

2654
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
with his co-author they they you know
 

2655
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,349
with his co-author they they you know
they're kind of

2656
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:51,359
they're kind of
 

2657
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,710
they're kind of
doing these kind of takedowns where they

2658
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
doing these kind of takedowns where they
 

2659
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,309
doing these kind of takedowns where they
say okay well yeah it does all these

2660
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
say okay well yeah it does all these
 

2661
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,069
say okay well yeah it does all these
amazing amazing things but

2662
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
amazing amazing things but
 

2663
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,109
amazing amazing things but
here's a shortcoming here's a

2664
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:57,119
here's a shortcoming here's a
 

2665
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,230
here's a shortcoming here's a
shortcoming here's your shortcoming and

2666
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,240
shortcoming here's your shortcoming and
 

2667
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,670
shortcoming here's your shortcoming and
so the pinker prince paper

2668
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
so the pinker prince paper
 

2669
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,550
so the pinker prince paper
is kind of like the that generation's

2670
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:02,560
is kind of like the that generation's
 

2671
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,990
is kind of like the that generation's
version of

2672
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
version of
 

2673
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,750
version of
marcus and davis right where they're

2674
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
marcus and davis right where they're
 

2675
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,230
marcus and davis right where they're
they're trained as cognitive scientists

2676
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
they're trained as cognitive scientists
 

2677
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,230
they're trained as cognitive scientists
but they're looking skeptically at the

2678
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
but they're looking skeptically at the
 

2679
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,270
but they're looking skeptically at the
results in the

2680
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,280
results in the
 

2681
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,790
results in the
in the artificial intelligence neural

2682
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
in the artificial intelligence neural
 

2683
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,630
in the artificial intelligence neural
net kind of world and saying

2684
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:14,640
net kind of world and saying
 

2685
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,230
net kind of world and saying
yeah it can do this and this and this

2686
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,240
yeah it can do this and this and this
 

2687
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,910
yeah it can do this and this and this
but like it can't do that and it can't

2688
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
but like it can't do that and it can't
 

2689
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,349
but like it can't do that and it can't
do that and it can't do that

2690
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:19,359
do that and it can't do that
 

2691
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,870
do that and it can't do that
maybe in principle or maybe just in

2692
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:20,880
maybe in principle or maybe just in
 

2693
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,870
maybe in principle or maybe just in
practice at this point but but the fact

2694
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:22,880
practice at this point but but the fact
 

2695
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,670
practice at this point but but the fact
of the matter is

2696
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:23,680
of the matter is
 

2697
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,309
of the matter is
you're you've narrowed your focus too

2698
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:26,319
you're you've narrowed your focus too
 

2699
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,270
you're you've narrowed your focus too
far

2700
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:27,280
far
 

2701
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,550
far
to be impressed you know you're

2702
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:28,560
to be impressed you know you're
 

2703
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,230
to be impressed you know you're
impressed with the things within that

2704
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
impressed with the things within that
 

2705
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,790
impressed with the things within that
circle

2706
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:30,800
circle
 

2707
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,150
circle
but you need to broaden that circle a

2708
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
but you need to broaden that circle a
 

2709
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,670
but you need to broaden that circle a
little bit you need to look at a wider

2710
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:33,680
little bit you need to look at a wider
 

2711
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,870
little bit you need to look at a wider
set of problems

2712
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,880
set of problems
 

2713
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,030
set of problems
and so um so we have so i was in this

2714
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
and so um so we have so i was in this
 

2715
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,550
and so um so we have so i was in this
seminar in college

2716
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:38,560
seminar in college
 

2717
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,790
seminar in college
that was basically a close reading of

2718
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:40,800
that was basically a close reading of
 

2719
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,150
that was basically a close reading of
the pinker prince paper

2720
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
the pinker prince paper
 

2721
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,710
the pinker prince paper
which was like really thick there was a

2722
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:44,720
which was like really thick there was a
 

2723
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,390
which was like really thick there was a
lot going on in there

2724
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:46,400
lot going on in there
 

2725
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,589
lot going on in there
and um and and it talked about

2726
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
and um and and it talked about
 

2727
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,030
and um and and it talked about
the reinforcement learning idea a little

2728
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,040
the reinforcement learning idea a little
 

2729
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,950
the reinforcement learning idea a little
bit i'm like oh that sounds really cool

2730
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:52,960
bit i'm like oh that sounds really cool
 

2731
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,470
bit i'm like oh that sounds really cool
because behavior is what is really

2732
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:54,480
because behavior is what is really
 

2733
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,589
because behavior is what is really
interesting to me about

2734
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:55,599
interesting to me about
 

2735
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,470
interesting to me about
psychology anyway so making programs

2736
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
psychology anyway so making programs
 

2737
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,910
psychology anyway so making programs
that i mean programs are things that

2738
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
that i mean programs are things that
 

2739
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,710
that i mean programs are things that
behave

2740
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720
behave
 

2741
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,550
behave
people are things that behave like i

2742
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:02,560
people are things that behave like i
 

2743
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,309
people are things that behave like i
want to make learning that learns to

2744
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
want to make learning that learns to
 

2745
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,430
want to make learning that learns to
behave

2746
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:05,440
behave
 

2747
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,790
behave
in which way was reinforcement learning

2748
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:06,800
in which way was reinforcement learning
 

2749
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,190
in which way was reinforcement learning
presented is this uh talking about

2750
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,200
presented is this uh talking about
 

2751
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,950
presented is this uh talking about
human and animal behavior or are we

2752
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:10,960
human and animal behavior or are we
 

2753
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,550
human and animal behavior or are we
talking about actual mathematical

2754
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
talking about actual mathematical
 

2755
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,670
talking about actual mathematical
constructs ah that's

2756
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:13,680
constructs ah that's
 

2757
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,190
constructs ah that's
right so that's a good question right so

2758
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
right so that's a good question right so
 

2759
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,790
right so that's a good question right so
this is i think

2760
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:16,800
this is i think
 

2761
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,030
this is i think
it wasn't actually talked about as

2762
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,040
it wasn't actually talked about as
 

2763
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,790
it wasn't actually talked about as
behavior in the paper that i was reading

2764
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:20,800
behavior in the paper that i was reading
 

2765
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,069
behavior in the paper that i was reading
i think that it just talked about

2766
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:22,079
i think that it just talked about
 

2767
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,470
i think that it just talked about
learning and to me learning is about

2768
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480
learning and to me learning is about
 

2769
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,230
learning and to me learning is about
learning to behave but really

2770
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,240
learning to behave but really
 

2771
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,589
learning to behave but really
neural nets at that point were about

2772
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:27,599
neural nets at that point were about
 

2773
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,109
neural nets at that point were about
learning like supervised learning so

2774
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:29,119
learning like supervised learning so
 

2775
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,349
learning like supervised learning so
learning to produce outputs from inputs

2776
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:31,359
learning to produce outputs from inputs
 

2777
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,950
learning to produce outputs from inputs
so i kind of tried to invent

2778
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
so i kind of tried to invent
 

2779
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,390
so i kind of tried to invent
reinforcement learning

2780
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,400
reinforcement learning
 

2781
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,470
reinforcement learning
i uh when i graduated i joined a

2782
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
i uh when i graduated i joined a
 

2783
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,990
i uh when i graduated i joined a
research group at

2784
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,000
research group at
 

2785
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,910
research group at
bellcore which had spun out of bell abs

2786
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:39,920
bellcore which had spun out of bell abs
 

2787
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,589
bellcore which had spun out of bell abs
recently at that time because of the

2788
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:41,599
recently at that time because of the
 

2789
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,950
recently at that time because of the
divestiture of the

2790
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
divestiture of the
 

2791
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,870
divestiture of the
of long distance and local phone service

2792
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:44,880
of long distance and local phone service
 

2793
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,910
of long distance and local phone service
in the 1980s 1984

2794
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
in the 1980s 1984
 

2795
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,270
in the 1980s 1984
and i was in a group uh with dave ackley

2796
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,280
and i was in a group uh with dave ackley
 

2797
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,309
and i was in a group uh with dave ackley
who

2798
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:52,319
who
 

2799
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,470
who
was the first author of the boltzmann

2800
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
was the first author of the boltzmann
 

2801
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,309
was the first author of the boltzmann
machine paper so the very first neural

2802
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:56,319
machine paper so the very first neural
 

2803
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,069
machine paper so the very first neural
net paper that could handle

2804
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079
net paper that could handle
 

2805
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,710
net paper that could handle
xor right so xor sort of killed neural

2806
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:00,720
xor right so xor sort of killed neural
 

2807
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,790
xor right so xor sort of killed neural
nets the very first the zero with the

2808
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
nets the very first the zero with the
 

2809
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,309
nets the very first the zero with the
first winter

2810
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
first winter
 

2811
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,910
first winter
yeah um the the perceptron's paper

2812
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
yeah um the the perceptron's paper
 

2813
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,950
yeah um the the perceptron's paper
and hinton along with his student dave

2814
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:10,960
and hinton along with his student dave
 

2815
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,390
and hinton along with his student dave
ackley and and i think there was other

2816
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
ackley and and i think there was other
 

2817
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,670
ackley and and i think there was other
authors as well

2818
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:13,680
authors as well
 

2819
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,430
authors as well
showed that no no with both machines we

2820
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,440
showed that no no with both machines we
 

2821
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,950
showed that no no with both machines we
can actually learn

2822
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:16,960
can actually learn
 

2823
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,349
can actually learn
non-linear concepts and so everything's

2824
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
non-linear concepts and so everything's
 

2825
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,950
non-linear concepts and so everything's
back on the table again and that kind of

2826
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:20,960
back on the table again and that kind of
 

2827
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,550
back on the table again and that kind of
started that second wave of neural

2828
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
started that second wave of neural
 

2829
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,190
started that second wave of neural
networks

2830
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,200
networks
 

2831
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,750
networks
so dave ackley was he became my mentor

2832
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:25,760
so dave ackley was he became my mentor
 

2833
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,670
so dave ackley was he became my mentor
at bellcore and we

2834
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
at bellcore and we
 

2835
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,309
at bellcore and we
talked a lot about learning and life and

2836
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
talked a lot about learning and life and
 

2837
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,990
talked a lot about learning and life and
computation and how all these things fit

2838
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
computation and how all these things fit
 

2839
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,710
computation and how all these things fit
together

2840
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:32,720
together
 

2841
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,550
together
now dave and i have a podcast together

2842
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,560
now dave and i have a podcast together
 

2843
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,230
now dave and i have a podcast together
so um so i get to

2844
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
so um so i get to
 

2845
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,270
so um so i get to
kind of enjoy that sort of

2846
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,280
kind of enjoy that sort of
 

2847
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,589
kind of enjoy that sort of
his his perspective uh once again even

2848
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:41,599
his his perspective uh once again even
 

2849
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,750
his his perspective uh once again even
even all these years later

2850
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:43,760
even all these years later
 

2851
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,990
even all these years later
and so i said so i said i was really

2852
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,000
and so i said so i said i was really
 

2853
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,589
and so i said so i said i was really
interested in learning but

2854
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
interested in learning but
 

2855
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,109
interested in learning but
in the concept of behavior and he's like

2856
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:49,119
in the concept of behavior and he's like
 

2857
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,510
in the concept of behavior and he's like
oh well that's reinforcement learning

2858
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,520
oh well that's reinforcement learning
 

2859
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,390
oh well that's reinforcement learning
here and he gave me rich sutton's 1984

2860
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:54,400
here and he gave me rich sutton's 1984
 

2861
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,510
here and he gave me rich sutton's 1984
td paper

2862
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
td paper
 

2863
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,069
td paper
so i read that paper i honestly didn't

2864
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
so i read that paper i honestly didn't
 

2865
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:58,950
so i read that paper i honestly didn't
get all of it

2866
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:58,960
get all of it
 

2867
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,710
get all of it
but i got the idea i got that they were

2868
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
but i got the idea i got that they were
 

2869
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,870
but i got the idea i got that they were
using that he was using ideas

2870
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:02,880
using that he was using ideas
 

2871
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,630
using that he was using ideas
that i was familiar with in the context

2872
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:04,640
that i was familiar with in the context
 

2873
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,150
that i was familiar with in the context
of neural nets and and

2874
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,160
of neural nets and and
 

2875
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,190
of neural nets and and
like sort of backprop uh but with this

2876
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:09,200
like sort of backprop uh but with this
 

2877
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,109
like sort of backprop uh but with this
idea of making predictions over time i'm

2878
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:11,119
idea of making predictions over time i'm
 

2879
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,630
idea of making predictions over time i'm
like this is so interesting but i don't

2880
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
like this is so interesting but i don't
 

2881
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,990
like this is so interesting but i don't
really get all the details i said

2882
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,000
really get all the details i said
 

2883
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,790
really get all the details i said
to dave and dave said oh well why don't

2884
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:16,800
to dave and dave said oh well why don't
 

2885
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,550
to dave and dave said oh well why don't
we have him come and give a talk

2886
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,560
we have him come and give a talk
 

2887
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,349
we have him come and give a talk
and i was like wait what you can do that

2888
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:21,359
and i was like wait what you can do that
 

2889
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,630
and i was like wait what you can do that
like these are real people

2890
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:22,640
like these are real people
 

2891
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,309
like these are real people
i thought they were just words i thought

2892
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
i thought they were just words i thought
 

2893
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,230
i thought they were just words i thought
it was just like ideas that somehow

2894
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,240
it was just like ideas that somehow
 

2895
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,109
it was just like ideas that somehow
magically seeped into paper he's like no

2896
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:29,119
magically seeped into paper he's like no
 

2897
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,349
magically seeped into paper he's like no
i

2898
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:29,359
i
 

2899
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,910
i
i i know rich like we'll just have him

2900
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:31,920
i i know rich like we'll just have him
 

2901
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,950
i i know rich like we'll just have him
come down and and he'll give a talk

2902
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
come down and and he'll give a talk
 

2903
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,109
come down and and he'll give a talk
and so i was you know my mind was blown

2904
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:37,119
and so i was you know my mind was blown
 

2905
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,030
and so i was you know my mind was blown
and uh so rich came and he gave a talk

2906
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
and uh so rich came and he gave a talk
 

2907
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,470
and uh so rich came and he gave a talk
at bellcore

2908
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:40,480
at bellcore
 

2909
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,230
at bellcore
and he talked about what he was super

2910
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:42,240
and he talked about what he was super
 

2911
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,910
and he talked about what he was super
excited which was they had just figured

2912
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,920
excited which was they had just figured
 

2913
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,510
excited which was they had just figured
out at the time

2914
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:45,520
out at the time
 

2915
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,750
out at the time
uh q learning so uh watkins had visited

2916
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
uh q learning so uh watkins had visited
 

2917
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,270
uh q learning so uh watkins had visited
the rich sutton's lab at umass or

2918
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
the rich sutton's lab at umass or
 

2919
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,349
the rich sutton's lab at umass or
it's andy barto's lab that rich was a

2920
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
it's andy barto's lab that rich was a
 

2921
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,790
it's andy barto's lab that rich was a
part of

2922
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
part of
 

2923
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,750
part of
and um he was really excited about this

2924
00:46:59,750 --> 00:46:59,760
and um he was really excited about this
 

2925
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,109
and um he was really excited about this
because it resolved a whole bunch of

2926
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
because it resolved a whole bunch of
 

2927
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,990
because it resolved a whole bunch of
problems that he didn't know how to

2928
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,000
problems that he didn't know how to
 

2929
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,870
problems that he didn't know how to
resolve in the

2930
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:02,880
resolve in the
 

2931
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,150
resolve in the
in the earlier paper and so uh

2932
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,160
in the earlier paper and so uh
 

2933
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,230
in the earlier paper and so uh
for people who don't know td temporal

2934
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
for people who don't know td temporal
 

2935
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,150
for people who don't know td temporal
difference these are all just algorithms

2936
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,160
difference these are all just algorithms
 

2937
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,430
difference these are all just algorithms
for reinforcement learning

over time
 

2945
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,589

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,829
better and or
but the theory didn't really support

2958
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:27,839
but the theory didn't really support
 

2959
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,109
but the theory didn't really support
changing your behavior like the

2960
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:29,119
changing your behavior like the
 

2961
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,710
changing your behavior like the
predictions had to be of a consistent

2962
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
predictions had to be of a consistent
 

2963
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,990
predictions had to be of a consistent
process if you really

2964
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,000
process if you really
 

2965
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,950
process if you really
wanted it to work and one of the things

2966
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:34,960
wanted it to work and one of the things
 

2967
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,470
wanted it to work and one of the things
that was really cool about

2968
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
that was really cool about
 

2969
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,230
that was really cool about
q-learning algorithm for reinforcement

2970
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,240
q-learning algorithm for reinforcement
 

2971
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,910
q-learning algorithm for reinforcement
learning is it was off policy which

2972
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:39,920
learning is it was off policy which
 

2973
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,030
learning is it was off policy which
meant that you could actually be

2974
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:41,040
meant that you could actually be
 

2975
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,710
meant that you could actually be
learning about the environment and what

2976
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
learning about the environment and what
 

2977
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,030
learning about the environment and what
the value of different actions would be

2978
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,040
the value of different actions would be
 

2979
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,630
the value of different actions would be
while actually figuring out how to

2980
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:46,640
while actually figuring out how to
 

2981
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,430
while actually figuring out how to
behave

2982
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
behave
 

2983
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,390
behave
optimally yeah so that was a revelation

2984
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
optimally yeah so that was a revelation
 

2985
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,670
optimally yeah so that was a revelation
yeah and the proof of that is kind of

2986
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,680
yeah and the proof of that is kind of
 

2987
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,069
yeah and the proof of that is kind of
interesting

2988
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:52,079
interesting
 

2989
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,589
interesting
i mean that's really surprising to me

2990
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
i mean that's really surprising to me
 

2991
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,910
i mean that's really surprising to me
when i first read that and then enriched

2992
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:55,920
when i first read that and then enriched
 

2993
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,710
when i first read that and then enriched
rich sutton's book on the matter it's

2994
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
rich sutton's book on the matter it's
 

2995
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,589
rich sutton's book on the matter it's
it's kind of

2996
00:47:59,589 --> 00:47:59,599
it's kind of
 

2997
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,109
it's kind of
beautiful that a single equation can

2998
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:01,119
beautiful that a single equation can
 

2999
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,349
beautiful that a single equation can
capture an equation one line of code and

3000
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
capture an equation one line of code and
 

3001
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,870
capture an equation one line of code and
like you can learn anything

3002
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
like you can learn anything
 

3003
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,430
like you can learn anything
yeah like enough time so equation and

3004
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,440
yeah like enough time so equation and
 

3005
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,549
yeah like enough time so equation and
code you're right like

3006
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:08,559
code you're right like
 

3007
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,829
code you're right like
you can the code that

3008
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:11,839
you can the code that
 

3009
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,270
you can the code that
you can arguably at least if you like

3010
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,280
you can arguably at least if you like
 

3011
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,549
you can arguably at least if you like
squint your eyes

3012
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
squint your eyes
 

3013
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,069
squint your eyes
can say this is all of intelligence

3014
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:20,079
can say this is all of intelligence
 

3015
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,150
can say this is all of intelligence
is that you can implement that in a

3016
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
is that you can implement that in a
 

3017
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,910
is that you can implement that in a
single wall i think i started with lisp

3018
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:23,920
single wall i think i started with lisp
 

3019
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,030
single wall i think i started with lisp
which is uh

3020
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:25,040
which is uh
 

3021
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,589
which is uh
shout out to lisp uh like a single line

3022
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
shout out to lisp uh like a single line
 

3023
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,470
shout out to lisp uh like a single line
of code

3024
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,480
of code
 

3025
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,349
of code
key piece of code maybe a couple that

3026
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:31,359
key piece of code maybe a couple that
 

3027
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,349
key piece of code maybe a couple that
you could do that it's kind of magical

3028
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:33,359
you could do that it's kind of magical
 

3029
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,950
you could do that it's kind of magical
it's uh feels too good to be true

3030
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,960
it's uh feels too good to be true
 

3031
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,829
it's uh feels too good to be true
well and it sort of is yeah it's kind of

3032
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:39,839
well and it sort of is yeah it's kind of
 

3033
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:40,230
well and it sort of is yeah it's kind of
kind of

3034
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:40,240
kind of
 

3035
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,990
kind of
it seems to require an awful lot of

3036
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
it seems to require an awful lot of
 

3037
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,670
it seems to require an awful lot of
extra stuff supporting it but

3038
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
extra stuff supporting it but
 

3039
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,589
extra stuff supporting it but
yeah but nonetheless the ideas the the

3040
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:45,599
yeah but nonetheless the ideas the the
 

3041
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,030
yeah but nonetheless the ideas the the
idea is really good and as far as we

3042
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,040
idea is really good and as far as we
 

3043
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,270
idea is really good and as far as we
know it is it is

3044
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:49,280
know it is it is
 

3045
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,870
know it is it is
a very reasonable way of trying to

3046
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:50,880
a very reasonable way of trying to
 

3047
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,390
a very reasonable way of trying to
create adaptive behavior

3048
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,400
create adaptive behavior
 

3049
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,630
create adaptive behavior
behavior that gets better at something

3050
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,640
behavior that gets better at something
 

3051
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,710
behavior that gets better at something
over time

3052
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:56,720
over time
 

3053
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,270
over time
did you find the idea of optimal uh at

3054
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,280
did you find the idea of optimal uh at
 

3055
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,470
did you find the idea of optimal uh at
all compelling that

3056
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
all compelling that
 

3057
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,069
all compelling that
you could prove that it's optimal so

3058
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:02,079
you could prove that it's optimal so
 

3059
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,790
you could prove that it's optimal so
like one part of computer science

3060
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:04,800
like one part of computer science
 

3061
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,349
like one part of computer science
that it makes people feel warm and fuzzy

3062
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
that it makes people feel warm and fuzzy
 

3063
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,069
that it makes people feel warm and fuzzy
inside

3064
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:08,079
inside
 

3065
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,309
inside
is when you can prove something like

3066
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:10,319
is when you can prove something like
 

3067
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,549
is when you can prove something like
that a sorting algorithm worst case

3068
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:12,559
that a sorting algorithm worst case
 

3069
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,630
that a sorting algorithm worst case
runs and and log n and it makes

3070
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,640
runs and and log n and it makes
 

3071
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,069
runs and and log n and it makes
everybody feel so good

3072
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:16,079
everybody feel so good
 

3073
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,829
everybody feel so good
even though in reality it doesn't really

3074
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:17,839
even though in reality it doesn't really
 

3075
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,270
even though in reality it doesn't really
matter what the worst case is what

3076
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
matter what the worst case is what
 

3077
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,990
matter what the worst case is what
matters is like

3078
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,000
matters is like
 

3079
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,910
matters is like
does this thing actually work in

3080
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:21,920
does this thing actually work in
 

3081
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,829
does this thing actually work in
practice on this particular actual set

3082
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:23,839
practice on this particular actual set
 

3083
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,030
practice on this particular actual set
of data that i

3084
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
of data that i
 

3085
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,109
of data that i
that i enjoy did you so here's that

3086
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:27,119
that i enjoy did you so here's that
 

3087
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,470
that i enjoy did you so here's that
here's a place where i have maybe a

3088
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
here's a place where i have maybe a
 

3089
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,950
here's a place where i have maybe a
strong opinion uh-oh which is like

3090
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
strong opinion uh-oh which is like
 

3091
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,470
strong opinion uh-oh which is like
you're right of course but no no like so

3092
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:34,480
you're right of course but no no like so
 

3093
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,270
you're right of course but no no like so
so the what makes worst case so great

3094
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:37,280
so the what makes worst case so great
 

3095
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,030
so the what makes worst case so great
right if you have a worst case analysis

3096
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
right if you have a worst case analysis
 

3097
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,950
right if you have a worst case analysis
so great is that you get modularity

3098
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:40,960
so great is that you get modularity
 

3099
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,510
so great is that you get modularity
you can take that thing and plug it into

3100
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:43,520
you can take that thing and plug it into
 

3101
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,870
you can take that thing and plug it into
another thing and still

3102
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
another thing and still
 

3103
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,870
another thing and still
have some understanding of what's going

3104
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:46,880
have some understanding of what's going
 

3105
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,950
have some understanding of what's going
to happen when you click them together

3106
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:48,960
to happen when you click them together
 

3107
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,030
to happen when you click them together
right if it just works well in practice

3108
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
right if it just works well in practice
 

3109
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,470
right if it just works well in practice
in other words with respect to some

3110
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
in other words with respect to some
 

3111
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,549
in other words with respect to some
distribution that you care about

3112
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:54,559
distribution that you care about
 

3113
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,150
distribution that you care about
when you go plug it into another thing

3114
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
when you go plug it into another thing
 

3115
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,750
when you go plug it into another thing
that distribution can shift

3116
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:57,760
that distribution can shift
 

3117
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,349
that distribution can shift
it can change and your thing may not

3118
00:49:59,349 --> 00:49:59,359
it can change and your thing may not
 

3119
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,510
it can change and your thing may not
work well anymore and you want it to

3120
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,520
work well anymore and you want it to
 

3121
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,190
work well anymore and you want it to
and you wish it does and you hope that

3122
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:03,200
and you wish it does and you hope that
 

3123
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,349
and you wish it does and you hope that
it will but it might not and then

3124
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:05,359
it will but it might not and then
 

3125
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,790
it will but it might not and then
ah so you're so so you're saying you

3126
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:08,800
ah so you're so so you're saying you
 

3127
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,069
ah so you're so so you're saying you
don't like

3128
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:10,079
don't like
 

3129
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,109
don't like
machine learning

3130
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:13,119
machine learning
 

3131
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,190
machine learning
but we have some positive theoretical

3132
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,200
but we have some positive theoretical
 

3133
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,270
but we have some positive theoretical
results for these things

3134
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,280
results for these things
 

3135
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,309
results for these things
you know you can come back at me with

3136
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:20,319
you know you can come back at me with
 

3137
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,150
you know you can come back at me with
yeah but they're really weak and yeah

3138
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,160
yeah but they're really weak and yeah
 

3139
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,750
yeah but they're really weak and yeah
they're really weak and and you can even

3140
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:23,760
they're really weak and and you can even
 

3141
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,309
they're really weak and and you can even
say that

3142
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
say that
 

3143
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,750
say that
you know sorting algorithms like if you

3144
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760
you know sorting algorithms like if you
 

3145
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,190
you know sorting algorithms like if you
do the optimal sorting algorithm it's

3146
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,200
do the optimal sorting algorithm it's
 

3147
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,829
do the optimal sorting algorithm it's
not really the one that you want

3148
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:29,839
not really the one that you want
 

3149
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,910
not really the one that you want
and that might be true as well but but

3150
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:31,920
and that might be true as well but but
 

3151
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,349
and that might be true as well but but
it is the modularity is a really

3152
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
it is the modularity is a really
 

3153
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,390
it is the modularity is a really
powerful statement

3154
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:34,400
powerful statement
 

3155
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,390
powerful statement
really as an engineer you can then

3156
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
really as an engineer you can then
 

3157
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,910
really as an engineer you can then
assemble different things you can count

3158
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,920
assemble different things you can count
 

3159
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,109
assemble different things you can count
on them to be

3160
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:39,119
on them to be
 

3161
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,470
on them to be
i mean it's interesting it's it's a

3162
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
i mean it's interesting it's it's a
 

3163
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,430
i mean it's interesting it's it's a
balance

3164
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,440
balance
 

3165
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,270
balance
like with everything else in life you

3166
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:45,280
like with everything else in life you
 

3167
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,430
like with everything else in life you
don't want to get too obsessed i mean

3168
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,440
don't want to get too obsessed i mean
 

3169
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,710
don't want to get too obsessed i mean
this is what computer scientists do

3170
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,720
this is what computer scientists do
 

3171
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,430
this is what computer scientists do
which they

3172
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
which they
 

3173
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,910
which they
potentially get obsessed they over

3174
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:51,920
potentially get obsessed they over
 

3175
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,430
potentially get obsessed they over
optimize things

3176
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:53,440
optimize things
 

3177
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,109
optimize things
or they start by optimizing them they

3178
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
or they start by optimizing them they
 

3179
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,109
or they start by optimizing them they
over optimize yeah so it's

3180
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
over optimize yeah so it's
 

3181
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,069
over optimize yeah so it's
it's easy to like get really granular

3182
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:00,079
it's easy to like get really granular
 

3183
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:00,870
it's easy to like get really granular
about this thing

3184
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
about this thing
 

3185
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,230
about this thing
but like the step from an n squared

3186
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
but like the step from an n squared
 

3187
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,430
but like the step from an n squared
to an n log n sorting algorithm is a big

3188
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
to an n log n sorting algorithm is a big
 

3189
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,390
to an n log n sorting algorithm is a big
leap

3190
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:08,400
leap
 

3191
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,790
leap
for most real-world systems no matter

3192
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:10,800
for most real-world systems no matter
 

3193
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,470
for most real-world systems no matter
what the actual

3194
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
what the actual
 

3195
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,990
what the actual
behavior of the system is that's a big

3196
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
behavior of the system is that's a big
 

3197
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,950
behavior of the system is that's a big
leap and the same can probably be

3198
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
leap and the same can probably be
 

3199
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,309
leap and the same can probably be
said for other kind of first

3200
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:20,319
said for other kind of first
 

3201
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,510
said for other kind of first
leaps that you would take on a

3202
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:21,520
leaps that you would take on a
 

3203
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,910
leaps that you would take on a
particular problem like it's the

3204
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:23,920
particular problem like it's the
 

3205
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,910
particular problem like it's the
picking the low hanging fruit or

3206
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920
picking the low hanging fruit or
 

3207
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,230
picking the low hanging fruit or
whatever the equivalent of

3208
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,240
whatever the equivalent of
 

3209
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,470
whatever the equivalent of
doing the not the dumbest thing but the

3210
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:30,480
doing the not the dumbest thing but the
 

3211
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,910
doing the not the dumbest thing but the
next to the dumbest thing

3212
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
next to the dumbest thing
 

3213
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,309
next to the dumbest thing
is picking the most delicious reachable

3214
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319
is picking the most delicious reachable
 

3215
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,109
is picking the most delicious reachable
fruit yeah

3216
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:35,119
fruit yeah
 

3217
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,470
fruit yeah
most delicious reachable fruit i don't

3218
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:36,480
most delicious reachable fruit i don't
 

3219
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,870
most delicious reachable fruit i don't
know why that's not a saying and

3220
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:38,880
know why that's not a saying and
 

3221
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,549
know why that's not a saying and
yeah okay so uh so you

3222
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:42,559
yeah okay so uh so you
 

3223
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,790
yeah okay so uh so you
then this is the 80s and this kind of

3224
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,800
then this is the 80s and this kind of
 

3225
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,109
then this is the 80s and this kind of
idea starts to percolate of uh

3226
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,119
idea starts to percolate of uh
 

3227
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,829
idea starts to percolate of uh
yeah at that point i got to re i got to

3228
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:49,839
yeah at that point i got to re i got to
 

3229
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,349
yeah at that point i got to re i got to
meet rich sutton so everything was sort

3230
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:51,359
meet rich sutton so everything was sort
 

3231
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,790
meet rich sutton so everything was sort
of downhill from there and that was that

3232
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:52,800
of downhill from there and that was that
 

3233
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,630
of downhill from there and that was that
was really the pinnacle of everything

3234
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
was really the pinnacle of everything
 

3235
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,630
was really the pinnacle of everything
um but then i you know then i felt like

3236
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:56,640
um but then i you know then i felt like
 

3237
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,710
um but then i you know then i felt like
i was kind of on the inside so then as

3238
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:58,720
i was kind of on the inside so then as
 

3239
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,069
i was kind of on the inside so then as
interesting results were happening i

3240
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:00,079
interesting results were happening i
 

3241
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,150
interesting results were happening i
could like check in with with

3242
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
could like check in with with
 

3243
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,069
could like check in with with
rich or with jerry tessaro who had a

3244
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
rich or with jerry tessaro who had a
 

3245
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,430
rich or with jerry tessaro who had a
huge impact on

3246
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:05,440
huge impact on
 

3247
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,549
huge impact on
uh kind of early thinking in in temporal

3248
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
uh kind of early thinking in in temporal
 

3249
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,670
uh kind of early thinking in in temporal
difference learning and reinforcement

3250
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:09,680
difference learning and reinforcement
 

3251
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,589
difference learning and reinforcement
learning and showed that you could do

3252
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:11,599
learning and showed that you could do
 

3253
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,109
learning and showed that you could do
you could solve problems that we didn't

3254
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:13,119
you could solve problems that we didn't
 

3255
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,990
you could solve problems that we didn't
know how to solve any other way

3256
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,000
know how to solve any other way
 

3257
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,910
know how to solve any other way
and so that was really cool so as good

3258
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:17,920
and so that was really cool so as good
 

3259
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,349
and so that was really cool so as good
things were happening i would hear about

3260
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:19,359
things were happening i would hear about
 

3261
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:19,829
things were happening i would hear about
it from

3262
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
it from
 

3263
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,589
it from
either the people who were doing it or

3264
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:21,599
either the people who were doing it or
 

3265
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,790
either the people who were doing it or
the people who were talking to the

3266
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:22,800
the people who were talking to the
 

3267
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,910
the people who were talking to the
people who are doing it

3268
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920
people who are doing it
 

3269
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,430
people who are doing it
and so i was able to track things pretty

3270
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,440
and so i was able to track things pretty
 

3271
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,150
and so i was able to track things pretty
well through through the 90s

3272
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
well through through the 90s
 

3273
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,910
well through through the 90s
so what uh wasn't most of the excitement

3274
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:31,920
so what uh wasn't most of the excitement
 

3275
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,230
so what uh wasn't most of the excitement
on reinforcement learning in the 90s

3276
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:34,240
on reinforcement learning in the 90s
 

3277
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,750
on reinforcement learning in the 90s
era with what is it td gamma like

3278
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:37,760
era with what is it td gamma like
 

3279
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,470
era with what is it td gamma like
what's the role of these kind of little

3280
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
what's the role of these kind of little
 

3281

uh intelligent systems so like what did

3310
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:13,119
uh intelligent systems so like what did
 

3311
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,630
uh intelligent systems so like what did
you think about tt gamble like what did

3312
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
you think about tt gamble like what did
 

3313
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,990
you think about tt gamble like what did
you think about that whole thing in the

3314
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000
you think about that whole thing in the
 

3315
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,390
you think about that whole thing in the
90s yeah i mean i found the td gammon

3316
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:18,400
90s yeah i mean i found the td gammon
 

3317
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,790
90s yeah i mean i found the td gammon
result really just remarkable so i had

3318
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800
result really just remarkable so i had
 

3319
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,470
result really just remarkable so i had
known about some of jerry's stuff before

3320
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:22,480
known about some of jerry's stuff before
 

3321
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,710
known about some of jerry's stuff before
he did td gammon he did a system

3322
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
he did td gammon he did a system
 

3323
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,190
he did td gammon he did a system
just more vanilla well not not entirely

3324
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
just more vanilla well not not entirely
 

3325
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,589
just more vanilla well not not entirely
vanilla but a more classical backproppy

3326
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
vanilla but a more classical backproppy
 

3327
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,230
vanilla but a more classical backproppy
kind of

3328
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,240
kind of
 

3329
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,790
kind of
uh network for playing back ammon where

3330
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800
uh network for playing back ammon where
 

3331
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,230
uh network for playing back ammon where
he was training it on

3332
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:34,240
he was training it on
 

3333
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,069
he was training it on
expert moves so it was kind of

3334
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:36,079
expert moves so it was kind of
 

3335
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,230
expert moves so it was kind of
supervised but the way that it worked

3336
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,240
supervised but the way that it worked
 

3337
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:38,790
supervised but the way that it worked
was not

3338
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:38,800
was not
 

3339
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,990
was not
to mimic the actions but to learn

3340
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
to mimic the actions but to learn
 

3341
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,309
to mimic the actions but to learn
internally an evaluation function so to

3342
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:44,319
internally an evaluation function so to
 

3343
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,109
internally an evaluation function so to
learn

3344
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:45,119
learn
 

3345
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,270
learn
well if the expert chose this over this

3346
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:47,280
well if the expert chose this over this
 

3347
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,190
well if the expert chose this over this
that must mean that the expert values

3348
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,200
that must mean that the expert values
 

3349
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,510
that must mean that the expert values
this

3350
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,520
this
 

3351
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,510
this
more than this and so let me adjust my

3352
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
more than this and so let me adjust my
 

3353
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,870
more than this and so let me adjust my
weights to make it so that

3354
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:52,880
weights to make it so that
 

3355
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,030
weights to make it so that
the network evaluates this as being

3356
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,040
the network evaluates this as being
 

3357
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,150
the network evaluates this as being
better than this

3358
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,160
better than this
 

3359
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,950
better than this
so it could learn from from human

3360
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:58,960
so it could learn from from human
 

3361
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,829
so it could learn from from human
preferences

3362
00:53:59,829 --> 00:53:59,839
preferences
 

3363
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,950
preferences
it could learn its own preferences and

3364
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:02,960
it could learn its own preferences and
 

3365
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,950
it could learn its own preferences and
then when he took the step from that to

3366
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:04,960
then when he took the step from that to
 

3367
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,990
then when he took the step from that to
actually

3368
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
actually
 

3369
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,829
actually
doing it as a full-on reinforcement

3370
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
doing it as a full-on reinforcement
 

3371
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,430
doing it as a full-on reinforcement
learning problem where you didn't need

3372
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,440
learning problem where you didn't need
 

3373
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,829
learning problem where you didn't need
a trainer you could just let it play

3374
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
a trainer you could just let it play
 

3375
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,910
a trainer you could just let it play
that was that was remarkable right and

3376
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
that was that was remarkable right and
 

3377
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,109
that was that was remarkable right and
so i think

3378
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:15,119
so i think
 

3379
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,870
so i think
as as humans often do as we've done

3380
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:18,880
as as humans often do as we've done
 

3381
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,190
as as humans often do as we've done
in the recent past as well people

3382
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,200
in the recent past as well people
 

3383
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,950
in the recent past as well people
extrapolate it's like oh well if you can

3384
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960
extrapolate it's like oh well if you can
 

3385
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,870
extrapolate it's like oh well if you can
do that which is obviously very hard

3386
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880
do that which is obviously very hard
 

3387
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,109
do that which is obviously very hard
then obviously you could do all these

3388
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:27,119
then obviously you could do all these
 

3389
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,390
then obviously you could do all these
other problems that we

3390
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,400
other problems that we
 

3391
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,069
other problems that we
that we want to solve that we know are

3392
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:30,079
that we want to solve that we know are
 

3393
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,430
that we want to solve that we know are
also really hard

3394
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,440
also really hard
 

3395
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,510
also really hard
and it turned out very few of them ended

3396
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
and it turned out very few of them ended
 

3397
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,190
and it turned out very few of them ended
up being practical

3398
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
up being practical

yeah and which i think speaks to

3446
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
yeah and which i think speaks to
 

3447
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,349
yeah and which i think speaks to
the role of the human expert in the

3448
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:27,359
the role of the human expert in the
 

3449
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,710
the role of the human expert in the
process of machine learning

3450

process of machine learning
 

3451
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,030
process of machine learning
right it's so easy we're so drawn to the

3452
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,040
right it's so easy we're so drawn to the
 

3453
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,950
right it's so easy we're so drawn to the
idea that that it's the technology that

3454
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:32,960
idea that that it's the technology that
 

3455
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,430
idea that that it's the technology that
is that

3456
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:33,440
is that
 

3457
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,390
is that
is where the power is coming from that i

3458
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:36,400
is where the power is coming from that i
 

3459
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,069

think we lose sight of the fact that

3460
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:38,079
think we lose sight of the fact that

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,349
think we lose sight of the fact that
sometimes you need a really good

sometimes you need a really good
just like i mean no one would think hey

3464
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
just like i mean no one would think hey

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,150
just like i mean no one would think hey
here's this great piece of software

00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,160
here's this great piece of software
 

3467
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,910
here's this great piece of software
here's like i don't know gnu emacs or

3468
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:43,920
here's like i don't know gnu emacs or

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,710
here's like i don't know gnu emacs or
whatever

whatever
 

3471
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,430
whatever
um doesn't that prove that computers are

3472
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
um doesn't that prove that computers are
 

3473
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,630
um doesn't that prove that computers are
super powerful and

3474
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,640
super powerful and
 

3475
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,829
super powerful and
basically going to take over the world

3476
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:49,839
basically going to take over the world
 

3477
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,829
basically going to take over the world
it's like no stallman is a hell of a

3478
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:51,839
it's like no stallman is a hell of a
 

3479
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,069
it's like no stallman is a hell of a
hacker right so he was able to make

3480
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
hacker right so he was able to make
 

3481
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,910
hacker right so he was able to make
the code do these amazing things he

3482
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
the code do these amazing things he
 

3483
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,789
the code do these amazing things he
couldn't have done it without the

3484
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:56,799
couldn't have done it without the
 

3485
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,230
couldn't have done it without the
computer but the computer couldn't have

3486
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
computer but the computer couldn't have
 

3487
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,109
computer but the computer couldn't have
done it without him

3488
00:55:59,109 --> 00:55:59,119
done it without him
 

3489
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,910
done it without him
and so i think people discount the role

3490
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:01,920
and so i think people discount the role
 

3491
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,270
and so i think people discount the role
of people like jerry who

the tail taylor swift takeover yeah and
 

3701
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,990
the tail taylor swift takeover yeah and
i mean people should know that td gammon

3702
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,000
i mean people should know that td gammon
 

3703
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,549
i mean people should know that td gammon
was i get would you call it do you like

3704
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
was i get would you call it do you like
 

3705
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:29,829
was i get would you call it do you like
the terminology of self

3706
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:29,839
the terminology of self
 

3707
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,230
the terminology of self
play by any chance so like systems that

3708
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:32,240
play by any chance so like systems that
 

3709
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,190
play by any chance so like systems that
learn

3710
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:33,200
learn
 

3711
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,829
learn
by playing themselves just i don't know

3712
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:35,839
by playing themselves just i don't know
 

3713
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,270
by playing themselves just i don't know
if it's the best word

3714
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:37,280
if it's the best word
 

3715
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,109
if it's the best word
but uh so what's what's the problem with

3716
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:39,119
but uh so what's what's the problem with
 

3717
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,030
but uh so what's what's the problem with
that term

3718
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
that term
 

3719
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,309
that term
okay so it's like the big bang like

3720
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:44,319
okay so it's like the big bang like
 

3721
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,309
okay so it's like the big bang like
it's it's like talking to serious

3722
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:46,319
it's it's like talking to serious
 

3723
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,910
it's it's like talking to serious
physicists do you like the term big bang

3724
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:47,920
physicists do you like the term big bang
 

3725
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,150
physicists do you like the term big bang
and

3726
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:48,160
and
 

3727
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,230
and
when when it was early i feel like it's

3728
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:50,240
when when it was early i feel like it's
 

3729
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,910
when when it was early i feel like it's
the early days of self-play i don't know

3730
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:51,920
the early days of self-play i don't know
 

3731
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,670
the early days of self-play i don't know
maybe it was just previously but

3732
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:53,680
maybe it was just previously but
 

3733
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,390
maybe it was just previously but
i think it's been used by only a small

3734
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:56,400
i think it's been used by only a small
 

3735
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,109
i think it's been used by only a small
group of people

00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,119
group of people
 

3737
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,710
group of people
uh and so like i think we're still

3738
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:58,720
uh and so like i think we're still
 

3739
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,230
uh and so like i think we're still
deciding is this

3740
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
deciding is this
 

3741
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,950
deciding is this

okay it depends how broadly you apply

3752
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:08,559
okay it depends how broadly you apply
 

3753
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,270
okay it depends how broadly you apply
the term so i used the term in my 1996

3754
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:11,280
the term so i used the term in my 1996

tessaro's paper was something like um

3762
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:18,480
tessaro's paper was something like um
 

3763
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,150

training up an expert

3764
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:20,160
training up an expert
 

3765
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,829
training up an expert
backgammon player through self-play so i

3766
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:21,839
backgammon player through self-play so i
 

3767
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,510
backgammon player through self-play so i
think it was in the title of his paper

3768
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,520
think it was in the title of his paper
 

3769
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,030
think it was in the title of his paper
okay if not in the title it was

3770
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
okay if not in the title it was
 

3771
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,030
okay if not in the title it was
definitely a term that he used

3772
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:27,040
definitely a term that he used
 

3773
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,230
definitely a term that he used
there's another term that we got from

3774
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:28,240
there's another term that we got from
 

3775
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,150
there's another term that we got from
that work is rollout so i don't know if

3776
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:30,160
that work is rollout so i don't know if
 

3777
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,910
that work is rollout so i don't know if
you do you ever hear the term rollout

3778
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:31,920
you do you ever hear the term rollout
 

3779
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,069
you do you ever hear the term rollout
that's a backgammon term that has now

3780
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079
that's a backgammon term that has now
 

3781
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,109
that's a backgammon term that has now
applied

3782
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:35,119
applied
 

3783
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,190
applied
generally in computers well at least in

3784
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:37,200
generally in computers well at least in
 

3785
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,309

because of td gammon yeah that's

3788
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:40,880
because of td gammon yeah that's
 

3789
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,470
because of td gammon yeah that's
fascinating so how is health play being

3790
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
fascinating so how is health play being
 

3791
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,470
fascinating so how is health play being
used now and like why is it does it does

3792
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:44,480
used now and like why is it does it does
 

3793
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,910
used now and like why is it does it does
it feel like a more general powerful

3794
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:45,920
it feel like a more general powerful
 

3795
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,390
it feel like a more general powerful
concept

3796
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:46,400
concept
 

3797
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,230
concept
sort of the idea of well the machine's

3798
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
sort of the idea of well the machine's
 

3799
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,910
sort of the idea of well the machine's
just going to teach itself to be smart

3800
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:49,920
just going to teach itself to be smart
 

3801
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,150
just going to teach itself to be smart
yeah so that's that's where maybe you

3802
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,160
yeah so that's that's where maybe you
 

3803
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,670
yeah so that's that's where maybe you
can correct me

3804
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:53,680
can correct me
 

3805
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,950
can correct me
but that's where you know the

3806
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960
but that's where you know the
 

3807
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,190
but that's where you know the
continuation of the spirit and actually

3808
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,200
continuation of the spirit and actually
 

3809
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,510
continuation of the spirit and actually
like

3810
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:57,520
like
 

3811
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,630
like
literally the exact algorithms of td

01:01:07,109 --> 01:01:07,119
that are a little bit more complex
 

3819
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,390
that are a little bit more complex
that when i was learning artificial

3820
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:08,400
that when i was learning artificial
 

3821
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,710

01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,430
or was the professors instilled in me
the idea like this is the limits of

3848
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:35,440
the idea like this is the limits of
 

3849
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,950
the idea like this is the limits of
artificial intelligence

3850
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:36,960
artificial intelligence
 

3851
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,390
artificial intelligence
of the field like it instilled in me the

3852
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:40,400
of the field like it instilled in me the
 

3853
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,109
of the field like it instilled in me the
idea that

3854
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:41,119
idea that
 

3855
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,349
idea that
if we can create a system that can solve

3856
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:43,359
if we can create a system that can solve
 

3857
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:44,789
if we can create a system that can solve
the game of go

3858
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
the game of go
 

3859
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,030
the game of go
we've achieved agi that was kind of i

3860
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,040
we've achieved agi that was kind of i
 

3861
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,470
we've achieved agi that was kind of i
didn't explicitly like

3862
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:48,480
didn't explicitly like
 

3863
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,270
didn't explicitly like
say this but it that was the feeling and

3864
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:51,280
say this but it that was the feeling and
 

3865
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,030
say this but it that was the feeling and
so from i was one of the people that it

3866
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:53,040
so from i was one of the people that it
 

3867
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,430
so from i was one of the people that it
seemed

3868
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
seemed
 

3869
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,470
seemed
magical when a learning system was able

3870
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:56,480
magical when a learning system was able
 

3871
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:56,870
magical when a learning system was able
to

3872
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880
to
 

3873
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,990
to
to beat a uh a human

to beat a uh a human
 

3875
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,710
to beat a uh a human
world champion at the game of go and

world champion at the game of go and
 

3877
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,710
world champion at the game of go and
even more so

3878
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:04,720
even more so
 

3879
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,270
even more so
from that that was alphago even more so

3880
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:07,280
from that that was alphago even more so
 

3881
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,630
from that that was alphago even more so
with alphago zero then

3882
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:08,640
with alphago zero then
 

3883
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,630
with alphago zero then
kind of renamed and advanced into alpha

3884
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:10,640
kind of renamed and advanced into alpha
 

3885
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,990
kind of renamed and advanced into alpha

3915
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,029
breakthrough performance of alpha zero
was

3916
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:45,039
was
 

3917
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,309
was
okay so alphago knocked my socks off

01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
okay so alphago knocked my socks off
 

3919
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,870
okay so alphago knocked my socks off
that was that was so remarkable which

i don't
 

3937
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,789
i don't
i i've never been a part of a program as

complicated as the program that they

3940
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,160
complicated as the program that they
 

3941
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,589
complicated as the program that they
built for that

3942
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
built for that
 

3943
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,390
built for that
and um and just the you know like like

3944
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:12,400
and um and just the you know like like
 

3945
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,549
and um and just the you know like like
jerry tessaro is a neural net whisperer

like you know david silver is a kind of

3948
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:16,240
like you know david silver is a kind of
 

3949
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,069
like you know david silver is a kind of
neural net whisperer too he was able to

3950
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:18,079
neural net whisperer too he was able to
 

3951
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,270
neural net whisperer too he was able to
coax these networks

3952
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:19,280
coax these networks
 

3953
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,510
coax these networks
and these new way out their

3954
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:21,520
and these new way out their
 

3955
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,109
and these new way out their
architectures to do

3956
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:23,119
architectures to do
 

3957
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,029
architectures to do
these you know solve these problems that

3958
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
these you know solve these problems that
 

3959
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,470
these you know solve these problems that
um as you said

3960
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
um as you said
 

3961
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,109
um as you said
you know when we were learning from uh

3962
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:29,119
you know when we were learning from uh
 

3963
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,109
you know when we were learning from uh
ai

3964
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
ai
 

3965
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,630
ai
no one had an idea how to make it work

3966
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
no one had an idea how to make it work
 

3967
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,309
no one had an idea how to make it work
it was it was remarkable

3968
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:34,319
it was it was remarkable
 

3969
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:38,309
it was it was remarkable
that um these you know these these

3970
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:38,319
that um these you know these these
 

3971
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,750
that um these you know these these
techniques that were so good at playing

3972
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:39,760
techniques that were so good at playing
 

3973
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,870
techniques that were so good at playing
chess and they could beat the world

3974
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:40,880
chess and they could beat the world
 

3975
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,990
chess and they could beat the world
champion in chess

3976
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:42,000
champion in chess
 

3977
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,230
champion in chess
couldn't beat you know your typical go

3978
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:44,240
couldn't beat you know your typical go
 

3979
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,630
couldn't beat you know your typical go
playing teenager and go

3980
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,640
playing teenager and go
 

3981
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,789
playing teenager and go
so the fact that that you know in a very

3982
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:48,799
so the fact that that you know in a very
 

3983
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,470
so the fact that that you know in a very
short number of years we kind of ramped

3984
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
short number of years we kind of ramped
 

3985
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,190
short number of years we kind of ramped
up to

3986
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,200
up to
 

3987
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,789
up to
uh trouncing people and go just

3988
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:54,799
uh trouncing people and go just
 

3989
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,109
uh trouncing people and go just
blew me away so you're kind of focusing

3990
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,119
blew me away so you're kind of focusing
 

3991
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:57,990
blew me away so you're kind of focusing
on the engineering

3992
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000
on the engineering
 

3993
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,990
on the engineering
aspect which is also very surprising i

3994
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,000
aspect which is also very surprising i
 

3995
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,910
aspect which is also very surprising i
mean there's something

3996
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:01,920
mean there's something
 

3997
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,549
mean there's something
different about large well-funded

3998
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:04,559
different about large well-funded
 

3999
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,150
different about large well-funded
companies i mean there's a compute

4000
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:06,160
companies i mean there's a compute
 

4001
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,109
companies i mean there's a compute
aspect to it too

4002
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
aspect to it too
 

4003
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,549
aspect to it too
sure like that of course

4004
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
sure like that of course
 

4005
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,710
sure like that of course
i mean that's similar to deep blue right

4006
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:12,720
i mean that's similar to deep blue right
 

4007
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,150
i mean that's similar to deep blue right
with uh with ibm

4008
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
with uh with ibm
 

4009
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,230
with uh with ibm
like there's something important to be

4010
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,240
like there's something important to be
 

4011
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,589
like there's something important to be
learned and remembered about

4012
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:17,599
learned and remembered about
 

4013
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,549
learned and remembered about
a large company taking the ideas that

4014
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:20,559
a large company taking the ideas that
 

4015
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:20,870
a large company taking the ideas that
are

4016
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
are
 

4017
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,870
are
already out there and investing a few

4018
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:22,880
already out there and investing a few
 

4019
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,390
already out there and investing a few
million dollars into it

4020
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,400
million dollars into it
 

4021
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,750
million dollars into it
or or more and

4022
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,760
or or more and
 

4023
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,750
or or more and
so you're kind of saying the engineering

4024
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
so you're kind of saying the engineering
 

4025
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,990
so you're kind of saying the engineering
is kind of fascinating both on the

4026
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
is kind of fascinating both on the
 

4027
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,549
is kind of fascinating both on the
with alphago is probably just gathering

4028
01:04:34,549 --> 01:04:34,559
with alphago is probably just gathering
 

4029
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,270
with alphago is probably just gathering
all the data

4030
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:35,280
all the data
 

4031
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,349
all the data
right of the expert games like

4032
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:37,359
right of the expert games like
 

4033
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:38,789
right of the expert games like
organizing everything

4034
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:38,799
organizing everything
 

4035
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,910
organizing everything
actually doing distributed supervised

01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
learning
 

4039
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,829
learning
and to me

4040
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:45,839
and to me
 

4041
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,349
and to me
see the engineering i kind of took for

4042
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:47,359
see the engineering i kind of took for
 

4043
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,349
see the engineering i kind of took for
granted

4044
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:49,359
granted
 

4045
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:52,829

persist in the

01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,390
persist in the
in the face of like long odds because it

4050
01:04:58,390 --> 01:04:58,400
in the face of like long odds because it
 

4051
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,029
in the face of like long odds because it
feels like

4052
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,039
feels like
 

4053
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,430
feels like
for me i'll be one of the skeptical

4054
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
for me i'll be one of the skeptical
 

4055
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,029
for me i'll be one of the skeptical
people in the room thinking that you can

4056
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:03,039
people in the room thinking that you can
 

4057
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:03,910
people in the room thinking that you can
learn your way to

4058
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:03,920
learn your way to

01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,270
learn your way to
to beat go like it sounded like

4060
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:07,280
to beat go like it sounded like
 

4061
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,710
to beat go like it sounded like
especially with david silver it sounded

4062
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:08,720
especially with david silver it sounded
 

4063
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,990
especially with david silver it sounded
like david was not

4064
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
like david was not
 

4065
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,150
like david was not
confident at all it's like it was like

4066
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,160
confident at all it's like it was like
 

4067
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,990
confident at all it's like it was like
not it's funny how confidence works

4068
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
not it's funny how confidence works
 

4069
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,190
not it's funny how confidence works
yeah it's like you're not like cocky

4070
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
yeah it's like you're not like cocky
 

4071
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,150
yeah it's like you're not like cocky
about it

4072
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:22,160
about it
 

4073
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,510
about it
like but right because if you're cocky

4074
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:25,520
like but right because if you're cocky
 

4075
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,230
like but right because if you're cocky
about it you

4076
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:26,240
about it you
 

4077
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,829
about it you
kind of stop and stall and don't get

4078
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:27,839
kind of stop and stall and don't get
 

4079
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,670
kind of stop and stall and don't get
anywhere yeah but there's like a

4080
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:29,680
anywhere yeah but there's like a
 

4081
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,990
anywhere yeah but there's like a
hope that's unbreakable maybe that's

4082
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,000
hope that's unbreakable maybe that's
 

4083
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,750
hope that's unbreakable maybe that's
better than confidence it's a kind of

4084
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:33,760
better than confidence it's a kind of
 

4085
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,789
better than confidence it's a kind of
wishful

4086
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:34,799
wishful
 

4087
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,870
wishful
hope and a little dream and you almost

4088
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:36,880
hope and a little dream and you almost
 

4089
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,190
hope and a little dream and you almost
don't want to do anything else you kind

4090
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:39,200
don't want to do anything else you kind
 

4091
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:39,589
don't want to do anything else you kind
of

4092
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:39,599
of
 

4093
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,750
of
keep doing it that's that seems to be

4094
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:41,760
keep doing it that's that seems to be
 

4095
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,029
keep doing it that's that seems to be
the story

4096
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:43,039
the story
 

4097
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,789
the story
and but with enough skepticism that

4098
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799
and but with enough skepticism that
 

4099
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,390
and but with enough skepticism that
you're looking for where the problems

4100
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:46,400
you're looking for where the problems
 

4101
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,349
you're looking for where the problems
are and fighting

4102
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
are and fighting
 

4103
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:48,870
are and fighting
through them yeah because you know

4104
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:48,880
through them yeah because you know
 

4105
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,309
through them yeah because you know
there's got to be a way out of this

4106
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:50,319
there's got to be a way out of this
 

4107
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:50,950
there's got to be a way out of this
thing yeah

4108
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:50,960
thing yeah
 

4109
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,069
thing yeah
and for him it was probably there's

4110
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:54,079
and for him it was probably there's
 

4111
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,349
and for him it was probably there's
there's a bunch of little factors that

4112
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:55,359
there's a bunch of little factors that
 

4113
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,470
there's a bunch of little factors that
come into play it's funny how these

4114
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:56,480
come into play it's funny how these
 

4115
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,829
come into play it's funny how these
stories just all come together like

4116
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
stories just all come together like
 

4117
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,750
stories just all come together like
everything he did in his life

4118
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
everything he did in his life
 

4119
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,510
everything he did in his life
came into play which is like a love for

4120
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,520
came into play which is like a love for
 

4121
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,789
came into play which is like a love for
video games

4122
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:02,799
video games
 

4123
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:06,309
video games
and also a connection to so the the 90s

4124
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
and also a connection to so the the 90s
 

4125
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,390
and also a connection to so the the 90s
had to happen with td gammon and so on

4126
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
had to happen with td gammon and so on
 

4127
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:08,870
had to happen with td gammon and so on
yeah

4128
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:08,880
yeah
 

4129
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,589
yeah
in some ways it's surprising maybe you

4130
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:11,599
in some ways it's surprising maybe you
 

4131
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,510
in some ways it's surprising maybe you
can provide some intuition to it

4132
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:13,520
can provide some intuition to it
 

4133
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,829
can provide some intuition to it
that not much more than td gammon was

4134
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:15,839
that not much more than td gammon was
 

4135
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,430
that not much more than td gammon was
done for quite a long time

4136
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,440
done for quite a long time
 

4137
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,670
done for quite a long time
on the reinforcement learning front yeah

4138
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:19,680
on the reinforcement learning front yeah
 

4139
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,950
on the reinforcement learning front yeah
is that weird to you

4140
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:20,960
is that weird to you
 

4141
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,430
is that weird to you
i mean like i said the the students who

4142
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:23,440
i mean like i said the the students who
 

4143
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,589
i mean like i said the the students who
i worked with we tried to get

4144
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
i worked with we tried to get
 

4145
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,190
i worked with we tried to get
basically apply that architecture to

4146
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,200
basically apply that architecture to
 

4147
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,950
basically apply that architecture to
other problems and

4148
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:28,960
other problems and
 

4149
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,950
other problems and
we consistently failed there were a

4150
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
we consistently failed there were a
 

4151
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,150
we consistently failed there were a
couple

4152
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
couple
 

4153
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,910
couple
a couple really nice demonstrations that

4154
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:33,920
a couple really nice demonstrations that
 

4155
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,109
a couple really nice demonstrations that
ended up being in the literature there

4156
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
ended up being in the literature there
 

4157
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:35,990
ended up being in the literature there
was a

4158
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,000
was a
 

4159
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,549
was a
paper about controlling elevators right

4160
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:38,559
paper about controlling elevators right
 

4161
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,630
paper about controlling elevators right
where it's it's like okay

4162
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:40,640
where it's it's like okay
 

4163
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,230
where it's it's like okay
can we modify the heuristic that

4164
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,240
can we modify the heuristic that
 

4165
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,910
can we modify the heuristic that
elevators use for deciding like a bank

4166
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
elevators use for deciding like a bank
 

4167
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,270
elevators use for deciding like a bank
of elevators for deciding

4168
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:45,280
of elevators for deciding
 

4169
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,470
of elevators for deciding
which floors we should be stopping on to

4170
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,480
which floors we should be stopping on to
 

4171
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,390
which floors we should be stopping on to
maximize throughput essentially and you

4172
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,400
maximize throughput essentially and you
 

4173
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,510
maximize throughput essentially and you
can set that up as a reinforcement

4174
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:51,520
can set that up as a reinforcement
 

4175
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,710
can set that up as a reinforcement
learning problem and you can

4176
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:52,720
learning problem and you can
 

4177
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,789
learning problem and you can
you know have a neural net represent the

4178
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:54,799
you know have a neural net represent the
 

4179
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,470
you know have a neural net represent the
value function so that it's taking

4180
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:56,480
value function so that it's taking
 

4181
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,150
value function so that it's taking
where all the elevators where the button

4182
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:58,160
where all the elevators where the button
 

4183
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,470
where all the elevators where the button
pushes you know this high dimensional

4184
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:00,480
pushes you know this high dimensional
 

4185
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,190
pushes you know this high dimensional
well at the time high dimensional input

4186
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:03,200
well at the time high dimensional input
 

4187
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,510
well at the time high dimensional input
um you know a couple dozen dimensions

4188
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:05,520
um you know a couple dozen dimensions
 

4189
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,990
um you know a couple dozen dimensions
and turn that into a prediction as to oh

4190
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
and turn that into a prediction as to oh
 

4191
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,190
and turn that into a prediction as to oh
is it going to be better if i stop at

4192
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:09,200
is it going to be better if i stop at
 

4193
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,470
is it going to be better if i stop at
this floor or not

4194
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:10,480
this floor or not
 

4195
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,510
this floor or not
and ultimately it appeared as though for

4196
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:13,520
and ultimately it appeared as though for
 

4197
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,549
and ultimately it appeared as though for
the

4198
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:14,559
the
 

4199
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,029
the
standard simulation distribution for

4200
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,039
standard simulation distribution for
 

4201
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,230
standard simulation distribution for
people trying to leave the building at

4202
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
people trying to leave the building at
 

4203
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,109
people trying to leave the building at
the end of the day

4204
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:19,119
the end of the day
 

4205
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,470
the end of the day
that the neural net learned a better

4206
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:20,480
that the neural net learned a better
 

4207
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,069
that the neural net learned a better
strategy than the standard one that's

4208
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
strategy than the standard one that's
 

4209
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,109
strategy than the standard one that's
implemented in

4210
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:23,119
implemented in
 

4211
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,750
implemented in
elevator controllers so that that was

4212
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:25,760
elevator controllers so that that was
 

4213
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,390
elevator controllers so that that was
nice

4214
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:26,400
nice
 

4215
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,390
nice
there was some work that satender singh

4216
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
there was some work that satender singh
 

4217
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,670
there was some work that satender singh
it all did on

4218
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
it all did on
 

4219
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,430
it all did on
uh handoffs with cell phones

4220
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:33,440
uh handoffs with cell phones
 

4221
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,430
uh handoffs with cell phones
uh you know deciding when when should

4222
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:35,440
uh you know deciding when when should
 

4223
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,510
uh you know deciding when when should
you hand off from this cell tower to

4224
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:37,520
you hand off from this cell tower to
 

4225
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,390
you hand off from this cell tower to
this cell

4226
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,400
this cell
 

4227
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,230
this cell
okay communication networks yeah yeah

4228
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,240
okay communication networks yeah yeah
 

4229
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,750
okay communication networks yeah yeah
and so

4230
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:41,760
and so
 

4231
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,349
and so
a couple things seemed like they were

4232
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
a couple things seemed like they were
 

4233
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,789
a couple things seemed like they were
really promising none of them made it

4234
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:44,799
really promising none of them made it
 

4235
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:46,789
really promising none of them made it
into production that i'm aware of

4236
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:46,799
into production that i'm aware of
 

4237
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,390
into production that i'm aware of
and neural nets as a whole started to

4238
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:48,400
and neural nets as a whole started to
 

4239
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,230
and neural nets as a whole started to
kind of implode around then

4240
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:50,240
kind of implode around then
 

4241
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,270
kind of implode around then
and so there just wasn't a lot of air in

4242
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:53,280
and so there just wasn't a lot of air in
 

4243
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,870
and so there just wasn't a lot of air in
the room for people to try to figure out

4244
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
the room for people to try to figure out
 

4245
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,390
the room for people to try to figure out
okay how do we get this to work

4246
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:56,400
okay how do we get this to work
 

4247
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,270
okay how do we get this to work
in the rl setting and then they they

4248
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,280
in the rl setting and then they they
 

4249
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,470
in the rl setting and then they they
found their way back in

4250
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:00,480
found their way back in
 

4251
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,750
found their way back in
in 10 in 10 plus years so you said

4252
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:03,760
in 10 in 10 plus years so you said
 

4253
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,829
in 10 in 10 plus years so you said
alphago was impressive like it's a big

4254
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:05,839
alphago was impressive like it's a big
 

4255
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,549
alphago was impressive like it's a big
spectacle is there right so then alpha

4256
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:08,559
spectacle is there right so then alpha
 

4257
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,470
spectacle is there right so then alpha
zero so i think i may have a slightly

4258
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,480
zero so i think i may have a slightly
 

4259
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,349
zero so i think i may have a slightly
different opinion

4260
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:11,359
different opinion
 

4261
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,589
different opinion
on this than some people so um i talked

4262
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:13,599
on this than some people so um i talked
 

4263
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,190
on this than some people so um i talked
to tinder saying in particular about

4264
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:15,200
to tinder saying in particular about
 

4265
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,870
to tinder saying in particular about
this so satinder was

4266
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
this so satinder was
 

4267
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,870
this so satinder was
uh like rich sutton a student of

4268
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
uh like rich sutton a student of
 

4269
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,470
uh like rich sutton a student of
antibartow so they came out of the same

4270
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:20,480
antibartow so they came out of the same
 

4271
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,110
antibartow so they came out of the same
lab

4272
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120

uh now deep mind uh as just as is rich

4278
01:08:29,749 --> 01:08:29,759
uh now deep mind uh as just as is rich
 

4279
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,749
uh now deep mind uh as just as is rich
though different sites the two of them

he's in alberta

4282
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
he's in alberta
 

4283
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,510
he's in alberta
rich is in alberta and uh satinder would

4284
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:35,520
rich is in alberta and uh satinder would
 

4285
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,870
rich is in alberta and uh satinder would
be in england but i think he's in

4286
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
be in england but i think he's in
 

4287
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,189
be in england but i think he's in
england from michigan at the moment

4288
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:39,199
england from michigan at the moment
 

4289
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,309
england from michigan at the moment
uh but the but he was yes he was much

4290
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:42,319
uh but the but he was yes he was much
 

4291
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,510
uh but the but he was yes he was much
more impressed with

4292
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,520
more impressed with
 

4293
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,709
more impressed with
uh alphago zero

4294
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
uh alphago zero
 

4295
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,510
uh alphago zero
which is didn't didn't get a kind of a

4296
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520
which is didn't didn't get a kind of a
 

4297

trained games yes just was purely

4300
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560
trained games yes just was purely
 

4301
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,110
trained games yes just was purely
self-play

4302
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:53,120
self-play
 

4303
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,229
self-play
though the first one alpha go was also a

4304
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:56,239
though the first one alpha go was also a
 

4305
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:57,829
though the first one alpha go was also a
tremendous amount of self-play

4306
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:57,839
tremendous amount of self-play
 

4307
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,669
tremendous amount of self-play
right they started off they kick-started

4308
01:08:59,669 --> 01:08:59,679
right they started off they kick-started
 

4309
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,510
right they started off they kick-started
the the action network that was making

4310
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:01,520
the the action network that was making
 

4311
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,390
the the action network that was making
decisions

4312
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,400
decisions
 

4313
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,829
decisions
but then they trained it for a really

4314
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:03,839
but then they trained it for a really
 

4315
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,749
but then they trained it for a really
long time using more traditional

4316
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:05,759
long time using more traditional
 

4317
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,510
long time using more traditional
temporal difference methods

4318
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
temporal difference methods
 

4319
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,149
temporal difference methods
um so so as a result i didn't it didn't

4320
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
um so so as a result i didn't it didn't
 

4321
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:10,630
um so so as a result i didn't it didn't
seem

4322
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
seem
 

4323
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,349
seem
that different to me like it seems like

4324
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:13,359
that different to me like it seems like
 

4325
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:13,749
that different to me like it seems like
yeah

4326
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:13,759
yeah
 

4327
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,709
yeah
why wouldn't that work like once once it

4328
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
why wouldn't that work like once once it
 

4329
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,590
why wouldn't that work like once once it
works it works so

4330
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
works it works so
 

4331
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,349
works it works so
but he he found that that removal of

4332
01:09:21,349 --> 01:09:21,359
but he he found that that removal of
 

4333
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,030
but he he found that that removal of
that extra information to be

4334
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,040
that extra information to be
 

4335
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,870
that extra information to be
breathtaking like that that's a game

4336
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
breathtaking like that that's a game
 

4337
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,789
breathtaking like that that's a game
changer to me the first thing was more

4338
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:26,799
changer to me the first thing was more
 

4339
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:27,669
changer to me the first thing was more
of a game changer

4340
01:09:27,669 --> 01:09:27,679
of a game changer
 

4341
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,590
of a game changer
but the open question i mean i guess

4342
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:29,600
but the open question i mean i guess
 

4343
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,110
but the open question i mean i guess
that's the assumption

4344
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,120
that's the assumption
 

4345
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,669
that's the assumption
is the expert games might contain with

4346
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:33,679
is the expert games might contain with
 

4347
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:34,229
is the expert games might contain with
them

4348
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:34,239
them
 

4349
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:37,590
them
within them a

4350
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:37,600
within them a
 

4351
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,269
within them a
humongous amount of information but we

4352
01:09:39,269 --> 01:09:39,279
humongous amount of information but we
 

4353
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,789
humongous amount of information but we
know that it went beyond that

4354
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:40,799
know that it went beyond that
 

4355
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,709
know that it went beyond that
right we know that it somehow got away

4356
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
right we know that it somehow got away
 

4357
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,070
right we know that it somehow got away
from that information because it was

4358
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:44,080
from that information because it was
 

4359
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,669
from that information because it was
learning strategies i don't think it

4360
01:09:45,669 --> 01:09:45,679
learning strategies i don't think it
 

4361
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,550
learning strategies i don't think it
i don't think alphago is just better at

4362
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:48,560
i don't think alphago is just better at
 

4363
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,630
i don't think alphago is just better at
implementing human strategies i think it

4364
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
implementing human strategies i think it
 

4365
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,390
implementing human strategies i think it
actually developed its own strategies

4366
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
actually developed its own strategies
 

4367
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:52,870
actually developed its own strategies
that were

4368
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
that were
 

4369
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,030
that were
that was more effective and so from that

4370
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:55,040
that was more effective and so from that
 

4371
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,070
that was more effective and so from that
perspective

4372
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:56,080
perspective
 

4373
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,350
perspective
okay well so it made at least one

4374
01:09:59,350 --> 01:09:59,360
okay well so it made at least one
 

4375
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,270
okay well so it made at least one
quantum leap in terms of strategic

4376
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
quantum leap in terms of strategic
 

4377
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,390
quantum leap in terms of strategic
knowledge

4378
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:02,400
knowledge
 

4379
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,110
knowledge
okay so now maybe it makes three like

4380
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,120
okay so now maybe it makes three like
 

4381
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,950
okay so now maybe it makes three like
okay but that first one is the doozy

4382
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
okay but that first one is the doozy
 

4383
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,430
okay but that first one is the doozy
right

4384
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,440
right
 

4385
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,550
right
getting it to to to work reliably and

4386
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,560
getting it to to to work reliably and
 

4387
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,470
getting it to to to work reliably and
and for the networks to to hold on to

4388
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:12,480
and for the networks to to hold on to
 

4389
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,790
and for the networks to to hold on to
the value well enough like that was

4390
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:14,800
the value well enough like that was
 

4391
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,870
the value well enough like that was
that was a big step well isn't maybe you

4392
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
that was a big step well isn't maybe you
 

4393
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,470
that was a big step well isn't maybe you
could speak to this on the reinforcement

4394
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
could speak to this on the reinforcement
 

4395
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,550
could speak to this on the reinforcement
learning front so the

4396
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:20,560
learning front so the
 

4397
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,470
learning front so the
starting from scratch and learning to do

4398
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
starting from scratch and learning to do
 

4399
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,510
starting from scratch and learning to do
something like the first like

4400
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:27,520
something like the first like
 

4401
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,709
something like the first like
like random behavior to like

4402
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:30,719
like random behavior to like
 

4403
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,830
like random behavior to like
crappy behavior to like somewhat okay

4404
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:33,840
crappy behavior to like somewhat okay
 

4405
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,709

behavior

4406
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:34,719
behavior
 

4407
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,310
behavior
it's not obvious to me that that's not

4408
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:38,320
it's not obvious to me that that's not
 

4409
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,830
it's not obvious to me that that's not
like impossible to take those steps like

4410
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:41,840
like impossible to take those steps like
 

4411
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,669
like impossible to take those steps like
if you just think about the intuition

4412
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:43,679
if you just think about the intuition
 

4413
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,430
if you just think about the intuition
like how the heck does

4414
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:45,440
like how the heck does
 

4415
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,950
like how the heck does
random behavior become somewhat

4416
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:48,960
random behavior become somewhat
 

4417
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,990
random behavior become somewhat
basic intelligent behavior not not human

4418
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:52,000
basic intelligent behavior not not human

4421
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,229
level not super human level
but just basic but you're saying to you

4422
01:10:56,229 --> 01:10:56,239
but just basic but you're saying to you
 

4423
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,229
but just basic but you're saying to you
kind of the intuition is like if

4424
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:58,239
kind of the intuition is like if
 

4425
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:59,990
kind of the intuition is like if
if you can go from human to superhuman

4426
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,000
if you can go from human to superhuman
 

4427
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,510
if you can go from human to superhuman
level intelligence on the

4428
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
level intelligence on the
 

4429
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,189
level intelligence on the
uh on this particular task of game

4430
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:03,199
uh on this particular task of game
 

4431
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,950
uh on this particular task of game
playing then

4432
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
playing then
 

4433
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,350
playing then
so you're good at taking leaps so you

4434
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:07,360
so you're good at taking leaps so you
 

4435
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,390
so you're good at taking leaps so you
can take many of them

4436
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:08,400
can take many of them
 

4437
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,510
can take many of them
that the system i believe that the

4438
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:09,520
that the system i believe that the
 

4439
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,990
that the system i believe that the
system can take that kind of leap

4440
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:12,000
system can take that kind of leap
 

4441
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,070
system can take that kind of leap
yeah no and also i think that that

4442
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,080
yeah no and also i think that that
 

4443
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,910
yeah no and also i think that that
beginner knowledge

4444

beginner knowledge
 

4445
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,390
beginner knowledge
in go like you can start to get a feel

4446
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:18,400
in go like you can start to get a feel
 

4447
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,669
in go like you can start to get a feel
really quickly

4448
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:19,679
really quickly
 

4449
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,110
really quickly
for the idea that um you know certain

4450
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:23,120
for the idea that um you know certain
 

4451
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,550
for the idea that um you know certain
parts of the being in certain parts of

4452
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560
parts of the being in certain parts of
 

4453
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,750
parts of the being in certain parts of
the board seems to be

4454
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:25,760
the board seems to be
 

4455
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,229
the board seems to be
more associated with winning right

4456
01:11:28,229 --> 01:11:28,239
more associated with winning right
 

4457
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,350
more associated with winning right
because it's not

4458
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:29,360
because it's not
 

4459
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,430
because it's not
it's not stumbling upon the concept of

4460
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:31,440
it's not stumbling upon the concept of
 

4461
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,669
it's not stumbling upon the concept of
winning it's told that it wins

4462
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:33,679
winning it's told that it wins
 

4463
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:35,350
winning it's told that it wins
or that it loses well it's self-play so

4464
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:35,360
or that it loses well it's self-play so
 

4465
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,510
or that it loses well it's self-play so
it both wins and loses it's told

4466
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
it both wins and loses it's told
 

4467
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,870
it both wins and loses it's told
which which side won and the information

4468
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:40,880
which which side won and the information
 

4469
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,390
which which side won and the information
is kind of there to start

4470
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:42,400
is kind of there to start
 

4471
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,470
is kind of there to start
percolating around to make a difference

4472
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:44,480
percolating around to make a difference
 

4473
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,430
percolating around to make a difference
as to

4474
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,440
as to
 

4475
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,590
as to
um well these things have a better

4476
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:47,600
um well these things have a better
 

4477
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,870
um well these things have a better
chance of helping you win and these

4478
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880
chance of helping you win and these
 

4479
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,149
chance of helping you win and these
things have a worse chance of helping

4480
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
things have a worse chance of helping
 

4481
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,030
things have a worse chance of helping
you win and so

4482
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040
you win and so
 

4483
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,709
you win and so
you know it can get to basic play i

4484
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:52,719
you know it can get to basic play i
 

4485
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,149
you know it can get to basic play i
think pretty quickly

4486
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:54,159
think pretty quickly
 

4487
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,310
think pretty quickly
then once it has basic play well now

4488
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
then once it has basic play well now
 

4489
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,550
then once it has basic play well now
it's kind of forced to do some search to

4490
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
it's kind of forced to do some search to
 

4491
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,229
it's kind of forced to do some search to
actually experiment with okay well what

4492
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:00,239
actually experiment with okay well what
 

4493
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:01,350
actually experiment with okay well what
gets me that next

4494
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
gets me that next
 

4495
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,390
gets me that next
increment of of improvement how far do

01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840
you think
 

4499
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,510
you think
okay this is where you kind of bring up

4500
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:07,520
okay this is where you kind of bring up

4503
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,470
the the elon musk and the sam harris is
right

4504
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:10,480
right
 

4505
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,790
right
how far is your intuition about these

4506
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:12,800
how far is your intuition about these
 

4507
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,550
how far is your intuition about these

01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:31,520
for alpha zero for example in the game
 

4525
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,350
for alpha zero for example in the game
of go or chess

4526
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,360
of go or chess
 

4527
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,110
of go or chess
it's it keeps no matter how much the

4528
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:35,120
it's it keeps no matter how much the
 

4529
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,470
it's it keeps no matter how much the
compute they throw at it it keeps

4530
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,480
compute they throw at it it keeps
 

4531
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,510

improving
 

4533
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,550
improving
so it's possible it's very possible that

4534
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
so it's possible it's very possible that
 

4535
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,430
so it's possible it's very possible that
you

4536
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,440
you
 

4537
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,110
you
if you throw you know some like 10x

4538
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
if you throw you know some like 10x
 

4539
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,270
if you throw you know some like 10x
compute that it will improve by 5x or

4540
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:47,280
compute that it will improve by 5x or
 

4541
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,630
compute that it will improve by 5x or
something like that

4542
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:48,640
something like that
 

4543
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,470
something like that
and when stated calmly it's so like

4544
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:52,480
and when stated calmly it's so like
 

4545
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,669
and when stated calmly it's so like
oh yeah i guess so but like and then you

4546
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:55,679
oh yeah i guess so but like and then you
 

4547
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:56,950
oh yeah i guess so but like and then you
think like well

4548
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:56,960
think like well
 

4549
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,990

uh but notice it's not getting better at

4564
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
uh but notice it's not getting better at
 

4565
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,910
uh but notice it's not getting better at
other things it's getting better at

4566
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:15,920
other things it's getting better at
 

4567
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,550
other things it's getting better at
go yeah and i think it's a that's a big

4568
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:18,560
go yeah and i think it's a that's a big
 

4569
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,350
go yeah and i think it's a that's a big
leap to say

4570
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:19,360
leap to say
 

4571
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,990
leap to say
okay well therefore it's better at other

4572
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,000
okay well therefore it's better at other
 

4573
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,630
okay well therefore it's better at other
things

4574
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:22,640
things
 

4575
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,790
things
well i mean the the question is how much

4576
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:24,800
well i mean the the question is how much
 

4577
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,390
well i mean the the question is how much
of the game of life

4578
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:26,400
of the game of life
 

4579
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,550
of the game of life
can be turned into right so that's of

4580
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
can be turned into right so that's of
 

4581
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,990
can be turned into right so that's of
that i think is a really good question

4582
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
that i think is a really good question
 

4583
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,350
that i think is a really good question
and i think that we don't i don't think

4584
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:31,360
and i think that we don't i don't think
 

4585
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,390
and i think that we don't i don't think
we as a

i don't know community really know that

4588
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:34,000
i don't know community really know that
 

4589
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,510
i don't know community really know that
the answer to this but

4590
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
the answer to this but
 

4591
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,709
the answer to this but
um so okay so so i went i went to a talk

4592
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:38,719
um so okay so so i went i went to a talk
 

4593

uh by some experts on
 

4595
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,790
uh by some experts on
computer chess so in particular computer

01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:53,920
things on the planet um and then
 

4607
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,990

computers like edge to head of the best

4608

computers like edge to head of the best
 

4609
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,510
computers like edge to head of the best
person and they've been ahead ever since

it's not like people have

4612
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:58,880
it's not like people have
 

4613
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,790
it's not like people have
have overtaken computers but um

4614
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:02,800
have overtaken computers but um
 

4615
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,110
have overtaken computers but um
but computers and people together have

4616
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:05,120
but computers and people together have
 

4617
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,470
but computers and people together have
overtaken computers

4618
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:06,480
overtaken computers
 

4619
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,030
overtaken computers
right so at least last time i checked i

4620
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,040
right so at least last time i checked i
 

4621
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,390
right so at least last time i checked i
don't know what the very latest is but

4622
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:10,400
don't know what the very latest is but
 

4623
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,510
don't know what the very latest is but
last time i checked

4624
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
last time i checked
 

4625
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,229
last time i checked
that there were teams of people who

4626
01:14:14,229 --> 01:14:14,239
that there were teams of people who
 

4627
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,149
that there were teams of people who
could work with computer programs to

4628
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:16,159
could work with computer programs to
 

4629
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:17,830
could work with computer programs to
defeat the best computer programs

4630
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:17,840
defeat the best computer programs
 

4631
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,590
defeat the best computer programs
in the game of go in the game of chess

4633
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,270

in the game of chess right and so

4634
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:21,280
in the game of chess right and so
 

4635
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,750
in the game of chess right and so

4641
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:31,590

01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:33,360
possible scores and the
 

4645
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,149
possible scores and the
you you increment and score basically if

4646
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:36,159
you you increment and score basically if
 

4647
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,550
you you increment and score basically if
you can

4650
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
beat another player of that lower score
 

4651
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,430
beat another player of that lower score
62 percent of the time or something like

if you can somewhat consistently beat

4656
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:45,520
if you can somewhat consistently beat
 

4657
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,870
if you can somewhat consistently beat
someone then you are

4658
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:46,880
someone then you are
 

4659
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,189
someone then you are
of a higher score than that person and

4660
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:49,199
of a higher score than that person and
 

4661
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:50,709
of a higher score than that person and
there's a question as to how many times

4662
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:50,719
there's a question as to how many times
 

4663
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,310
there's a question as to how many times
can you do that in chess

4664
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,320
can you do that in chess
 

4665
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,750
can you do that in chess
right and so we know that there's a

4666
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:53,760
right and so we know that there's a
 

4667
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,669
right and so we know that there's a
range of human ability levels that

4668
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:55,679
range of human ability levels that
 

4669
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,910
range of human ability levels that
cap out with the best playing humans and

4670
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:57,920
cap out with the best playing humans and
 

4671
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,149
cap out with the best playing humans and
the computers went a step beyond that

4672
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
the computers went a step beyond that
 

4673
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,550
the computers went a step beyond that
and computers and people together have

4674
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
and computers and people together have
 

4675
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,110
and computers and people together have
not gone i think a full step beyond that

4676
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:05,120
not gone i think a full step beyond that
 

4677
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,590
not gone i think a full step beyond that
it feels the estimates that they have is

4678
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
it feels the estimates that they have is
 

4679
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,030
it feels the estimates that they have is
that it's starting to asymptote

4680
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:09,040
that it's starting to asymptote
 

4681
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,870
that it's starting to asymptote
that we've reached kind of the maximum

4682
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
that we've reached kind of the maximum
 

4683
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,550
that we've reached kind of the maximum
the best possible

4684
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
the best possible
 

4685
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,870
the best possible
chess playing and so that means that

4686
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:14,880
chess playing and so that means that
 

4687
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,310
chess playing and so that means that
there's kind of a

4688
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
there's kind of a
 

4689
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,790
there's kind of a
finite strategic depth right at some

4690
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:18,800
finite strategic depth right at some
 

4691
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,550
finite strategic depth right at some
point you just can't get any better at

4692
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:20,560
point you just can't get any better at
 

4693
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,590
point you just can't get any better at
this game

4694
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
this game
 

4695
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,470
this game
yeah i mean i i don't uh so i like to

4696
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,480
yeah i mean i i don't uh so i like to
 

4697
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,110
yeah i mean i i don't uh so i like to
check that

4698
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
check that
 

4699
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,870
check that
uh i think it's interesting because if

4700
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
uh i think it's interesting because if
 

4701
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,270
uh i think it's interesting because if
you have

4702
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:29,280
you have
 

4703
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,030
you have
somebody like uh magnus carlsen who's

4704
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
somebody like uh magnus carlsen who's
 

4705
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,070
somebody like uh magnus carlsen who's
using these chess programs to train his

4706
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
using these chess programs to train his
 

4707
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,350
using these chess programs to train his
mind like to learn

4708
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,360
mind like to learn
 

4709
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,950
mind like to learn
to become a better chess player yeah and

4710
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:38,960
to become a better chess player yeah and
 

4711
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,950
to become a better chess player yeah and
so like that's a very

4712
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:40,960
so like that's a very
 

4713
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,790
so like that's a very
interesting thing because we're not

4714
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:42,800
interesting thing because we're not
 

4715
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,110
interesting thing because we're not
static creatures we're learning together

4716
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
static creatures we're learning together
 

4717
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,870
static creatures we're learning together
i mean just like we're talking about

4718
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
i mean just like we're talking about
 

4719
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,709
i mean just like we're talking about
social networks those algorithms are

4720
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
social networks those algorithms are
 

4721
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,310
social networks those algorithms are
teaching us just like we're teaching

4722
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:50,320
teaching us just like we're teaching
 

4723
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,350
teaching us just like we're teaching
those algorithms

4724
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
those algorithms
 

4725
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,510
those algorithms
so that's a fascinating thing but i

4726
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
so that's a fascinating thing but i
 

4727
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,390
so that's a fascinating thing but i
think

4728
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400
think
 

4729
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,590
think
the best just playing programs are now

4730
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:57,600
the best just playing programs are now
 

4731
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,950
the best just playing programs are now
better than the pairs like they have

4732
01:15:58,950 --> 01:15:58,960
better than the pairs like they have
 

4733
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,229
better than the pairs like they have
competition between

4734
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:00,239
competition between
 

4735
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:03,110
competition between
paris but the it's still even if they

4736
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,120
paris but the it's still even if they
 

4737
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:03,510
paris but the it's still even if they
weren't

4738
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:03,520
weren't
 

4739
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,189
weren't
it's an interesting question where's the

4740
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:05,199
it's an interesting question where's the
 

4741
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,590
it's an interesting question where's the
ceiling so the the david the ominous

4742
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:07,600
ceiling so the the david the ominous
 

4743
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,550
ceiling so the the david the ominous
david silver

4744
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:08,560
david silver
 

4745
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,630
david silver
kind of statement is like we have not

4746
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:10,640
kind of statement is like we have not
 

4747
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,070
kind of statement is like we have not
found the ceiling

4748
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:12,080
found the ceiling
 

4749
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,390
found the ceiling
right but so the question is okay so i

4750
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
right but so the question is okay so i
 

4751
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,350
right but so the question is okay so i
don't i don't know

4752
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
don't i don't know
 

4753
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,630
don't i don't know
his analysis on that my from talking to

4754
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:18,640
his analysis on that my from talking to
 

4755
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,070
his analysis on that my from talking to
go experts the depth the strategic depth

4756
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,080
go experts the depth the strategic depth
 

4757
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,270
go experts the depth the strategic depth
of go seems to be

4758
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,280
of go seems to be
 

4759
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,030
of go seems to be
substantially greater than that of chess

4760
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,040
substantially greater than that of chess
 

4761
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,870
substantially greater than that of chess
that there's more kind of

4762
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:26,880
that there's more kind of
 

4763
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,470
that there's more kind of
steps of improvement that you can make

4764
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,480
steps of improvement that you can make
 

4765
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,070
steps of improvement that you can make
get getting better and better and better

4766
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,080
get getting better and better and better
 

4767
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,510
get getting better and better and better
but there's no reason to think that it's

4768
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:31,520
but there's no reason to think that it's
 

4769
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,270
but there's no reason to think that it's
infinite yeah

4770
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:33,280
infinite yeah
 

4771
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,430
infinite yeah
and so it could be that it's that the

4772
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
and so it could be that it's that the
 

4773
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,510
and so it could be that it's that the
what david is seeing is a kind of

4774
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:37,520
what david is seeing is a kind of
 

4775
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,110
what david is seeing is a kind of
asymptoting that you can keep getting

4776
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
asymptoting that you can keep getting
 

4777
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:39,590
asymptoting that you can keep getting
better

4778
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:39,600
better
 

4779
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,590
better
but with diminishing returns and at some

4780
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:41,600
but with diminishing returns and at some
 

4781
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,870
but with diminishing returns and at some
point you hit

4782
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:42,880
point you hit
 

4783
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,350
point you hit
optimal play like in theory all these

4784
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,360
optimal play like in theory all these
 

4785
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,229
optimal play like in theory all these
finite games

4786
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
finite games
 

4787
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,709
finite games
they're finite they have an optimal

4788
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
they're finite they have an optimal
 

4789
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,229
they're finite they have an optimal
strategy there's a strategy that is the

4790
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:50,239
strategy there's a strategy that is the
 

4791
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,830
strategy there's a strategy that is the
minimax optimal strategy

4792
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:51,840
minimax optimal strategy
 

4793
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,470
minimax optimal strategy
and so at that point you can't get any

4794
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:54,480
and so at that point you can't get any
 

4795
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,310
and so at that point you can't get any
better you can't beat that that strategy

4796
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
better you can't beat that that strategy
 

4797
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,149
better you can't beat that that strategy
now that strategy may be

4798
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:58,159
now that strategy may be
 

4799
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,310
now that strategy may be
from an information processing

4800
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
from an information processing
 

4801
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,510
from an information processing
perspective

4802
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,520
perspective
 

4803
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,630
perspective
intractable right the you need

4804
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:04,640
intractable right the you need
 

4805
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,310
intractable right the you need
the the all the situations are

4806
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:06,320
the the all the situations are
 

4807
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,510
the the all the situations are
sufficiently different that you can't

4808
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520
sufficiently different that you can't
 

4809
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,110
sufficiently different that you can't
compress it at all it's this

4810
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
compress it at all it's this
 

4811
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,149
compress it at all it's this
giant mess of hard-coded rules

4812
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
giant mess of hard-coded rules
 

4813
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,110
giant mess of hard-coded rules
and we can never achieve that but but

4814
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,120
and we can never achieve that but but
 

4815
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,110
and we can never achieve that but but
that still puts a cap on how many levels

4816
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:17,120
that still puts a cap on how many levels
 

4817
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,950
that still puts a cap on how many levels
of improvement that we can actually make

4818
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:18,960
of improvement that we can actually make
 

4819
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,910
of improvement that we can actually make
but the the thing about self-play is if

4820
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
but the the thing about self-play is if
 

4821
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,149
but the the thing about self-play is if
you

4822
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:22,159
you
 

4823
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:23,910
you
if you put it although i don't like

4824
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:23,920
if you put it although i don't like
 

4825
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,310
if you put it although i don't like
doing that in the broader category of

4826
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
doing that in the broader category of
 

4827
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,870
doing that in the broader category of
self-supervised learning is that it

4828
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:28,880
self-supervised learning is that it
 

4829
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,990
self-supervised learning is that it
doesn't require

4830
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,000
doesn't require
 

4831
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,310
doesn't require
too much or any human human labeling

4832
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:32,320
too much or any human human labeling
 

4833
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,830
too much or any human human labeling
yeah yeah human label or

4834
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
yeah yeah human label or
 

4835
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,310
yeah yeah human label or
just human effort the human involvement

4836
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:36,320
just human effort the human involvement
 

4837
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,830
just human effort the human involvement
past a certain point

4838
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:37,840
past a certain point
 

4839
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,709
past a certain point
and the same thing you could argue is

4840
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:40,719
and the same thing you could argue is
 

4841
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:41,590
and the same thing you could argue is
true for

4842
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:41,600
true for
 

4843
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,750
true for
the recent breakthroughs in natural

4847
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,750
language processing with language models
oh this is how you get to gpt3

4848
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:47,760
oh this is how you get to gpt3
 

4849
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,070
oh this is how you get to gpt3
yeah see how that did the uh that was a

4850
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,080
yeah see how that did the uh that was a
 

4851
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,910
yeah see how that did the uh that was a
good good transition yeah yeah

4852
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:51,920
good good transition yeah yeah
 

4853
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,630
good good transition yeah yeah
i practiced that for days uh leading up

4854
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:54,640
i practiced that for days uh leading up
 

4855
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,669
i practiced that for days uh leading up
to this guy now

4856
01:17:55,669 --> 01:17:55,679
to this guy now
 

4857
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,470
to this guy now
uh but like that's one of the questions

4858
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:58,480
uh but like that's one of the questions
 

4859
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,669
uh but like that's one of the questions
is

4860
01:17:59,669 --> 01:17:59,679
is
 

4861
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,709
is
can we find ways to formulate problems

4862
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:02,719
can we find ways to formulate problems
 

4863
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,149
can we find ways to formulate problems
in this world that are important to us

4864
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:04,159
in this world that are important to us
 

4865
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:05,430
in this world that are important to us
humans

4866
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:05,440
humans
 

4867
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,110
humans
like more important than the game of

4868
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,120
like more important than the game of
 

4869
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,630
like more important than the game of
chess

4870
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:08,640
chess
 

4871
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,590

that uh to which self-supervised kinds

4872
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:11,600
that uh to which self-supervised kinds
 

4873
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,590
that uh to which self-supervised kinds
of approaches could be applied whether

4874
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:13,600
of approaches could be applied whether
 

4875
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,870
of approaches could be applied whether
it's self-play

4876
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:14,880
it's self-play
 

4877
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,550
it's self-play
for example for like maybe you could

4878
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:16,560
for example for like maybe you could
 

4879
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,189
for example for like maybe you could
think of like autonomous vehicles

4880
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:19,199
think of like autonomous vehicles
 

4881
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,229
think of like autonomous vehicles
in simulation that kind of stuff

so what's your intuition like trying to

4912
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
so what's your intuition like trying to
 

4913
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,590
so what's your intuition like trying to
stitch all of it together

4914
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,600
stitch all of it together
 

4915
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,110
stitch all of it together

neural networks in the context of
 

4923
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,149
neural networks in the context of
language models is there some intuition

4924

language models is there some intuition
 

4925
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,750
language models is there some intuition
in there that might be

4926
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:15,760
in there that might be
 

4927
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,070
in there that might be
useful to think about yeah yeah yeah so

4928
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:18,080
useful to think about yeah yeah yeah so
 

4929
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:18,790
useful to think about yeah yeah yeah so
so

and you've seen the kind of text that
 

4947
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,750
and you've seen the kind of text that
they spit out

4948
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:35,760
they spit out
 

4949
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,110
they spit out
and you compare it to what's happening

4950
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,120
and you compare it to what's happening
 

4951
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,790

it's really good at a bunch of things
 

4967
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,870
it's really good at a bunch of things
and it does seem to understand a lot of

you can answer many questions with that
 

4977
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,110
you can answer many questions with that
but it doesn't make it a good

01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,229
but it doesn't make it a good
conversationalist

4980
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
conversationalist
 

4981
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,590
conversationalist
right and doesn't make it a good

4982
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
right and doesn't make it a good
 

4983
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,350
right and doesn't make it a good
storyteller it just makes it good at

4984
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
storyteller it just makes it good at
 

4985
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,189
storyteller it just makes it good at
imitating of things it has seen

4986
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:11,199
imitating of things it has seen
 

4987
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,990
imitating of things it has seen
in the past the exact same thing could

4988
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:14,000
in the past the exact same thing could
 

4989
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,790
in the past the exact same thing could
be said by

4990
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:14,800
be said by
 

4991
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,870
be said by
people who voting for donald trump about

4992
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:16,880
people who voting for donald trump about
 

4993
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,990
people who voting for donald trump about
joe biden supporters

4994
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
joe biden supporters
 

4995
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,510
joe biden supporters
and people voting for joe biden about

4996
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:19,520
and people voting for joe biden about
 

4997
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,110
and people voting for joe biden about
donald trump supporters

4998
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:21,120
donald trump supporters
 

4999
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,270
donald trump supporters
is uh you know that they're not

5000
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
is uh you know that they're not
 

5001
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,790
is uh you know that they're not
intelligent they're just following

5002
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:24,800
intelligent they're just following
 

5003
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,149
intelligent they're just following
the yeah they're following things

5004
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
the yeah they're following things
 

5005
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,070
the yeah they're following things
they've seen in the past and uh

5006
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,080
they've seen in the past and uh
 

5007
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,229
they've seen in the past and uh
so it's very it doesn't take long to

5008
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
so it's very it doesn't take long to
 

5009
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,189
so it's very it doesn't take long to
find the flaws

5010
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:31,199
find the flaws
 

5011
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:34,550
find the flaws
in their uh in their like

5012
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:34,560
in their uh in their like
 

5013
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,310
in their uh in their like
natural language generation abilities

5014
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:36,320
natural language generation abilities
 

5015
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,990
natural language generation abilities
yes yeah so we're being very

5016
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
yes yeah so we're being very
 

5017
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,189
yes yeah so we're being very
that's interesting critical of ass

5018
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
that's interesting critical of ass
 

5019
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,350
that's interesting critical of ass
right so so i've had a similar thought

5020
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:43,360
right so so i've had a similar thought
 

5021
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,510
right so so i've had a similar thought
which was that

5022
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,520
which was that
 

5023
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,629
which was that
the stories that gpt-3 spits out

5024
01:20:48,629 --> 01:20:48,639
the stories that gpt-3 spits out
 

5025
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:52,390
the stories that gpt-3 spits out
are amazing and very human-like

5026
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:52,400
are amazing and very human-like
 

5027
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,430
are amazing and very human-like
and it doesn't mean that computers are

5028
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
and it doesn't mean that computers are
 

5029
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,669
and it doesn't mean that computers are
smarter than we realize necessarily it

5030
01:20:57,669 --> 01:20:57,679
smarter than we realize necessarily it
 

5031
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,430
smarter than we realize necessarily it
partly means that people are dumber than

5032
01:20:59,430 --> 01:20:59,440
partly means that people are dumber than
 

5033
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,149
partly means that people are dumber than
we realize

5034
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:00,159
we realize
 

5035
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:03,270
we realize
or that much of what we do day to day

5036
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:03,280
or that much of what we do day to day
 

5037
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,510
or that much of what we do day to day
is not that deep like we're just we're

5038
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:05,520
is not that deep like we're just we're
 

5039
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,430
is not that deep like we're just we're
just kind of going with the flow we're

5040
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:07,440
just kind of going with the flow we're
 

5041
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:07,910
just kind of going with the flow we're
saying

5042
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:07,920
saying
 

5043
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,430
saying
whatever feels like the natural thing to

5044
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:09,440
whatever feels like the natural thing to
 

5045
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,270
whatever feels like the natural thing to
say next not a lot of it

5046
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:11,280
say next not a lot of it
 

5047
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,189
say next not a lot of it
is is is creative or meaningful or or

5048
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
is is is creative or meaningful or or
 

5049
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:18,070
is is is creative or meaningful or or
intentional but enough is that we

5050
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,080
intentional but enough is that we
 

5051
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,110
intentional but enough is that we
actually get

5052
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,120
actually get
 

5053
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,110
actually get
we get by right we we do come up with

5054
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,120
we get by right we we do come up with
 

5055
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,709
we get by right we we do come up with
new ideas sometimes and we do

5056
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:22,719
new ideas sometimes and we do
 

5057
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,149
new ideas sometimes and we do
manage to talk each other into things

5058
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:24,159
manage to talk each other into things
 

5059
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,149
manage to talk each other into things
sometimes and we do sometimes

5060
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
sometimes and we do sometimes
 

5061
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,510
sometimes and we do sometimes
vote for reasonable people sometimes

5062
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
vote for reasonable people sometimes
 

5063
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,910
vote for reasonable people sometimes
but um but it's really hard to see in

5064
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:31,920
but um but it's really hard to see in
 

5065
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,510
but um but it's really hard to see in
the statistics because so much of what

5066
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,520
the statistics because so much of what
 

5067
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,830
the statistics because so much of what
we're saying is kind of rote

5068
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
we're saying is kind of rote
 

5069
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,750
we're saying is kind of rote
and so our metrics that we use to

5070
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:37,760
and so our metrics that we use to
 

5071
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,390
and so our metrics that we use to
measure how these systems are doing

5072
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,400
measure how these systems are doing
 

5073
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,270
measure how these systems are doing
don't reveal that because it's it's it's

5074
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:43,280
don't reveal that because it's it's it's
 

5075
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,629
don't reveal that because it's it's it's
in the interest this is

5076
01:21:44,629 --> 01:21:44,639
in the interest this is
 

5077
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,430
in the interest this is
that that is very hard to detect but is

5078
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:47,440
that that is very hard to detect but is
 

5079
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:47,990
that that is very hard to detect but is
your

5080
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,000
your
 

5081
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,430
your
do you have an intuition that with these

5082
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,440
do you have an intuition that with these
 

5083
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,590
do you have an intuition that with these
language models

5084
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
language models
 

5085
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,830
language models
if they grow in size it's already

5086
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:53,840
if they grow in size it's already
 

5087
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,149
if they grow in size it's already
surprising that when you go from gpt2 to

5088
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,159
surprising that when you go from gpt2 to
 

5089
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,350
surprising that when you go from gpt2 to
gpg3

5090
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,360
gpg3
 

5091
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,430
gpg3
that there is a noticeable improvement

5092
01:21:59,430 --> 01:21:59,440
that there is a noticeable improvement
 

5093
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,350
that there is a noticeable improvement
so the question now goes back to the

5094
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:01,360
so the question now goes back to the
 

5095
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,350
so the question now goes back to the
ominous david silver and the ceiling

5096
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:03,360
ominous david silver and the ceiling
 

5097
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,870
ominous david silver and the ceiling
right so maybe there's just no ceiling

5098
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:04,880
right so maybe there's just no ceiling
 

5099
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,550
right so maybe there's just no ceiling
we just need more compute now

5100
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:08,560

 

5101
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,870

i mean okay so now i'm speculating yes

5102
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:10,880
i mean okay so now i'm speculating yes
 

5103
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,229
i mean okay so now i'm speculating yes
as opposed to before when i was

5104
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:12,239
as opposed to before when i was
 

5105
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:15,270
as opposed to before when i was
completely on firm yeah all right um

5106
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:15,280
completely on firm yeah all right um
 

5107
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,950
completely on firm yeah all right um
i don't believe that you can get

5108
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:16,960
i don't believe that you can get
 

5109
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,950
i don't believe that you can get
something that really

5110
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:18,960
something that really
 

5111
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,270
something that really
can do language and use language as a

5112
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:21,280
can do language and use language as a
 

5113
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,229
can do language and use language as a
thing that doesn't interact with people

5114
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:24,239
thing that doesn't interact with people
 

5115
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,990
thing that doesn't interact with people
like i think that it's not enough to

5116
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,000
like i think that it's not enough to
 

5117
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,590
like i think that it's not enough to
just take everything that we've said

5118
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:27,600
just take everything that we've said
 

5119
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,110
just take everything that we've said
written down and just say

5120
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:29,120
written down and just say
 

5121
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,470
written down and just say
that's enough you can just learn from

5122
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:30,480
that's enough you can just learn from
 

5123
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,229
that's enough you can just learn from
that and you can be intelligent i think

5124
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:32,239
that and you can be intelligent i think
 

5125
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,430
that and you can be intelligent i think
you really need to

5126
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:33,440
you really need to
 

5127
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,750
you really need to
be pushed back at i think that

5128
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
be pushed back at i think that
 

5129
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,709
be pushed back at i think that
conversations

5130
01:22:36,709 --> 01:22:36,719
conversations
 

5131
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,030
conversations
even people who are pretty smart maybe

5132
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:39,040
even people who are pretty smart maybe
 

5133
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,229
even people who are pretty smart maybe
the smartest thing that we know

5134
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
the smartest thing that we know
 

5135
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,750
the smartest thing that we know
not maybe not the smartest thing we can

5136
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:41,760
not maybe not the smartest thing we can
 

5137
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,669
not maybe not the smartest thing we can
imagine but we get

that there's
 

5149
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,310
that there's
something in that interaction that would

oh i'll just write your story and then
 

5155
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,950
oh i'll just write your story and then
you can read it later and i think

you can read it later and i think

01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,629
you can read it later and i think
i think because these systems are just

you know shut down like we like we have

they have to have an argument with us
 

5179
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,910
they have to have an argument with us
and lose a couple times before they

oh okay wait there's some nuance here

5184
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:21,600
oh okay wait there's some nuance here
 

5185
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,110
oh okay wait there's some nuance here
that actually matters

5186
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:23,120
that actually matters
 

5187
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,229
that actually matters
yeah that's actually subtle sounding but

5188
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:26,239
yeah that's actually subtle sounding but
 

5189
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:29,270
yeah that's actually subtle sounding but
quite profound that the interaction with

5190
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280
quite profound that the interaction with
 

5191
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,430
quite profound that the interaction with
humans is essential

5192
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
humans is essential
 

5193
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,310
humans is essential
and the limitation within that is

5194
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:34,320
and the limitation within that is
 

5195
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,270
and the limitation within that is
profound as well

5196
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,280
profound as well
 

5197
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,229
profound as well
because the time scale like the

5198
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:38,239
because the time scale like the
 

5199
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:39,750
because the time scale like the
bandwidth at which you can really

5200
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,760
bandwidth at which you can really
 

5201
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,430
bandwidth at which you can really
interact with humans is very low

5202
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:43,440
interact with humans is very low
 

5203
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,750
interact with humans is very low
so it's costly so you can't one of the

5204
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:45,760
so it's costly so you can't one of the
 

5205
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,669
so it's costly so you can't one of the
underlying things about self self-plays

5206
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
underlying things about self self-plays
 

5207
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,189
underlying things about self self-plays
it has to do you know a very large

5208
01:23:51,189 --> 01:23:51,199
it has to do you know a very large
 

5209
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,030
it has to do you know a very large
number of interactions

5210
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
number of interactions
 

5211
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,790
number of interactions
and so you can't really deploy

5212
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:54,800
and so you can't really deploy
 

5213
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,550
and so you can't really deploy
reinforcement learning systems

5214
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:56,560
reinforcement learning systems
 

5215
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,310

01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
into the real world to interact like you
 

5217
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,270
into the real world to interact like you
couldn't deploy a language model

01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:01,280
couldn't deploy a language model
 

5219
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,990
couldn't deploy a language model

into the real world to interact with
 

5221
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,830
into the real world to interact with
humans because it would just not get

01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840
humans because it would just not get
 

5223
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,790
humans because it would just not get
enough data

5224
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
enough data
 

5225
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,350
enough data
relative to the cost it takes to

01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,360
relative to the cost it takes to
 

5227
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,750
relative to the cost it takes to
interact like the time of humans is is

01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
interact like the time of humans is is
 

5229
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,629
interact like the time of humans is is
expensive

5230
01:24:12,629 --> 01:24:12,639
expensive
 

5231
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,070
expensive
which is really interesting that's that

01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:14,080
which is really interesting that's that

if there's ways to make algorithms that

if there's ways to make algorithms that
 

5239
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,390
if there's ways to make algorithms that
are more efficient at learning

5240
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:22,400
are more efficient at learning
 

5241
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,910
are more efficient at learning
keep the spirit and reinforcement

5242
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:23,920
keep the spirit and reinforcement
 

5243
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,229
keep the spirit and reinforcement
learning and become more efficient

5244

in some sense this seems to be the goal

i'd love to hear what your

i'd love to hear what your
thoughts are i don't know if you got a

chance to see a
 

5253
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,950
chance to see a
blog post called bitter lesson oh yes

5254
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
blog post called bitter lesson oh yes
 

5255
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,590
blog post called bitter lesson oh yes
but rich sutton that makes an argument

5256
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
but rich sutton that makes an argument
 

5257
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,950
but rich sutton that makes an argument
hopefully i can

5258
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
hopefully i can
 

5259
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,350
hopefully i can
summarize it perhaps perhaps you can

5260
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:43,360
summarize it perhaps perhaps you can
 

5261
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,629
summarize it perhaps perhaps you can
yeah but

5262
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:44,639
yeah but
 

5263
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:46,470
yeah but
okay so i i mean i could try and you can

5264
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:46,480
okay so i i mean i could try and you can
 

5265
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,470
okay so i i mean i could try and you can
correct me which is uh

5266
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
correct me which is uh
 

5267
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,550
correct me which is uh

the biggest improvements in practice are
 

5283
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,550
the biggest improvements in practice are
the very simple

the very simple
 

5285
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,629
the very simple
like dumb algorithms that are able to

like dumb algorithms that are able to

01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,629
like dumb algorithms that are able to
leverage computation

leverage computation
 

5289
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,550
leverage computation
and you just wait for the computation to

and you just wait for the computation to
 

5291
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,110
and you just wait for the computation to
improve like all the academics and so on

01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,590
and sometimes those tricks can be like
big that feel in the moment like big

5302
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600
big that feel in the moment like big
 

5303
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,750
big that feel in the moment like big
spikes and breakthroughs but in reality

5304
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
spikes and breakthroughs but in reality
 

5305
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,550
spikes and breakthroughs but in reality
over the decades it's still the same

5306
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:26,560
over the decades it's still the same
 

5307
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,629
over the decades it's still the same
dumb algorithm that just

5308
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:28,639
dumb algorithm that just
 

5309
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,310
dumb algorithm that just
waits for the compute to get faster and

5310
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:30,320
waits for the compute to get faster and
 

5311
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,750
waits for the compute to get faster and
faster do you find

5312
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:33,760
faster do you find
 

5313
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,229
faster do you find
that to be an interesting argument

5314
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:36,239
that to be an interesting argument
 

5315
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,750
that to be an interesting argument
against the entirety of the field of

5316
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
against the entirety of the field of
 

5317
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,350
against the entirety of the field of
machine learning

5318
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:39,360
machine learning
 

5319
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,110
machine learning
that's an academic discipline that we're

5320
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:41,120
that's an academic discipline that we're
 

5321
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,629
that's an academic discipline that we're
really just a subfield of computer

5322
01:25:42,629 --> 01:25:42,639
really just a subfield of computer
 

5323
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,229
really just a subfield of computer
architecture yeah

5324
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
architecture yeah
 

5325
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,510
architecture yeah
we're just kind of waiting around for

5326
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:45,520
we're just kind of waiting around for
 

5327
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,189
we're just kind of waiting around for
them to do we really don't want to do

5328
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:47,199
them to do we really don't want to do
 

5329
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:48,870
them to do we really don't want to do
hardware work so like that's right i

5330
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
hardware work so like that's right i
 

5331
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,910
hardware work so like that's right i
really don't want to

5332
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:49,920
really don't want to
 

5333
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,149
really don't want to
we're procrastinating yes that's right

5334
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:52,159
we're procrastinating yes that's right
 

5335
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,669
we're procrastinating yes that's right
just waiting for them to do their job so

5336
01:25:53,669 --> 01:25:53,679
just waiting for them to do their job so
 

5337
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:55,510
just waiting for them to do their job so
that we can pretend to have done ours so

5338
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,520
that we can pretend to have done ours so
 

5339
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,870
that we can pretend to have done ours so
uh yeah i mean the argument reminds me a

5340
01:25:58,870 --> 01:25:58,880
uh yeah i mean the argument reminds me a
 

5341
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,070
uh yeah i mean the argument reminds me a
lot of

5342
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:00,080
lot of
 

5343
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,149
lot of
i think it was a fred jelinek quote uh

5344
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:02,159
i think it was a fred jelinek quote uh
 

5345
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,310
i think it was a fred jelinek quote uh
early computational linguist who said

5346
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:04,320
early computational linguist who said
 

5347
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,270
early computational linguist who said
you know we're building these

5348
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
you know we're building these
 

5349
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,629
you know we're building these
computational linguistic systems and

5350
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
computational linguistic systems and
 

5351
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,070
computational linguistic systems and
every time we fire a linguist

5352
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:10,080
every time we fire a linguist
 

5353
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,310
every time we fire a linguist
performance goes up by ten percent

5354
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:12,320
performance goes up by ten percent
 

5355
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,910
performance goes up by ten percent
something like that and so the idea of

5356
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:13,920
something like that and so the idea of
 

5357
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,149
something like that and so the idea of
us building the knowledge in

5358
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:16,159
us building the knowledge in
 

5359
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:19,110
us building the knowledge in
in that in that case um was much less he

5360
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:19,120
in that in that case um was much less he
 

5361
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,870
in that in that case um was much less he
was finding to be much less successful

5362
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:20,880
was finding to be much less successful
 

5363
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,709
was finding to be much less successful
than get rid of the people who know

5364
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:22,719
than get rid of the people who know
 

5365
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,629
than get rid of the people who know
about language as a

5366
01:26:24,629 --> 01:26:24,639
about language as a
 

5367
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,229
about language as a
you know from a kind of scholastic

5368
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239
you know from a kind of scholastic
 

5369
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,149
you know from a kind of scholastic
academic kind of perspective and replace

5370
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:30,159
academic kind of perspective and replace
 

5371
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:32,470
academic kind of perspective and replace
them with more compute

5372
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:32,480
them with more compute
 

5373
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,910
them with more compute
and so i think this is kind of a modern

5374
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:33,920
and so i think this is kind of a modern
 

5375
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,590
and so i think this is kind of a modern
version of that story which is okay we

5376
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:35,600
version of that story which is okay we
 

5377
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,350
version of that story which is okay we
want to do better on

5378
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,360
want to do better on
 

5379
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,110
want to do better on
machine vision you could build in all

5380
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:39,120
machine vision you could build in all
 

5381
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,070
machine vision you could build in all
these you know

5382
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,080

 

5383
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,110

motivated part-based models that you

5384
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:45,120
motivated part-based models that you
 

5385
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,390
motivated part-based models that you
know that just feel like

5386
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:46,400
know that just feel like
 

5387
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,669
know that just feel like
obviously the right thing that you have

5388
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:47,679
obviously the right thing that you have
 

5389
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:49,750
obviously the right thing that you have
to have or we can throw a lot of data at

5390
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:49,760
to have or we can throw a lot of data at
 

5391
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,709
to have or we can throw a lot of data at
it and guess what we're doing better

5392
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
it and guess what we're doing better
 

5393
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:51,990
it and guess what we're doing better
with it with a lot of data

5394
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:52,000
with it with a lot of data
 

5395
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,070
with it with a lot of data
so i i hadn't thought about it until

5396
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080
so i i hadn't thought about it until
 

5397
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,350
so i i hadn't thought about it until
this moment in this way

5398
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:57,360
this moment in this way
 

5399
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,430
this moment in this way
but what i believe well i've thought

5400
01:26:59,430 --> 01:26:59,440
but what i believe well i've thought
 

5401
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,550
but what i believe well i've thought
about what i believe

5402
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:00,560
about what i believe
 

5403
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,189
about what i believe
what i believe is that you know

5404
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:04,199
what i believe is that you know
 

5405
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:07,590
what i believe is that you know
compositionality and

5406
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:07,600
compositionality and
 

5407
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,030
compositionality and
what's the right way to say it the

5408
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,040
what's the right way to say it the
 

5409
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,270
what's the right way to say it the
complexity grows

5410
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:11,280
complexity grows
 

5411
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,430
complexity grows
rapidly as you consider more and more

5412
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:13,440
rapidly as you consider more and more
 

5413
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,470
rapidly as you consider more and more
possibilities

5414
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,480
possibilities
 

5415
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,910
possibilities
like explosively and so far moore's law

5416
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:17,920
like explosively and so far moore's law
 

5417
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,629
like explosively and so far moore's law
has also

5418
01:27:18,629 --> 01:27:18,639
has also
 

5419
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:20,709
has also
been growing explosively exponentially

5420
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:20,719
been growing explosively exponentially
 

5421
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,950
been growing explosively exponentially
and so so it really does seem like well

5422
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:22,960
and so so it really does seem like well
 

5423
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:23,910
and so so it really does seem like well
we don't have to

5424
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:23,920
we don't have to
 

5425
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,030
we don't have to
think really hard about the algorithm

5426
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,040
think really hard about the algorithm
 

5427
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,550
think really hard about the algorithm
design or the way that we build the

5428
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:28,560
design or the way that we build the
 

5429
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,270
design or the way that we build the
systems

5430
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:29,280
systems
 

5431
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,990
systems
because the best benefit we could get is

5432
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,000
because the best benefit we could get is
 

5433
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,669
because the best benefit we could get is
exponential and the best benefit that we

5434
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
exponential and the best benefit that we
 

5435
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:35,750
exponential and the best benefit that we
can get from waiting is exponential

5436
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:35,760
can get from waiting is exponential
 

5437
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,950
can get from waiting is exponential
so we can just wait it's got that's

5438
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
so we can just wait it's got that's
 

5439
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,709
so we can just wait it's got that's
gotta end right and there's hints now

5440
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:40,719
gotta end right and there's hints now
 

5441
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,390
gotta end right and there's hints now
that that moore's law is

5442
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:42,400
that that moore's law is
 

5443
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,709
that that moore's law is
is starting to feel some friction uh

5444
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719
is starting to feel some friction uh
 

5445
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:45,430
is starting to feel some friction uh
starting to

5446
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:45,440
starting to
 

5447
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,189
starting to
the world is pushing back a little bit

5448
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:47,199
the world is pushing back a little bit
 

5449
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,950
the world is pushing back a little bit
um one thing i

5450
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960
um one thing i
 

5451
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,870
um one thing i
i don't know do lots of people know this

5452
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
i don't know do lots of people know this
 

5453
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,110
i don't know do lots of people know this
i didn't know this i was i was trying to

5454
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:53,120
i didn't know this i was i was trying to
 

5455
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,070
i didn't know this i was i was trying to
write an essay and yeah moore's law has

5456
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:56,080
write an essay and yeah moore's law has
 

5457
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,669
write an essay and yeah moore's law has
been amazing and it's been it's enabled

5458
01:27:57,669 --> 01:27:57,679
been amazing and it's been it's enabled
 

5459
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:59,189
been amazing and it's been it's enabled
all sorts of things but there's a

5460
01:27:59,189 --> 01:27:59,199
all sorts of things but there's a
 

5461
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:00,870
all sorts of things but there's a
there's also a kind of counter moore's

5462
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:00,880
there's also a kind of counter moore's
 

5463
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,110
there's also a kind of counter moore's
law which is that the development cost

5464
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,120
law which is that the development cost
 

5465
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:03,669
law which is that the development cost
for each

5466
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:03,679
for each
 

5467
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,310
for each
successive generation of chips also is

5468
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:06,320
successive generation of chips also is
 

5469
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,510
successive generation of chips also is
doubling

5470
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:07,520
doubling
 

5471
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,350
doubling
so it's costing twice as much money so

5472
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:09,360
so it's costing twice as much money so
 

5473
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,830
so it's costing twice as much money so
the amount of development money per

5474
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:11,840
the amount of development money per
 

5475
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,830
the amount of development money per
cycle or whatever is actually sort of

5476
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:13,840
cycle or whatever is actually sort of
 

5477
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,750
cycle or whatever is actually sort of
constant and at some point

5478
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:15,760
constant and at some point
 

5479
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,830
constant and at some point
we run out of money uh so or we have to

5480
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:17,840
we run out of money uh so or we have to
 

5481
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,430
we run out of money uh so or we have to
come up with an entirely different way

5482
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:19,440
come up with an entirely different way
 

5483
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:19,990
come up with an entirely different way
of

5484
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:20,000
of
 

5485
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,110
of
of doing the development process so like

5486
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:23,120
of doing the development process so like
 

5487
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:23,350
of doing the development process so like
i

5488
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:23,360
i
 

5489
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,189
i
i guess i always always a bit skeptical

5490
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:25,199
i guess i always always a bit skeptical
 

5491
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,870
i guess i always always a bit skeptical
of the look it's an exponential curve

5492
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:26,880
of the look it's an exponential curve
 

5493
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,669
of the look it's an exponential curve
therefore it has

5494
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:27,679
therefore it has
 

5495
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,750
therefore it has
no end soon the number of people going

5496
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:29,760
no end soon the number of people going
 

5497
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,189
no end soon the number of people going
to nurips will be greater than the

5498
01:28:31,189 --> 01:28:31,199
to nurips will be greater than the
 

5499
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:32,629
to nurips will be greater than the
population of the earth

5500
01:28:32,629 --> 01:28:32,639
population of the earth
 

5501
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:34,229
population of the earth
that means we're going to discover life

5502
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:34,239
that means we're going to discover life
 

5503
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,390
that means we're going to discover life
on other planets no it doesn't it means

5504
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:36,400
on other planets no it doesn't it means
 

5505
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,270
on other planets no it doesn't it means
that we're in a

5506
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:37,280
that we're in a
 

5507
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,229
that we're in a
in a sigmoid curve on the front half

5508
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:40,239
in a sigmoid curve on the front half
 

5509
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,550
in a sigmoid curve on the front half
which looks a lot like an exponential

5510
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:42,560
which looks a lot like an exponential
 

5511
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,070
which looks a lot like an exponential
the second half is going to look a lot

5512
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:44,080
the second half is going to look a lot
 

5513
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,070
the second half is going to look a lot
like diminishing returns

5514
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080
like diminishing returns
 

5515
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,510
like diminishing returns
yeah the i mean but the interesting

5516
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:47,520
yeah the i mean but the interesting
 

5517
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,830
yeah the i mean but the interesting
thing about moore's law if you actually

5518
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:49,840
thing about moore's law if you actually
 

5519
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,149
thing about moore's law if you actually
like look at the technologies involved

5520
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:52,159
like look at the technologies involved
 

5521
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,030
like look at the technologies involved
it's

5522
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:53,040
it's
 

5523
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,510
it's
hundreds if not thousands of s-curves

5524
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:55,520
hundreds if not thousands of s-curves
 

5525
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,950
hundreds if not thousands of s-curves
stacked on top of each other it's not

5526
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:56,960
stacked on top of each other it's not
 

5527
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,709
stacked on top of each other it's not
actually an exponential curve

5528
01:28:58,709 --> 01:28:58,719
actually an exponential curve
 

5529
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:02,070
actually an exponential curve
it's constant breakthroughs and and

5530
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,080
it's constant breakthroughs and and
 

5531
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,990
it's constant breakthroughs and and
then what becomes useful to think about

5532
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:04,000
then what becomes useful to think about
 

5533
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,430
then what becomes useful to think about
which is exactly what you're saying

5534
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,440
which is exactly what you're saying
 

5535
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,590
which is exactly what you're saying
the cost of development like the size of

5536
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:07,600
the cost of development like the size of
 

5537
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,189
the cost of development like the size of
teams the amount of resources that are

5538
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:09,199
teams the amount of resources that are
 

5539
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:10,149
teams the amount of resources that are
invested

5540
01:29:10,149 --> 01:29:10,159
invested
 

5541
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:13,030
invested
in continuing to find new s-curves new

5542
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:13,040
in continuing to find new s-curves new
 

5543
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,229
in continuing to find new s-curves new
breakthroughs

5544
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:14,239
breakthroughs
 

5545
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:17,750
breakthroughs
and yeah it's uh it's an interesting

5546
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:17,760
and yeah it's uh it's an interesting
 

5547
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:18,709
and yeah it's uh it's an interesting
idea

5548
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:18,719
idea
 

5549
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:20,870
idea
you know if we live in the moment if we

5550
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:20,880
you know if we live in the moment if we
 

5551
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,790
you know if we live in the moment if we
sit here today

5552
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:22,800
sit here today
 

5553
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,910
sit here today
it seems to be the reasonable thing to

5554
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:25,920
it seems to be the reasonable thing to
 

5555
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,189
it seems to be the reasonable thing to
say that

5556
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:27,199
say that
 

5557
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:30,870
say that
exponentials end and yet in the software

5558
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:30,880
exponentials end and yet in the software
 

5559
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,350
exponentials end and yet in the software
realm

5560
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:31,360
realm
 

5561
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,910
realm
they just keep appearing to be happy

5562
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:33,920
they just keep appearing to be happy
 

5563
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,629
they just keep appearing to be happy
anyway

5564
01:29:34,629 --> 01:29:34,639
anyway
 

5565
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:38,550
anyway
and it's so i mean it's so

5566
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
and it's so i mean it's so
 

5567
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,030
and it's so i mean it's so
hard to disagree with elon musk on this

5568
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,040
hard to disagree with elon musk on this
 

5569
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,229
hard to disagree with elon musk on this
because

5570
01:29:42,229 --> 01:29:42,239
because
 

5571
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,590
because
it it like i i've

5572
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:45,600
it it like i i've
 

5573
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,669
it it like i i've
you know i used to be one of those folks

5574
01:29:47,669 --> 01:29:47,679
you know i used to be one of those folks
 

5575
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:49,430
you know i used to be one of those folks
i'm still one of those folks i've

5576
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:49,440
i'm still one of those folks i've
 

5577
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,430
i'm still one of those folks i've
studied autonomous vehicles that's what

5578
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
studied autonomous vehicles that's what
 

5579
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,790
studied autonomous vehicles that's what
i worked on and

5580
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:52,800
i worked on and
 

5581
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,510
i worked on and
and it's it's like you look what elon

5582
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:55,520
and it's it's like you look what elon
 

5583
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,270
and it's it's like you look what elon
musk is saying about autonomous vehicles

5584
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:57,280
musk is saying about autonomous vehicles
 

5585
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,189
musk is saying about autonomous vehicles
well obviously in a couple years

5586
01:29:59,189 --> 01:29:59,199
well obviously in a couple years
 

5587
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,830
well obviously in a couple years
or in a year or next month we'll have

5588
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:01,840
or in a year or next month we'll have
 

5589
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,430
or in a year or next month we'll have
fully autonomous vehicles like there's

5590
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:03,440
fully autonomous vehicles like there's
 

5591
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,350
fully autonomous vehicles like there's
no reason why we can't driving is pretty

5592
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
no reason why we can't driving is pretty
 

5593
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,149
no reason why we can't driving is pretty
simple

5594
01:30:06,149 --> 01:30:06,159
simple
 

5595
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:07,990
simple
like it's just a learning problem and

5596
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:08,000
like it's just a learning problem and
 

5597
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,590
like it's just a learning problem and
you just need to convert

5598
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:09,600
you just need to convert
 

5599
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,750
you just need to convert
uh all the driving that we're doing into

5600
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,760
uh all the driving that we're doing into
 

5601
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,189
uh all the driving that we're doing into
data and just having you all know with

5602
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:13,199
data and just having you all know with
 

5603
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,550
data and just having you all know with
the trains on that data

5604
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
the trains on that data
 

5605
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,750
the trains on that data
and uh like we use only our eyes so you

5606
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:17,760
and uh like we use only our eyes so you
 

5607
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:18,870
and uh like we use only our eyes so you
can use cameras and

5608
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:18,880
can use cameras and
 

5609
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,709
can use cameras and
you can train on it and it's like yeah

5610
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:22,719
you can train on it and it's like yeah
 

5611
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:26,070
you can train on it and it's like yeah
that's that what that should work

5612
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:26,080
that's that what that should work
 

5613
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,990
that's that what that should work
and then you put that hat on like the

5614
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:28,000
and then you put that hat on like the
 

5615
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,189
and then you put that hat on like the
philosophical hat

5616
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:29,199
philosophical hat
 

5617
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:31,110
philosophical hat
and but then you put the pragmatic hat

5618
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:31,120
and but then you put the pragmatic hat
 

5619
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,950
and but then you put the pragmatic hat
and it's like this is what the flaws of

5620
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:32,960
and it's like this is what the flaws of
 

5621
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,310
and it's like this is what the flaws of
computer vision are like

5622
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:34,320
computer vision are like
 

5623
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,990
computer vision are like
this is what it means to trans scale and

5624
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:36,000
this is what it means to trans scale and
 

5625
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,750
this is what it means to trans scale and
then you you put the

5626
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:37,760
then you you put the
 

5627
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,870
then you you put the
human factors the psychology hat on

5628
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:40,880
human factors the psychology hat on
 

5629
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,149
human factors the psychology hat on
which is like

5630
01:30:42,149 --> 01:30:42,159
which is like
 

5631
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:43,669
which is like
it's actually driving us a lot the

5632
01:30:43,669 --> 01:30:43,679
it's actually driving us a lot the
 

5633
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,110
it's actually driving us a lot the
cognitive science or cognitive whatever

5634
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:45,120
cognitive science or cognitive whatever
 

5635
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,229
cognitive science or cognitive whatever
the heck you call it

5636
01:30:46,229 --> 01:30:46,239
the heck you call it
 

5637
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,950
the heck you call it
is it's really hard it's much harder to

5638
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:48,960
is it's really hard it's much harder to
 

5639
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,910
is it's really hard it's much harder to
drive than

5640
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:49,920
drive than
 

5641
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,070
drive than
than we realize there's much larger

5642
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:52,080
than we realize there's much larger
 

5643
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,270
than we realize there's much larger
number of edge cases

5644
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:53,280
number of edge cases
 

5645
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,189
number of edge cases
so building up an intuition around this

5646
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:55,199
so building up an intuition around this
 

5647
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,350
so building up an intuition around this
is uh

5648
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:57,360
is uh
 

5649
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,350
is uh
around exponential is really difficult

5650
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360
around exponential is really difficult
 

5651
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,870
around exponential is really difficult
and on top of that

5652
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:00,880
and on top of that
 

5653
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,350
and on top of that
the pandemic is making us think about

the pandemic is making us think about
 

5655
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,510
the pandemic is making us think about
exponentials

5656
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:05,520
exponentials
 

5657
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,110
exponentials
making us realize that like we don't

5658
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:07,120
making us realize that like we don't
 

5659
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,350
making us realize that like we don't
understand anything about it we're not

5660
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:09,360
understand anything about it we're not
 

5661
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,910
understand anything about it we're not
able to intuit exponentials we're either

5662
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:11,920
able to intuit exponentials we're either

uh natural language generation of the

5724
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:29,760
uh natural language generation of the
 

5725
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,229
uh natural language generation of the
same kind of models that could be used

5726
01:32:32,229 --> 01:32:32,239
same kind of models that could be used
 

5727
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:34,310
same kind of models that could be used
to learn human behavior and then

5728
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
to learn human behavior and then
 

5729
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,310
to learn human behavior and then
manipulate that human behavior to

5730
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,320
manipulate that human behavior to
 

5731
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,229
manipulate that human behavior to
gain advertiser dollars and all those

5732

gain advertiser dollars and all those
 

5733

kinds of things sure uh

5734
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:40,080
kinds of things sure uh
 

5735
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,990
kinds of things sure uh
feed the capitalist system and and right

5736
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:42,000
feed the capitalist system and and right
 

5737
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,510
feed the capitalist system and and right
so they arguably already are

5738
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:43,520
so they arguably already are
 

5739
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,950
so they arguably already are
manipulating human behavior

manipulating human behavior
 

5741
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,550

yeah yeah so but not for

5742
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:47,560
yeah yeah so but not for

which i think is a big that would be a

5746
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:51,600
which i think is a big that would be a
 

5747
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,110
which i think is a big that would be a
big step like if they were trying to

5748
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:53,120
big step like if they were trying to
 

5749
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,990
big step like if they were trying to
manipulate us

5750
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:54,000
manipulate us
 

5751
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,110
manipulate us
to convince us not to shut them off i

5752
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
to convince us not to shut them off i
 

5753
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,470
to convince us not to shut them off i
would be very freaked out

5754
01:32:58,470 --> 01:32:58,480
would be very freaked out
 

5755
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,030
would be very freaked out
but i don't see a path to that from

5756
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,040
but i don't see a path to that from
 

5757
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:01,990
but i don't see a path to that from
where we are now

5758
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:02,000
where we are now
 

5759
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,189
where we are now
they they don't have any of those

5760
01:33:05,189 --> 01:33:05,199
they they don't have any of those
 

5761
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,709
they they don't have any of those
abilities that's not what they're trying

01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:06,719
abilities that's not what they're trying
 

5763
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,350
abilities that's not what they're trying
to do they're trying to keep people on

5764
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
to do they're trying to keep people on
 

5765
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,189
to do they're trying to keep people on
on the site but see the thing is this

5766
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,199
on the site but see the thing is this
 

5767
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,030
on the site but see the thing is this
this is the thing about life on earth

5768
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,040
this is the thing about life on earth
 

5769
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:16,149
this is the thing about life on earth
is they might be borrowing our

5770
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:16,159
is they might be borrowing our
 

5771
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:19,270

consciousness and sentience like

so like in a sense they do because the

01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,360
so like in a sense they do because the
 

5775
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,030
so like in a sense they do because the
creators of the algorithms

creators of the algorithms
 

5777
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,189
creators of the algorithms
have like they're not you know if you

5778
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:25,199
have like they're not you know if you
 

5779
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,470
have like they're not you know if you
look at our body

5780
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:26,480
look at our body
 

5781
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:29,030
look at our body
okay we're not a single organism we're a

little motivations we're built on top of
 

5787
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,189
little motivations we're built on top of
each other

companies and corporations right because

5796
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:40,320
companies and corporations right because
 

5797
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,110

funny organisms in and of themselves

5800
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:43,280
funny organisms in and of themselves
 

5801
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,790
funny organisms in and of themselves
that really do seem to have self

5802
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:44,800
that really do seem to have self
 

5803
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,629
that really do seem to have self
preservation built in and i think that's

5804
01:33:46,629 --> 01:33:46,639
preservation built in and i think that's
 

5805
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,310
preservation built in and i think that's
at the at the design level i think

5806
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,320
at the at the design level i think
 

5807
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,110
at the at the design level i think
they're designed to have

5808
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:49,120
they're designed to have
 

5809
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:49,990
they're designed to have
self-preservation

5810
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:50,000
self-preservation
 

5811
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,669
self-preservation
be a focus so you're right in that in

5812
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:53,679
be a focus so you're right in that in
 

5813
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:55,030
be a focus so you're right in that in
that broader

5814
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,040
that broader
 

5815
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,470
that broader
system that we're also a part of

5816
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,480
system that we're also a part of
 

5817
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,669
system that we're also a part of
and can have some influence on uh

5818
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:01,679
and can have some influence on uh
 

5819
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,669
and can have some influence on uh
it's it's it is much more complicated

5820
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
it's it's it is much more complicated
 

5821
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,350
it's it's it is much more complicated
much more powerful yeah i agree with

5822
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:05,360
much more powerful yeah i agree with
 

5823
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,629
much more powerful yeah i agree with
that

5824
01:34:06,629 --> 01:34:06,639
that
 

5825
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,270
that
uh so people really love it when i ask

5826
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
uh so people really love it when i ask
 

5827

really uh skillful the way you thank you
 

5849
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,390
really uh skillful the way you thank you
that question i'm going to try to do the

5850
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:32,400
that question i'm going to try to do the
 

5851
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,629
that question i'm going to try to do the
same with the books

5852
01:34:34,629 --> 01:34:34,639
same with the books
 

5853
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:36,790
same with the books
so do you have a skillful way to avoid

5854
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:36,800
so do you have a skillful way to avoid
 

5855

so do you have a skillful way to avoid
answering the question about three books

5856
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:38,480
answering the question about three books
 

5857
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,669
answering the question about three books
you would recommend

5858
01:34:39,669 --> 01:34:39,679
you would recommend
 

5859
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,870
you would recommend
i'd like to tell you a story

5860
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:42,880

 

5861
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,430

so um my first job out of college was at

5862
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,440
so um my first job out of college was at
 

5863
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,870
so um my first job out of college was at
bellcore i mentioned that before

5864
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:46,880
bellcore i mentioned that before
 

5865
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,310
bellcore i mentioned that before
where i worked with dave ackley the head

5866
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:48,320
where i worked with dave ackley the head
 

5867
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,590
where i worked with dave ackley the head
of the group was a guy named tom

5868
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:49,600
of the group was a guy named tom
 

5869
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,189
of the group was a guy named tom
landauer and i don't know

5870
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:51,199
landauer and i don't know
 

5871
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,669
landauer and i don't know
how well known he's known now but

5872
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:53,679
how well known he's known now but
 

5873
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,109
how well known he's known now but
arguably he's the

5874
01:34:55,109 --> 01:34:55,119
arguably he's the
 

5875
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:56,629
arguably he's the
he's the inventor and the first

5876
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
he's the inventor and the first
 

5877
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,950
he's the inventor and the first
proselytizer of word embeddings

5878
01:34:58,950 --> 01:34:58,960
proselytizer of word embeddings
 

5879
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,270
proselytizer of word embeddings
so they they developed a system shortly

5880
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:01,280
so they they developed a system shortly
 

5881
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,350
so they they developed a system shortly
before i got to the group

5882
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:03,360
before i got to the group
 

5883
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,629
before i got to the group
yeah um that that uh called latent

5884
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
yeah um that that uh called latent
 

5885
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,390
yeah um that that uh called latent
semantic analysis that would take

5886
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,400
semantic analysis that would take
 

5887
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,109
semantic analysis that would take
words of english and embed them in you

5888
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:11,119
words of english and embed them in you
 

5889
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,870
words of english and embed them in you
know multi-hundred dimensional space

5890
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:12,880
know multi-hundred dimensional space
 

5891
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,950
know multi-hundred dimensional space
and then used that as a way of uh you

5892
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:14,960
and then used that as a way of uh you
 

5893
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,629
and then used that as a way of uh you
know assessing similarity and basically

5894
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:16,639
know assessing similarity and basically
 

5895
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:17,750
know assessing similarity and basically
doing reinforcement learning

5896
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
doing reinforcement learning
 

5897
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,270

retrieval you know sort of pre-google

5900
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,600

and he was trained as an anthropologist

5904
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:27,920
and he was trained as an anthropologist
 

5905
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:28,550
and he was trained as an anthropologist
but then

5906
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:28,560
but then
 

5907
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,910
but then
became a cognitive scientist so i was in

5908
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:29,920
became a cognitive scientist so i was in
 

5909
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,350
became a cognitive scientist so i was in
the cognitive science research group

5910
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:31,360
the cognitive science research group
 

5911
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,709
the cognitive science research group
it's you know like i said

5912
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:32,719
it's you know like i said
 

5913
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,950
it's you know like i said
i'm a cognitive science groupie um at

5914
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:34,960
i'm a cognitive science groupie um at
 

5915
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,070
i'm a cognitive science groupie um at
the time i thought i'd become a

5916
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:36,080
the time i thought i'd become a
 

5917
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,910
the time i thought i'd become a
cognitive scientist but then i realized

5918
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:37,920
cognitive scientist but then i realized
 

5919
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:38,870
cognitive scientist but then i realized
in that group

5920
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:38,880
in that group
 

5921
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,470
in that group
no i'm a computer scientist but i'm a

5922
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:40,480
no i'm a computer scientist but i'm a
 

5923
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:41,750
no i'm a computer scientist but i'm a
computer scientist who really loves to

01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:41,760
computer scientist who really loves to
 

5925
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,590
computer scientist who really loves to
hang out with cognitive scientists

5926
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:43,600
hang out with cognitive scientists
 

5927
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,709
hang out with cognitive scientists
and he said he studied language

5928
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:46,719
and he said he studied language
 

5929
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:49,109

acquisition in particular he said you
 

5931
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,310
acquisition in particular he said you
know humans have about

5932
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:50,320
know humans have about
 

5933
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,950
know humans have about
this number of words of vocabulary and

5934
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
this number of words of vocabulary and
 

5935
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,430
this number of words of vocabulary and
most of that is learned from reading

5936
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
most of that is learned from reading
 

5937
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,590
most of that is learned from reading
and i said that can't be true because i

5938
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:57,600
and i said that can't be true because i
 

5939
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,109
and i said that can't be true because i
have a really big vocabulary

5940

pattern recognition at this point i
 

5959
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,189
pattern recognition at this point i
don't sound it out

5960

a small tangent on that it is a

6026
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,560
a small tangent on that it is a
 

6027
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,470
a small tangent on that it is a
fascinating open question to me

6028
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:24,480
fascinating open question to me
 

6029
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,990
fascinating open question to me
on the topic of driving whether

6030
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,000
on the topic of driving whether
 

6031
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,790
on the topic of driving whether
you know supervised learning people

6032
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:30,800
you know supervised learning people
 

6033
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,390
you know supervised learning people
machine learning people think you have

6034
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
machine learning people think you have
 

6035
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,109
machine learning people think you have
to like

6036
01:37:33,109 --> 01:37:33,119
to like
 

6037
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:36,470
to like
drive to learn how to drive to me it's

6038
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:36,480
drive to learn how to drive to me it's
 

6039
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,709
drive to learn how to drive to me it's
very possible that just by

6040
01:37:38,709 --> 01:37:38,719
very possible that just by
 

6041
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:41,669
very possible that just by
us humans by first of all walking but

6042
01:37:41,669 --> 01:37:41,679
us humans by first of all walking but
 

6043
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:42,390
us humans by first of all walking but
also by

6044
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
also by
 

6045
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,709
also by
watching other people dr not even being

6046
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:44,719
watching other people dr not even being
 

6047
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,310
watching other people dr not even being
inside cars as a passenger

6048
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
inside cars as a passenger
 

6049
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,310
inside cars as a passenger
but let's say being inside the car as a

6050
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:48,320
but let's say being inside the car as a
 

6051
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,550
but let's say being inside the car as a
passenger but even just

6052
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:50,560
passenger but even just
 

6053
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,550
passenger but even just
like being a pedestrian and crossing the

6054
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:52,560
like being a pedestrian and crossing the
 

6055
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,550
like being a pedestrian and crossing the
road you learn

6056
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:54,560
road you learn
 

6057
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,470
road you learn
so much about driving from that it's

6058
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:56,480
so much about driving from that it's
 

6059
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,750
so much about driving from that it's
very possible

6060
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:57,760
very possible
 

6061
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,070
very possible
that you can without ever being inside

01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:01,280
of a car
 

6065
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,310

um you know i have wishes to live um
and they're you know they're figuring

6092
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:31,840
and they're you know they're figuring
 

6093
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,390
and they're you know they're figuring
things out now they start off

6094
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:34,400
things out now they start off
 

6095
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:37,750
things out now they start off
very very much better than i imagine

6096
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:37,760
very very much better than i imagine
 

6097
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,830
very very much better than i imagine
uh like a neural network would right

6098
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:39,840
uh like a neural network would right
 

6099
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,510
uh like a neural network would right
they get that they're seeing the world

6100
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520
they get that they're seeing the world
 

6101
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,870
they get that they're seeing the world
they get that there's a road that

6102
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:42,880
they get that there's a road that
 

6103
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,470
they get that there's a road that
they're trying to be on they get that

6104
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:44,480
they're trying to be on they get that
 

6105
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,149
they're trying to be on they get that
there's a relationship between the angle

6106
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:46,159
there's a relationship between the angle
 

6107
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:46,870
there's a relationship between the angle
the steering

6108
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:46,880
the steering
 

6109
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,790
the steering
but it takes a while to not be very

6110
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:48,800
but it takes a while to not be very
 

6111
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,790
but it takes a while to not be very
jerky

6112
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:50,800
jerky
 

6113
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,310
jerky
and so that happens pretty quickly like

6114
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
and so that happens pretty quickly like
 

6115
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,070
and so that happens pretty quickly like
the ability to stay in lane

6116
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
the ability to stay in lane
 

6117
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,790
the ability to stay in lane
at speed that happens relatively fast

6118
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:56,800
at speed that happens relatively fast
 

6119
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,310
at speed that happens relatively fast
it's not zero shot learning but

6120
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:58,320
it's not zero shot learning but
 

6121
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,709
it's not zero shot learning but
it's pretty fast the thing that's

6122
01:39:00,709 --> 01:39:00,719
it's pretty fast the thing that's
 

6123
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,390
it's pretty fast the thing that's
remarkably hard and this is i think

6124
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
remarkably hard and this is i think
 

6125
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,990
remarkably hard and this is i think
partly why self-driving cars are really

6126
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,000
partly why self-driving cars are really
 

6127
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:04,629
partly why self-driving cars are really
hard

6128
01:39:04,629 --> 01:39:04,639
hard
 

6129
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:07,030
hard
is the degree to which driving is a

6130
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,040
is the degree to which driving is a
 

6131
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:09,270
is the degree to which driving is a
social interaction activity yes

6132
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
social interaction activity yes
 

6133
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,030
social interaction activity yes
and that blew me away i was completely

6134
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:11,040
and that blew me away i was completely
 

6135
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,870
and that blew me away i was completely
unaware of it until i watched my son

6136
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:12,880
unaware of it until i watched my son
 

6137
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,070
unaware of it until i watched my son
learning to drive

6138
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:14,080
learning to drive
 

6139
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,189
learning to drive
and i was realizing that he was sending

6140
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:17,199
and i was realizing that he was sending
 

6141
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,270
and i was realizing that he was sending
signals to all the cars around him

6142
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:19,280
signals to all the cars around him
 

6143
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,430
signals to all the cars around him
and those in his case he's he's always

6144
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:21,440
and those in his case he's he's always
 

6145
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,390
and those in his case he's he's always
had

6146
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,400
had
 

6147
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,750
had
social communication challenges

6148
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:25,760
social communication challenges
 

6149
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,669
social communication challenges
he was sending very mixed confusing

6150
01:39:27,669 --> 01:39:27,679
he was sending very mixed confusing
 

6151
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:29,189
he was sending very mixed confusing
signals to the other cars and that was

6152
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:29,199
signals to the other cars and that was
 

6153
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:30,950
signals to the other cars and that was
causing the other cars to drive

6154
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:30,960
causing the other cars to drive
 

6155
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,030
causing the other cars to drive
weirdly and erratically and there was no

6156
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:33,040
weirdly and erratically and there was no
 

6157
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,149
weirdly and erratically and there was no
question in my mind

6158
01:39:34,149 --> 01:39:34,159
question in my mind
 

6159
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:36,550
question in my mind
that he would he would have an accident

6160
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:36,560
that he would he would have an accident
 

6161
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,910
that he would he would have an accident
because

6162
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:37,920
because
 

6163
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,990
because
they didn't know how to read him there's

6164
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:40,000
they didn't know how to read him there's
 

6165
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,669
they didn't know how to read him there's
things you do with the the speed that

6166
01:39:41,669 --> 01:39:41,679
things you do with the the speed that
 

6167
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:43,590
things you do with the the speed that
you drive the positioning of your car

6168
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:43,600
you drive the positioning of your car
 

6169
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,070
you drive the positioning of your car
that you're constantly like in the head

6170
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:46,080
that you're constantly like in the head
 

6171
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,510
that you're constantly like in the head
of the other drivers

6172
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:47,520
of the other drivers
 

6173
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,390
of the other drivers
and seeing him not knowing how to do

6174
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:50,400
and seeing him not knowing how to do
 

6175
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,070
and seeing him not knowing how to do
that and having to be taught explicitly

6176
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:52,080
that and having to be taught explicitly
 

6177
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,669
that and having to be taught explicitly
okay you have to be thinking about what

6178
01:39:53,669 --> 01:39:53,679
okay you have to be thinking about what
 

6179
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,990
okay you have to be thinking about what
the other driver is thinking

6180
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:56,000
the other driver is thinking
 

6181
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,830
the other driver is thinking
was a revelation to me yeah i was

6182
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:57,840
was a revelation to me yeah i was
 

6183
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,030
was a revelation to me yeah i was
supposed to be really

6184
01:39:59,030 --> 01:39:59,040
supposed to be really
 

6185
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,990
supposed to be really
so so creating kind of uh theories of

6186
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:02,000
so so creating kind of uh theories of
 

6187
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,590
so so creating kind of uh theories of
mind of the other theories of mind of

6188
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:03,600
mind of the other theories of mind of
 

6189
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,709
mind of the other theories of mind of
the other cars

6190
01:40:04,709 --> 01:40:04,719
the other cars
 

6191
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,709
the other cars
yeah yeah which i just hadn't heard

6192
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:06,719
yeah yeah which i just hadn't heard
 

6193
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,470
yeah yeah which i just hadn't heard
discussed in the self-driving car

6194
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:08,480
discussed in the self-driving car
 

6195
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,070
discussed in the self-driving car
talks that i've been to since then

6196
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,080
talks that i've been to since then
 

6197
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,030
talks that i've been to since then
there's some people who do do

6198
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:13,040
there's some people who do do
 

6199
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,709
there's some people who do do
consider those kinds of issues but it's

6200
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:14,719
consider those kinds of issues but it's
 

6201
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,149
consider those kinds of issues but it's
way more subtle than i think

6202
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:16,159
way more subtle than i think
 

6203
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,629
way more subtle than i think
there's a little bit of work involved

6204
01:40:18,629 --> 01:40:18,639
there's a little bit of work involved
 

6205
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,070
there's a little bit of work involved
with that when you realize

6206
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:20,080
with that when you realize
 

6207
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,590
with that when you realize
like when you especially focus not on

6208
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:21,600
like when you especially focus not on
 

6209
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,030
like when you especially focus not on
other cars but on pedestrians for

6210
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,040
other cars but on pedestrians for
 

6211
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:23,669
other cars but on pedestrians for
example

6212
01:40:23,669 --> 01:40:23,679
example
 

6213
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:26,629
example
it's it's a literally staring you in the

6214
01:40:26,629 --> 01:40:26,639
it's it's a literally staring you in the
 

6215
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,149
it's it's a literally staring you in the
face yeah yeah yeah so that when you're

6216
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:28,159
face yeah yeah yeah so that when you're
 

6217
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:29,750
face yeah yeah yeah so that when you're
just like how do i interact with

6218
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:29,760
just like how do i interact with
 

6219
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,950
just like how do i interact with
pedestrians

6220
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:30,960
pedestrians
 

6221
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,550
pedestrians
um yeah like pedestrians you're

6222
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:32,560
um yeah like pedestrians you're
 

6223
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,070
um yeah like pedestrians you're
practically talking to an octopus at

6224
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:34,080
practically talking to an octopus at
 

6225
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,109
practically talking to an octopus at
that point they've got all these

6226
01:40:35,109 --> 01:40:35,119
that point they've got all these
 

6227
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:36,390
that point they've got all these
weird degrees of freedom you don't know

6228
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:36,400
weird degrees of freedom you don't know
 

6229
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,510
weird degrees of freedom you don't know
what they're going to do they can turn

6230
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:37,520
what they're going to do they can turn
 

6231
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,590
what they're going to do they can turn
around any second but the point is

6232
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:39,600
around any second but the point is
 

6233
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,910
around any second but the point is
we humans know what they're going to do

6234
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:41,920
we humans know what they're going to do
 

6235
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,109
we humans know what they're going to do
like we have a good

6236
01:40:43,109 --> 01:40:43,119
like we have a good
 

6237
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:44,629
like we have a good
theory of mind we have a good mental

6238
01:40:44,629 --> 01:40:44,639
theory of mind we have a good mental
 

6239
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,629
theory of mind we have a good mental
model of what they're doing

6240
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:46,639
model of what they're doing
 

6241
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:49,189
model of what they're doing
and we have a good model of the model

6242
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:49,199
and we have a good model of the model
 

6243
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,310
and we have a good model of the model
that have a view

6244
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,320
that have a view
 

6245
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,910
that have a view
and the model of the model of the model

6246
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:51,920
and the model of the model of the model
 

6247
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,070
and the model of the model of the model
like they're we're able to kind of

6248
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,080
like they're we're able to kind of
 

6249
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,270
like they're we're able to kind of
reason about this kind of

6250
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:55,280
reason about this kind of
 

6251
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,030
reason about this kind of
uh the social like game of it

6252
01:40:59,030 --> 01:40:59,040
uh the social like game of it
 

6253
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,590
uh the social like game of it
uh all the hope is that it's quite

6254
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:01,600
uh all the hope is that it's quite
 

6255
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,109
uh all the hope is that it's quite
simple actually

6256
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:03,119
simple actually
 

6257
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,709
simple actually
that it could be learned that's what i

6258

that it could be learned that's what i
 

6259
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,390
that it could be learned that's what i
just talked to the waymo i don't know if

6260
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:06,400
just talked to the waymo i don't know if
 

6261
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,910
just talked to the waymo i don't know if
you know that company it's

6262
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:07,920
you know that company it's
 

6263

6267
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,990
their cto
about this podcast and they like i wrote

6268
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:14,000
about this podcast and they like i wrote
 

6269
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,270
about this podcast and they like i wrote
in their car

6270
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:15,280
in their car
 

6271
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,270
in their car
and it's quite aggressive and it's quite

6272
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,280
and it's quite aggressive and it's quite
 

6273
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,189
and it's quite aggressive and it's quite
fast and it's good and it feels

6274
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
fast and it's good and it feels
 

6275
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,750
fast and it's good and it feels
great it make it also just like tesla

6276
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:21,760
great it make it also just like tesla
 

6277
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,629
great it make it also just like tesla
waymo made me change my mind about like

6278
01:41:24,629 --> 01:41:24,639
waymo made me change my mind about like
 

6279
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:27,430
waymo made me change my mind about like
maybe driving is easier than i thought

6280
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
maybe driving is easier than i thought
 

6281
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,950
maybe driving is easier than i thought
maybe i'm just being

6282
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:28,960
maybe i'm just being
 

6283
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,070
maybe i'm just being
speciesist human

6284
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:32,080
speciesist human
 

6285
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,350
speciesist human
maybe uh it's a speciesist argument yes

6286
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:35,360
maybe uh it's a speciesist argument yes
 

6287
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,550
maybe uh it's a speciesist argument yes
i don't know

6288
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:36,560
i don't know
 

6289
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:39,109
i don't know
but it it's fascinating to think about

6290
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:39,119
but it it's fascinating to think about
 

6291
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:41,109
but it it's fascinating to think about
like the same

6292
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:41,119
like the same
 

6293
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,430
like the same
as with reading which i think you just

6294
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:43,440
as with reading which i think you just
 

6295
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,189
as with reading which i think you just
said you avoided the question

6296
01:41:45,189 --> 01:41:45,199
said you avoided the question
 

6297
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:46,550
said you avoided the question
but i still hope you answered in some

6298
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:46,560
but i still hope you answered in some
 

6299
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,629
but i still hope you answered in some
way we avoided it brilliantly

6300
01:41:48,629 --> 01:41:48,639
way we avoided it brilliantly
 

6301
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:50,709
way we avoided it brilliantly
it is there's blind spots there's

6302
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
it is there's blind spots there's
 

6303
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,229
it is there's blind spots there's

that artificial intelligence researchers
have about what it actually

6308
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:56,320
have about what it actually
 

6309
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,189
have about what it actually

very articulate about the

some sense the elon musk approach of
 

6343
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,070
some sense the elon musk approach of
being ultra confident and just like

01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:30,080
being ultra confident and just like
 

6345
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,149

like some people say it's reckless and

6348
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:33,840
like some people say it's reckless and
 

6349
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,350
like some people say it's reckless and
dangerous and so on

6350
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:35,360
dangerous and so on
 

6351
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,790
dangerous and so on
but like partly it's like it seems to be

6352
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:38,800
but like partly it's like it seems to be
 

6353
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,550
but like partly it's like it seems to be
one of the only ways to make progress in

6354
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:40,560
one of the only ways to make progress in
 

6355
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,790
one of the only ways to make progress in
artificial intelligence so it's uh

6356
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:42,800
artificial intelligence so it's uh
 

6357
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,950
artificial intelligence so it's uh
it's you know these these are difficult

6358
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:44,960
it's you know these these are difficult

01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:54,239
is messy so
 

6369
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,149
is messy so
many years ago before self-driving cars

6370
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
many years ago before self-driving cars
 

6371
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:57,669
many years ago before self-driving cars
were an actual thing you could have a

6372
01:42:57,669 --> 01:42:57,679
were an actual thing you could have a
 

6373
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:58,470
were an actual thing you could have a
discussion about

6374
01:42:58,470 --> 01:42:58,480
discussion about
 

6375
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,629
discussion about
somebody asked me like what if what if

6376
01:43:00,629 --> 01:43:00,639
somebody asked me like what if what if
 

6377
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:02,310
somebody asked me like what if what if
the what if we could use that robotic

6378
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:02,320
the what if we could use that robotic
 

6379
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,990
the what if we could use that robotic
technology and use it to drive cars

6380
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:04,000
technology and use it to drive cars
 

6381
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,709
technology and use it to drive cars
around

6382
01:43:04,709 --> 01:43:04,719
around
 

6383
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:05,990
around
like isn't that aren't people going to

6384
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:06,000
like isn't that aren't people going to
 

6385
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,350
like isn't that aren't people going to
be killed and then it's not you know

6386
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:07,360
be killed and then it's not you know
 

6387
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:07,990
be killed and then it's not you know
blah blah blah

blah blah blah
 

6389
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,590
blah blah blah
i'm like that's not what's gonna happen

6390
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:09,600
i'm like that's not what's gonna happen
 

6391
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,030
i'm like that's not what's gonna happen
i said with confidence

6392
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:11,040
i said with confidence
 

6393
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,830
i said with confidence
incorrectly obviously uh what i think is

6394
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:13,840
incorrectly obviously uh what i think is
 

6395
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,109
incorrectly obviously uh what i think is
gonna happen is we're gonna have a lot

6396
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:15,119
gonna happen is we're gonna have a lot
 

6397
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:15,750
gonna happen is we're gonna have a lot
more

6398
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:15,760
more
 

6399
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,510
more
like a very gradual kind of rollout

6400
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:17,520
like a very gradual kind of rollout
 

6401
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,950
like a very gradual kind of rollout
where people

6402
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:18,960
where people
 

6403
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,430
where people
have these cars in like closed

6404
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:21,440
have these cars in like closed
 

6405
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,470
have these cars in like closed
communities

6406
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:22,480
communities
 

6407
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,470
communities
right where it's somewhat realistic but

6408
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:24,480
right where it's somewhat realistic but
 

6409
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,510
right where it's somewhat realistic but
it's still

6410
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:25,520
it's still
 

6411
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,430
it's still
in a box right so that we can really get

6412
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:27,440
in a box right so that we can really get
 

6413
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,950
in a box right so that we can really get
a sense of what

6414
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
a sense of what
 

6415
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,070
a sense of what
what are the weird things that can

6416
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:30,080
what are the weird things that can
 

6417
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,229
what are the weird things that can
happen how do we

6418
01:43:32,229 --> 01:43:32,239
happen how do we
 

6419
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:34,070
happen how do we
how do we have to change the way we

6420
01:43:34,070 --> 01:43:34,080
how do we have to change the way we
 

6421
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,229
how do we have to change the way we
behave around these vehicles like

6422
01:43:36,229 --> 01:43:36,239
behave around these vehicles like
 

6423
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:38,390
behave around these vehicles like
it obviously requires a kind of

6424
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
it obviously requires a kind of
 

6425
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,350
it obviously requires a kind of
co-evolution

6426
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:39,360
co-evolution
 

6427
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,189
co-evolution
that you can't just plop them in and see

6428
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
that you can't just plop them in and see
 

6429
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,470
that you can't just plop them in and see
what happens

6430
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:42,480
what happens
 

6431
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,830
what happens
but of course we're basically popping

6432
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:43,840
but of course we're basically popping
 

6433
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,030
but of course we're basically popping
them in to see what happens so i was

6434
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,040
them in to see what happens so i was
 

6435
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:45,830
them in to see what happens so i was
wrong but i

6436
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:45,840
wrong but i
 

6437
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,109
wrong but i
do think that would have been a better

6438
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:47,119
do think that would have been a better
 

6439
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,669
do think that would have been a better
plan so that's but your intuition that's

6440
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:49,679
plan so that's but your intuition that's
 

6441
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:50,550
plan so that's but your intuition that's
funny

6442
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,560
funny
 

6443
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,550
funny
just zooming out and looking at the

6444
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,560
just zooming out and looking at the
 

6445
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,070
just zooming out and looking at the
forces of capitalism

6446
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:54,080
forces of capitalism
 

6447
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,310
forces of capitalism
and it seems that capitalism rewards

6448
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,320
and it seems that capitalism rewards
 

6449
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,750
and it seems that capitalism rewards
risk takers

6450
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:57,760
risk takers
 

6451
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,149
risk takers
and rewards and punishes risk takers

6452
01:44:00,149 --> 01:44:00,159
and rewards and punishes risk takers
 

6453
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:00,790
and rewards and punishes risk takers
like it

6454
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:00,800
like it
 

6455
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,990
like it
and like try it out

6456
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:04,000
and like try it out
 

6457
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,590
and like try it out
the academic approach

6458
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:07,600
the academic approach
 

6459
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,109
the academic approach
to let's try a small thing

6460
01:44:11,109 --> 01:44:11,119
to let's try a small thing
 

6461
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,270
to let's try a small thing
and try to understand slowly the

6462
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:13,280
and try to understand slowly the
 

6463
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,790
and try to understand slowly the
fundamentals of the problem

6464
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
fundamentals of the problem
 

6465
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,510
fundamentals of the problem
and let's start with one and do two and

6466
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:17,520
and let's start with one and do two and
 

6467
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,310
and let's start with one and do two and
then see that

6468
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:18,320
then see that
 

6469
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,030
then see that
and then do the three uh you know uh the

6470
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:21,040
and then do the three uh you know uh the
 

6471
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,470
and then do the three uh you know uh the
the capitalist like startup

6472
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:22,480
the capitalist like startup
 

6473
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,390
the capitalist like startup
entrepreneurial dream is

let's build a thousand and let's right
and 500 of them fail but whatever the

6478
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:28,800
and 500 of them fail but whatever the
 

6479
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,750
and 500 of them fail but whatever the
other 500 we

other 500 we
 

6481
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,430
other 500 we
learned from them but if you're good

6482
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:31,440
learned from them but if you're good
 

6483
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,350
learned from them but if you're good
enough i mean one thing it's like your

6484
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
enough i mean one thing it's like your
 

6485
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:34,870
enough i mean one thing it's like your
intuition would say like

6486
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:34,880
intuition would say like
 

6487
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,030
intuition would say like
that's going to be hugely destructive to

6488
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:37,040
that's going to be hugely destructive to
 

6489
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,149
that's going to be hugely destructive to
everything but

6490
01:44:38,149 --> 01:44:38,159
everything but
 

6491
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:41,669
everything but
actually it's kind of the the the forces

6492
01:44:41,669 --> 01:44:41,679
actually it's kind of the the the forces
 

6493
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:42,470
actually it's kind of the the the forces
of capitalism

6494
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:42,480
of capitalism
 

6495
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,390
of capitalism
people are quite it's easy to be

6496
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:44,400
people are quite it's easy to be
 

6497
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,990
people are quite it's easy to be
critical but if you actually look at the

6498
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,000
critical but if you actually look at the
 

6499
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:46,950
critical but if you actually look at the
data

6500
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:46,960
data
 

6501
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,950
data
at the way our world has progressed in

6502
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:48,960
at the way our world has progressed in
 

6503
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,629
at the way our world has progressed in
terms of the quality of life

it seems like the competent good people

6506
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,040
it seems like the competent good people
 

6507
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,550
it seems like the competent good people
rise to the top

this is coming from me from the soviet

6510
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:56,320
this is coming from me from the soviet
 

6511
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,669
this is coming from me from the soviet
union and

6512
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:57,679
union and
 

6513
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:00,830
union and
so on it's like it's interesting

6514
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:00,840
so on it's like it's interesting
 

6515
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,950
so on it's like it's interesting
that somebody like elon musk is the way

6516
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:04,960
that somebody like elon musk is the way
 

6517
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,430
that somebody like elon musk is the way
you uh you push progress in artificial

6518
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:07,440
you uh you push progress in artificial
 

6519
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,030
you uh you push progress in artificial
intelligence like it's forcing way more

6520
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:09,040
intelligence like it's forcing way more
 

6521
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,229
intelligence like it's forcing way more
to step this

6522
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:10,239
to step this
 

6523
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:13,109
to step this
their stuff up uh and waymo is forcing

6524
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:13,119
their stuff up uh and waymo is forcing
 

6525
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:13,430
their stuff up uh and waymo is forcing
uh

6526
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:13,440
uh
 

6527
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:16,870
uh
elon musk to step up

6528
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:16,880
elon musk to step up
 

6529
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,950
elon musk to step up
it's fascinating i because i have this

6530
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,960
it's fascinating i because i have this
 

6531
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,709
it's fascinating i because i have this
tension in in my

6532
01:45:20,709 --> 01:45:20,719
tension in in my
 

6533
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:24,390
tension in in my
heart and just being upset by

6534
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:24,400
heart and just being upset by
 

6535
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:27,109
heart and just being upset by
the lack of progress in autonomous

6536
01:45:27,109 --> 01:45:27,119
the lack of progress in autonomous
 

6537
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:29,590
the lack of progress in autonomous
vehicles and within academia

6538
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:29,600
vehicles and within academia
 

6539
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,790
vehicles and within academia
so there's a huge progress in the early

6540
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:32,800
so there's a huge progress in the early
 

6541
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:33,430
so there's a huge progress in the early
days

6542
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,440
days
 

6543
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,470
days
of the darpa challenges and then it just

6544
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:36,480
of the darpa challenges and then it just
 

6545
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,830
of the darpa challenges and then it just
kind of stopped

6546
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:37,840
kind of stopped
 

6547
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:40,149
kind of stopped
like at mit but it's true everywhere

intelligence starts

intelligence starts
approaching the problems of the real

like academics kind of like ah all right

6568
01:45:59,430 --> 01:45:59,440
like academics kind of like ah all right

let let the couple get really hard in a

6570
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:01,280
let let the couple get really hard in a
 

6571
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,709
let let the couple get really hard in a
different way in a different way and

6572
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:02,719
different way in a different way and
 

6573
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,149
different way in a different way and
that's right i think yeah right some of

6574
01:46:04,149 --> 01:46:04,159
that's right i think yeah right some of
 

6575
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:05,270
that's right i think yeah right some of
us are not

6576
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:05,280
us are not
 

6577
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,830
us are not
excited about that other way but i still

6578
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:07,840
excited about that other way but i still
 

6579
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,590
excited about that other way but i still
think there's fundamentals problems to

6580
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:09,600
think there's fundamentals problems to

01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,109
it's the same criticism you could have

cvpr where application papers
 

6595
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:25,109
cvpr where application papers
are often as powerful and as important

6596
01:46:25,109 --> 01:46:25,119
are often as powerful and as important
 

6597
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:26,149
are often as powerful and as important

as like
 

6599
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,870
as like
uh theory paper even like theory just

6600
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:28,880
uh theory paper even like theory just
 

6601
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,270
uh theory paper even like theory just
seems

6602
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:29,280
seems
 

6603
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:31,510
seems
much more respectable and so on i mean

6604
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:31,520
much more respectable and so on i mean
 

6605
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,790
much more respectable and so on i mean
machine learning community is changing

6606

machine learning community is changing
 

6607
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,669
machine learning community is changing
that a little bit

6608
01:46:33,669 --> 01:46:33,679
that a little bit
 

6609
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:36,149
that a little bit
i mean at least in statements but it's

6610
01:46:36,149 --> 01:46:36,159
i mean at least in statements but it's
 

6611
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:37,189
i mean at least in statements but it's
it's still

6612
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:37,199
it's still
 

6613
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:40,229
it's still
not seen as the sexiest of uh pursuits

6614
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:40,239
not seen as the sexiest of uh pursuits
 

6615
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:41,590
not seen as the sexiest of uh pursuits
which is like how do i actually make

6616
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:41,600
which is like how do i actually make
 

6617
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,189
which is like how do i actually make

uh in terms of books that i find myself
 

6635
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:03,350
uh in terms of books that i find myself
thinking back on that i read a while ago

thinking back on that i read a while ago
 

6637
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,270
thinking back on that i read a while ago
like that have stood the test of time to

6638
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:05,280
like that have stood the test of time to
 

6639
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,350
like that have stood the test of time to
some degree i find myself thinking of

some degree i find myself thinking of
 

6641
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,189

roshkopf um which

6646
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:13,440
roshkopf um which
 

6647
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,669
roshkopf um which
was it basically put out the premise

6648
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:15,679
was it basically put out the premise
 

6649
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,510
was it basically put out the premise
that we all need to become

6650
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:17,520
that we all need to become
 

6651
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,109
that we all need to become
programmers in one form or another

6652
01:47:21,109 --> 01:47:21,119
programmers in one form or another
 

6653
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,830
programmers in one form or another
and it was an analogy to once upon a

6654
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:23,840
and it was an analogy to once upon a
 

6655
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,910
and it was an analogy to once upon a
time we all had to become

6656
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:25,920
time we all had to become
 

6657
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,590
time we all had to become
readers we had to become literate and

6658
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:27,600
readers we had to become literate and
 

6659
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,189
readers we had to become literate and
there was a time before that when not

6660
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:29,199
there was a time before that when not
 

6661
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:30,709
there was a time before that when not
everybody was literate but once literacy

6662
01:47:30,709 --> 01:47:30,719
everybody was literate but once literacy
 

6663
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:31,590
everybody was literate but once literacy
was possible

6664
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:31,600
was possible
 

6665
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,070
was possible
the people who were literate had more of

6666
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:34,080
the people who were literate had more of
 

6667
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:34,709
the people who were literate had more of
a say

6668
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:34,719
a say
 

6669
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,510
a say
in society than the people who weren't

6670
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:37,520
in society than the people who weren't
 

6671
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,790
in society than the people who weren't
and so we made a big effort to get

6672
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,800
and so we made a big effort to get
 

6673
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,310
and so we made a big effort to get
everybody up to speed and now it's

6674
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,320
everybody up to speed and now it's
 

6675
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,270
everybody up to speed and now it's
it's not 100 universal but it's quite

6676
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:43,280
it's not 100 universal but it's quite
 

6677
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:43,910
it's not 100 universal but it's quite
widespread

6678
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
widespread
 

6679
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,470
widespread
like the assumption is generally that

6680
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:46,480
like the assumption is generally that
 

6681
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,310
like the assumption is generally that
people can read

people can read

the analogy that he makes is that

6684
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:50,080
the analogy that he makes is that
 

6685
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,669
the analogy that he makes is that
programming is a similar kind of thing

6686
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:51,679
programming is a similar kind of thing
 

6687
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:52,310
programming is a similar kind of thing
that uh

6688
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:52,320
that uh
 

6689
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,750
that uh
that we need to have a say

6690
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:55,760
that we need to have a say
 

6691
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,629
that we need to have a say
in right so being a reader being

01:47:58,629 --> 01:47:58,639
in right so being a reader being
 

6693
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,550
in right so being a reader being
literate being a reader means you can

6694
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:00,560
literate being a reader means you can
 

6695
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,750
literate being a reader means you can
receive all this information

6696
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:01,760
receive all this information
 

6697
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,149
receive all this information
but you don't get to put it out there

6698
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:04,159
but you don't get to put it out there
 

6699
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:05,590
but you don't get to put it out there
and programming is the way that we get

6700
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:05,600
and programming is the way that we get
 

6701
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,629
and programming is the way that we get
to put it out there

6702
01:48:06,629 --> 01:48:06,639
to put it out there
 

6703
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:08,229
to put it out there
that was the argument he made i think he

6704
01:48:08,229 --> 01:48:08,239
that was the argument he made i think he
 

6705
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:10,149
that was the argument he made i think he
specifically has now

specifically has now
 

6707
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:12,149
specifically has now
backed away from this idea he doesn't

6708
01:48:12,149 --> 01:48:12,159
backed away from this idea he doesn't
 

6709
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:14,709
backed away from this idea he doesn't
think it's happening quite this way

think it's happening quite this way
 

6711
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:17,430
think it's happening quite this way
and that might be true that it didn't

6712
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:17,440

01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:41,920
have a problem we're like okay i'll just
 

6739
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,270
have a problem we're like okay i'll just
i'll hack up a perl script or something

01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,709
i'll hack up a perl script or something
and make it so

6742
01:48:44,709 --> 01:48:44,719
and make it so
 

6743
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,149
and make it so
if we lived in a world where everybody

6744
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:46,159
if we lived in a world where everybody
 

6745
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:48,070
if we lived in a world where everybody
could do that that would be a

6746
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:48,080
could do that that would be a
 

6747
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,870
could do that that would be a
better world and computers would be have

6748
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:50,880
better world and computers would be have
 

6749
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:51,350
better world and computers would be have
i think

6750
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:51,360
i think
 

6751
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,870
i think
less sway over us and other people's

6752
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:54,880
less sway over us and other people's
 

6753
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,790
less sway over us and other people's
software would have less sway over us

6754
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:56,800
software would have less sway over us
 

6755
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,390
software would have less sway over us
as a group yeah in some sense software

6756
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:58,400
as a group yeah in some sense software
 

6757
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,470
as a group yeah in some sense software
engineering programming's power

6758
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:00,480
engineering programming's power
 

6759
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,709
engineering programming's power
it's programming is power right it's

6760
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:02,719
it's programming is power right it's
 

6761
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:04,470
it's programming is power right it's
it's yeah it's like magic it's like

6762
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:04,480
it's yeah it's like magic it's like
 

6763
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,070
it's yeah it's like magic it's like
magic spells and

6764
01:49:06,070 --> 01:49:06,080
magic spells and
 

6765
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:09,109
magic spells and
and it's not out of reach of everyone

6766
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:09,119
and it's not out of reach of everyone
 

6767
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,950
and it's not out of reach of everyone
but at the moment it's just a sliver of

6768
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:10,960
but at the moment it's just a sliver of
 

6769
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,470
but at the moment it's just a sliver of
the population who can

6770
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:12,480
the population who can
 

6771
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,149
the population who can
who can commune with machines in this

6772
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:14,159
who can commune with machines in this
 

6773
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:16,470
who can commune with machines in this
way so i don't know so that book had a

6774
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:16,480
way so i don't know so that book had a
 

6775
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:16,870
way so i don't know so that book had a
big

6776
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:16,880
big
 

6777
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:19,270
big
big impact on me currently i'm i'm

6778

big impact on me currently i'm i'm
 

6779

reading uh the alignment problem

6780
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:20,880
reading uh the alignment problem
 

6781
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,390
reading uh the alignment problem
actually by brian christian so i don't

6782
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:22,400
actually by brian christian so i don't
 

6783
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,510
actually by brian christian so i don't
know if you've seen this out there yet

6784
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:23,520
know if you've seen this out there yet
 

6785
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,270
know if you've seen this out there yet
is this similar to stuart russell's work

6786
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:25,280
is this similar to stuart russell's work
 

6787
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:26,950
is this similar to stuart russell's work
with the control problem

6788
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:26,960
with the control problem
 

6789
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,310
with the control problem
it's in in that same general

6790
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:28,320
it's in in that same general
 

6791
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,990
it's in in that same general
neighborhood i mean they take they have

6792
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
neighborhood i mean they take they have
 

6793
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,629
neighborhood i mean they take they have
different

emphases that they're they're
 

6797
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:32,950
emphases that they're they're
concentrating on i think i think

6798
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:32,960
concentrating on i think i think
 

6799
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,310
concentrating on i think i think
stewart's book

6800
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:34,320
stewart's book
 

6801
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,589
stewart's book
did a remarkably good job like a just a

6802
01:49:37,589 --> 01:49:37,599
did a remarkably good job like a just a
 

6803
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:40,629
did a remarkably good job like a just a
celebratory good job at describing

6804
01:49:40,629 --> 01:49:40,639
celebratory good job at describing
 

6805
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:43,270
celebratory good job at describing
ai technology and sort of how it works i

6806
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:43,280
ai technology and sort of how it works i
 

6807
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:44,550
ai technology and sort of how it works i
thought that was great it was really

6808
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
thought that was great it was really
 

6809
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,149
thought that was great it was really
cool to see that in a book

6810
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:46,159
cool to see that in a book
 

6811
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,070
cool to see that in a book
yeah i think he has some experience

6812
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,080
yeah i think he has some experience
 

6813
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,510
yeah i think he has some experience
writing some books

6814
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:49,520
writing some books
 

6815
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,510
writing some books
you know that's probably a possible

6816
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:51,520
you know that's probably a possible
 

6817
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,510
you know that's probably a possible
thing he's maybe thought a thing or two

6818
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:53,520
thing he's maybe thought a thing or two
 

6819
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:54,870
thing he's maybe thought a thing or two
about how to explain

6820
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:54,880
about how to explain
 

6821
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,709
about how to explain
ai to people yeah yeah that's a really

6822
01:49:56,709 --> 01:49:56,719
ai to people yeah yeah that's a really
 

6823
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:59,109
ai to people yeah yeah that's a really
good point um this book so far

6824
01:49:59,109 --> 01:49:59,119
good point um this book so far
 

6825
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:01,510
good point um this book so far
has been remarkably good at telling the

6826
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:01,520
has been remarkably good at telling the
 

6827
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,149
has been remarkably good at telling the
story

6828
01:50:02,149 --> 01:50:02,159
story
 

6829
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:05,189

history
of some of the things that have happened

of some of the things that have happened
 

6835
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:09,750
of some of the things that have happened
uh this i'm in the first third he said

6836
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:09,760
uh this i'm in the first third he said
 

6837
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,189
uh this i'm in the first third he said
this book is in three thirds the first

6838
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:11,199
this book is in three thirds the first
 

6839
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,070
this book is in three thirds the first
third is

6840
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:12,080
third is
 

6841
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:15,189
third is
essentially ai fairness and you know

6842
01:50:15,189 --> 01:50:15,199
essentially ai fairness and you know
 

6843
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:17,030
essentially ai fairness and you know
implications of ai on society that we're

6844
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:17,040
implications of ai on society that we're
 

6845
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,310
implications of ai on society that we're
seeing right now

6846
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:18,320
seeing right now
 

6847
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,910
seeing right now
and that's been great i mean he's

6848
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:19,920
and that's been great i mean he's
 

6849
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,669
and that's been great i mean he's
telling the stories really well he's he

6850
01:50:21,669 --> 01:50:21,679
telling the stories really well he's he
 

6851
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:23,270
telling the stories really well he's he
went out and talked to the frontline

6852
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:23,280
went out and talked to the frontline
 

6853
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,550
went out and talked to the frontline
people who

6854
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:24,560
people who
 

6855
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,910
people who
whose names are associated with some of

6856
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:25,920
whose names are associated with some of
 

6857
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,070
whose names are associated with some of
these ideas and and it's been terrific

6858
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,080
these ideas and and it's been terrific
 

6859
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,510
these ideas and and it's been terrific
he says the second half of the book is

6860
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:29,520
he says the second half of the book is
 

6861
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,510
he says the second half of the book is
on reinforcement learning so

6862
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:31,520
on reinforcement learning so
 

6863
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,229
on reinforcement learning so
maybe that'll be fun um and then the

6864
01:50:34,229 --> 01:50:34,239
maybe that'll be fun um and then the
 

6865
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:35,430
maybe that'll be fun um and then the
third half

6866
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:35,440
third half
 

6867
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:38,470
third half
third third is on uh this is super

6868
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:38,480
third third is on uh this is super
 

6869
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,910
third third is on uh this is super
intelligence alignment problem

6870
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:39,920
intelligence alignment problem
 

6871
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,870
intelligence alignment problem
and i i suspect that that part will be

6872
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:42,880
and i i suspect that that part will be
 

6873
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,229
and i i suspect that that part will be
less fun for me to read

6874
01:50:44,229 --> 01:50:44,239
less fun for me to read
 

6875
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:47,350
less fun for me to read
yeah it's yeah it's

6876
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:47,360
yeah it's yeah it's
 

6877
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,629
yeah it's yeah it's
it's an interesting problem to talk

6878
01:50:48,629 --> 01:50:48,639
it's an interesting problem to talk
 

6879
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:50,229
it's an interesting problem to talk
about i find it to be the most

6880
01:50:50,229 --> 01:50:50,239
about i find it to be the most
 

6881
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:51,350
about i find it to be the most
interesting just like

6882
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:51,360
interesting just like
 

6883
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,629
interesting just like
thinking about whether we live in a

6884
01:50:52,629 --> 01:50:52,639
thinking about whether we live in a
 

6885
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:54,790
thinking about whether we live in a
simulation or not as a

6886
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:54,800
simulation or not as a
 

6887
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,030
simulation or not as a
as a thought experiment to think about

6888
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:57,040
as a thought experiment to think about
 

6889
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,229
as a thought experiment to think about
our own existence

6890
01:50:58,229 --> 01:50:58,239
our own existence
 

6891
01:50:58,239 --> 01:51:00,229
our own existence
so in the same way talking about

6892
01:51:00,229 --> 01:51:00,239
so in the same way talking about
 

6893
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:02,149
so in the same way talking about
alignment problem with agi

6894
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:02,159
alignment problem with agi
 

6895
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,229
alignment problem with agi
is a good way to think similarly like

6896
01:51:04,229 --> 01:51:04,239
is a good way to think similarly like
 

6897
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:05,750
is a good way to think similarly like
the trolley problem with autonomous

6898
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:05,760
the trolley problem with autonomous
 

6899
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:06,550
the trolley problem with autonomous
vehicles

6900

it's a useless thing for engineering but

6902
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:08,560
it's a useless thing for engineering but
 

6903
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,229
it's a useless thing for engineering but
it's a it's a nice little thought

um and all his stories just from a
 

6937
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:43,270
um and all his stories just from a
he's he was a computer scientist

6938
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:43,280
he's he was a computer scientist
 

6939
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,750
he's he was a computer scientist
actually he studied at brown

6940
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:45,760
actually he studied at brown
 

6941
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,070
actually he studied at brown
they all have this sort of really

6942
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
they all have this sort of really
 

6943
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,430
they all have this sort of really
insightful bit of

01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,910
science or computer science that drives
them and so it's just

6948
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:53,920
them and so it's just
 

6949
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,149
them and so it's just
a romp right to just like he creates

6950
01:51:56,149 --> 01:51:56,159
a romp right to just like he creates
 

6951
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,070
a romp right to just like he creates
these artificial worlds with these

6952

these artificial worlds with these
 

6953
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,149

by extrapolating on these ideas that

6954
01:52:00,149 --> 01:52:00,159
by extrapolating on these ideas that
 

6955
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:01,350
by extrapolating on these ideas that
that we know about

6956
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:01,360
that we know about
 

6957
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,790
that we know about
but hadn't really thought through to

6958
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:02,800
but hadn't really thought through to
 

6959
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,790
but hadn't really thought through to
this kind of conclusion and so his stuff

6960
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:04,800
this kind of conclusion and so his stuff
 

6961
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:05,189
this kind of conclusion and so his stuff
is

6962
01:52:05,189 --> 01:52:05,199
is
 

6963
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:07,189
is
it's really fun to read it's mind

6964
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
it's really fun to read it's mind

uh read way too much my roots are

6976
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:19,360
uh read way too much my roots are
 

6977
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,149

but a couple generations back well it's

6980
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
but a couple generations back well it's
 

6981
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,709

probably in there somewhere so maybe we

6982
01:52:24,709 --> 01:52:24,719
probably in there somewhere so maybe we
 

6983
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,310
probably in there somewhere so maybe we
can uh

6984
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:26,320
can uh
 

6985
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,629
can uh
we can pull up that thread a little bit

6986
01:52:28,629 --> 01:52:28,639
we can pull up that thread a little bit
 

6987
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:30,629
we can pull up that thread a little bit
of the existential dread

6988
01:52:30,629 --> 01:52:30,639
of the existential dread
 

6989
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:32,629
of the existential dread
that we all feel you mentioned that you

6990
01:52:32,629 --> 01:52:32,639
that we all feel you mentioned that you
 

6991
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:33,990
that we all feel you mentioned that you
i think somewhere in the conversation

i mean i think reinforcement learning
 

7029
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:10,229
i mean i think reinforcement learning
researchers maybe think about this from

researchers maybe think about this from
 

7031
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:11,990
researchers maybe think about this from
a science perspective more often

7032
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:12,000
a science perspective more often
 

7033
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,750

having little lifetimes little weird
little lifetimes and it's

little lifetimes and it's
 

7047
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,430
little lifetimes and it's
it's hard not to project yourself into
